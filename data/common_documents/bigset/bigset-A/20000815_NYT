WORST WATER-MAIN BREAK IN MEMORY CRIPPLES KC'S SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A water-main break believed to be the worst
in Kansas City's history cut service to 150,000 people, closed
businesses and forced residents to boil drinking water Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Though workers restored service in a few hours, a boil-water
order remained in effect Monday night from the state line to
Eastern Avenue and from the Missouri River south to 63rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cautioned against drinking unboiled tap water until
the lines had been fully flushed of pathogens. The boil order was
expected to be lifted later Tuesday. The Kansas City Water Services
Department believed it was the first such order in more than 100
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had major water-main breaks in the past, but none as
severe as this,'' Gurnie Gunter, Water Services director, said.
Officials were still trying to determine Monday night what caused
the break in the West Bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reported fires or injuries in the water outage.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 a.m. a 48-inch pipe near 25th and Allen
streets ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of Metals USA about two blocks away ran into the
warehouse, shouting, ``You guys better get out of here. The water's
coming up pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Water was gushing into the street, and a greenish-brown swamp
rapidly filled the low-lying area.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of past floods, Charles Donnelly, Metals USA president,
ordered employees to pile sandbags at doorways and activate sump
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got a little scary,'' said Donnelly, adding that his
business was not damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the break, water pressure trickled to a halt
all over the city's center, and the effect was immediate. It forced
officials to shut down the Turkey Creek pumping station, one of the
city's primary stations.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial air-conditioning units dependent on water tanks
fizzled out. High-rise office buildings downtown, including City
Hall, were evacuated because fire sprinklers became inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   A few guests at the Kansas City Marriott Country Club Plaza were
caught midshower without water and had to rinse with bottled water,
said Craig Johnson, hotel general manager .
</P>
<P>
   The problem did not last as long as water department officials
had feared. Crews isolated the break about 11:50 a.m. and gradually
restored water pressure by 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, city officials had recommended that buildings
of more than four stories close, because there would be no water to
put out fires in high-rises. In addition to City Hall, the Jackson
County Courthouse closed, as did the U.S. District Courthouse, the
Bolling Federal Building and the Missouri State Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. offices near Crown Center closed by noon,
and the 5,700 employees were sent home. Most seemed happy at their
unexpected day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of smiles for a Monday,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department moved its dispatchers to a backup location
at 1328 Agnes Ave. that had water service. The Fire Department also
moved some of its dispatchers to the same building. Both agencies
let some employees go home early.
</P>
<P>
   Across the affected area, tens of thousands of people suddenly
had to cope with the loss of a basic resource usually taken for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   At Penn Valley Community College, students stood in line for
registration while rest-room doors nearby were posted with white
signs and black letters: ``Out of order. No running water.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Missouri-Kansas City canceled summer classes.
</P>
<P>
   Across Oak Street at the Twin Oaks Apartments, a
university-owned complex, UMKC brought in portable toilets and
bottled water for residents.
</P>
<P>
   UMKC student Erin Skornia came to her boyfriend's aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to get him to take him to my place so he can take a
shower,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems touched neighborhoods too.
</P>
<P>
   Iona Kopp of the 4100 block of Genessee Street said she did not
know the water was off until she went to the sink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to do my dishes, and there was no water,'' she said.
``You never miss the water until the world runs dry.''
</P>
<P>
   The water-main break was good news for restaurants on the Kansas
side, which did a brisk lunch business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was crazy,'' said Scott Gipson, general manager of
Applebee's Neighborhood Grill &AMP; Bar on Rainbow Boulevard. ``The
people kept on coming.'' Gipson said the restaurant served an extra
150 customers from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   With water at no more than a trickle, several hospitals tapped
emergency supplies of bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Mercy shut off water elsewhere to maintain pressure
to an operating room where a lengthy operation was under way.
Truman Medical Center and St. Luke's Hospital diverted ambulances
from their emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's maintained rest-room sanitation by lining toilets
with red plastic medical-waste bags that could be easily disposed
of.
</P>
<P>
   To get through surgeries and dialysis treatments scheduled in
the morning, Veterans Hospital used three tanks of water on the
hospital's roof. By afternoon, however, the tanks were empty and
the hospital brought in bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Staffs at the affected hospitals kept their hands germ-free by
using waterless disinfecting hand cleansers or soap and bottled
water.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping patients cool became a serious issue. Trinity Lutheran
Hospital turned lights off to reduce the strain on its
air-conditioning system. Children's Mercy called in a water truck
to pump water into its cooling towers. And Truman brought fans out
of storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, a lot of this stuff we ordered for Y2K''
preparations, said Truman spokeswoman Jennifer Sykes.
</P>
<P>
   Water department employees worked in water above their knees to
shut off the valves leading to the leak. By then, several million
gallons had been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Officials first had to turn off the six to eight large pumps at
the Turkey Creek station. Meanwhile, engineers pulled out an atlas
of the city's network of water mains and shutoff valves and located
the ones closest to the break.
</P>
<P>
   Workers had to clamp two valves to the south and one to the
north to isolate the break, but the northern valve was hidden
underneath water.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the pumps off, workers had to wait nearly an hour
before the water drained sufficiently to expose the northern valve.
Crews finally found the valve's cast-iron lid, pulled it off and
used an 8-foot pole to reach in and turn it off.
</P>
<P>
   With that done, workers slowly restarted pumps, to restore
pressure gradually.
</P>
<P>
   City officials did not know what caused the break.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Goold, Water Department assistant director for distribution
and collection, said he had never heard of a 48-inch main breaking.
Although the main was about 40 years old, Goold said the age should
not have been a major factor, because concrete pipes usually last
100 years or more.

VALLEY, HARBOR SECESSION MIGHT BE JUST THE BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the filing Monday of petitions to join a
secession study, Hollywood residents joined a powerful grass-roots
movement that threatens to crack apart what Los Angeles' boosters
call the ``Capital City of the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods equal to half the city's population -- from its
northern suburbs in the San Fernando Valley to its symbolic heart,
Hollywood, to its southernmost border at the Los Angeles Harbor --
are trying to break away from Los Angeles and form their own
cities.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall has failed to serve Los Angeles' 3.5 million residents
over a long period of time, they say, and the neighborhoods of the
sprawling areas could do better if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lead role are activists in the Valley, the suburban
home of 1.3 million people made famous by countless pop culture
references -- from songs like Frank Zappa's ``Valley Girl'' to
films like ``Chinatown'' and ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is ``too big to deliver local services effectively
or efficiently,'' said Richard Close, chairman of Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment, the Valley secession group. ``We're
trying to create local control over local decisions, to make the
city even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley activists also launched efforts to break up the mammoth
Los Angeles Unified School District and the county Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   And activists in other parts of the city say if the Valley isn't
getting its fair share, who is? They point to the necessity of
getting 25 percent of all registered voters in breakaway areas to
sign secession study petitions as proof of how widespread the
discontent is.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. does not work,'' said Gene La Pietra, founder of the
Hollywood secession movement. ``Everywhere you go in the city,
people always feel the other part of the city's getting the
services, but the fact is nobody's getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, after crime in the Hollywood Division of
the Los Angeles Police Department went down, the city's response
was to transfer officers to other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, disagree. They think the city has been
working well and is improving.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, as secessionist voices have gotten
louder, the city has made some attempts to keep the city together
by appeasing them. Most notable was a series of voter-approved
changes to the City Charter -- supported by Mayor Richard Riordan
but opposed by most City Council members -- which took effect last
month and forms one of the pillars of the antisecession argument.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's press secretary, Peter Hidalgo, said the mayor
believes the new charter, which created a system of advisory
neighborhood councils and a Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
will make the city more responsive to its residents.
</P>
<P>
   It also concentrated somewhat more power in the mayor's office,
and Hidalgo argued the mayor should be given a chance to use his
new power to make the city more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters overwhelmingly supported a new charter reform
program, which clearly allows more local involvement with city
government and even gives local authority for neighborhood-related
issues,'' Hidalgo said. ``Which brings Angelenos and city
government much closer than they have been in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, City Council and city employees' union vehemently
oppose the secession movements, but several public opinion polls
have found a majority of city voters in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is being studied by a county agency to determine how
the city could be broken up and could go on the ballot in November
2002, with voter majorities needed both in the seceding community
and the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The secession movement is an outgrowth of many factors, experts
say, including the massive sprawl of Los Angeles that leads to a
feeling of disconnection and political apathy among its residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley and Harbor areas in particular are the most
geographically isolated sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley, which was nothing but farmland when it was annexed
in 1915, is separated from the rest of L.A. by the Santa Monica
Mountains, leaving only two freeways and a few surface roads as
congested links to downtown. The Harbor area is connected only by a
thin sliver of land in a shape designed to give Los Angeles
political control over the economically valuable harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the separation between the Valley and the Harbor is
also a reflection of a larger society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think government itself -- not just the city of Los Angeles,
but in general -- has become faceless, too large, too unwieldy,''
said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University's
Davenport Institute for Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thinks a new Valley city of 1.3 million -- which
would be the nation's sixth largest as well as its richest, safest
and most diverse city -- would still be too large to serve its
residents. He would rather see cities a tenth that size.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, he added, when Los Angeles was still developing, the
idea of a large city was attractive because it gave economies of
scale. But now technology has made communication and transportation
so easy, there is much less need for large, concentrated downtowns
and big cities, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was one of the pioneers of annexation and bigger is
better,'' Kotkin said. ``And in many ways, it (open italics) was
(italics end) better. I remember when I moved to L.A. in the mid
'70s, I was always struck by how much better the city of L.A.
functioned than the independent cities or unincorporated areas like
West Hollywood or Culver City. Those places looked pretty rundown.
Now I think it's the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts think if the three secession drives are
successful, it could spark a chain reaction, both within the
remaining portions of Los Angeles and throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Coasters are watching Los Angeles to see if it's
successful or not,'' said Philip J. Ethington, a University of
Southern California history professor who studies urban annexation
and growth issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an example case. California typically has
been setting the national trend on a lot of these major issues.''

JOHNSON GETS SOME SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MIAMI _ A day after Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone said manager Davey Johnson would finish the season, many
players said Monday they were relieved the season will conclude
without major upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, at the front of that group is All-Star left
fielder Gary Sheffield, who enjoys playing for Johnson and is a
staunch supporter of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked for advice how to handle this situation,''
Sheffield said. ``I've got to be with a team and an organization
that I can be comfortable with. If you look at my situation, I have
a lot of decisions I have to make. And Davey not being here, that's
one question that would come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about it with my wife. I don't know what it would be
like without Davey. I don't want to think about it. That's where it
gets kind of touchy with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has known Johnson since the mid-1980s, when his uncle,
Dwight Gooden, pitched for Johnson with the Mets. Sheffield was
constantly around those ballclubs and has always said Johnson
treated him fairly, and has been more than just a manager to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who led the majors with 37 homers heading into
Monday's game at Florida, said recently that players had to take on
much of responsibility for the team's play, stating Johnson
shouldn't bear the brunt of the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know how much a manager means to certain
people,'' Sheffield said. ``That's one of the biggest things. I
feel very lucky to be playing for this manager. I feel like I can
say things to him and he can say things to me. We have a good
working relationship and Davey is all about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged that questions of his pending status
infiltrated the clubhouse and was causing a distraction, and he
said the proclamation that no changes would be made before the end
of the season did ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sensing some negative stuff in here,'' Johnson said.
``That's what was my concern a little bit the other day. That's not
healthy for (the players), as individuals, and as a group. . . .
That's left.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue of Johnson's status isn't dead. Rather, it's
been put aside.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson, who is under contract for $1.5 million next
season, will remain for the rest of the season, his long-term
future remains in question. If the Dodgers don't reach the
playoffs, Johnson likely won't return for a third year, despite
being under contract.
</P>
<P>
   But a big reason Malone made his statements was the Dodgers'
standing. They entered Monday 4 games behind San Francisco in the
National League West, and the organization wanted all the focus to
be on baseball instead of a ``death'' watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is not going to be any easier,'' Johnson said. ``An
eight-game winning streak may make it a little easier. I'm happy
everybody is (past) this and maybe we can focus on what's happening
on a daily basis.'
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: The start of the game was delayed by 57
minutes because of thunderstorms. . . . Adrian Beltre's
second-inning error was his 19th of the season, second most of any
third baseman in the National League. . . . Sheffield, Eric Karros
and Shawn Green each had an RBI in the Sunday's game, marking the
first time in more than a month the No. 3, 4 and 5 hitters have
driven in a run in the same game. The last time it happened was
June 21, when they each had two RBI in a 7-6 win against Houston.

UCLA HURTING AT LINEBACKER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another day, another linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Strong-side linebacker Tony White, a two-year starter and one of
only three projected senior starters on defense, left practice
Monday morning with a strained back and is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   A position that seemed the Bruins' deepest last spring is now
its thinnest. If the Bruins' season opener against No. 3-ranked
Alabama were today instead of Sept. 2, true freshman Brandon
Chillar would be starting at the strong-side spot.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Pieper, a versatile backup the last two seasons, retired
two months ago on the advice of doctors who said he was susceptible
to a serious spinal injury.
</P>
<P>
   Then Santi Hall and Asi Faoa were suspended Friday for the
season opener for disciplinary reasons. The following day, Hall
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's four guys we thought we'd have and not one of them are
on the field right now,'' said defensive coordinator Bob Field.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report II: It looks as if guard Oscar Cabrera, who
sprained his right ankle Saturday, might not be ready for Alabama.
Senior Micah Webb has been shifted from backup right tackle and
will compete with redshirt freshman Shane Lehman to replace
Cabrera, who was on crutches Tuesday.

THE CLINTONS RUN A BIT LATE, AND NETWORKS KEEP THE CAMERAS
ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS to replace hed, update and rewrite throughout)  
 By PETER MARKS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic convention program was running
behind by 20 minutes on Monday night, which happened to be just
long enough to ensure that Hillary Rodham Clinton's speech to the
delegates was broadcast live in prime time on all three of the
major broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC News was not even scheduled to carry Mrs. Clinton's speech,
having planned to go on the air at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time to pick
up the first words of President Clinton's address a few minutes
later. But because the first lady did not begin speaking until
10:24 p.m., NBC joined CBS and ABC in running most of the 18-minute
talk.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic coup did not go unnoticed by the NBC anchor, Tom
Brokaw, who seemed to be letting viewers in on the Democrats' move
when he declared that with the Democrats' ``schedule slipping so
much, she was able to get on prime time.'' (Before breaking in at
10:30, NBC carried the convention on its cable channel, MSNBC.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Republicans, the Democrats have a minute-by-minute
master schedule, so that they know at any moment whether they are
not keeping to the plan. The 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. slot is the only
time in which all three broadcast networks _ which by far capture
the bulk of convention watchers _ are on the air at the gatherings.
And getting on all three is the most coveted media hat trick.
</P>
<P>
   Asked just before Mrs. Clinton's speech whether the Democrats
were indeed running behind, Peter Ragone, a convention spokesman,
said, ``We might be, just a little.'' Asked later for comment about
the delays, Mr. Ragone said that those in charge of the program
told him, ``It was not intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the convention is intended as a crowning television
moment for Vice President Al Gore, it was the president who weighed
most heavily on the minds of editors and producers today. And after
Mrs. Clinton finished her remarks, Mr. Clinton made his grand
entrance in a manner reserved in American television culture for
the best and the brightest, namely, late-night talk show hosts,
movie stars and football heroes.
</P>
<P>
   As C-Span and other networks recorded the moment, a camera
followed the president as he made his way through the backstage
maze at the Staples Center, the lens trained on him as he strolled
confidently. Emerging into the hall, the camera at his back, it was
unclear whether he looked more like a guest host on ``Saturday
Night Live'' or the star of a sequel to ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mr. Clinton starting to speak at only shortly before 11, it
was clear that the networks were being boxed into devoting a lot
more time to the gathering than they had planned. He finished
speaking at just after 11:30 p.m., and ABC, CBS and NBC carried it
until the end. Last week the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, Jim Nicholson, had admonished the networks that it would
be unfair to give Mr. Clinton more air time than had been allotted
to Gen. Colin L. Powell, the featured speaker on the first night of
the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   All three networks said Mr. Clinton's speech would be more
newsworthy than General Powell's and probably worth staying with.
(None ran all of the general's speech.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In all respect to Colin Powell, I don't think they're equal in
that one is the president and has been president for eight years,''
said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC
News.
</P>
<P>
   Like its network morning-show rivals, CBS's ``Early Show'' with
Bryant Gumbel was set to kick off its week in Los Angeles today
with an extensive sitdown interview with Mr. Clinton and a separate
talk with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Lyne Pitts, the program's executive producer, got
the distressing news that the president and first lady were backing
out. They also pulled out of an agreement with NBC's ``Today,'' and
Mr. Clinton decided not to do ABC's ``Good Morning America''
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all set,'' Ms. Pitts said. ``Bryant was supposed to
interview him Saturday afternoon; it had been booked for quite some
time. I got the calls at a little bit after 9 in the morning saying
that, sorry, the president's schedule would not accommodate the
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unknown for sought-after newsmakers to bump a news
show or two from their itineraries. But such a wholesale
withdrawal, at a time when the news media were fixated on the
Clintons, raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Thursday night how upset the Gore folks were with
Clinton's confessional on Thursday and that would be the talk of
our interview,'' Ms. Pitts said, adding that it was ``more than an
assumption'' that the Clintons had dropped out to try to turn down
the heat on them. Mrs. Clinton, however, did interviews tonight
with anchors on all of the major broadcast and cable networks.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla surrounding Mr. Clinton's appearance seemed to
reflect a sense in the press corps here that Los Angeles might
generate more interesting and entertaining tidbits than did
Philadelphia.  &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton savored what he called ``this
moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic and
self-congratulatory valedictory Monday night, implored Americans to
protect his achievements by electing Vice President Al Gore to
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the very best decisions of my entire life,'' he said,
was ``asking Al Gore to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton made no direct mention of Gov. George W. Bush on
the opening night of the 43rd Democratic National Convention, he
scoffed at the suggestion by the Republican nominee at his
convention two weeks ago that the nation had stumbled into
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of the last eight years was an
accident that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance,'' Clinton said in a swansong
that lasted about 40 minutes. ``It was a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no allusions to the personal scandals he has
weathered; at an event last week the president said his
transgressions should not tar Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton focused Monday on the high points of his entire
two terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to transfer his popularity among the
Democratic faithful to Gore, who has had a difficult time rousing
his party. Clinton, who has said the election of Gore as his
successor is crucial to protecting his own legacy, offered this
testament: ``In the most difficult days of the last years, when we
faced the toughest issues _ of war and peace, of taking on powerful
special interests _ he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to link Gore to the economic good times, Clinton said of
his ambitious plan to cut the deficit in 1993: ``It passed by a
single vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast
the deciding vote. Not a single Republican supported it. Their
leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and
give us a one-way ticket to recession.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for effect: ``Time has not been kind to their
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's entrance to the hall built to a crescendo. As the
crowd roared in anticipation, a camera followed him as he strode
briskly down a corridor toward the stage for his moment of triumph.
When he said his first ``thank you'' to settle the adoring crowd, a
chant broke out, ``Thank you, Bill!''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was trying to hand off his party to Gore, the
political production Monday night at the Staples Center here lacked
the end-of-an-era emotions of Ronald Reagan's farewell to his
convention in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That was in part because, Clinton's wife, Hillary, was front and
center in her new role as Senate candidate. In her speech, Mrs.
Clinton not only commended her husband and blessed the nomination
of Gore but sought to bolster her own bid for the Senate from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   After calling on the public to ``continue America's progress''
by electing Gore and his running-mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Mrs.
Clinton turned to her own race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' she said. ``I will always be profoundly grateful
to all of you and to the American people for the last eight years.
Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unmistakable contrast to the Republican convention two
weeks ago, which was choreographed to a second-by-second precision,
the Democratic gathering _ typical for the party _ had the untamed
feel of street theater. Clinton did not reach the rostrum until
close to 11 p.m. EST, nearly 25 minutes past schedule, and missed
most of the prime-time television audience. In typical Clinton
fashion, the president, one of his aides said, did not finish
tinkering with the address until about 9:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   During a year in which Clinton has surrendered the political
stage to his vice president and to his wife _ only grudgingly, his
friends and advisers say _ the event Monday night was a prime-time
reminder of how the president dominates his party as a colossal
political and oratorical force.
</P>
<P>
   And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Gore faces a
daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as
Clinton _ who is widely regarded as the party's most adroit
campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at the party's
convention in Los Angeles in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring for Clinton underscored a daunting problem for
Gore: the more powerful that Clinton was in his speech, the less
likely that the vice president could pull off a climactic
acceptance speech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sadness to this evening,'' said Cheri
Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in
Clinton-Gore buttons. ``They have been a good team, Clinton and
Gore. Gore will work well with Lieberman. But I'm really going to
miss Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grizzard, a delegate from Florida who wore a Clinton '92
T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, ``I would vote for
Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says
I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the
crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the
music, a smile plastered to her face, waved a sign that proclaimed,
``Iowa Loves Clinton.'' The same sign could be seen in the Kansas
section, and in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico _ and elsewhere.
The New York contingent hoisted dozens of ``Hillary'' posters,
waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado
section.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Graves, 24, a delegate from Fayettville, Ark., was
particularly moved by Monday night's program because the president
is from her home state. ``This is all very sad,'' she said. ``He
has been ours, and he is leaving office. We are hopeful for Al
Gore, but he just isn't ours.''
</P>
<P>
   When short excerpts of past convention speeches by Democratic
presidents was shown on overhead screens, delegates responded with
warm applause for John F. Kennedy, and polite applause for Jimmy
Carter. But the moment Clinton's face filled the screen, the hall
exploded in cheers. It was impossible not to notice that the sound
fell slightly but unmistakably when a clip of Gore followed.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for the bittersweet comments of some of the
4,339 delegates is that, given polls showing Gore trailing Bush,
they lack the confidence that Republicans enjoyed at their
convention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton faced one of the most precarious political
challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Gore that
will spur Democrats _ and the American public _ to rally around the
vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Gore some
room to declare his independence.
</P>
<P>
   He devoted far more attention to Gore than to Mrs. Clinton, whom
he praised for her work with children and for being ``a great first
lady,'' who will ``always be there for the families of New York and
America.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his address, Clinton reprieved what he considered
the triumphs of his administration, from cutting taxes to cracking
down on crime to cleaning the environment to making the world more
secure. He did not mention any of the failures of his tenure,
notably his wife's campaign to overhaul the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the slogan of his acceptance speech four years ago, he
declared, ``My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with
confidence: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed it
together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   The president drew one of the biggest ovations when he recalled
Ronald Reagan's famous refrain from 1980. ``My fellow Americans,
are we better off today than we were eight years ago?'' he asked.
``You bet we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation,
Clinton said, ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity
going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health
care and in family tax cuts that we can afford. In stark contrast,
the GOP wants to spend every dime of our projected surplus and then
some.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's presence Monday night could not help remind
viewers of the scandals of the Clinton administration that the Bush
campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, Clinton's
departure from Los Angeles on Tuesday could not be too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news
conference Monday, ``We've got to get Bill Clinton _ and I'm going
to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly _ out of town as
quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our
convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Clinton and his
stalwart supporters. Advisers to Clinton said he was choking up as
he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the address, Clinton, who turns 54 on
Saturday, harkened back to his roots in Arkansas. ``Fifty-four
years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm to a young widow
in a small Southern town. America gave me the chance to live my
dreams. I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours.
Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the same
optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago, my
heart is filled with gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the objective of pumping up Gore for four nights, the
Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade
of moderation at their convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by
upbraiding the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia,''
said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the
party's most prolific fund-raiser. ``They pretended they were
tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they
cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face
it, they pretended they were Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates to his
state, saying, ``Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen
the previews of the Republicans' movie: `George and Dick's
Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's gonna make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: ``The
Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show _ for
real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay
and lesbian Americans immeasurably better.''
</P>
<P>
   On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so
marked the Republican convention. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California rebuffed an offer to address the delegates, saying she
did not want it to appear as if she had been motivated by
``personal gain'' when, under pressure from the Gore campaign, she
agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.

NET WORTH: EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP DOESN'T SOLVE LABOR WOES AT
UNITED  AIRLINES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How bad are relations between United Airlines
and its pilots?
</P>
<P>
   On one United flight last week, a pilot got on the intercom to
explain why the plane was more than two hours late taking off.
</P>
<P>
   First, he denied media reports that pilots were calling in sick,
using his presence as living proof. Instead, he blamed the delay on
the fact that someone from United had scheduled only nine minutes
for an airport turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Then he ``joked'' that he hoped the same person wasn't
scheduling maintenance workers. To the astonishment of some
passengers, he continued making negative remarks about United and
its problems.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the kind of comments you'd expect to hear from the
cockpit of an employee-owned airline and spotlights the question:
Why hasn't United's employee stock ownership plan _ once praised to
the skies _ prevented its noisy labor dispute. Many of the
company's pilots and mechanics have refused to work overtime since
their contracts expired earlier this year, leading to delays and
flight cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I called Corey Rosen, director of the National
Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, Rosen says, are complex, but boil down to two
things: drawbacks in the plan's design, including a provision that
prevents employees from cashing in their stock until they leave the
company; and the lack of a long-term commitment to change United's
``militaristic'' corporate culture into one that truly puts
employees first, a la Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Established in July 1994, the ESOP gave employees, excluding
flight attendants, 55 percent of the company's stock in exchange
for pay and benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots were big proponents of the ESOP and ended up with 25
percent of United's stock, although they make up only 10 percent of
the workforce. They also made the biggest financial sacrifices,
says Ken Bradley, a United pilot and spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, the ESOP was hailed as a success, and it was
a success,'' Rosen says. ``In the first year, they set up BOB (best
of business) teams to look at basically everything the company did,
from fuel utilization to pass policies (which govern free tickets
for employees' families).''
</P>
<P>
   The teams came up with cost savings and morale-boosting measures
that boosted the bottom line. United's stock soared from $23
(split-adjusted) when the ESOP began to $98 in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step would be to institutionalize these ad hoc
teams,'' Rosen says. ``That didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As time went on, ``management got its back up about how they
would deal with pilots'' in their next contract negotiations. ``And
they stopped advertising themselves as an employee-owned company
(because) if you advertise yourself that way, customers are going
to expect employees to behave that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen says the failure to include flight attendants in the ESOP
was a near-fatal flaw. The attendants opted not to join because
they couldn't reach agreements with management on key issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else there should have figured out a way to get the
flight attendants in,'' Rosen says. ``They're the face of the
airline to the public. If you'd had the flight attendants involved,
you might have had a more positive customer response and there
might have been a perception (among employees) that the ESOP was a
more-effective instrument for moving the company forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan also had certain design deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most ESOPs, United required participants to take a pay
cut, so some employees may not have perceived a net benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Second, whereas most ESOPs are ongoing, United only contributed
to the plan for five years and nine months.
</P>
<P>
   It worked like this: In 1994, the ESOP borrowed money to buy
United stock on behalf of employees. During the next five or so
years, United contributed money to the plan, and that money repaid
the loan. As the loan was repaid, shares were allocated to workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the period, contributions ended and employees had
their full allocation of stock. The end came in April for pilots
and July for mechanics. At that time, pay scales bounced back to
1994 levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees won't see any additional contributions made to the
account,'' Rosen says. ``The only change now is the increase or
decrease in value of the shares.''
</P>
<P>
   New employees are not part of the plan, and as participants
leave the company and sell their stock, the collective stake of
employees will shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Workers everywhere greet cultural change with a
``this-too-shall-pass'' attitude, and the ESOP's limited life span
``reinforced that problematic attitude,'' Rosen thinks.
</P>
<P>
   But the ESOP's biggest drawback, from a motivational standpoint,
is that employees can't cash in their stock until they leave the
company.
</P>
<P>
   This is standard for ESOPs, but most ESOPs are used by private
companies that don't have marketable securities.
</P>
<P>
   Most public companies use stock-option plans, in which employees
are periodically granted blocks of stock options. Each year, they
can cash in a portion of their options.
</P>
<P>
   But ESOPs have better tax advantages for employees and employers
than stock option plans. A spokeswoman for United says the company
chose an ESOP in part because ``the tax savings were tremendous for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike stock option plans, ESOPs also let employees aggregate
voting control, which gives unions more power.
</P>
<P>
   James Higgins, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette,
estimates that the average United pilot might have stock worth
about $120,000 in the ESOP, equal to about one year's salary. Not
bad, but he or she ``can't sell United shares and buy a
refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen says United could amend its plan to permit payouts while
an employee is still with the company. ``I recommended they do
it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The United spokesman wasn't sure that's legally possible. And
even if it is, she says, the ESOP was designed to provide for
employees' retirement, not their immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, the United pilot, says the ESOP has ``zero intrinsic
value,'' because current employees can't sell their stock and have
no control over its price.
</P>
<P>
   Since its peak in late 1997, United stock has fallen by almost
half to $51 _ the result of competitive pressures, rising fuel
costs, uncertainty over United's bid for US Airways and its current
labor problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the pilots' perspective, the ESOP was a failure,''
Bradley says. ``Cultural change has been very limited ... and
management has reverted to an adversarial mode.'' In response, he
admits, the union ``has reacted in an adversarial way.''
</P>
<P>
   United management sees the ESOP as a success.
</P>
<P>
   It let United reduce its cost structure and immediately
strengthen its competitive position, says spokesman Matt Triaca. It
also led to ``fairly stable relations'' with unions. As part of the
deal, during the five-plus years the ESOP was active, no union
contracts expired except for one with the flight attendants, and
they agreed to a new 10-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also allowed United to set up its lower-cost Shuttle
service, which gave the airline a presence in important new markets
like the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen believes the ESOP has been a ``qualified success'' for
labor and management. ``Who it has not worked for is the customer
and the shareholder. United has been more or less as good an
investment as any other airline,'' he says. ``But most companies
get a lot more mileage out of employee ownership than United did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Neidl, an analyst with ING Barings, agrees. ``At one time, I
was in favor of the ESOP. I thought if you gave employees ownership
they'd act more like owners than typical unionized employees. I
haven't seen it at United.''
</P>
<P>
   As for that United pilot who criticized the company from the
cockpit, Bradley says the union does not condone such behavior.
But, he explains, ``the frustration levels are very, very high.
Pilots have been subjected to a lot of abuse'' by passengers and
the public.
</P>
<P>
   The company's response: ``The vast majority of our employees are
continuing to perform their jobs as professionals,'' Triaca says.

   (PHOENIX) - Turns out they don't take volunteers for jury duty.
I called down to the federal courthouse in Tucson to offer my
services as a juror in the case of a lawsuit filed by a Javier
Bencomo Arreola of Chihuahua, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, I was told. First, I live in Phoenix, which is far enough
away to be considered ``an undue hardship or extreme
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind the drive, I said. Not for this case.
</P>
<P>
   Second, federal law requires the jury pool for any given case to
be filled by ``random selection of citizens' names.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Bencomo Arreola is not a citizen of the United States. He
is, however, suing a pair of U.S. citizens - Linda Louise and
Andreas Mueller.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I'm volunteering for jury duty.
</P>
<P>
   Bencomo Arreola wants the Muellers to forfeit $300,000 for
having scared the bejabbers out of him April 5. It seems Bencomo
Arreola was part of a group of undocumented immigrants passing
through an area near the Muellers' property in southern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   All along the border, ranchers and farmers and other ordinary
folks have gotten the feeling that they are under siege. Probably
because they (beginitalic)are (enditalic)under siege.
</P>
<P>
   The border is less like a border these days and more like the
front lines of a battleground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people crossing into Arizona from Mexico are not
evil or dangerous. But that doesn't mean they can't do harm to
people or property. And it doesn't mean they can't be frightening
to those who hear them and see them passing through in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Border Patrol can't stop the flow, American citizens
now patrol their properties with guns. Sometimes, they detain
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bencomo Arreola's lawyer, Fernando Gaxiola, says the Muellers
went too far down the dangerous road of vigilantism. He says the
couple set a dog on the group, and that Andreas Mueller cornered
the border crossers and threatened them with a rifle, even though
his client was not technically on his property. For now, the
parties involved in the lawsuit aren't talking. The courts are a
slow grinding machine. If, however, the case ever goes to trial,
I'd like to volunteer my services as a juror.
</P>
<P>
   The laws of the United States are available for use by everyone,
even those who aren't citizens. That makes it possible for Bencomo
Arreola to file suit and even to win.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I am on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration policy is not always fair and reasonable. Many good
folks are kept out. Still, breaking into a country is a lot like
breaking into a house. The people in the house have no right to
harm you, unless you threaten their lives. But they must have a
right to shoo you off, to detain you, to scare the living daylights
out of you.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be the neighborly thing to do, but it's difficult to
be hospitable with uninvited guests, let alone uninvited guests who
return again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Bencomo Arreola deserves the benefit of the doubt, of
course. He deserves an opportunity to make a better life for
himself and his family, if he does so legally. He deserves our
attention. He deserves our concern. He deserves our best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   And he deserves not one red cent of the Muellers' money.

LOS ANGELES MAYOR WELCOMES DELEGATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was California's day in the sun at the opening
of the Democratic National Convention with Mayor Richard Riordan
heading a contingent of local, state and federal officials in
welcoming delegates to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a Republican treading in enemy territory, appeared with
about 30 L.A. children Monday, sounding very like a Democrat in his
impassioned speech calling for higher teacher salaries and
repudiating the notion minorities cannot learn because of their
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles and our country are enjoying prosperity unknown in
the history of the world,'' Riordan said. ``However, too many
people, particularly minorities, have been left behind. We owe
everybody the tools to get and keep high-quality, high-paying
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   For Riordan, the speech also gave him an opportunity to boast of
the city and its economy over the past several years, accompanied
by a fast-cut film with hard-driving rock music showing off
different areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was but one of many California officials and others
who addressed the standing-room-only crowd at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los
Angeles, provided the opening invocation at the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   He asked God to ``keep us ever committed to protect the life and
well-being of all people, but especially unborn children, the sick
and the elderly, those on Skid Row and those on Death Row.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony also said he hoped candidates would embody values that
``protect all human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis and California's two U.S. Senators, Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, as well as Los Angeles County
Supervisor Gloria Molina also addressed the crowd, and they were
not afraid to attack Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (Vice President) Al Gore country,'' Davis said.
``Californians welcome the party of President Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. I ask you if you are better off today than you
were eight years ago. You better believe you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein also struck out against Republicans,
particularly on school vouchers and the right for women to choose
on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also offered a direct challenge to the GOP assertion that
the Clinton administration has missed an opportunity during the
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were given a chance, we led,'' Boxer said. `They had
their chance and they were unsuccessful. That's why they were
defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   And Molina, speaking in both English and Spanish, said the city
and the Democratic Party offered similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With dreams, hard work and a desire to succeed, everyone can
be successful,'' Molina said.

CLINTON BIDS GOODBYE TO PARTY, PASSES MANTEL TO GORE 
 
By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring that prosperity during his administration has made the
United States ``more decent, more humane, more united,'' President
Clinton bid a long goodbye to his party Monday and extended credit
for his success to his would-be successor, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the last major address of his presidency, Clinton
starred on opening night of the Democratic National Convention,
revisiting the ``bridge to the 21st century'' theme of his 1996
campaign, and saying the nation is better off now than it was eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1992, America has grown, not just economically, but as a
community,'' Clinton said. ``We are growing more diverse and more
united. But we're not just better off, we're also a better country
_ more decent, more humane, more united. Now, that's the purpose of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, however,
a nearby rock concert for convention protesters erupted into a
violent confrontation. Demonstrators threw chunks of concrete and
police responded with pepper spray and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police herded the demonstrators to the far end of a designated
protest area, pushing them away from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, as he prepared to pass the mantle of party leadership to
Gore, Clinton praised the vice president's tenure amid sustained,
enthusiastic applause from the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al and I have worked closely together for eight years now. In
the most challenging moments, when we faced the most difficult
issues _ of war and peace, of taking on powerful special interests
_ he was always there,'' according to the text of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and running mate Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., watched
the evenings proceedings together in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great speech,'' Gore said afterward. ``I
appreciated the generous and kind words he said about me and
Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months left in his second and final term as
president, Clinton said, ``we built our bridge to the 21st century.
We crossed it together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the timeline of the 2000 presidential campaign, Clinton's
speech _ his fourth before a national convention audience _ served
as a transitional moment as 4,370 delegates stand poised to
nominate Gore for the presidency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Clinton also seized what may be his last chance
before a national audience to take credit for the country's
economic prosperity, rebutting claims by Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and Republican leadership that his policies have been meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of these eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's address capped an evening of speeches and
tributes on the theme of ``prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights included a video honoring former President
Carter, the only other living Democratic president, appearances by
female U.S. senators, and a brief address by first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton, herself a candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The opening day of the convention also included the first
significant confrontation between police and a portion of the
estimated 50,000 protesters converging on the city for the four-day
event.
</P>
<P>
   Blocks from the Staples Center, hundreds of protesters clashed
with police in riot gear, resulting in 10 arrests. The
demonstrators, environmentalists objecting to Gore's ties to
Occidental Petroleum Corp., blocked a downtown intersection and
taunted police who ordered them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, protests around the convention hall had been
raucous but largely without confrontation. For several days, the
police presence around the convention facility has been highly
visible and large in number.
</P>
<P>
   In protests of a more political nature, Republican leaders
joined together to scoff at Democratic claims of achievement on
Monday, saying Clinton and Gore are building themselves up to be
something they're not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a candidate for the Democrats who can't lead, is
hesitant to take a position, and America's surveys are showing
consistently they can't wait until Nov. 7 so we can have a change
in direction in this country,'' said U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this reinvention convention, Al Gore is trying to rewrite
history,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   In her address to the delegates, Hillary Clinton stuck largely
to the softer themes of children and families.
</P>
<P>
   In 20-minute remarks, the first lady thanked the nation for her
time in the White House, touched on key Democratic campaign themes
and made a single reference to her own campaign against Republican
Rick Lazio back in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' Clinton said, adding ``I will always be profoundly
grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last
eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the title of a book she authored on raising children,
the first lady said, ``You know, I still believe it takes a
village.'' She went on to say that Gore and his running mate,
Lieberman, ``have what it takes, and they'll do what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The departing first lady, whose tenure has at times been stormy,
controversial and unpopular with the mainstream American public,
said, ``Really, the most important thing that I can say tonight is:
Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the convention, both Clintons have
come under fire from within their own party for failing to stay
sufficiently out of sight during what should be Gore's moment to
shine.
</P>
<P>
   The high-wattage Clinton duo have been mingling with Hollywood
celebrities and raising millions of dollars in campaign funds since
arriving in Los Angeles over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, struggling to come out from behind Clinton's shadow
and establish himself as a viable next leader for the nation, their
activities have proved a persistent distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic advisers and leadership are hoping the Clinton factor
will diminish as the week progresses and momentum builds toward
Gore's nomination speech on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the country wants to hear from Gore,'' said Democratic
strategist James Carville. ``Between now and November, it's Gore's
turn. But the president sometimes has a hard time keeping his
opinions to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some accounts, Clinton has been kept largely out of
the loop by the Gore campaign, and is not privy to its strategies
and machinations.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll released by Fox News/Opinion Dynamics cited 68
percent of Americans who thought Gore should ask Clinton to stay
home from campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to leave Los Angeles early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Carter, in an interview with NBC, said Gore is
coming into his own in the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the escapades of President Clinton in the White
House are still in people's memories but I think that time is
passing by,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning in Missouri as the convention got under way in
California, continued to stress his key commitments to fixing
Social Security and Medicare, but avoided direct confrontation with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people on the other ticket are good men, I'll never attack
them personally,'' Gore said, referring to Bush and running mate
Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Gore said, ``The American people need to know the
specifics of how the American people would be affected if the other
side won.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to arrive in Los Angeles Wednesday.

VALLEY, HARBOR SECESSION MIGHT BE JUST THE BEGINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the filing Monday of petitions to join a
secession study, Hollywood residents joined a powerful grass-roots
movement that threatens to crack apart what Los Angeles' boosters
call the ``Capital City of the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods equal to half the city's population -- from its
northern suburbs in the San Fernando Valley to its symbolic heart,
Hollywood, to its southernmost border at the Los Angeles Harbor --
are trying to break away from Los Angeles and form their own
cities.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall has failed to serve Los Angeles' 3.5 million residents
over a long period of time, they say, and the neighborhoods of the
sprawling areas could do better if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lead role are activists in the Valley, the suburban
home of 1.3 million people made famous by countless pop culture
references -- from songs like Frank Zappa's ``Valley Girl'' to
films like ``Chinatown'' and ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is ``too big to deliver local services effectively
or efficiently,'' said Richard Close, chairman of Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment, the Valley secession group. ``We're
trying to create local control over local decisions, to make the
city even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley activists also launched efforts to break up the mammoth
Los Angeles Unified School District and the county Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   And activists in other parts of the city say if the Valley isn't
getting its fair share, who is? They point to the necessity of
getting 25 percent of all registered voters in breakaway areas to
sign secession study petitions as proof of how widespread the
discontent is.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. does not work,'' said Gene La Pietra, founder of the
Hollywood secession movement. ``Everywhere you go in the city,
people always feel the other part of the city's getting the
services, but the fact is nobody's getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, after crime in the Hollywood Division of
the Los Angeles Police Department went down, the city's response
was to transfer officers to other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, disagree. They think the city has been
working well and is improving.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, as secessionist voices have gotten
louder, the city has made some attempts to keep the city together
by appeasing them. Most notable was a series of voter-approved
changes to the City Charter -- supported by Mayor Richard Riordan
but opposed by most City Council members -- which took effect last
month and forms one of the pillars of the antisecession argument.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's press secretary, Peter Hidalgo, said the mayor
believes the new charter, which created a system of advisory
neighborhood councils and a Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
will make the city more responsive to its residents.
</P>
<P>
   It also concentrated somewhat more power in the mayor's office,
and Hidalgo argued the mayor should be given a chance to use his
new power to make the city more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters overwhelmingly supported a new charter reform
program, which clearly allows more local involvement with city
government and even gives local authority for neighborhood-related
issues,'' Hidalgo said. ``Which brings Angelenos and city
government much closer than they have been in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, City Council and city employees' union vehemently
oppose the secession movements, but several public opinion polls
have found a majority of city voters in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is being studied by a county agency to determine how
the city could be broken up and could go on the ballot in November
2002, with voter majorities needed both in the seceding community
and the city as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The secession movement is an outgrowth of many factors, experts
say, including the massive sprawl of Los Angeles that leads to a
feeling of disconnection and political apathy among its residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley and Harbor areas in particular are the most
geographically isolated sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley, which was nothing but farmland when it was annexed
in 1915, is separated from the rest of L.A. by the Santa Monica
Mountains, leaving only two freeways and a few surface roads as
congested links to downtown. The Harbor area is connected only by a
thin sliver of land in a shape designed to give Los Angeles
political control over the economically valuable harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the separation between the Valley and the Harbor is
also a reflection of a larger society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think government itself -- not just the city of Los Angeles,
but in general -- has become faceless, too large, too unwieldy,''
said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at Pepperdine University's
Davenport Institute for Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thinks a new Valley city of 1.3 million -- which
would be the nation's sixth largest as well as its richest, safest
and most diverse city -- would still be too large to serve its
residents. He would rather see cities a tenth that size.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, he added, when Los Angeles was still developing, the
idea of a large city was attractive because it gave economies of
scale. But now technology has made communication and transportation
so easy, there is much less need for large, concentrated downtowns
and big cities, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was one of the pioneers of annexation and bigger is
better,'' Kotkin said. ``And in many ways, it (open italics) was
(italics end) better. I remember when I moved to L.A. in the mid
'70s, I was always struck by how much better the city of L.A.
functioned than the independent cities or unincorporated areas like
West Hollywood or Culver City. Those places looked pretty rundown.
Now I think it's the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts think if the three secession drives are
successful, it could spark a chain reaction, both within the
remaining portions of Los Angeles and throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Coasters are watching Los Angeles to see if it's
successful or not,'' said Philip J. Ethington, a University of
Southern California history professor who studies urban annexation
and growth issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an example case. California typically has
been setting the national trend on a lot of these major issues.''

LOS ANGELES MAYOR WELCOMES DELEGATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was California's day in the sun at the opening
of the Democratic National Convention with Mayor Richard Riordan
heading a contingent of local, state and federal officials in
welcoming delegates to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a Republican treading in enemy territory, appeared with
about 30 L.A. children Monday, sounding very like a Democrat in his
impassioned speech calling for higher teacher salaries and
repudiating the notion minorities cannot learn because of their
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles and our country are enjoying prosperity unknown in
the history of the world,'' Riordan said. ``However, too many
people, particularly minorities, have been left behind. We owe
everybody the tools to get and keep high-quality, high-paying
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   For Riordan, the speech also gave him an opportunity to boast of
the city and its economy over the past several years, accompanied
by a fast-cut film with hard-driving rock music showing off
different areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was but one of many California officials and others
who addressed the standing-room-only crowd at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Roger Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los
Angeles, provided the opening invocation at the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
   He asked God to ``keep us ever committed to protect the life and
well-being of all people, but especially unborn children, the sick
and the elderly, those on Skid Row and those on Death Row.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony also said he hoped candidates would embody values that
``protect all human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis and California's two U.S. Senators, Barbara
Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, as well as Los Angeles County
Supervisor Gloria Molina also addressed the crowd, and they were
not afraid to attack Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (Vice President) Al Gore country,'' Davis said.
``Californians welcome the party of President Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. I ask you if you are better off today than you
were eight years ago. You better believe you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and Feinstein also struck out against Republicans,
particularly on school vouchers and the right for women to choose
on abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer also offered a direct challenge to the GOP assertion that
the Clinton administration has missed an opportunity during the
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were given a chance, we led,'' Boxer said. `They had
their chance and they were unsuccessful. That's why they were
defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   And Molina, speaking in both English and Spanish, said the city
and the Democratic Party offered similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``With dreams, hard work and a desire to succeed, everyone can
be successful,'' Molina said.
</P>

 &HT;    POLICE, PROTESTERS CLASH OUTSIDE CONVENTION
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS and SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Police in riot gear clashed Monday night with
protesters outside the Democratic National Convention after
demonstrators pelted officers with chunks of concrete and steel
balls fired from slingshots.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded with pepper spray, rubber bullets and finally a
charge on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they moved on the crowd after protestors started
fires and refused to clear an area near where the presidential
motorcade was expected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to tolerate lawlessness,'' Sgt. John
Pasquariello of the Los Angeles Police Dept told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The clash occurred in an area near the Staples Center designated
for protests and involved about 300 of 8,000 people gathered
outside the convention hall. The altercation began as thousands
began to leave a rock concert by Rage Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble then spread as more police rushed to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters with bandannas over their faces lit several fires in
the concert area. The ground around police was littered with rocks,
broken bottles and sticks thrown over a fence by the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Rage Against The Machine is anti-authoritarian and has
campaigned in support of such figures as Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on
death row for killing a Philadelphia police officer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the trouble started quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw no particular provocation,'' said homeless activist
Robert Norse, 53. ``Suddenly, the crowd started to run in my
direction. The police were shouting 'Move. Move.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Cruz resident said bedlam then broke out. A friend was
clubbed in the back, Norse said, and people were hit with rubber
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Johnson, a 46-yeard-old journalist from Santa Cruz, also
said the onset of trouble came suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eating a hot dog,'' she said, ``and all of a suddden
people started rushing and screaming in panic.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she was clubbed in the back by police.
</P>
<P>
   Before the melee, the mood had been festive.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, hundreds of environmental activists jammed
intersections near the convention site to demand that Vice
President Al Gore sever his ties to the Los Angeles-based
Occidental Petroleum Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, featuring giant puppets portraying the evils of
capitalism, proceeded peacefully from a downtown park to the
designated dissent site near the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   But after some protesters refused to leave the area, police
locked batons to herd them away and clear the streets. About a
dozen protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Atossa Soltani, founder of the environmental group Amazon Watch,
told the gathering that the Gore family ties to Occidental ``makes
him no better than Bush.'' He challenged Gore to ``show us you are
an environmental champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Occidental has rights to conduct exploratory drilling a few
miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa Indian reserve in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's late father, Al Gore Sr., served on the Occidental board
after losing his Senate re-election bid in 1968. Between $500,000
and $1 million in Occidental stock is currently held in trust for
Gore's mother, Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon Watch released a letter to Gore signed by singer Bonnie
Raitt and actors Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon suggesting that
Gore's decision to retain his Occidental ties was not only a matter
of environmental concern but ``a question of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway dismissed the protests, saying,
``Al Gore has been a champion of the environment his entire public
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, the governor of
Texas, and Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, both have professional
and political ties to the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the environment wasn't all protesters were concerned
about, judging by the variety of messages on the signs they
carried. They ran the gamut from ``One Nation Under Corporation''
to ``Stop Patents of Indigenous Medicines.'' One sign read: ``All
government is bad.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON SEEKS BALANCE OF LEAVING AND HELPING GORE
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS with updating thruout including quotes from Clinton that were
slight deviations from prepared text) 
By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The transfer of power is one of the key tests of
democracy. At the governmental level, the United States has managed
it exceptionally well ever since George Washington, hero of the war
that brought the nation into being, handed over to John Adams in
1797.
</P>
<P>
   But before the reins of government can pass from one hand to
another, party leadership must be transferred, in a process for
which there is no set of statutes and no rulebook. It has often
proved difficult for sitting presidents, especially in the modern
era, when vice presidents more or less automatically seek the
presidency. So it has proved for President Clinton, despite largely
cordial relations with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton sought to lift the Gore campaign onto a
new, smoother road. He described Gore as ``a profoundly good man''
whom he had come to know well in eight years. But his words about
Gore did not form the emotional climax of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, Gore takes over the leadership of the
Democratic party this week. That was decided when he saw off his
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, in the primaries.
But what remains to be decided is how thoroughly he can put his
stamp on the party. Can he make it his own? Or will he be deemed
only second-best by the party faithful?
</P>
<P>
   Another question: Will Clinton really let go of the baton? The
Clintons hope, of course, to retain a presence in Washington in the
form of a New York Senate seat _ something the delegates here were
constantly reminded of _ and if they do so Clinton will surely be
part of that presence.
</P>
<P>
   That was the subtext Monday night as the president, wildly
popular among his fellow Democrats through the ups and downs of the
last eight years, appeared before the convention. The hard fact is
Gore needs help, most of all from Clinton. Paradoxically, he needs
both the enthusiastic endorsement of the president and his help in
escaping the long presidential shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that seemed at times more like a State of the Union
address than anything else, Clinton was unstinting in his praise of
his vice president. During ``the most difficult days,'' the
president said, Gore ``was always there.'' He added: ``More than
anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al Gore understands
the future and how sweeping changes and scientific breakthroughs
will affect ordinary Americans' daily lives.'' But unlike Ronald
Reagan, who promised at the 1988 convention that he would gladly
serve as ``a foot soldier'' in George Bush's forthcoming campaign
if needed, Clinton studiously avoided a pledge to crisscross the
country this fall for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking also to the television audience, he made an untypically
restrained comment that stopped short of a direct appeal for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I feel,'' he said. ``But it's not my decision to
make. That belongs to the American people. I just want to tell all
of you gathered in this great arena a few things I know about Al
Gore.'' All in all, the Clintons will have spent more than three
days here by the time they leave on Tuesday morning. Before he
spoke Monday night, Clinton had delivered seven other officially
announced speeches Monday, and no doubt some off-hand remarks as
well. He and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have raised
money with a zeal unmatched by any first family in history,
apparently saw no need to deviate from their routine during Gore's
big week here, even when the people closest to Gore gnashed their
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   They were almost as omnipresent as the morning mist this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Reagan's 1988 behavior was sharp. He spent
only 48 hours at the New Orleans convention that year, scheduled
only three public appearances and made a determined effort to
transfer some of his inner fire, and a bit of his electoral appeal,
to his more diffident No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, when Reagans again slipped offstage quickly and
quietly, leaving Washington without even staying for the
post-inaugural lunch at the Capitol, Elaine Crispen, Nancy Reagan's
press secretary, explained their attitude this way: ``It's a sense
of what's right. It's their party. It's the Bushes' victory. Let's
let them enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   After initially giving him only a lukewarm endorsement, Reagan
had campaigned hard for George Bush, the father of this year's
Republican nominee, emerging in the final days of the campaign as
Bush's main surrogate. He traveled some 25,000 miles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late in the 1960 campaign, after describing himself as ``just a
spectator,'' Dwight D. Eisenhower leapt into the fray in a bid to
save the day for his vice president, Richard Nixon. It was a
stirring sight, James Reston wrote in The New York Times that fall,
``the old pro coming off the bench and swinging for the fences for
the last time.'' John F. Kennedy won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will do the same remains up in the air.
Democratic state chairmen from New Jersey to Wisconsin to Oregon
have been pressing Clinton to stump hard for Gore, in the hope that
he could brighten a campaign that has often seemed inert and
uninspired. The White House has said it will let Gore make the
decision, but the chairmen, by and large, think the president's
presence on the trail is worth the gamble that he might well remind
voters how much more exciting than his protege he can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have the president in this state every chance I got,''
said Kam Kuwata, a California campaign consultant. ``We need the
energy, and he's the one who has the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are Clinton will answer the call. Sooner or later, as
election day approached, each one of the presidents since World War
II whose vice presidents were seeking to succeed them has felt the
pull of the stump.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates on the floor lustily cheered both the president and
the first lady Monday night. But they were divided in another
respect. Some, like Eleanor Sobel, a state representative from
Hollywood, Fla., said Gore could carry the party banner as well as
Clinton, and argued that it was time now for the president to move
on. Others, like Greg Salazar from Las Vegas, N.M., expressed
concern that Clinton would overshadow Gore. But even Salazar said
that if the race looked close, ``the president should come out in
public and ask the people to vote for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has never had a coup d'etat. It shares that
distinction with Britain and only a few other countries. In fact,
only once in more than two hundred years has the outcome of a
national election, and hence the right to the presidency, been
disputed beyond the Electoral College's verdict. That was in 1876,
when the Democrats charged that the Republicans had stolen the
election for Rutherford B. Hayes, and even then, the inaugural went
ahead right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But president after president has wrestled with the question of
his own succession. Eisenhower tried in 1955 to ease Nixon out of
the Cabinet, toying with the names of Henry Cabot Lodge and Nelson
A. Rockefeller as possible replacements. Asked five years later to
name ``a major idea'' of Nixon's that he had adopted,'' the
president answered, in a tone of overwhelming boredom, ``If you
give me a week, I might think of one. I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   In his turn, Nixon decided in the spring of 1971 that John
Connally, the former governor of Texas, should be his successor,
not Spiro Agnew. But when Agnew was forced to resign in 1973, Nixon
was unable to win assurances of confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was as conflicted as Lyndon B. Johnson. He was
furious that his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, harbored doubts
about the Vietnam War, and he told friends that ``Hubert cries too
much.'' For a time, he toyed with the idea of trying to get himself
drafted for another term in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Nov. 3, 1968, at the tail-end of the campaign, did he
give his full-throated backing to Humphrey, standing next to him at
the Astrodome in Houston and shouting, ``That man, my friend and
co-worker for 20 years, is a healer and a builder and will
represent all of the people all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between Clinton and Gore never became as severe as
those in some past administrations. But this handoff has not been
without significant friction, and Gore can afford little of that.

COMMENTARY: IN LOS ANGELES, MRS. CLINTON IS READY FOR HER CLOSE-UP
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS to replace top of graph 10) 
By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The setting for the Clinton rally in Hollywood
Sunday afternoon was more reminiscent of the first couple's
Arkansas past than their New York future. It was the small-town
Main Street created for the Sony Pictures Studio, a place where
Hillary Rodham Clinton slipped somewhat too easily into her old
supporting role as first lady. After more than a year of
establishing her own political identity in New York, with only five
months to go in the Clinton presidency, she was once again doing
her dutiful first lady act, performing a downbeat opening routine
for her highly oratorical husband.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, she gave an earnest, efficient, plain speech to
this Hollywood group before turning over the microphone. True to
form, he made her look like a novice. Still, when the candidate for
the Senate spoke, people listened; as the president spoke, his
audience began to slip away at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   This moment on an ersatz street in the capital of make-believe
underscored one real-life, if largely unspoken, truth about the
couple that have dominated Democratic consciousness for almost a
decade. He has always been the Clinton with the talent to win
people over, to dazzle them with empathy, to make the Hollywood
crowd envy his glamour and open their checkbooks. But this week in
Los Angeles, the party faithful are going through a collective act
of realization. At long last, Hillary has one thing he doesn't _ a
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now comes the time when she has to talk about who she is, what
kind of person she is, what she thinks about issues and what she
would do as senator,'' says Randi Weingarten, president of the
United Federation of Teachers. Like most of Mrs. Clinton's ardent
New York supporters, Weingarten insists that she has full
confidence in the First Lady's abilities to wow her audiences, to
convince them of her solid credentials, her stands on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Mrs. Clinton is but a few days away from
shedding the first lady role more fully than ever and moving into
the territory of the full-time candidate who will have to rely on
her own talents and resources more than on borrowed charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vice President Al Gore, Mrs. Clinton has to move out more
solidly on her own, holding onto the economic progress in the last
eight years while shedding the sleazier stuff that is clearly a
more complicated part of her life than the vice president's.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend in Hollywood rubbing shoulders with movie stars and
moguls raises money at the same time that it revives the questions
about the Clintons' attraction to glitter and old memories of
Monica Lewinsky's hometown. Back home in New York, Mrs. Clinton's
opponent Rick Lazio was making the connection by holding a press
conference at Planet Hollywood in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Vice President Gore, Mrs. Clinton is enjoying the rush
of support coming from his choice of Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his
running mate. A Democratic candidate in New York State usually
needs about 70 percent of the Jewish vote. Before the Lieberman
choice, only about half of the state's Jewish Democrats were
supporting the first lady. ``It's hard to imagine a more helpful
choice for her,'' said Victor Kovner, a New York City Democratic
Party loyalist who sees the choice as a tie-breaker in this race.
``The Jewish community will come home to their party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman may also activate the Orthodox vote that is
heavily conservative, Mrs. Clinton seems confident that she will
make a net gain from his presence on the New York ballot. All
weekend, she has used the Lieberman name like a protective mantra,
even letting it be known that she agrees with many of the
Connecticut senator's concerns about too much violence in the
entertainment fare churned out by her big donors here.
</P>
<P>
   While paying tribute to her husband and Gore, the first lady
delivered what was essentially her own campaign speech. She has
seemed determined to create a new aura of independence in Los
Angeles _ not only at the fund-raisers but also in the many media
interviews with anchors big-time and small. It was she, for
example, who announced the pullback in the first couple's interview
schedule when it became clear that their efforts to upstage Gore
were turning into a public-relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Her other appearances here were intended to do more than raise
money. She also wanted to make the point that the New York Senate
campaign was a contest on issues _ abortion, the economy, gun
control _ where she fits more easily with the state's majority than
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, then, this convention marks Mrs. Clinton's graduation
from the campaign-worker phase of her life to the politician phase.
That gave a special resonance to the words that she spoke to a
worshipful crowd of Democratic women in a jammed ballroom of the
Wilshire Grand Hotel. ``We are not going back,'' she said. ``we are
not keeping quiet. We are not giving up. We intend to take our
rightful place at the table.'' Mr. Clinton was not in the audience,
but you have to wonder if he checked the transcript. &QL;

RESIDENTS CALM AS BERYL BREWS &HT;     
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;     
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN _ Tropical Storm Beryl is expected to hit land around
sunup Tuesday, but many residents, mindful of last year's weak pass
by Hurricane Bret, seemed unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they watched Beryl's development, planned to weather
the storm at home and hoped it would mean a needed soaking of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bret, a powerful Category 4 hurricane, barreled
through the open ranch country of South Texas, doing little harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's left yet, and nobody is talking about leaving,'' said
Matt Moreau, owner of Pico Ace Hardware on South Padre Island.
``Most people are laughing about it and being cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Weather Service predicted that Beryl's
effect on the Houston area would be limited to widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms ending Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a quarter of an inch (of rain), consider yourself
lucky,'' said weather service meteorologist Kent Prochazka.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl was declared a tropical storm Monday when its sustained
winds reached 40 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It could reach hurricane strength _ consistent winds of at least
75 mph _ before blowing ashore Tuesday, said James Franklin at the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Beryl will likely move inland along the northeast coast of
Mexico sometime Tuesday morning. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m. Monday, Beryl had sustained winds of 50 mph. It was
centered about 115 miles south of Brownsville and was moving
west-northwest at 8 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 20 to 30 mph were blowing in Brownsville, and light
rain was falling.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the U.S. government issued a hurricane warning
for a 100-mile stretch from Baffin Bay, just south of Corpus
Christi, to the Mexican border. The Mexican government issued a
hurricane warning from the border south to La Pesca, a stretch of
about 130 miles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; However, by 10 p.m., the hurricane warning had been downgraded
to a tropical storm warning from Port Mansfield southward to
Tampico, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warnings, few South Padre residents purchased
plywood sheets and flashlight batteries. People were confident the
storm would follow weather service predictions and hit land south
of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   If the storm passes to the south, residents of the Rio Grande
Valley would see strong winds and get a much-needed drenching of
five to 10 inches of rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not boarding up windows or advising evacuation, and
we're not planning to do that,'' said Ray Kendall, South Padre
Island city manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through our countdown: closing off the low access
points to the beach so the water won't flood the streets; moving
trash barrels back to vegetation line; trying to get people to move
their umbrellas off the beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron County's two beachfront parks on South Padre Island were
closed Monday as crews boarded up facilities facing the Gulf. An
evacuation of mobile homes at Isla Blanca Park also was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a steady stream of shrimp trawlers moved through the
Brazos Santiago Pass on their way to Port Isabel, cutting short
fishing trips into the roiling Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
   At the island's U.S. Coast Guard station, three rescue boats
were hauled out of the water and a 41-foot patrol boat was moved
inland.
</P>
<P>
   Petty officer Mike Watson said the station was preparing for an
intense tropical storm _ with a storm surge and high winds _ but
not a major hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, everything is calm,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil at sea was good news for some: Near the island's
southern jetties, eager surfers lined the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to stay out there till I get washed back in,'' said
Houston surfer Aaron Lloyd, watching the waves hiss to shore. ``We
always come down here for the hurricanes _ it's the only good surf
all summer.''

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrated her husband's
years in office and proclaimed her faith in Al Gore to an audience
of thousands of cheering Democrats Monday night. She also used the
moment to advance her bid for the Senate as she luxuriated in a
level of attention unimaginable for a candidate conducting her
first campaign for public office.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton arrived at the Democratic National
Convention hall here, she had already been interviewed by all three
network anchors for segments on the evening news, as well as by
CNN's Larry King. It was a feast of prime-time exposure that left
her aides ecstatic, surpassed only by the 17 minutes in prime time
she enjoyed before a partisan audience that applauded her review of
her years in the White House and her mention of the political
career she has embarked upon in running for senator from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives, and soon,
we'll be starting a new one,'' she said. ``For me, it will be up to
the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege of
serving them in the United States Senate. I will always be
profoundly grateful to all of you and to the American people for
the last eight years. Really, the most important thing that I can
say tonight is, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also benefited from the lagging pace of the first night
of the convention: she started 20 minutes late, assuring live
coverage by all three networks.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech and in her interviews with the networks, Clinton
went to considerable lengths to praise the record of her husband
and the credentials of the man seeking to succeed him, fulfilling
the typical role of a prominent convention speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to stand here at this extraordinary moment _ the
most peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's
history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was no ordinary surrogate, talking about the party's
standard-bearer. Throughout her speech, she framed her praise of
Gore and the Democratic Party in ways that served to reinforce the
issues and attacks on her opponent in New York, Rep. Rick Lazio.
They were issues that she has raised over the summer in both
campaign speeches and in her television advertisements. She
discussed her support for raising the minimum wage, new gun-control
laws, abortion rights, and even her ill-fated advocacy of a
national health care program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a few ideas about health care,'' she said. `` I've
learned a few lessons since then. But I haven't given up on the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also interspersed her speech with details about her life
growing up, and suggested that she played a key role in the White
House in the enactment of legislation expanding foster care,
reinforcing what has been one of the dominant themes of her
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With her speech Monday, Clinton ended one of the more unusual
political trips undertaken by a candidate running for office from
New York. She spent four days in California, and while the purpose
of the trip was to accompany Bill Clinton for his last convention
as a sitting president, she turned almost every moment toward
advancing her own campaign for Senate: raising money, giving
interviews to New York newspapers and television stations and,
Monday, giving the speech and sitting down for interviews with
Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's schedule contrasted sharply with that of her opponent
during the Republican convention just two weeks ago, when Lazio
spent just one day in Philadelphia. In New York Monday, Lazio went
to Planet Hollywood to mock Clinton's efforts, and his aides
discouraged the argument that it would do her any good in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is being here in New York,'' Lazio said,
standing in front of a cut-out photograph of Sylvester Stallone.
``I think the most important thing is to be in New York and talk
about New York issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady viewed tonight's speech as a key moment in her
national life, as well as her Senate campaign. And she could not
have asked for a more receptive audience. When she spoke at the
Democratic convention in 1996, in a year in which she had been a
target of Republican attacks, delegates had offered her an ecstatic
reception. This time, after four years marked by the impeachment of
her husband and his public acknowledgment of an extramarital sexual
encounter, the crowd was once again exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to quiet the crowd several times, and remained relaxed
and poised throughout her speech. At times, she spoke passionately
about favorite topics, like child health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may not have been necessary, there were elaborate
preparations to get the crowd warmed up for Clinton and the
president. Thirty minutes before she was to speak, young aides
circulated through the arena passing out arm-loads of Hillary
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get it together,'' one woman called out in the
New York delegation. Another tried to get a chant going _ ``We need
a woman senator in New York state now'' _ prompting Sen. Charles
Schumer, who was elected in 1998, to stand and say, ``At least you
didn't say it two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort worked: On the floor, the aisles were packed to the
point that it was nearly impossible for anyone to move _ even
senators, like Tom Harkin of Iowa, who entered under the escort of
several aides, or Sen. Robert Torricelli, who entered with his
wife, Patricia Duff. In the New York section, 14 delegates stood
with signs that spelled `Senator Hillary.'' and thousands more
waved ``Hillary'' signs. For the first time of the evening, the
arena exploded with flashbulbs. Hardly a single Gore-Lieberman sign
could be seen throughout her address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the podium to the sounds of the song, ``New York,
New York,'' and delegates in the hall sang along as Clinton
prepared to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention of Lazio in her speech. She was more
discursive in the interviews she taped during the day with the
network anchors, using a question about why some voters dislike the
Clintons as a way of hitting the issues with which she has sought
to distinguish herself from Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not people that are ever going to vote for me and
what I stand for,'' she said on CBS. ``You know, they aren't
pro-choice, they are happy to let the gun lobby, you know, decide
what our laws are. They have a very different view of where we
should go when it comes to the future of New York and America.''
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton agreed to such an extensive schedule of network
interviews was notable. Clinton has until now resisted interviews
with the national media, as her aides argued it would not help _
and might actually hurt _ her effort to transform herself into a
candidate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, though, Clinton's advisers have concluded that the
key to winning the contest with Lazio, given the registration
advantage Democrats have in New York, is to present the contest
partisan, Republican-Democratic terms, rather than as a referendum
on Clinton herself. Thus, they said Monday, they have decided to
encourage coverage of Clinton attending what is in effect a
four-day celebration of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lazio paid only a cursory visit to the Republican
convention, and did not participate in any of its official events.

 &HT;    SUMMER FULL OF SURPRISES FOR HOLLYWOOD(a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Also moving in ``F'' category) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Hollywood, the summer of 2000 was a season of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm (enditalic)blew away
(beginitalic)The Patriot (enditalic)at the box office.
(beginitalic)Chicken Run (enditalic)trotted past the fowl Jim
Carrey movie (beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic). And people
loved hanging out at (beginitalic)Big Momma's House(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise was the runaway hit (beginitalic)Scary
Movie(enditalic), the Wayans brothers' raunchy send-up of teenage
slasher movies that cracked the $140 million mark. In the
wheels-within-wheels department, (beginitalic)Scary Movie
(enditalic)parodied such films as (beginitalic)Scream(enditalic),
which poked fun at such old horror flicks as (beginitalic)Halloween
(enditalic)and (beginitalic)Friday the 13th(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Scary Movie (enditalic)overcame some pretty loud
harrumphing from critics, many of whom felt it scored too high on
the raunch-o-meter.
</P>
<P>
   And it pretty much did. But (beginitalic)Scary Movie
(enditalic)was a far better effort than the disgusting
(beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic), which got a pass from
some because it had Carrey and the Farrelly brothers behind it. No
matter that the movie stunk.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, people voted with their feet. At last count,
(beginitalic)Scary Movie (enditalic)has made over $50 million more
than (beginitalic)Me, Myself &AMP; Irene(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The Wayanses led a vanguard of African-American filmmakers and
stars who cashed in this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There was Martin Lawrence in (beginitalic)Big Momma's
House(enditalic), playing an FBI agent who dresses up like an
elderly woman to catch a thief. At last count, the movie was
approaching $115 million in receipts, especially impressive because
it cost only about $30 million to make.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy also climbed back into the fat suit for
(beginitalic)Nutty Professor II: The Klumps(enditalic). Widely
dismissed as inferior to the original, the movie still grossed $43
million on its first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And director John Singleton scored a solid hit with
(beginitalic)Shaft(enditalic), starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of stars, we saw a battle for Hollywood hunk supremacy
between Mel Gibson in the Revolutionary War epic (beginitalic)The
Patriot(enditalic) and George Clooney in (beginitalic)The Perfect
Storm(enditalic), which chronicles the exploits of a fishing boat
caught in a horrific gale.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of incredible special effects, Clooney easily
bested Gibson, outearning him by $60 million. To be fair, Gibson
had to carry his long, dull movie, while Clooney's performance
consisted mainly of clinging to something while being battered with
spectacular digitized waves.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm (enditalic)didn't rule the summer
season, however. That honor goes to (beginitalic)Mission:
Impossible 2(enditalic), the Tom Cruise spy movie that made more
than $200 million while proving to be critic-proof. Many reviewers
saw it as a step down from the original, but audiences loved it.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Mission: Impossible 2(enditalic) was closely
followed at the box office by another guy movie,
(beginitalic)Gladiator(enditalic), which followed the exploits of a
Roman general who is first double-crossed and then becomes the Rock
of the Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   With testosterone-laden flicks dominating theaters, the summer
films didn't give women much to choose from. So it was no surprise
that the splendid ghost story (beginitalic)What Lies
Beneath(enditalic) showed some staying power, with receipts
approaching $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The supernatural thriller gets my vote as the summer's best. It
stars Michelle Pfeiffer, whose character is haunted by an
apparition somehow connected to her husband, played by Harrison
Ford. Of the calls I received praising this movie, most were from
women.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer movie, (beginitalic) X-Men(enditalic),
started strong with a $54 million opening, but it's faded fast in
recent weeks, perhaps because all the comic book collectors have
finally seen it the requisite 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer winds down, there were three late entries in the
sweepstakes. Last weekend's (08/04-06) (beginitalic)Space Cowboys,
Hollow Man (enditalic)and (beginitalic)Coyote Ugly (enditalic)all
tried to grab pieces of the weekend gate, with (beginitalic)Hollow
Man (enditalic)breaking on top with a $26 million opening.
</P>
<P>
   If the summer lacked anything, it was that one critical success
that had everyone talking about it. But there's no need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The fall film season is right around the corner.

POLICE AND DEMONSTRATORS CLASH OUTSIDE CONVENTION HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (UPDATES thruout with confrontation with police; SUBS headline)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The long-awaited dance between protesters and the
police began peacefully here Monday but turned into a rowdy
confrontation Monday night when some in the audience at a concert
outside the Staples Center threw rocks and bottles at officers, who
responded by firing rubber-coated bullets and moving in on
horseback to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The concert of protest itself, by the hard-rock, hip-hop band
Rage Against the Machine, was peaceful enough, staged just outside
the center in a fenced-off spot from which the authorities had
tried to bar demonstrators until a federal judge intervened. But
once it was over, some in the crowd threw the bottles and rocks
over a high-security fence at police officers on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   When the demonstrators _ a few hundred people among a crowd of
several thousand _ refused to disperse the police declared them an
illegal assembly and began firing rubber-coated bullets and using
mounted officers to force the crowd back away from the Staples
Center and down a nearby street.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates and journalists streaming out of the arena found their
way blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a tragedy; I'm disgusted,'' said a stockbroker
from Venice, Calif., who would give his name only as Johnny and was
holding two rubber bullets that he said had been fired at him..
</P>
<P>
   Also in early evening, a bomb threat forced the evacuation of
nearby Patriotic Hall, the scene of the so-called shadow convention
and headquarters for various alternative media outlets. The police
said they were investigating a report of a bomb in a van parked
behind the building. But protesters called that a ruse, and the
conservative commentator Arianna Huffington, an organizer of the
shadow gathering, led her followers down the street in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, in hot, smoggy weather, knots of hundreds of
marchers _ and then a few thousand of them _ plied their way back
and forth between the Staples Center, site of the Democratic
National Convention, and Pershing Square, a broad public plaza
about a dozen blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The official theme of the day of protest was ``Human Need, Not
Corporate Greed,'' but the placards, banners, puppets and armbands
that swirled through the usually sterile streets of downtown Los
Angeles embraced a dizzying range of causes and concerns.
Demonstrators were on hand to protest everything from Vice
President Al Gore's investments in an oil company that plans to
drill near a Colombian Indian reserve to the influence of the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Not a Commodity,'' read one banner. Another said, ``Al
Gore (EQ) Corporate Eichmann.'' Perhaps the bleakest placard read
``All Government Is Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning began with a rally in Pershing Square, featuring the
singer Bonnie Raitt, to protest Gore's family holdings in the
Occidental Petroleum Corp., which has rights to conduct exploratory
drilling a few miles outside the legal boundaries of the U'wa
Indian reserve in Colombia. Environmental groups have urged Gore to
divest his family of the stock, worth some $500,000, which had been
owned by his father, who died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the only drug coming out of Colombia
is oil,'' said Raitt, who with John Densmore, former drummer for
the Doors, sang the old Buffalo Springfield song ``For What It's
Worth.'' The crowd then headed to the Staples Center, where it
greeted some delegates arriving early, including a Baltimore city
councilman, Keiffer J. Mitchell Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in early just to walk around and see what it's all
about,'' Mitchell said. ``The Democratic Party and the Republican
Party may not address everything, but this shows that here in the
United States of America we can speak out on any issue without fear
of retaliation or harm.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not how some protesters saw it just a few moments
later, after they had turned back toward Pershing Square and tried
to block traffic at the intersection of Sixth and Flower streets.
After ignoring bullhorn warnings to disperse, nine demonstrators
were arrested and taken to jail, said a police spokesman, Officer
Marlo Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The police moved the remaining demonstrators back to Pershing
Square, where perhaps 2,000 people were gathered and still more
rallies were scheduled. Just as the group reached the southwestern
corner of the square, there was another tense few minutes as
demonstrators again stood in the middle of an intersection, this
one adjoining the grand old Biltmore Hotel, where top Democrats and
aides to Gore are staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been declared an unlawful assembly,'' the police
commander on the scene warned through a loudspeaker, his voice
barely audible over the din of police helicopters circling
overhead, as officers brandished tear-gas guns. ``We need to clear
the intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, demonstrators, with bullhorns of their own, answered
back by invoking the Constitution and the First Amendment, shouting
among other things that ``the right of the people to peacefully
assemble shall not be abridged.'' Eventually the protesters
retreated, and traffic began flowing again.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Villa, a 25-year-old preschool teacher from Berkeley,
Calif., who came for the protests, looked on in disgust. ``These
guys,'' he said of the police, ``are a brutal force.''

OLYMPICS RETURN TO AUSTRALIA IN DIFFERENT TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympians who traveled to Melbourne for the 1956 Summer
Games might as well have been going into outer space. Thirteen
years before Apollo 11, the athletes were convinced the moon would
be easier to reach than Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what planet I was on when we arrived,'' said
shot putter Parry O'Brien of the U.S. Olympic squad's journey
halfway around the world.
</P>
<P>
   From Los Angeles it was a two-day journey on a propeller plane
that buzzed across the Pacific Ocean, hop scotching land masses to
refuel like a bee pollinating plants. Along the way the U.S. team
crossed the international date line and lost not just one day but a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   When they finally staggered off the plane, wobbly-legged, they
felt as though they had stumbled into a time warp. They stepped
into a strange land where television and refrigeration and the
racial integration of teams remained very much of a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   The language was the same but even that sounded different.
</P>
<P>
   In myriad ways, it will be Melbourne once more when the Olympics
return to Australia for the second time next month. The U.S.
athletes who travel to Sydney can count on being treated well by
the local populace, seeing heated demonstrations and feeling the
heat from faraway flash points.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference will be the size and scale of the stage.
The 1956 Summer Games carried a price tag of $20 million; the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney have accrued a half-a-billion dollar bill.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate what's ahead for the U.S. Olympic team, it's
instructive to take a look back.

   Melbourne had won by one vote (over Buenos Aires) the right to
host the 1956 Olympics. It was the first Games to be held in the
southern hemisphere and, as such, it expanded people's mental map
of the world in a way that seems quaint in our jet-propelled,
Internet-powered world.
</P>
<P>
   The first Olympics to be held in Australia was also the last
Games not to be televised to a global audience. They took place at
a time when the world was expanding so fast it seemed to be coming
apart at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Politics crashed sport's Amateur Ball in Melbourne and the Cold
War heated up.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq boycotted the Games to protest the
British and French stratagem in the Suez Canal area. Communist
China withdrew when it learned Nationalist China (Taiwan) was
sending a team.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union participated in the Summer Games for only the
second time and turned the Olympic pool into a bloody mess,
mimicking their military compatriots who had rolled into Hungary a
month earlier to quell anti uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hungarian Olympic team members had gathered in Budapest
before traveling to Melbourne and they were there when Russian
tanks rolled into the city. According to one published report,
three members of the country's Olympic team were among the
thousands of Hungarians killed during the fighting that ensued.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. athletes, before leaving for Melbourne, were briefed by FBI
and State Department officials on what to do if someone from the
Hungarian Olympic contingent approached them about seeking
political asylum. So O'Brien, a USC standout, knew exactly what to
do when a Hungarian coach asked for his help in gaining asylum
during the track and field competition.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien passed on the phone number the State Department had
provided and wished him well. The coach was hardly alone; more than
half the Hungarian Olympic delegation refused to return to Hungary
after the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody regretted helping these people,''
O'Brien, who dominated the shot competition with the five best
puts, said recently by telephone. ``The way we understood it, to go
back to Hungary and life under a Soviet-imposed dictatorship would
have been to face prison or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Games began, a U.S. senator had urged that Russia be
banned from participating, reasoning that a victory by a Russian
athlete would, ``endanger the peace of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands pulled out of the Games because of the Soviets'
aggression. In announcing the Dutch withdrawal, the president of
that country's National Olympic Committee asked plaintively, ``How
can sports prevail over what has happened in Hungary?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Games were under way, Hungarian emigrants living in
Australia let it be known they were wondering the same thing.
``There were demonstrations all over the place that were organized
by Hungarians living in Australia,'' O'Brien said. ``Sentiments
were running very high against the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   The politically charged atmosphere spilled into the swimming
pool during a water polo semifinal that pitted Hungary against
Russia. The first elbows were thrown almost as soon as the ball was
dropped in the water. Before long it began raining seat cushions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who attended the match, recalled, ``There were
Hungarian emigrants in the crowd and they were chanting and
throwing seat cushions into the water. They had to stop the game
four times.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was stopped for good before the match clock ran out
with the Hungarians leading, 4-0. Hungary proceeded to win the gold
with a victory against a Yugoslavia-Croatia team.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Forty-four years later, of course, Yugoslavia and Croatia are
united only in their enmity toward each other. The Sydney Games
figure to bear some scars for all the blood shed in the tinderbox
that is the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Too, discontent that long has been smoldering in Australia could
flare into full-scale demonstrations during the Olympics.
Australian Aborigine Evonne Goolagong, a two-time Wimbledon
champion, recently led a march on Sydney to protest the plight of
the Aborigines, Australia's original, dark-skinned settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson traveled to Melbourne in 1956 as the 20-year-old
world record holder in the decathlon and to Sydney, on business,
earlier this summer. The UCLA graduate was struck by one thing then
and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious you don't see many people of color,'' said
Johnson, who is of African-American descent.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't color his Olympic experience at all. Johnson said he
was treated extraordinarily well wherever he went in Melbourne. He
remembered walking through parks and having people greet him and
give him food straight out of their picnic baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort and enthusiasm of the citizenry was incredible,''
Johnson said. ``You could tell it was a great thing for their
national pride to have an Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother also attended those Games after Johnson's hometown of
Kingsburg, in central California, raised the money for her air
fare. She was billeted with a Caucasian family in a Melbourne
suburb. Neighbors reacted to her presence by slamming their screen
doors shut and closing their windows whenever she came into view.
</P>
<P>
   Rafer Johnson hadn't known any of this until earlier this summer
when he had dinner in Sydney with one of the daughters of the
couple that had hosted his mother. The woman cut short their
reminiscing because she wasn't feeling well and last week _
Johnson's voice cracked as he got to this part of the story _ she
died. The friendships built during an Olympic fortnight are such
that Johnson felt as if he had lost a member of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and the daughter had kept up a correspondence throughout
the years, one result of his 1956 Olympic participation that he
values more than the silver medal he won in the decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's just the Olympic Games,'' Johnson said,
``but there's so much going on away from the competition. What
people don't realize is the tremendous bonds that are
established.''
</P>
<P>
   [box]
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven thousand volunteers are expected to help roll out
the welcome mat next month in Sydney. Their aim is to make the
faraway land seem like home, no matter where that happens to be.
They are cut from the same soft, cotton cloth as the 400 Melbourne
housewives who in 1956 volunteered to be on-call moms at the
Olympic Village so all the athletes might feel more at home.
</P>
<P>
   Forty four years after he competed in Melbourne, Johnson's
daughter Jenny Johnson Jordan will compete in Sydney in the beach
volleyball competition with partner Annette Buckner Davis. For
Australia and for one American family, the Olympics are as
interlocked as the Olympic rings. They have come full circle.

BROWN ROCKED IN LOSS TO MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There is this team that sometimes provides hope, but
every time you believe in the players, they give reason to say,
``nope.''
</P>
<P>
   They had their ace on the mound, but he got knocked all around,
and in the end there are answers for which you grope.
</P>
<P>
   The team? The Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost to the Florida
Marlins 11-2 Monday at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With distractions supposedly out the way, right-hander Kevin
Brown kicked off a three-game series against the afterthought
Florida Marlins with one of the shortest outings of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The defense didn't help by committing three errors in the first
two innings, but Brown (10-5) certainly wasn't even close to sharp
as he allowed nine runs (five earned) in 1 innings in one of the
more shocking days this season. One of the errors occurred after
Carlos Perez relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the errors they made might have gotten him mad,'' said
Florida left fielder Henry Rodriguez, who had two hits and three
RBI in the first two innings. ``Maybe the (57-minute) rain delay
got him mad. His fastball wasn't sinking as much as it usually
does. Maybe he got upset or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't wait around afterward to speak, instead saying ``If
I wanted to talk, don't you think I'd be waiting in the
clubhouse,'' as he left the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson voiced concern about Brown's right
side. Brown has a rib irritation on his right side, which bothered
himafter his last start. He received a cortisone shot Friday in
Atlanta, and didn't go in for treatment after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was feeling good,'' Dodgers trainer Stan Johnston said.
``He reported to me after (the game) that he didn't feel it at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson remains concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He warmed up good. That's what (pitching coach) Claude
(Osteen) told me,'' Johnson said. ``He wasn't throwing the ball
where he wanted to, and that's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not what the Dodgers had in mind after what they thought
could be a lightning-rod kind of day.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Dodgers entered the day having won just two of
their last eight, there was a strong feeling things were about to
turn around. They were coming off a win at Atlanta and were only
4games behind San Francisco in the National League West despite
playing poorly for the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Management also tried to ease the collective mind of the
clubhouse by publicly stating after Sunday's game against the
Braves that Johnson and his staff would remain for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still battling and trying to turn things around,''
Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green said. ``We'll try to win the
series and salvage the road trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed four runs in the first and five more in the
second. Errors by Kevin Elster, Adrian Beltre and Mark Grudzielanek
contributed to the dismal outing as the Dodgers trailed 4-2 after
the first inning and 9-2 after the second.
</P>
<P>
   Of Brown's 371 career starts, only four have been shorter. Only
once did he allow more runs. It was his shortest outing since June
22, 1995, when he lasted four outs against Boston when he was
pitching for Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very painful injury,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley
said. ``I had (a rib injury) earlier, but I go by his stuff and he
didn't look like he was injured tonight.''

AT THIS CONVENTION, IT'S JESSE JACKSON JR. IN THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf and add new 7th and 8th grafs about concerns of
black delegates) By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At Democratic conventions past, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson wrote a compelling piece of the story line. The 1988
convention in Atlanta, for instance, was consumed with the question
of how warmly Jackson would embrace Michael Dukakis, who had
defeated him in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's convention, however, Jackson's son and namesake,
Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., is the one making waves by giving public
voice to the concerns within the party's left wing about its
centrist ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Saturday, at a forum at the University of Southern
California, when the third-term Chicago Democrat was asked whether
people should vote for Vice President Al Gore. ``The only option is
Al Gore,'' he responded. ``But if there was another campaign that
was speaking to our issues that had the possibility and
plausibility of winning, we should support that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at another forum, this one part of the ``Shadow
Convention'' organized by a coalition of left-leaning groups,
Jackson made it clear that he would campaign aggressively for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket. But he continued to cast his decision as one
driven more by his fear of the alternative _ electing Gov. George
W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference after the speech, Jackson said: ``I am
supporting Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman and I'm doing it as
enthusiastically as I can. But Jackie Wilson is not on the ticket,
and Elvis Presley is not on the ticket, so Mr. Excitement is not
running for president. This is about pragmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there has been low-level tension among Democrats,
tension that has surfaced anew since Gore's selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate _ that pits centrists against
Democratic liberals. While a moderate message is seen as necessary
to win undecided independent voters, the party's left wing argues
that a more traditional agenda is needed to excite minorities and
other voters from the Demcrats' base. Some liberals have complained
about Lieberman's support for federal vouchers to pay for private
school tuition and about his statements in opposition to
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lieberman is expected to address some of those
concerns at a meeting of black delegates here, and several Gore
campaign officials have been acting as ambassadors to concerned
black Democrats, assuring them that Lieberman's record is
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are something the Gore campaign could do without
as it tries to generate enthusiasm for its candidate, and seeks to
motivate a traditional base that include minorities, women and
union members.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he would try to persuade disillusioned liberal
Democrats from defecting to Ralph Nader and the Green Party. And he
criticized the Gore campaign's recent emphasis on restoring the
country's sense of morality, something his vice presidential
choice, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, has emphasized throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start getting into this personal-life litmus test we
are deep in Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson territory,'' the
younger Jackson said, ``and that is unfamiliar Democratic real
estate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Jackson, meanwhile, has not stayed silent, and on
Monday made essentially the same point as his son. ``If it means we
have to hold our noses and take castor oil, do it,'' the elder
Jackson urged a group of voters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Minority voters, the elder Jackson said, would become enthused
about voting Democratic when they begin to view the campaign as a
choice not just between presidential candidates but between
distinct ideologies. ``Gore and Lieberman are quarterbacks but the
team is much broader than that,'' he said in an interview. ``And
when I see what our alternatives are I am inspired to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reverend Jackson is scheduled to speak at the convention on
Tuesday night. Though he has had starring roles at past
conventions, he said he was not bothered by the fact that he was
slated to appear before network television coverage begins.
``Whenever I speak,'' he said, ``it's prime time.''

 TOO MANY CHICKENS IN THE ROAD  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why did the chickens cross the road?
</P>
<P>
   To get to the middle, where it's safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats now execute their half of the Chicken Run, in
which compassionate conservatism meets puritanical liberalism in
the center divide, from where they can panhandle the traffic from
both directions.
</P>
<P>
   There should be a ceremony, like the one at Promontory Point in
Utah when the Union Pacific RR met with the Central Pacific RR and
they drove a golden spike.
</P>
<P>
   The Repubs and Dems could bury a golden hatchet and form a
Gore-Bush ticket. Al and W would win in a landslide, after
campaigning from the back of what Lotta Dotz calls a Gore-Bush
truck. Then they would take turns being president.
</P>
<P>
   IT WAS SAD when Gore snubbed the political fund-raising party at
the L.A. mansion of Hugh Hefner, who has always been a crusading
liberal. I didn't read any reaction comments from Hefner, which is
too bad, because he would have made hot news:
 &UR; Hef in huff over Demo rebuff! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the irony. The Democrats stiffed Hef because they're
stressing family values. Don't they realize that Hefner's
girlfriends are twins? The man is  &UR; dating  &LR; a family.
</P>
<P>
   Family values are important. Los Angeles hookers have declared
this ``Family Values Week'' and are giving discounts to convention
delegates who show a wallet photo of the wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   WHILE AL is wallowing in his own virtue, Gar Smith brings up an
interesting point. Says Gar:
</P>
<P>
   ``In his book, `Earth in the Balance,' Gore calls auto exhaust a
deadlier threat than any military enemy we are ever again likely to
confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al inherited $500,000 in Occidental Petroleum stock. What do
you call a politician who calls himself an environmentalist and is
a major shareholder in Occidental Petroleum?
</P>
<P>
   ``An Oxy moron.''
</P>
<P>
   MR. SHOP got his first taste of Emeryville's new Ikea store, and
says:
</P>
<P>
   The place has a shrine-like aura I haven't seen since In-N-Out
opened its first Bay Area franchise a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Man, the place is swarming with shoppers. If you want
inexpensive assemble-it-yourself furniture, you have to pay the
price.
</P>
<P>
   I accidentally bought the wrong item, phoned the store, got this
recorded message: ``Due to overwhelming response to our recent
store opening, we are technically unable to provide information ...
over the phone. We are also unable to transfer any phone calls to
the sales floor.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: ``We've been open for four months, but we are so
busy baling our money that we don't have time to hire operators and
salespeople who would let you know if the item you're looking for
is one of the very many items that you will find in our showroom
tagged `Temporarily oversold.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporarily oversold?'' Al Gore has the same tag tied to the
lapel of his suit this week.
</P>
<P>
   RUNDOWN shoppers, recharge.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Johnstone reports that the newly enlarged Banana Republic
store at Sutter and Grant aims to please. If you hand your cell
phone to the store's concierge, he or she will plug it into a
battery-charger while you shop.
</P>
<P>
   The charge for the charge: No charge!
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO isn't the only city-by-the-Bay that is growing
cold and unfriendly to scuffling little arts groups and assorted
non-profits.
</P>
<P>
   Those little guys being forced into the streets of S.F. by the
dot.com money invasion, many of them were fleeing to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Now: The Oakland East Bay Symphony is being booted from its
offices in the Kaiser Building at Lake Merritt, because of rising
rents due to dot.com invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Man, you hate to see a tuba player huffing ``Stairway to
Heaven'' on a street corner for spare change.
</P>
<P>
   XTREMELY HANDY: The Triple-A Auto Club is using bicycles to
patrol parking areas for the X Games. These chivalrous knights on
yellow bikes carry tools to fix flats, unlock doors and jump dead
batteries. For free.

SPARKS DON'T MIND ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks love the road. And
that's exactly where they'll be as they continue their Women's
National Basketball Association playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who had Monday off after completing a two-game sweep
of Phoenix Sunday in the best-of three series, will be at Houston
on Thursday night in the first game of the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Sheryl Swoopes scored a career playoff-high 27
points as the three-time champion Comets advanced with a 75-70
victory over the Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets won two games to end the first-round, best-of-three
series, thus earning their berth with tthe Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Though a matchup with the Comets would not seem to bring a smile
to any opponent, the Sparks actually look forward to playing on the
road. They seem to find more peace on the road, few distractions
and plenty of time to focus.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were 13-3 on the road during the regular season,
finishing with a 5-1 mark away from the Forum. After losing the
season-ender to Utah, they opened the playoffs with a resounding
win at Phoenix Friday to take the lead in that series. They simply
have no qualms playing on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been some statements about us being 'road warriors,'
and I think that's a good name for us,'' Sparks coach Michael
Cooper said. ``We feel very confident and comfortable on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The other Cooper: Houston Comets guard Cynthia Cooper gave
her perspective on the playoff race in her guest column in USA
Today. In short, she said she's looking forward to cheering on
teammate Sheryl Swoopes in the Olympics after the Comets win their
fourth WNBA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time WNBA MVP remains confident that the Comets can pull
it off as a coronation to her planned retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been talk whether it would be good for the league if
we were to win a fourth title,'' Cooper wrote. ``The league's front
office would probably prefer three or four different champions. But
as players, we're out to win a championship every single year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be rewarded for our consistency with some type of
respect for winning three championships and in a position to win
our fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Lisa Leslie and Tamecka Dixon had a chance to
rest their bruised knees on the team's day off Monday, but Dixon
wasn't so sure that's a good idea. ``I don't really like taking
days off with Coop because the next practice is hell,'' she said. .
. . New York's center Tari Phillips was selected the league's most
improved player, which should come as no surprise to anyone who saw
any ABL games. Therein lies the problem, because the ABL was rarely
televised, which helped led to the grass-root league's demise in
1999. But Phillips was a dominant post player for the Colorado
Xplosion. Why she didn't make an impression on Orlando's coach
Carolyn Peck is Peck's loss and Rich Adubato's gain. Phillips could
possibly play her old team. Orlando and Cleveland play in the
decisive third game tonight and the winner will play New York in
the Eastern Conference Finals.!dlim!!end!

NAVY SUBMARINE CAPTAIN SAYS CLOCK IS TICKING FOR
RUSSIAN  SUBMARINERS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What happened to the Russian submarine Kursk is
the submariners' worst nightmare _ trapped on the bottom of the sea
in a crippled boat with hope running out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for them,'' said Len Vaden, who spent years as an
electrician on U.S. Navy submarines during the Cold War. In those
days, the enemy was the Soviet navy, and Vaden, who served on two
nuclear subs, will not talk about any encounters submarines he
served aboard may or may not have had with the Russians. ``I can
neither confirm nor deny anything about that,'' he said carefully.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands what it must be like to be aboard the trapped
submarine. ``Submariners are a strange breed, they say. People
always ask what it's like to be serving in steel coffins,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure what happened to the Kursk when it
apparently collided with another vessel or an object on Sunday and
plunged to the bottom of the icy Barents Sea not far from the
northern Russian port of Murmansk.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Russian seamen are aboard, and Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyodev said Monday that the chances for a successful rescue
``are not very high.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the chances are very, very low,'' said retired
U.S. Navy Capt. Edward L. Beach, an author, former submarine
skipper and one of the most respected authorities on undersea
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Beach's 27-year Navy career ranged from World War II diesel
boats _ he wrote the submarine classic ``Run Silent, Run Deep'' _
through command of a nuclear submarine. He was skipper of the USS
Triton, which in 1960 was the first vessel to circumnavigate the
world submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something went radically wrong,'' he said of the Kursk. ``It
must have happened fast. My guess is that they were getting ready
to surface, and a surface ship was coming fast. Maybe they didn't
see them; maybe the ship didn't see the sub. It's happened
before.''
</P>
<P>
   A submarine is always at its most vulnerable just as it surfaces
or submerges; those are the moments submarine crews fear most.
</P>
<P>
   Beach thinks it must have been a Russian ship that hit the
Russian sub, although some Russian sources are hinting that the
Kursk collided with a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, U.S., British and other Western naval
vessels were known to stalk Soviet subs, and there were said to be
several close calls or even collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is described in the book ``Blind Man's Bluff,''
which describes many supersecret encounters and a spy operation in
which a U.S. sub tapped a Soviet underwater telephone cable in the
foggy, bleak and forbidding Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Rapid Sinking
</P>
<P>
   But Beach thinks that scenario is improbable. Whatever happened,
the Kursk was damaged in the bow and went down at a 60-degree
angle, very quickly and very steeply. Apparently the nuclear
reactor shut down, or so the Russians say.
</P>
<P>
   Vaden, now a civilian electrical contractor, remembers how
sometimes his own subs would temporarily go out of control. The
stern planes that control the angle of dive ``would go out of
whack,'' he said. ``You are so busy trying to get control you don't
think. ... But we trained hard. We trained for emergencies. We knew
our boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kursk, for whatever reason, went to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Beach said a damaged U.S. submarine can be assisted by a
deep-sea rescue vehicle, a kind of diving bell that can use an
escape hatch to rescue trapped crews.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors can't use the torpedo tubes to escape, Beach said.
``At that depth, using the tubes to escape would be certain
death,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Beach's view, there was speculation that the Russian
sailors might be able to escape from the vessel on their own and
float to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   British Royal Navy submarines are equipped with a kind of escape
mechanism that has been used in training up to a depth of 600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it hasn't been tried for real,'' British Navy spokesman
Jim Jenkin said. ``And their escape facility may be nothing like
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beaver of Jane's Information Group, an authoritative source
in the military and defense field, said he expects the news will be
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this submarine has a lot more damage than we think,
and I think there are probably already people dead from the impact
of the collision,'' he said. ``It seems to be more of a calamity
than the Russians are letting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaver said that if the submarine is fitted similarly to British
vessels, the crew would be able to make oxygen for themselves for
about a month, which means they probably would have enough to last
until a rescue could be mounted.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the Russian submarine was equipped with
such devices. The Kursk is among the Russian navy's newest vessels,
and presumably has the latest emergency equipment. The submarine
was commissioned in 1995 by then President Boris Yeltsin and is
among the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet. However,
maintenance and training standards in the Russian navy have
reportedly declined markedly in the last few years. According to
some reports, naval personnel have not even been paid in some
months.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no way to help, the crew of the trapped vessel will
surely die as the air is used up. ``As you get more and more carbon
dioxide and less oxygen,'' Beach said, ``you get sleepy. It takes
more and more of an effort to stay awake. Finally, you simply go to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaden hopes that doesn't happen. ``Maybe,'' the Cold War veteran
said, ``there is some way. Maybe the the U.S. Navy can help them
out. I hope so.''

KRAYZELBURG WINS 200 BACKSTROKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS  &UR; - &LR;  Swimmers at the world- class level are plumbers
trying to get more out of leaky faucets. Their time drops come in
maddening trickles, hundredths-of-a-second at a splash. Unless, of
course, the improvements dry up altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg isn't simply a world-class swimmer anymore,
he's a world record holder. That means every time the Studio City
resident goes to work, he's got a lot of people breathing over his
shoulder, fully expecting him to turn that trickle into a torrent.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming in the fish bowl that is the U.S. Olympic Trials caught
up to Krayzelburg Monday, though nobody in the water could. The
Trojan Swim Club standout won the 200-meter backstroke at the IUPUI
Natatorium in 1 minute, 57.31 seconds. That was a new Olympic
Trials record but well off his year-old world record of 1:55.87.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Peirsol, a 17-year-old from Irvine, finished second in
1:57.98. The senior-to-be at Newport Harbor High had set the
Olympic Trials mark (1:57.93) in Sunday's semifinals after having
handed Krayzelburg his first defeat in the event in three years at
a meet at USC last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest part right here,'' Peirsol said. ``It's
almost downhill from here. The pressure is off.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Peirsol to say. Like U.S. butterflyer Tom
Malchow and individual medley specialist Tom Dolan, Krayzelburg can
confirm that being the world record holder ``definitely adds a
little more pressure because everybody expects you to go out and
beat it every time you swim.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to come to terms with it,'' Krayzelburg said.
``You have to realize that maybe at this level, winning is more
important than a world record.''
</P>
<P>
   If sweeping the 100 and 200 in a stroke at these Trials was
easy, more swimmers would have done it. As it is, Krayzelburg, 24,
who won the 100 backstroke on Friday, is the only stroke specialist
so far to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moses set an American record in the 100 backstroke and
finished fourth in the 200; Kristy Kowal, who set an American
record in the 200 breaststroke Monday, was third in the 100; Jenny
Thompson, who lowered her own American record in the 100 freestyle,
didn't try to qualify for the 200. And so on it has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really encouraged that I was able to do it,'' Krayzelburg
said. ``I know I can do better in Sydney by a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Beard had been encouraged by her swims in the heats and
the semifinals of the 200-meter breaststroke. And yet the darling
of the 1996 Olympics knew everybody assumed she was done.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old wasn't so sure everybody wasn't right. The 1996
triple Olympic medalist was eighth in the 100 on Friday. The fact
she couldn't quite shake was that no female Olympian in the stroke
had made a second U.S. Olympic team team since Susan Rapp qualified
for a third in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Beard changed all that with a strong second 100 that left her
second in the 200, behind Kowal but ahead of the 100 winner,
16-year-old Megan Quann.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my 100, it was really hard for me to bring myself back
here and swim the 200,'' Beard said. ``I really tried to crank out
the third 50 and I was actually getting goose bumps the last 50, I
was getting so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   It meant a lot to Beard to earn a berth to Sydney and not just
because she will be reunited with her boyfriend, Ryk Neethling, a
distance swimming star from South Africa who attends Arizona with
Beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take `96 and times it by 100 and that's exactly how I'm
feeling,'' Beard said. ``This is nothing like `96. I didn't even
know what the Olympics were all about then. I was not really
expected to make it back. In the back of my mind I was thinking it
was going to be hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. and Hart High product Anthony Ervin made a sub-22
second 50 freestyle look really easy. Hall and Ervin, who train
together in Phoenix, clocked 21.91 and 21.92, respectively, to lead
tonight's eight finalists. Kevin Clements of Industry Hills
finished third in the 200 individual medley, missing an Olympic
berth by one spot and 1.7 seconds.

A NEW MEDIUM STRUGGLES WITH THE MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By VLAE KERSHNER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet coverage of the Republican convention didn't fully live
up to its promise, a new report says. Don't look for much of an
improvement this week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite laying over 6,600 miles of cable and the equivalent of
70,000 high-speed lines from Philadelphia, Web sites were neither
as popular nor as effective as they could have been, according to a
study for Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government Vanishing
Voter project. It's available at
 &UR; www.vanishingvoter.org. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PC Data Online ratings for major Web news sites were actually
down 14 percent the week of the the GOP convention, the study
noted. The four highest-rated sites were  &UR; msnbc.com, &LR; 
 &UR; cnn.com, nytimes.com and washingtonpost.com,  &LR; drawing slightly
fewer than 10 million users among them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study said, coverage was often disjointed and
technical glitches were widespread. Those are problems I
encountered again Monday, for example with the youth-oriented
 &UR; www.pseudo.com site,  &LR; which has had a makeover since the GOP
convention but still isn't very reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Anything really new in L.A. this week?
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC offered a video feed called ``From the Streets'' with
highlights from the demonstrations outside the convention hall.
That's an improvement _ the major media had little in the way of
video or photos from the demonstrations in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the coverage is similar to two weeks ago.
No surprise. If the major news organizations tried to beef up their
coverage this week, they would run the risk of heightening
suspicions they are slanted toward the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Those suspicions were voiced this week on  &UR; www.grassroots.com &LR; 
by Christopher Buckley, admittedly a GOP partisan. He argues that
the New York Times' political coverage is slanted against the
Republicans. Hardly a new argument, but he has some recent examples
of coverage of George W. Bush's convention speech that will get the
blood boiling among the distrust-the-media crowd.
</P>
<P>
   DIALING DOWN THE CLINTONS: Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's
convention speeches got a lower rating than any Republican
convention address, according to an instant meter survey.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC/SpeakOut.com survey displays a dial with a scale of 1
to 100, initially set at a neutral level of 50. Users move the dial
to to register agreement or disagreement with the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bill and Hillary Clinton scored an average of 52 last
night. By comparison, George W. Bush rated a 55. John McCain has
the highest score so far, a 62.
</P>
<P>
   The scores are not a scientific sample of all voters, but they
are adjusted so that the gender and party affiliation of the users
match those of the voting public.
</P>
<P>
   WAGGING THE DOG: Also on San Francisco-based  &UR; grassroots.com &LR; 
are Emil Guillermo's audio clips from a Santa Monica party for
so-called Blue Dog Democrats (the party's more conservative wing).
He asks various partygoers what the difference is between the blue
dogs and yellow dog Democrats, and their colorful attempts to
explain will leave you scratching your ... head.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton savored what he called ``this
moment of unprecedented good fortune'' and, in a nostalgic and
self-congratulatory valedictory Monday night, implored Americans to
protect his achievements by electing Vice President Al Gore to
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the very best decisions of my entire life,'' he said,
was ``asking Al Gore to be my partner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton made no direct mention of Gov. George W. Bush
during his address on the opening night of the 43rd Democratic
National Convention, he scoffed at the suggestion by the Republican
nominee at his convention two weeks ago that the nation had
stumbled into prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say _ and I'm sure you've heard this somewhere in
the last few days _ the progress of these eight years was just some
sort of accident that we just coasted along, let me be clear:
America's success was not a matter of chance,'' Clinton said in a
swan song that lasted about 40 minutes. ``It was a matter of
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no allusions to the personal scandals he has
weathered; at an church last week the president said his
transgressions should not tar Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton catalogued the high points of his entire two
terms, the longest presidential tenure of a Democrat since Franklin
D. Roosevelt, who died in 1945 after 12 years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also tried to transfer his popularity among the
Democratic faithful to Gore, who has had a difficult time rousing
his party. Clinton, who has said the election of Gore as his
successor is crucial to protecting his own legacy, offered this
testament: In the most challenging moments, when we faced the most
difficult issues of war and peace, of whether to take on some
powerful special interests, he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Linking Gore to the economic good times, Clinton said of his
ambitious plan to cut the deficit in 1993: ``It passed by a single
vote in both houses. In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the
deciding vote. Not a single Republican supported it. Their leaders
said our plan would increase the deficit, kill jobs, and give us a
one-way ticket to recession.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for effect: ``Time has not been kind to their
predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's entrance to the hall built to a crescendo. As the
crowd roared in anticipation, a camera followed him as he strode
briskly down a corridor toward the stage for his moment of triumph.
When he said his first ``thank you'' to settle the adoring crowd, a
chant broke out, ``Thank you, Bill!''
</P>
<P>
   And at times the speech seemed as much an argument for yet
another campaign as a celebration of things past. Occasionally, the
crowd broke out into cries of ``Let's go, Bill!'' as if he were the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton was trying to hand off his party to Gore, the
political production Monday night at the Staples Center here lacked
the end-of-an-era emotions of Ronald Reagan's farewell to his
convention in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   That was in part because, Clinton's wife, Hillary, was front and
center speaking in her new role as Senate candidate. In her speech,
Mrs. Clinton not only commended her husband and blessed the
nomination of Gore but sought to bolster her own bid for the Senate
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After calling on the public to ``continue America's progress''
by electing Gore and his running-mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Mrs.
Clinton turned to her own race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide
whether I'll have the privilege of serving them in the United
States Senate,'' she said. ``But I will always be profoundly
grateful to all of you and to the American people for the last
eight years. Really, the most important thing that I can say
tonight is thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Republican convention two weeks ago, which
was choreographed to a second-by-second precision, the Democratic
gathering _ typical for the party _ had the untamed feel of street
theater. Clinton did not reach the rostrum until close to 11 p.m.
EDT, nearly 25 minutes past schedule, and missed most of the
prime-time television audience. In typical Clinton fashion, the
president, one of his aides said, did not finish tinkering with the
address until about 9:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   During a year in which Clinton has surrendered the political
stage to his vice president and to his wife _ only grudgingly, his
friends and advisers say _ the event Monday night was a prime-time
reminder of how the president dominates his party as a colossal
political and oratorical force.
</P>
<P>
   And to some delegates, it was a reminder that Gore faces a
daunting challenge in trying to inspire voters as skillfully as
Clinton _ who is widely regarded as the party's most adroit
campaigner since John F. Kennedy, who was nominated at the party's
convention in Los Angeles in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring for Clinton underscored a daunting problem for
Gore: the more powerful that Clinton was in his speech, the less
likely that the vice president could pull off a climactic
acceptance speech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sadness to this evening,'' said Cheri
Hamilton, a delegate from Kentucky who covered herself in
Clinton-Gore buttons. ``They have been a good team, Clinton and
Gore. Gore will work well with Lieberman. But I'm really going to
miss Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grizzard, a delegate from Florida who wore a Clinton '92
T-shirt over his dress shirt and tie, said, ``I would vote for
Clinton again if I could but, unfortunately, the Constitution says
I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere on the convention floor were signs reflecting the
crowd's deep affection for the Clintons. A woman, bopping to the
music, a smile plastered to her face, waved a sign that proclaimed,
``Iowa Loves Clinton.'' The same sign could be seen in the Kansas
section, and in Utah, Florida, Indiana, New Mexico _ and elsewhere.
The New York contingent hoisted dozens of ``Hillary'' posters,
waving them madly and passing a few to delegates in the Colorado
section.
</P>
<P>
   Angie Graves, 24, a delegate from Fayettville, Ark., was
particularly moved by Monday night's program because the president
is from her home state. ``This is all very sad,'' she said. ``He
has been ours, and he is leaving office. We are hopeful for Al
Gore, but he just isn't ours.''
</P>
<P>
   When short excerpts of past convention speeches by Democratic
presidents was shown on overhead screens, delegates responded with
warm applause for John F. Kennedy, and polite applause for Jimmy
Carter. But the moment Clinton's face filled the screen, the hall
exploded in cheers. It was impossible not to notice that the sound
fell slightly but unmistakably when a clip of Gore followed.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation for an apparent lack of excitement about
Gore among some of the 4,339 delegates is that polls show he is
trailing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Clinton faced one of the most precarious political
challenges of his career: to offer a stout endorsement of Gore that
will spur Democrats _ and the American public _ to rally around the
vice president. But he also had to take care to leave Gore some
room to declare his independence.
</P>
<P>
   He devoted far more attention to Gore than to Mrs. Clinton, whom
he praised for her work with children and for being ``a great first
lady,'' who will ``always be there for the families of New York and
America.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of his address, Clinton reprieved what he considered
the triumphs of his administration, from cutting taxes to cracking
down on crime to cleaning the environment to making the world more
secure. He did not mention any of the failures of his tenure,
notably his wife's campaign to overhaul the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the slogan of his acceptance speech four years ago, he
declared, ``My fellow Americans, tonight we can say with gratitude
and humility: We built our bridge to the 21st century. We crossed
that bridge together. And we're not going back.''
</P>
<P>
   The president drew one of the biggest ovations when he recalled
Ronald Reagan's famous refrain from 1980. ``My fellow Americans,
are we better off today than we were eight years ago?'' he asked.
``You bet we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that the new ticket would build on his foundation,
Clinton said: ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will keep our prosperity
going by paying down the debt, investing in education and health
care and providing family tax cuts that we can afford. Now that
stands in stark contrast to the position of our Republican
friends.'' He offered what sounded like a point-by-point rebuttal
of Bush's acceptance speech two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's presence Monday night could not help remind
viewers of the scandals of the Clinton administration that the Bush
campaign is intent on keeping alive. For some Democrats, Clinton's
departure from Los Angeles on Tuesday could not be too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois put it at a news
conference Monday, ``We've got to get Bill Clinton _ and I'm going
to say this quite frankly and quite bluntly _ out of town as
quickly as possible and get to these issues and not make our
convention some referendum on what occurred in the impeachment
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was clearly an emotional crest for Clinton and his
stalwart supporters. Advisers to Clinton said he was choking up as
he rehearsed his lines earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the address, Clinton, who turns 54 on
Saturday, harkened back to his roots in Arkansas. ``Fifty-four
years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm to a young widow
in a small Southern town. America gave me the chance to live my
dreams. I have tried to give you a better chance to live yours.
Now, with hair grayer and wrinkles deeper, but with the same
optimism and hope I brought to the work I love eight years ago, my
heart is filled with gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the objective of pumping up Gore for four nights, the
Democrats sought to portray the Republicans as staging a masquerade
of moderation at their convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker stirred up the Democratic faithful by
upbraiding the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans put on quite a spectacle in Philadelphia,''
said Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the convention and the
party's most prolific fund-raiser. ``They pretended they were
tolerant. They pretended they were moderates. They pretended they
cared about education, health care and the environment. Let's face
it, they pretended they were Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California welcomed the delegates to his
state, saying, ``Here in the home of the film industry, we've seen
the previews of the Republicans' movie: `George and Dick's
Excellent Adventure.' I don't think it's gonna make it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Tobias, the Democratic Party's treasurer, said: ``The
Democratic leadership celebrates diversity, not for show _ for
real. They have made my life and the lives of millions of other gay
and lesbian Americans immeasurably better.''
</P>
<P>
   On this first day, there was not quite the harmony that so
marked the Republican convention. Rep. Loretta Sanchez of
California rebuffed an offer to address the delegates, saying she
did not want it to appear as if she had been motivated by
``personal gain'' when, under pressure from the Gore campaign, she
agreed to move a fund-raiser from the Playboy mansion.

   LOS ANGELES _ Acknowledging her own personal and political
difficulties as first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton last night
thanked Americans for their support ``in good times and bad,'' and
then officially made the case for her own political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives, and soon
we'll be starting a new one,'' said Hillary Clinton to the adoring
cheers of the crowd in her high-profile speech at the Democratic
National Convention last night in the Staples Center. ``For me, it
will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have
the privilege of serving them in the United States Senate.`
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton took the stage at the Staples Center to the
sounds of ``New York, New York'' and a prolonged standing ovation
from the crowd who jammed the aisles to watch. It took several
minutes for her to control the cheers delegates sang along with the
tune, while wave after wave of ``Hillary'' and ``It takes a
Senator'` signs bobbed across the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady then took on the task of proving her own
credentials as as a child advocate, much as reminding voters of
those of her husband _ and his vice president, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes in November are the biggest for the littlest among
us,'` she said. ``We've made great progress in the last eight
years, but we still have a lot of work to do.'`
</P>
<P>
   She took direct jabs at the GOP team of Texas Governor George W.
Bush and his vice presidential running mate Dick Cheney, playing
off Bush's mantra to ``leave no child behind.'' And she took aim at
the charge repeated by speaker after speaker in the GOP convention
_ that her husband's administration had ``squandered`' its
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not squander our children's future,'' she said to
cheers. ``Let's elect leaders who will leave no child behind.
Leaders who talk the talk, and walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also refused to back down from the theme which was
the basis of her best-selling book _ one which Republicans have
lambasted _ that communities must take responsibility for children.
</P>
<P>
   For children to suceed, she said, ``It takes responsible parents
who put their own children first. It takes all of us -teachers,
workers, business owners, community leaders and people of faith,''
she said. `You know, I still believe it takes a village.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate candidate also frankly confronted some of
her past political difficulties. ``You may remember I had a few
ideas about health care. I've learned a few lessons since then,''
she said. ``But I haven't given up on the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   She urged continued work ``to insure millions more kids through
the Children's Health Insurance Program,'' and passage of a
Patient's Bill of Rights to ``provide access to affordable health
care for every single child and family in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Mrs. Clinton got a major boost from her
husband during his primetime speech.
</P>
<P>
   While praising her effort, the President noted that his wife has
worked for 30 years as an advocate for children's causes. The
President said that throughout his Administration, `she became a
full time advocate for her lifetime cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has always been there for all our kids,` he said. `She'll
always be there for the families of New York and America.''

 RAGE AGAINST THE CONVENTION  &HT;     By NEVA CHONIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As President Clinton spoke inside the Staples
Center Monday night, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and
charged on horseback to disperse an unruly crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The altercation broke out as thousands were leaving a concert by
the rock band Rage Against the Machine in a protest area near the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Police herded protesters to the far end of the area and away
from the convention after a running battle along a fence directly
across from the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired at protesters after they threw pieces of concrete
and water bottles, sprayed police with ammonia and fired steel
balls and rocks from slingshots. Protesters with bandanna-covered
faces lit fires in the concert area.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation initially involved about 300 people out of a
crowd of 8,000, but then spread as more officers rushed to the
scene. The ground around them was littered with rocks, broken
bottles and sticks thrown over the fence from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton began speaking inside the convention
center, pepper spray wafted over the crowd outside, stinging noses
and throats.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates and members of the media were caught up in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation took place beneath a huge TV screen outside of
the Staples Center displaying a live video image of the convention
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, 10 people were arrested when police and
protesters clashed near the center as about 200 environmental
demonstrators blocked an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear used batons to push back the demonstrators
from the intersection before making their arrests. About 400 others
watched from the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what a police state looks like,'' one shouted.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was aimed at Occidental Petroleum's plans to begin
exploratory drilling near an Indian reservation in Colombia.
Environmental activists have called on Vice President Al Gore to
sell his family's Occidental stock, valued at up to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, hundreds staged a ``March of Corporate Shame''
through downtown Los Angeles in which some called for campaign
finance reform, and others condemned alleged corporate abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was to culminate with a concert outside the
convention by Rage Against the Machine, a popular rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to beat, beat back, the corporate attack,''
chanted protesters, some of whom wore pig costumes to symbolize
corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting police, demonstrators used their own bullhorn to
taunt officers and danced in front of them to the beat of a drum. A
pungent odor permeated the air from the vinegar demonstrators
poured on cloths to withstand tear gas, although none was fired.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a line of officers charged, knocking people down.
Some yelled, ``We're nonviolent!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are acting in a very aggressive way,'' said Medea
Benjamin, a Green Party activist and founding director of the San
Francisco-based activist group Global Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Police defended their response.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were here, you saw there was a lot of restraint and
that all the training has paid off,'' said Sgt. Michael Barela, who
was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested and handcuffed the 10 protesters on charges of
failure to disperse. With their hands bound, they chanted, ``Al
Gore cut your ties, stop the drilling, stop the lies.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Gore has been dogged by protests of his
connection to Occidental. His father, the late Sen. Albert Gore
Sr., served on Occidental's board, owned stock in the company and
was chief executive of a subsidiary. His family inherited the stock
when he died in December.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have urged Gore to divest his family of that stock.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has granted Occidental the right to
conduct exploratory drilling a few miles outside the legal
boundaries of the U'wa Indian reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The U'wa believe oil exploration would bring violence and
destroy their culture. In 1997, the group threatened mass suicide
to discourage drilling in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore bills himself as an environmentalist, but he's not
putting his money where his mouth is,'' said Michael Mossberg, a
protester from Seattle. ``What I'd want him to do today is use his
power to get Occidental to stop drilling on U'wa land.''

COWBOYS' ERIK WILLIAMS TO END 4-WEEK HOLDOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ In what seemed only a matter of time,
Dallas Cowboys offensive tackle Erik Williams has ended his
four-week holdout and will be at Midwestern State University for
the final four days of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys reported Monday night that Williams was making the
120-mile drive from the Metroplex to Wichita Falls along with
teammate Leon Lett. He is expected to be on the MSU practice field
Tuesday afternoon with the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as Thursday, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said that he
would not trade Williams, 31, who probably will not be fined for
his absence, although Jones has not been willing to address that
issue one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   According to league rules, Williams could be fined $5,000 a day
for as long as he was away from the team.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also saves another $1.6 million by coming back, as he
would have had to pay the Cowboys $800,000 of already paid signing
bonus money in each of the next two seasons if he retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news,'' Jones was quoted as saying on
dallascowboys.com, the team's official Web site. ``Erik can really
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' return also ensures the Cowboys will have the
offensive line they were counting on at the beginning of the
season. Though the Cowboys are comfortable with the group they have
been playing with the past few weeks, they have said all along that
Williams was one of their best five offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 0-3 this preseason, played Sunday night with only
one offensive lineman _ left tackle Flozell Adams _ starting at his
projected position. Solomon Page has replaced Williams at right
tackle but now probably will move back to right guard.
</P>
<P>
   With Williams back in the fold, Page can move back to right
guard, which would likely move Jorge Diaz to the bench as a solid
veteran backup.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Williams has missed so much time, it is unlikely
that he will play against the Broncos on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, he might get into some action against the Rams on Aug.
24 and almost certainly should be ready for the season opener Sept.
3.

CLINTON OPENS CONVENTION WITH ROUSING DEFENSE OF HIS
EIGHT-YEAR  TERM
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTH 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton opened the Democratic convention
Monday night with a ringing defense of his eight years in office
and a warning that booming times could all end unless Al Gore is
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``To serve as president at the dawn of a new era in human
history has been an honor, a privilege and a joy,'' Clinton said in
an emotional speech on the opening night of the Democrat's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done everything I could to empower the American people
... to turn our country around and move us forward together. But
the best is yet to be _ if we make the right choices.''
</P>
<P>
   That choice is Gore, Clinton said, calling the vice president
``a profoundly good man,'' who throughout the eight years of his
administration has been ``the greatest champion of working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that brought delegates in the Staples Center to
their feet time after time, the president also took direct aim at
GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush, who suggested Clinton
had little to do with the country's growing prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you heard it said sometime in the past two weeks that
the progress of the last eight years was an accident, that we just
coasted along,'' Clinton said. ``Let me be clear: America's success
was not a matter of chance, it was a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night was Clinton's last hurrah, his final opportunity to
address as president a Democratic Party he led out of the political
wilderness with his 1992 win over President George Bush. After
their prime-time speeches, Clinton and his wife, Hillary, prepared
to depart Los Angeles, leaving the convention to Gore, the party's
hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton didn't leave quietly. Time and again in his
41-minute speech, the president worked to show that ``the stars
have never shined more brightly on any nation, at any time,
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made it clear that any success was in spite of the
Republicans in Congress, not because of itthem &LR; , as Bush has
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their leaders said (the 1993 budget) would increase the
deficit, kill jobs and give us a one-way ticket to recession,''
Clinton said. ``Time has not been kind to those predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans said then they would not be held responsible
for the results of our economic policies. I hope the American
people will take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans ``face a fundamental choice,'' Clinton warned. ``Are
we going to keep this progress and prosperity going?''
</P>
<P>
   With Gore as president, the country will be ready to deal with
the different challenges a booming economy can bring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've ever known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes can affect
Americans' daily lives,'' the president said. ``I think we need
someone in office at the dawn of the 21st century who really
understands the future.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he said, Gore and Lieberman will continue the
fight for civil rights and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this may be the most important of all,'' Clinton said.
``They believe the people you're buying your soft drinks and
popcorn from here at the Staples Center deserve the same chance
they have to send their children to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is only the third president since the end of World War
II to make his farewells to a party after having served two full
terms. The others were both Republicans _ Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
succeeded Truman in 1953, and Ronald Reagan, who ousted Democrat
Jimmy Carter and took office in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   For Hillary Rodham Clinton, her run for a New York Senate seat
was almost an afterthought in her speech last night. Speaking right
before her husband, she was interrupted by wild applause as she
talked about the need to provide for the nation's children and
looked back with nostalgia at eight years of good times and
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for giving me the most extraordinary opportunity to
work here at home and around the world on the issues that matter
most to children, families and women,'' Hillary Clinton said.
``Thank you for your faith and support in good times _ and in bad.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the honor and privilege
of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Echo Across Convention Floor
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message was echoed Monday by a partisan parade of
Democratic politicians who credited Clinton and Gore with
everything good that's taken place in the country over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in education, a dropping crime rate, fewer teen
pregnancies and continuing job growth: To giddy Democratic
delegates, it's all part of the Clinton-Gore legacy and a blueprint
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the story they came to Los Angeles to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the convention's opening night was ``Progress and
Prosperity,'' and the Democrats brought out a lineup of regular
people who were winners from the past eight years: a couple who
bought their first home, a man who started his own business,
another who has seen the steel plant he works in expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stories like these are commonplace,'' said New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen. ``In Al Gore, we will have a president ... to keep
the prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing that theme, thousands of delegates and guests waved
signs declaring ``America: Better Than Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat mood as Clinton's hour approached was characterized
by Steve Alari, who sat near the front of the hall holding a huge
sign that said, ``Thank you, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to thank him for all the years of service as we watch
him pass the torch,'' said Alari, a delegate from Long Beach.
``Look at the economy and what he's done for people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Rankin, a steel worker from nearby Carson, said
Democrats were united in their sentiments at the convention:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need eight more years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein,
co-chairs of the convention, pounded home the theme of a
Democratic-led prosperity in their brief remarks to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned around the economic lives of American working
people,'' Feinstein said. ``Unemployment is at the lowest level in
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer turned around Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican
convention two weeks ago, arguing that Democrats have made their
most of the last eight years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their chance and they failed,'' she said. ``We had
our chance and we led.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Gray Davis, the host governor, also got his moment in
the spotlight _ and a standing ovation. Standing under the massive
backdrop proclaiming ``America 2000,'' Davis said he represents ``a
state that personifies the new moderate direction in American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to put on an act to appear like the party of
compassion,'' he said. ``We are the real thing. That's why
California is Al Gore country.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone echoed the good feeling coming out of the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   In the streets near the Staples Center, police clashed with
demonstrators for the first time. When environmental protesters
blocked a busy downtown intersection Monday afternoon, officers in
riot gear removed them and arrested 10 people for failing to
disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Police also were kept busy with a variety of other marches
through the city, but there were no reports of serious problems.

 ANALYSIS: SUPPORT FOR CLINTON UNWAVERING AS HE TRANSFERS POWER  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The man from Hope isn't going away. And the
Democratic faithful couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Bill Clinton addressed a Democratic convention,
delegates were so anxious for him to leave they gave him an ovation
when he uttered the words: ``In closing ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, had Clinton decided to defy the Constitution and
seek a third term, there is little doubt that delegates would have
given him their unanimous support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-four years ago this week, I was born in a summer storm
to a young widow in a small southern town,'' Clinton said 40
minutes into what some believed would be a farewell opus.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Clinton's stealing the spotlight from Vice
President Al Gore's convention. Indeed, Clinton strode the podium
in dramatic fashion, emerging from a televised stroll through the
back corridors of the Staples Center as piano music played and the
delegate's roared in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton could hardly have done more to share the glory. From
reminding American's about Gore's tie-breaking vote to implement
his first budget in 1993, to declaring Gore a ``profoundly good
man,'' Clinton did everything that could be asked of a political
patron.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, a reporter asked President Eisenhower if he could think
of a single major idea advanced by his vice President, Richard
Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give me a week, I might think of one,'' Eisenhower
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a single sentence, credited Gore with fighting for
welfare reform, protecting the environment, closing the digital
divide, and creating millions of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes and scientific
breakthroughs affect Americans' daily lives,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as it was a full-throated endorsement of his vice
president, the speech was also a celebration of the peace and
prosperity the nation has enjoyed during his administration, and a
pointed rebuttal to the Republican allegation that he had little to
do with it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a speech that articulated more clearly than any he has
yet delivered where he sees his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton boasted of 22 million new jobs, the elimination of
deficits, rising wages, new teachers, improved test scores, child
care tax credits, reduced crime, improved medicine, cleaner
environment, peace in Northern Ireland, and the expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, I have waited over 30 years to see my
country once again in a position to build the future of our dreams
for our children,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember the standard the Republicans used to have for
whether a party should continue in office _ my fellow Americans,
are we better off today than we were 8 years ago?'' Clinton asked.
``You bet we are.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the most comprehensive initiative of his
presidency, a plan to restructure the health care system, was
rejected by a Democratic Congress. And no matter that Clinton is
the first president since Andrew Johnson in the 1860s to be
impeached .
</P>
<P>
   Few Democrats really believe he will go down in history, as one
of the greatest presidents ever, as Gore once said of him.
Nevertheless, Clinton stood before 5,000 adoring Democrats Monday
as nothing less than their political savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy is brilliant,'' marveled Bob Mulholland, a long time
consultant to the California Democratic Party. ``Clinton taught
Democrats that it's more important to be in office than outside,
yelling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come from the same wing of the party as Bill
Clinton,'' said Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, the liberal
former Assembly speaker. ``But let me tell you, Bill Clinton saved
the party. We were becoming an irrelevant party.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton won the party's nomination in 1992, Democrats had
lost three consecutive presidential elections and had been shut out
of the White House for 20 of the previous 24 years. Clinton took a
decidedly centrist posture, grabbing issues like welfare reform,
crime and a balanced budget, which had long been Republican
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went straight up against Democratic orthodoxy,'' said Al
From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group which
Clinton helped found and tugged Democrats from their liberal
moorings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton redefined the party as a centrist party,'' From said,
noting that he spawned similar political success in Great Britain
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton has really been the modernizer of progressive
politics, not only in this country, but around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never said what will come when his term ends five
months from now, but it is hard to imagine him fading quickly from
the political spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think think it is going to be much more difficult for him to
leave political life,'' observed former President Jimmy Carter, who
called his post presidential life ``the best part of my
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that President Clinton is
much more of a political animal than I am,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Clinton accepted his party's nomination saying
he still believes in a place called Hope. There is no doubt that he
still believes in politics, and the party still believes in him.

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Injuries are part of football. Some are
just more of a hardship on the team than others.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys received a major scare against the Oakland
Raiders on Sunday when Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, Dallas' leading
receiver last season, sprained his left thumb while trying to make
a diving catch on the Cowboys' first offensive play.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail was done for the night, although X-rays were negative. He
will be evaluated day to day.
</P>
<P>
   So, who could the Cowboys least afford to lose this season?
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind the depth chart, i.e., who is backing up whom, and
what can be done to adjust the game plan for fill-in players for
the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' ``Top Five Indispensables,'' although everyone
seems to come up with a different list when asked, are: 1) Jackie
Harris, 2) Joey Galloway, 3) Ryan McNeil, 4) Troy Aikman and 5) Dat
Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the top three has yet to appear in a
regular-season game for the Cowboys, Harris, Galloway and McNeil
were acquired during the off-season to fill major holes. Aikman
runs the offense. Nguyen sets the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons the Cowboys can ill afford to lose these players:
</P>
<P>
   _ Harris is a Jay Novacek-type tight end. He's a perfect fit for
this Jack Reilly/Ernie Zampese offense. Disregard that he has only
four preseason catches for 37 yards. He, obviously, is being saved
for the games that count. Harris can split a zone and work the
middle of the field as well as the best possession receiver, and he
does it at 6-foot-4, 250 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   David LaFleur, a three-year starter, is more of a blocker at
6-7, 272. A big part of this offense is to use both tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   _ Galloway averaged 15.7 yards per catch in his first five NFL
seasons at Seattle, with 5,688 all-purpose yards in 71 NFL games.
He also returns punts. But it's his ability to catch and make
defenders miss that makes him nearly irreplaceable. In the Cowboys'
timing-route offense, he's becoming automatic on the quick turnouts
and slants. No one is better on the go routes.
</P>
<P>
   James McKnight (August 1999 knee surgery) played Sunday night
for the first time since December 1998 with Seattle. He is the
likely replacement for Galloway or Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   _ McNeil, a corner who defends ``and'' tackles, has the savvy
and confidence of an eight-year veteran with 91 NFL starts. That's
79 more than Kareem Larrimore, Mario Edwards, Duane Hawthorne,
Dwayne Goodrich and Charlie Williams put together. Williams, who
has all 12 of those starts, is sidelined with a staph infection
following off-season knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aikman finally has a backup _ Randall Cunningham _ who can win
games and force opposing defensive coordinators to tear up game
plans if Aikman is unable to play. Still, in the NFL, you don't win
without your No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nguyen is more than even the Cowboys' coaching staff imagined
when training camp began. He never leaves the field now. He was
supposed to be in a battle with Barron Wortham, who started at
middle linebacker in Super Bowl XXXIV for the Tennessee Titans, but
Wortham has been injured and Nguyen has been making plays _
instinctively, that's his game _ and making the calls for the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether this list is accurate or not, the Cowboys can
only hope they never have to know.

TWO `WONDERWOMEN' FOIL TAPPIN'S COMEBACK EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ By most swimming standards, Ashley Tappin has had
an exceptional meet in this _ as she calls it _ her ``third
comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 100-meter butterfly last week, in her first
Olympic trials after undergoing rotator cuff surgery, Tappin
lowered her personal best by nearly a full second. She finished
third.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday night, at the age of 26, she equaled her best-ever
time in the 100 freestyle. And finished third again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look at them,'' instructed Tappin, who won a relay gold
medal at the 1992 Olympics. ``Look at their body structure,
compared to mine. They have, maybe, 20 pounds on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the luck of the draw. I just happen to be swimming
against two people who are stronger than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger, stronger, faster.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in these U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, those
two wonderwomen at large, Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres, led the
race to the wall Monday night. In a churning fashion that was
impressively similar to their one-two finish in the 100 butterfly,
Thompson shattered the American record in the 100 freestyle in
54.07 seconds, with Torres one wake behind.
</P>
<P>
   Tappin's 55.28 got her only third, with a spot on the 400 free
relay team as a consolation prize. Veteran and four-time gold
medalist Amy Van Dyken could do no better than fourth, but she,
too, will head to Sydney on the sprint relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in this same Indiana University Natatorium pool,
no American records were broken during the selection meet.
</P>
<P>
   In this meet, eight American records have fallen. In addition,
17 Olympic trials records have been set.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Thompson in the American record book Monday night was
19-year-old Kristy Kowal, a native of Reading, Pa., who swims for
the University of Georgia. After finishing a heartbroken third in
the 100-meter breaststroke in 1996 and again last week, Kowal won
the 200 breaststroke in 2:24.75.
</P>
<P>
   Her time eclipsed Anita Nall's 2:25.35 American record set in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard after the 100 to get over that,'' a happy
and relieved Kowal said. ``People say lightning doesn't strike
twice, but it did to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew that this was my last shot to make the team. I
think I started crying as I got near the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200-meter backstroke finals, Lenny Krayzelburg of
Hollywood, Calif., set a trials record and made it a sweep of the
men's backstroke events. Krayzelburg, who set the existing world
record (1:55.87) in the event 12 months ago, swam a meet-record
1:57.31 with the jingling of his father's tambourine ringing in his
ears _ and he promptly pronounced himself displeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have won, but I was a little disappointed with my
time,'' said Krayzelburg, who confessed much the same thing after
he won the 100 backstroke. ``I don't know what's going on with my
200-meter backstroke. I'm just struggling to find my perfect
stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Peirsol, 17, who set a trials record in the semis,
finished second in 1:57.98.
</P>
<P>
   In the night's remaining final, 1996 Olympic gold medalist Tom
Dolan of Arlington, Va., won the men's 200-meter individual medley
in 2:00.81.
</P>
<P>
   Austin resident Ron Karnaugh, a 1992 Olympian attempting a
comeback at age 34, finished fourth. Karnaugh became one of the
tragic stories of the '92 Games when his father died of a heart
attack during the opening ceremonies in the Olympic Stadium.
Karnaugh competed _ and finished sixth _ six days later.
</P>
<P>
   In these trials, meanwhile, the story has been the two rival
wonderwomen, Thompson and Torres. Amid the hype surrounding their
rematch and the ongoing stories about their frosty relationship and
the curious training program that they share, Thompson felt pleased
that she was able to keep the wheels on long enough to sprint to
Monday night's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt proud of the way I turned that around and was able to
maintain my composure,'' said the Menlo Park, Calif., resident. ``I
was really pleased to get a win in such a high-profile situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It can't hurt for Sydney, she acknowledged, where a
Thompson-Torres showdown in the sprints with reigning world record
holdess Inge de Bruijn of The Netherlands could be the highlights
of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who was clocked in 54.62 Monday night, was not pleased
with her race and noted that she was swimming faster just three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs gave out at the 75-meter mark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, whose legs were beginning to cramp, excused herself and
headed back to the warmdown area. Thompson, relaxed and secure, a
far cry from the defeated jangle of nerves that she was in 1996,
allowed her 3-year-old niece to join her at the interview table.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl's name, Thompson said without blushing, is
Sydney. nn

FOUR-TEAM DEAL TO BRING EISLEY, BARROS AND CURLEY TO MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Relatively quiet since a flurry of Draft Day trades,
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban played the lead role in a
four-team, nine-player deal agreed upon Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban expects the deal to be consummated Tuesday after gaining
approval from the NBA. Before the deal, the only thing the
Mavericks had done after the start of the free-agent signing period
was sign their own free agents: Gary Trent, Hubert Davis and Greg
Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs pick up guard Howard Eisley from Utah, guard Dana
Barros from Boston and forward Bill Curley from Golden State, Cuban
confirmed. Eisley is a safe bet to be on the roster opening night,
while the Mavericks might only be a stopping-off point for Barros
and Curley.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks will send center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams and
guard Robert Pack to Boston, and center Bruno Sundov to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Boston also gets $3 million in cash from
the Mavs, plus a conditional first-round draft pick from Utah. The
Jazz receive Donyell Marshall from Golden State. The Warriors land
Danny Fortson from Boston and Adam Keefe from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Though the trade for the Mavs is their first since the
free-agency period began Aug. 1, Donnie Nelson said Cuban has been
working behind the scenes trying to broker a major deal. And Nelson
expects this deal to be just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in, and a part of, a bulk of the deals that have
gone down this summer,'' said Nelson, the Mavs director of player
personnel and assistant coach. ``And we'll continue to be active,
I'm pretty sure about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal for the Mavs is the sign-and-trade for
Eisley. A backup to John Stockton in Utah the last five seasons,
Eisley is expected to push Mavs incumbent point guard Steve Nash
for the starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Eisley agreed to sign with the Mavs last week for the team's
$2.25 million exception after negotiations with the Jazz fell
apart. Utah offered Eisley a five-year deal worth $20 million,
while Eisley was asking for $30 million over six years.
</P>
<P>
   Had Eisley signed with the Mavs for the exception, Utah would
have lost him without compensation. Instead, the Jazz signed Eisley
to a multiyear deal, starting at $4.25 million yearly. Eisley, 27,
averaged 8.6 points and 4.2 assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   Barros, a Boston College product, has played for three teams in
an 11-year career. Cuban added that at least one team has shown
interest in Barros, leaving the possibility open for another trade.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said Curley, a 6-9 five-year veteran, also from Boston
College, could be ``serviceable backup center'' who is ``smart, can
shoot it and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of the often-injured Pack and Williams had been a
goal of Cuban's this summer. The two players never really made an
impact with the Mavs, spending most of their time on the injured
list.
</P>
<P>
   By working the sign-and-trade for the Eisley, the Mavs keep
their middle-class exceptions for this year and next. Nelson said
the next year's exception is expected to be around $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big things that we gained out of this was our
exception this year and our exception next year,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who said the team still hopes to find a backup center
for the $2.25 exception, praised Cuban for his ability to make
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   On draft night, Cuban helped put together deals that landed
rookies Courtney Alexander, Donnell Harvey and Eduardo Najera, in
addition to the Mavs pick, Etan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really been able to pick up this stuff quickly,'' Nelson
said. ``I admire what he's done with the team since he's been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the completion of the four-team trade, the Mavs would have
17 players under contract. The NBA allows 12 on the active roster
and up to three on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Others rumored to be on the Mavs' trading block are Cedric
Ceballos and Shawn Bradley. nn

   LOS ANGELES _ There could be no more irresistible political
farewell. Like the flawed hero of his own Hollywood movie,
President Bill Clinton prepared to address the Democratic Party
faithful Monday night on a wave of high emotion, rhetorical
magnetism, mixed feelings about his glaring personal shortcomings,
and extravagant praise for the man who would succeed him, Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the balmy, dream-fuelled Southern California that he
has made his spiritual home every bit as much as Arkansas or the
White House, Clinton could play to his favorite audience of movie
stars, political wheeler-dealers, philanthropic billionaires and
party fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, over the weekend, he had been reduced to tears by the
generous tributes of the Hollywood glitterati. Now it was his turn
to return the favor, and use his considerable charisma and
rhetorical skill to propel the Democrats forward and stir their
excitement about the new race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give Al Gore and Joe Lieberman eight years and you will
see that the best is yet to be,'' Clinton told a group of party
donors at a brunch meeting _ the line he was widely expected to
take on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Los Angeles is Clinton's town, it is hardly Gore's. The
flighty, fiercely competitive, morally ambiguous atmosphere may be
a West Coast mirror of the Clinton White House, but it doesn't suit
the earnest, buttoned-down, somewhat prudish temperament of the
Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the Emerald City, it will inescapably seem that the Wizard of
Oz is handing over to the Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Gore and the Clintons, both Bill and
Hillary, has been palpable and much remarked upon ever since they
entered the White House eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past few days, as the Clintons have coasted
gleefully from the Hollywood Hills to the Malibu beachfront to be
feted and showered with attention at every turn, the Gore camp has
had to worry about being upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's speeches were expected
to be ``amazingly gracious'' about the vice president. But that did
not alleviate the risk that, just by opening his mouth and smiling
his infectiously boyish smile, Clinton would put his putative
successor into the shade.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. media has talked of little else _ dredging up the
misgivings Gore had right from the start about Clinton's slipshod
sexual morality and Mrs. Clinton's overweening ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gore's aides have characterized Hillary as something of
a Wicked Witch of the East for daring to run for the Senate in New
York _ an ``act of indescribable selfishness,'' according to one
Gore official, that risks sapping attention and campaign funds from
the race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Clintons have spent their time in California
raising money for her Senate battle and his presidential library,
not the Gore-Lieberman campaign, has hardly improved matters.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Democrats are not seeking to pretend, as the
Republicans did in Philadelphia two weeks ago, that they speak with
a single, spin-doctored, electorally friendly voice.
</P>
<P>
   With the party genuinely torn over its loyalties, between big
business and the unions, between economic growth and environmental
protection, and between the suburban middle classes and the working
poor, it is seeking to make a virtue of necessity and present the
divisions and disagreements as a sign of dynamism and sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's New York Times was filled with convention-related
advertisements challenging Gore to declare his true loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   One urged him to drop the Democrats' pursuit of a Star
Wars-style missile defense system; another questioned the Clinton
administration's record on protecting forests; and a third, from
the bus riders' union, asked Gore: ``Which side are you on? Racism
or civil rights?''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore seeks to define himself as his own man, he will need to
answer and fend off such criticisms. Already, much has been made of
his running mate Lieberman's differing _ and invariably more
conservative _ views on such matters as school vouchers, Social
Security fund investments and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appointment of Lieberman has gone down well _ a
Reuters poll Monday showed the gap between Gore and his Republican
opponent, George W. Bush, closing to just three percentage points _
it will be this convention week that determines whether Gore can
push himself firmly into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Clinton farewell will be his first big test. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair has been holidaying in his borrowed
Tuscan fortress, are half a dozen Italian towns that are trying to
slow down the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns sign
up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and hence
more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that
way: whatever they might say, they regard being busy as a sign of
status.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do
we get our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations,
have fun, and still find time to slope about doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   We will all have our own ideas, but the Slow Cities movement
can, I suggest, teach us some principles of how we might do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the slowing down is not so much slowing,
but calming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key aspects of the Italian cities' plan is to cut
down on noise _ understandably in view of the Vespa/mobile phone
culture of the Italian young.
</P>
<P>
   This holds a lesson for us here. While we cannot do anything
about the booming stereo in the next car at the traffic lights, we
can create more calm by not inflicting noise on ourselves when we
don't need to. Turn down the telly. Throw out the Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   But while cutting down on noise may help take pressure off
people, it doesn't solve the time problem. How do we create more
downtime for ourselves? Everyone will have lots of tricks they have
learned that enable them to save time.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trawl of my colleagues suggests the following ideas. One
is to do the weekly supermarket shopping at 8 a.m. on a Saturday
morning when you can whisk around in half the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   A second is, whenever you see an object that would make a good
present, to buy it and stick it in a drawer. Then you have presents
ready for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, doing things at the last minute is also very
efficient. There was some economic study that looked at the time
taken to do routine tasks: the closer it was to the deadline, the
quicker the task was done.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist I found the last idea particularly encouraging.
But I would like to offer two further suggestions. One takes a lot
of organization, costs money and is not an option for everyone; the
other can be done instantly by anyone and is free.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to cut commuting time. The sums are simple. On a
typical working day, we spend eight hours at work and eight hours
asleep. So that leaves only eight hours for everything else _ from
brushing one's teeth to making sure the fridge is stocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use another hour each way of that time commuting,
you have used up one-quarter of all the spare time during the day.
Given frequent traffic delays and the unreliability of public
transport, this is an enormous burden we place on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much a modern burden: the word commuter is only
about 130 years old. Nearly all the additional time we gained in
the last century by shorter working hours, we lost in longer
commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   By a combination of living close to work (or working close to
where you live) and using the new technologies to do at least some
work at home, it should be possible for many people to trim the
time they spend going to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who has just sold his apartment and is borrowing one
closer to our offices says he is astounded by the amount of time he
has suddenly discovered he has gained.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, not everyone has this option. The option that we
do all have can gain even more time. It is to give up watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Social Trends, the average man in
Britain spends 24 hours a week watching television, the average
woman 26 hours. That is between three and four hours a day _ all of
which has to come out of the eight hours of leisure. No wonder
people feel they have no time.
</P>
<P>
   Are you out of touch if you don't watch the box? Not if you
listen to the radio and read the newspapers. Put a tablecloth over
it for a week and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps Tony Blair should try that one. If he vowed never to
watch TV and simply paid his PR people to watch it for him, think
of the time he could save.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should pop over to Greve and have a beer with the
mayor. Don't hurry. Get one of those squads of bodyguards to do the
driving. Stop off at Castellina in Chianti on the way back and have
another beer. And reflect on the fact that is one of the things
vacations are for: to get new ideas on how to make life more
pleasant when you get back home. &QL;

KAPLER EXTENDS HITTING STREAK TO 27 IN RANGERS' LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The first-place Texas Rangers used to find
that beating the New York Yankees was difficult at best during the
regular season and almost impossible in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For the last-place Rangers, well ... how about that Gabe Kapler
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Kapler went 2-for-4 on Monday night to extend his hitting streak
to 27 games, but it did the Rangers little good in a 7-3 loss to
the Yankees at The Ballpark in Arlington. The Yankees built a 7-0
lead through 71/2 innings then held off the Rangers' last-ditch
rally in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won 38 of their past 49 games _ regular-season
and postseason _ against the Rangers going back to the 1996
playoffs. But that seems sadly irrelevant now that there's no real
chance of the two teams meeting again in the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go through what we're going through now as a team
in general,'' Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer said. ``But three out
of the last four years, this was basically two first-place teams
playing. This year, it's not the case. When we take the field, we
still believe we can win. We're not playing bad baseball, but we're
not playing consistent winning baseball. That's how you compete
against a team like the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning baseball, the Rangers have lost 11 of 15 and
are 12-19 since the All-Star break. At 54-62, they are also eight
games under .500 for the first time since the end of the 1997
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made some changes, and they've had a lot of
injuries,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``You lose (Juan
Gonzalez) and you lose Pudge (Rodriguez), and that's totally
different. I'm sure it's frustrating for Johnny (Oates). You can
only do so much as a manager. You have such high hopes in spring
training, then when you lose players like that, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler kept his hitting streak alive by drilling a grounder
through the middle in the second inning, then lined a single to
center field in the fourth. But, with the Rangers down 7-2, he
popped out with the bases loaded and no outs in the eighth against
Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we played a pretty ugly game tonight,'' said Kapler,
who also got picked off first base and had a throwing error in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he had no interest in talking about the hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about anything but the game,'' Kapler
said. ``Tonight we flat-out stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Oates was a little more positive than that about
starting pitcher Matt Perisho, who gave up six runs in six innings
to take the loss. Perisho, with eight strikeouts, showed some
flashes of what the Rangers hope is potential.
</P>
<P>
   But Jorge Posada's two-run home run in the first and Derek
Jeter's two-run homer in the sixth crushed any chance of it being a
winning effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he threw the ball OK,'' Oates said. ``You look at
their lineup, he had some success against some pretty good hitters.
If Matt were to throw the ball every time out like he did tonight,
he'd win a few ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Perisho has lost five consecutive decisions and is
winless in 10 starts since beating Tampa Bay on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, overall, I can take a lot of positives out of this,''
Perisho said. ``I threw a lot more strikes and was a lot more
aggressive. But there's a reason why they're in first place: They
hit my mistakes. If I minimize my mistakes, it's a different
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had a much tougher time against Yankees starter Andy
Pettitte, who held them scoreless on four hits through seven
innings before faltering in the eighth. But by then the Rangers
were too far behind to have a realistic hope of coming back against
the Yankees' bullpen. nn

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Without even a nod to President Clinton, who
delivered his valedictory speech to Democrats in Los Angeles on
Monday night, Vice President Al Gore struck populist themes on
Monday in two appearances and pledged to ``stand up for what's
right'' for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was introduced at a humid open-air rally here on Monday
night within view of the city's landmark Gateway Arch by his
running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, as a ``decent and honest''
man. But neither referred to the president, whose administration's
policies they have both generally supported and want to perpetuate,
but whose private behavior they have both criticized.
</P>
<P>
   After the rally, Gore relaxed with his wife, Tipper, Lieberman,
and his wife, Hadassah, in a hotel room as he listened to Clinton's
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great speech,'' he said. ``I appreciate the
generous and kind words he said about me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, he called Clinton and thanked him, a White
House aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he reacted to the ``adulation'' heaped on Clinton,
Gore said, ``Appropriate and what you would think would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   How could he expect in his own speech on Thursday night to top
Clinton's? Gore's wife shot reporters an exasperated look as he
blew past the question.
</P>
<P>
   While Lieberman flew on to Los Angeles Monday night, Gore will
meet Clinton in Michigan on Tuesday for a symbolic ``passing of the
torch,'' a ceremony that Gore aides hope will help shift the
attention from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally here, Gore focused on his many pledges _ to improve
education, move toward universal health-care coverage, raise the
minimum wage and enact anti-hate-crimes legislation. He framed the
election as a choice between middle-class families and special
interests like drug and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes down to this,'' he declared to several hundred
people here. ``Which side are you on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``On one side there are working families, middle-class families,
and they face a lot of obstacles; and on other side there are a lot
of powerful interests who misuse the campaign finance system to
wield more influence than they should,'' he declared. ``We need
campaign finance reform to give democracy back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also makes a world of difference who you've got in the
White House,'' he said. ``I have never hesitated to take on the
powerful, to take on the ones that find ways to make the system
work for them, even if it comes as a disadvantage to most people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when the big drug companies say that they're
opposed to a prescription drug benefit, that shouldn't rule the day
in the Congress and in our nation,'' he said. ``We ought to have
people who are willing to fight hard enough to overcome that and do
what's right for the people of this country. That's what I'm all
about; that's what this campaign is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier appearance on Monday in Independence, Mo., Gore
gave a flash preview of his coming convention speech, plunging into
details of how he would shore up Medicare and Social Security and
suggesting that his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, was
hiding behind generalities on his tax-cut proposal that Gore argued
would cut benefits and hurt other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is hoping that his detail-laden speech on Thursday, when he
accepts the Democratic nomination for president, will accomplish a
couple of things: give him a political mandate to follow the course
he is proposing, and portray the Republicans as speaking vaguely
because their positions are unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give generalities and not give the specifics _ that's not
the best way to elevate our democracy,'' he said on Monday in
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers say these detailed discussions, while not
exciting, address the concerns of ordinary Americans and play to
Gore's strengths, including his grasp of policy, and at the same
time suggest that Bush is unprepared to grapple with such basic
issues.

   LONDON _ Just an hour's (slow) drive from San Gimignano, where
Prime Minister Tony Blair has been holidaying in his borrowed
Tuscan fortress, are half a dozen Italian towns that are trying to
slow down the pace of life.
</P>
<P>
   They are members of the ``Slow City'' movement, where towns sign
up to a series of measures designed to make life calmer and hence
more enjoyable for citizens and visitors alike.
</P>
<P>
   So far there are 32 towns in Italy that have joined the scheme,
which grew out of the ``Slow Food'' plan of the early Eighties.
That was a reaction to Americanized fast food, the idea being that
people should eat delicious meals, and take all afternoon doing it,
instead of bolting down a hamburger on the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   These Slow Cities are coping with traffic by enlarging
pedestrian areas and building car parking lots on the edge. They
are planting more trees in parks, banning car alarms, and taking
down TV aerials, posters and neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you detect a tinge of anti-Americanism, even xenophobia, in
all this you would be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American urban model,'' protests Paolo Saturnini, the
mayor of Greve in Chianti (just 30 miles from San Gimignano), ``has
invaded our cities and risks making Italian towns look the same. We
want to stop this kind of globalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of anti-globalization in these include banning
genetically-modified foods and promoting locally produced organic
food in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But these cities are not against progress in the sense that they
are anti-technology; in fact they argue that technology, properly
applied, ought to make life easier and more relaxed. They are, so
to speak, anti-McDonald's rather than anti-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us would applaud the idea, but short of high-tailing it
to Tuscany, what can we do about it? In any case, going slow while
on vacation is not the problem for most of us: it is how to slow
down our daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Slow Cities project touches a nerve because one of the
growing divisions in our society is not about money but about time:
between the time-rich and the time-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some time-richness is involuntary: that of the unemployed or the
early retired. And some of the time-poor have chosen to be that
way: whatever they might say, they regard being busy as a sign of
status.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of us there is a genuine problem of balance: how do
we get our work done, fulfill our social and family obligations,
have fun, and still find time to slope about doing nothing?
</P>
<P>
   We will all have our own ideas, but the Slow Cities movement
can, I suggest, teach us some principles of how we might do so.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the slowing down is not so much slowing,
but calming.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key aspects of the Italian cities' plan is to cut
down on noise _ understandably in view of the Vespa/mobile phone
culture of the Italian young.
</P>
<P>
   This holds a lesson for us here. While we cannot do anything
about the booming stereo in the next car at the traffic lights, we
can create more calm by not inflicting noise on ourselves when we
don't need to. Turn down the telly. Throw out the Walkman.
</P>
<P>
   But while cutting down on noise may help take pressure off
people, it doesn't solve the time problem. How do we create more
downtime for ourselves? Everyone will have lots of tricks they have
learned that enable them to save time.
</P>
<P>
   A quick trawl of my colleagues suggests the following ideas. One
is to do the weekly supermarket shopping at 8 a.m. on a Saturday
morning when you can whisk around in half the usual time.
</P>
<P>
   A second is, whenever you see an object that would make a good
present, to buy it and stick it in a drawer. Then you have presents
ready for every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, doing things at the last minute is also very
efficient. There was some economic study that looked at the time
taken to do routine tasks: the closer it was to the deadline, the
quicker the task was done.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist I found the last idea particularly encouraging.
But I would like to offer two further suggestions. One takes a lot
of organization, costs money and is not an option for everyone; the
other can be done instantly by anyone and is free.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to cut commuting time. The sums are simple. On a
typical working day, we spend eight hours at work and eight hours
asleep. So that leaves only eight hours for everything else _ from
brushing one's teeth to making sure the fridge is stocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use another hour each way of that time commuting,
you have used up one-quarter of all the spare time during the day.
Given frequent traffic delays and the unreliability of public
transport, this is an enormous burden we place on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is very much a modern burden: the word commuter is only
about 130 years old. Nearly all the additional time we gained in
the last century by shorter working hours, we lost in longer
commuting time.
</P>
<P>
   By a combination of living close to work (or working close to
where you live) and using the new technologies to do at least some
work at home, it should be possible for many people to trim the
time they spend going to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who has just sold his apartment and is borrowing one
closer to our offices says he is astounded by the amount of time he
has suddenly discovered he has gained.
</P>
<P>
   But, as I said, not everyone has this option. The option that we
do all have can gain even more time. It is to give up watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest Social Trends, the average man in
Britain spends 24 hours a week watching television, the average
woman 26 hours. That is between three and four hours a day _ all of
which has to come out of the eight hours of leisure. No wonder
people feel they have no time.
</P>
<P>
   Are you out of touch if you don't watch the box? Not if you
listen to the radio and read the newspapers. Put a tablecloth over
it for a week and see what happens. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,075, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps Tony Blair should try that one. If he vowed never to
watch TV and simply paid his PR people to watch it for him, think
of the time he could save.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should pop over to Greve and have a beer with the
mayor. Don't hurry. Get one of those squads of bodyguards to do the
driving. Stop off at Castellina in Chianti on the way back and have
another beer. And reflect on the fact that is one of the things
vacations are for: to get new ideas on how to make life more
pleasant when you get back home. &QL;

RANGERS PITCHER GLYNN SCRATCHED FROM SCHEDULED START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers, still unsure what caused
Ryan Glynn to faint in the dugout Friday night, want him to undergo
more tests and have scratched him from Wednesday's start against
the New York Yankees. The Rangers expect to put him on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers internist Dr. Scott Hunter said Glynn is suffering from
syncope _ sudden lost of consciousness _ which has more than 50
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt uncomfortable letting him get go back out there
until we get all the tests done,'' Hunter said. ``I'm not convinced
we've looked at everything that needs to be looked at before we let
him go back to a high level of athleticism. It can be a nebulous
problem. That's why we need to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the testing could take another seven to 10 days.
Glynn, who has a history of occasional fainting, passed out after
pitching 42/3 innings on the hottest day of the season. But Hunter
said, ``The heat may have provoked it, but I don't think that was
the source.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will pitch Jonathan Johnson in Glynn's spot. The
Rangers ruled out Darren Oliver, who is on the disabled list with
weakness in his left shoulder and on a medical-rehabilitation
assignment with Oklahoma. MEANINGLESS SERIES
</P>
<P>
   A Rangers-Yankees series used to mean something around here. It
also brought out the inevitable questions about the Rangers'
inability to beat the Yankees. But that has been completely missing
from this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about that,'' Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer
said. ``We don't have the same things we've had to deal with in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro said, ``I guess they don't expect
us to beat the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said he misses the constant questions about the
Rangers' troubles against New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss winning so, yeah, I miss that,'' Palmeiro said. ``That
comes from winning.'' CURTIS STAYS IN LINEUP
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates wants to see how right fielder
Ricky Ledee and designated hitter Frank Catalanotto, both young,
left-handed hitters, do against left-handed pitchers down the
stretch. But Oates always wants to give Chad Curtis as much playing
time as possible against left-handers, as he has all year.
</P>
<P>
   So Oates said when left-handers face the Rangers, he'll likely
alternate Curtis, a right-handed hitter, between filling in for
Ledee and Catalanotto. Monday, Catalanotto sat against Yankees
left-hander Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure Curtis gets as many at-bats as possible
against left-handers,'' Oates said. ``We're trying to win as many
games as we can, and he's a valuable part of our ballclub. Chad
Curtis can help us win ballgames, and, last I heard, that was the
objective.'' LAMB SITS
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Mike Lamb, in a 1-for-18 slump, got a day off
Monday with Andy Pettitte pitching for the Yankees. But shortstop
Royce Clayton, 1-for-21, is still in the lineup, and Johnny Oates
isn't ready to sit him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``His defense has been very good,'' Oates said. ``He's doing
what he's supposed to do. He has hit a couple balls hard.'' TOP
HITTERS
</P>
<P>
   Rangers designated hitter Frank Catalanotto went into Monday
night's game hitting .362, the fourth-highest batting average in
the majors for players with at least 150 at-bats. The top five:
Player, Team AB-H Avg. Todd Helton, Colorado 411-161 .392 Nomar
Garciaparra, Boston 367-141 .384 Jeffrey Hammonds, Colorado 328-120
.366 Frank Catalanotto, Texas 152-55 .3618 Carlos Delgado, Toronto
426-154 .3615 RING CEREMONY
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are planning to present Chad Curtis with his World
Series ring when the Rangers play at Yankee Stadium next week.
Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said the club wants to have a nice
ceremony at home plate in front of the home fans. Curtis played for
the Yankees last year, hitting a game-winning home run in the 10th
inning of Game 3 of the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. nn

DESPITE STRUGGLING ROTATION, YANKEES SAY THEY CAN WIN ANOTHER
TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Chad Curtis spent a few minutes before
batting practice yesterday saying hello to his old teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers outfielder saw Bernie Williams, the New York
Yankees' magnificent center fielder, and Derek Jeter, their
fabulous shortstop, as well as third baseman Scott Brosius, first
baseman Tino Martinez, right fielder Paul O'Neill and catcher Jorge
Posada.
</P>
<P>
   All played key roles as the Yankees won the American League East
and destroyed the Rangers, Boston Red Sox and Atlanta Braves in the
playoffs last season to win their third World Series title in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Add newcomers David Justice, Jose Canseco and Glenallen Hill,
and the Yankees that began a three-game series against the Rangers
with a 7-3 victory Monday night at The Ballpark in Arlington look
like an imposing bunch once again.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for one nagging little matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's any question at all is if some guys who
have pitched well in the past are going to pitch that way again,''
said Curtis, who played with the Yankees the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 64-50, the third-best record in the American
League. Before Monday night, they were fourth in the league with a
.282 team batting average, and third with a 4.55 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they don't quite resemble the juggernaut of the past few
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have been inconsistent all year,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, as Curtis pointed out, it's the starting pitching that
has been inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the World Series last year on the strength of
their starting pitching. Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez was 3-0
with a 1.20 ERA in the playoffs. David Cone was 2-0 with a 1.29
ERA, Roger Clemens was 2-1 with a 3.24 ERA, and Andy Pettitte was
2-0 with a 3.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   However, only Pettitte and Clemens are pitching well this
season. Pettitte is 14-6 with a 4.19 ERA after defeating the
Rangers on Monday night, and Clemens is 10-6 with a 3.62 ERA and
hasn't lost since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who pitches tonight, is struggling through the worst
season of his career. He's 2-10 with a 6.56 ERA. He lost eight
consecutive decisions before beating the Oakland Athletics in his
most recent start.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is 8-9 with a 5.06 ERA. He was on the disabled list
from July 19 until Aug. 6 because of a sore elbow and back spasms,
and is 0-2 with a 10.45 ERA in two starts since returning.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, expected to bolster the rotation after coming over
in a trade with the Cincinnati Reds, won his first two starts but
is 0-2 with a 15.96 ERA in his past two.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the pitching problems, Curtis isn't expecting his
old team to relinquish its title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know El Duque,'' Curtis said. ``You can throw him in Game 1
of any series in the playoffs, and he's going to shut down the
other team. David Cone has been the same way. If he can still
believe that about himself, I think he can do it. And Clemens is
throwing good, Andy's throwing good, and they've got Neagle. I
think they're just as good as they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is shared in the Yankees' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coney's coming back, and Roger's throwing the ball as good as
he's been throwing it the last couple of years,'' Neagle said. ``El
Duque, it's always tough when you come back off the DL to try to
get out there and feel comfortable again. He'll be OK. And Andy's
Andy; he's one of the most consistent pitchers around. I definitely
think you can see the rotation shaping up and getting to where we
want to be going into the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the Yankees have no doubt that they'll be back
in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overlooking the regular season,'' Tino Martinez
said. ``By no means do we have this sewn up. We still have our work
cut out for us the rest of the way. But our goal is to win the
World Series. Anything short of that is a disappointment because
we've done it the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense remains formidable. The Yankees scored 189 runs in
their first 30 games after the All-Star break, the most in the
majors. That should be good enough to carry them to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they've got a little more than seven weeks to get the
pitching figured out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to come together,'' Martinez said. ``When
everybody gets healthy, and with Coney coming around a little bit,
we're going to be tough to beat. Last year, there were a lot of
questions about our staff, and we had all of our guys healthy going
into the postseason, and we won the World Series. There's always
going to be question marks, but, as long as our guys are healthy, I
don't think we're going to have any problems.'' nn

   &UR; DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION(Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEM-ASSESS (Los Angeles) _ The transfer of power is one of the
key tests of democracy. At the governmental level, the United
States has managed it exceptionally well ever since George
Washington, hero of the war that brought the nation into being,
handed over to John Adams in 1797. But before the reins of
government can pass from one hand to another, party leadership must
be transferred, in a process for which there is no set of statutes
and no rulebook. It has often proved difficult for sitting
presidents, especially in the modern era, when vice presidents more
or less automatically seek the presidency. So it has proved for
President Clinton, despite largely cordial relations with Vice
President Al Gore. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   PEARSON-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Since January 1997, when she
took charge of Pearson PLC _ a British publisher whose holdings
include Penguin Books, The Economist, The Financial Times and a
major educational publishing operation _ Marjorie Scardino has
overhauled the formerly sleepy company, engineering major
acquisitions and asset sales as well as smaller deals. The result,
Scardino contends, is a media company poised for growth by
extending its books, newspapers and magazines into online,

   TOOTH-TECH (Undated) _ The business of straightening teeth has
always been a small-scale, fairly low-tech affair _ a one-on-one
interaction between orthodontist and patient. It seems a stretch
that a classic Silicon Valley startup could create a role for
itself in this highly local profession, but that is exactly what
seems to be happening with Align Technology, a manufacturer of a
clear plastic alternative to braces aimed at appearance-conscious
adults. Now, armed with promising early results and backed by
venture capital on a scale that has stunned the industry, Align is

L.A. POLICE PUT DOWN MELEE AFTER FREE CONCERT AT DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO, DONNA HUFFAKER, LISA MASCARO AND JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day of peaceful protest ended Monday night with
volleys of bottles and other objects being hurled at police -- who
drove 10,000 demonstrators away from Staples Center with a massive
force of officers on horseback, motorcycle and foot.
</P>
<P>
   The melee erupted about 7:30 p.m. as President Clinton took the
podium at the Democratic National Convention and the
anti-authoritarian Los Angeles band Rage Against the Machine was
concluding its concert outside the arena with ``Killing In the Name
Of.''
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators climbed the 12-foot fence keeping them
away from Staples Center. Others grabbed at television news cameras
and attacked a radio reporter when police ordered the area cleared
and began moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Officers sprayed pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse the
crowd, which responded by throwing pylons, cans, bottles, asphalt
and a handicapped-parking sign. Other signs were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were hurt, none seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accused the police of overreacting, but Los Angeles
Police Department officials said the growing violence of the crowd
required action.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of the crowd inside the area became very
violent. It's unfortunate because earlier in the day most of the
crowds were very lawful,'' said Cmdr. David Kalish, department
spokesman. ``It became necessary for officers to actively move
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred mounted officers, and some on foot or
motorcycle, forced the crowd back several blocks through a freeway
underpass.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were kept inside Staples Center until the protesters
were cleared away and there was no threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegate Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer of the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, was caught in the melee and
said he was shoved by officers despite identifying himself as a
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were absolutely out of line,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``They should be ashamed of themselves. Is this
what they use our taxpayer money to train for?''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd said the police action was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a protester. I've never seen L.A. get crazy like this.
I just came down here to see the action,'' said a 23-year-old
Canoga Park man who identified himself only as Jeremiah. ``They're
doing a good job, but they're still cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The melee started after Rage Against the Machine, known for its
CD ``The Battle of Los Angeles,'' left the stage and East L.A. band
Ozomatli was starting its set.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was generally peaceful until the final song of the
90-minute concert.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was screaming the lyrics from Rage Against the
Machine's last song and making obscene gestures toward Staples
Center while Hillary Rodham Clinton's image was projected on a
big-screen TV outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   A protest group wearing all black, known as the ``Black Block,''
started over a security fence, yelling ``This is what a police
state looks like!''
</P>
<P>
   A police commander took the stage and told the crowd the
demonstration was over and said, ``Everyone has to disperse or you
will be subject to arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were told they had 15 minutes to leave, but fires
broke out among the crowd and only about 1,000 people left before
police sent in the mounted officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't give people enough time to go,'' said Gillian
Claycomb, a 19-year-old UCLA student. ``We were totally obeying the
law. We were protesting in a peaceful way -- dancing and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said police didn't give clear direction and pushed
protesters in a variety of directions.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Vargas, 28, of Los Angeles said he was hit with a rubber
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the end got hit. It's absurd,'' Vargas said.
``Everyone was in the motion of leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all dispersing as we were told and they rolled up on
us with their horses and began hitting us with their batons,'' said
Kelly Brand, 34, of Los Angeles who was at the protest with the
American Indian movement. ``I was trying to get out and I asked the
cop which way to go, he said, `That way,' and hit me with his
baton.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand had a bloody, five-inch gash below his left shoulder
blade.
</P>
<P>
   Police were pushing protesters away from the area. Some
protesters lay down and linked arms.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Carter of the National Lawyers Guild, which is monitoring
police action, said everything was ``fine until they decided to
shut down the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd started throwing various objects over the
fence toward a line of riot police.
</P>
<P>
   A police commander then ordered the power turned off. As
concertgoers filtered out of the area, police on horseback, with
batons drawn, rushed in to move people away from the fences.
Officers in riot gear then fired pepper spray and rubber bullets
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We're deploying en masse,'' said California Highway Patrol
Assistant Chief Stan Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Before the melee, Edward Harris, a Department of Justice
community service officer, estimated the crowd size at up to 10,000
people. There was one arrest for a person crossing a police line.
</P>
<P>
   A mix of protesters and music fans came to the protest site
after a day of rallying against corporate globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Activists decried corporate globalization during the day and
partied into the night. And the convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of hogwash,'' said Mike Deaver, an 18-year-old
from Seal Beach who came out for the Rage show. ``What's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, firefighters sprayed water to cool off
the crowd. Most in the crowd had been protesting during the day and
marched from Pershing Square to the protest site outside Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   A line of officers lined the protest area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the fence. It's creepy,'' Greenpeace activist and
North Hollywood resident Gabrielle Weeks said before the melee.
</P>
<P>
   She said the hundreds of officers who stood ready resembled
``scowling cops in welding visors trying to intimidate us. They're
lined up like angry Rockettes. I don't know how that helps the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Rincon, a 26-year-old Los Angeles health educator, took
the day off to come to the protest with her 7-month-old son, Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome the convention's being held here and to protest
with Rage at our side or vice versa,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon came to protest injustice in society, pointing out the
homeless being swept off the street in preparation for the
convention. She noted the people at Staples Center looking down on
the concert in the protest area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to come out of the nice Staples Center and see the
people,'' Rincon said. ``They want our vote, they need to come down
here.''

TCU PLAYERS REMINISCE ABOUT HOW FAR THEY'VE COME
</HEADLINE>
 DAY-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Dennis Franchione enjoys telling
the story of changing expectations and mindsets.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting a 1-10 Horned Frogs football team and turning it into
a winner wasn't an overnight process, though he admits the job
wasn't as daunting as might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Franchione wasn't prepared to say in December
1997, but taking over a program that hit rock bottom gives a coach
a blank slate and a group of players ready to listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they won four or five games, then maybe they think they're
doing some things right,'' Franchione said Monday at TCU's annual
media day. ``But those freshmen were willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garner, a reserve freshman lineman in 1997, remembers what
that was like. He signed with TCU after the Horned Frogs' 6-5
season in 1995, the second consecutive winning season under Pat
Sullivan. The Horned Frogs slumped to 4-7 in '96, Garner's redshirt
year, before bottoming out at 1-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a young team, and we needed a total attitude change,''
said Garner, who is entering his third season as the starting
center. ``We needed a leader to show us how. We had the raw talent,
we just needed some sculpting and maturing.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of that sculpting has been in the weight room. Two years
ago, only four players on the team could bench press 400 pounds,
Franchione said. Now, 51 players can including quarterback Casey
Printers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reflects how far we've come,'' Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   With consecutive bowl victories, the Frogs have matured into a
top-20 team heading into Garner's senior season. A Western Athletic
Conference championship and entry into the Bowl Championship Series
have become the team's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we wanted to do but didn't know it could be
done this quickly,'' Garner said. ``We have a lot of goals this
year, and that's something that has been growing each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the obvious team goals, Garner and the rest of the
offensive linemen have a personal interest in one individual honor.
The self-named ``Big Uglies'' are ready to wage their own weekly
Heisman Trophy campaign on behalf of senior tailback LaDainian
Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``With LT getting all the recognition, it makes us give that
much more effort,'' Garner said. ``The better job we do, the better
game he has and the better his chances of winning the Heisman.''
FRESHMAN UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The incoming freshman class has gone through five practices, and
Franchione said ``they've lived up to their billing.''
</P>
<P>
   The class was rated by many as the third best in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has redshirted the vast majority of his first two TCU
recruiting classes. He did, however, indicate Monday that two
players _ defensive tackle Brandon Johnson (Carrollton Smith) and
receiver Reggie Harrell ( Lamar) _ have a chance to contribute this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans join the newcomers in two-a-day practices Tuesday.
RECEIVER BATTLES
</P>
<P>
   With the graduation of Mike Scarborough, speedster LaTarence
Dunbar (20 catches for 315 yards in '99) is the Frogs' top
returning receiver. Franchione would like Dunbar to take a ``bigger
role'' and labeled him a potential ``playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione also said someone from the group of Cedric James,
Kevin Brown and Tim Maiden has to step up as the No. 2 receiver. In
previous seasons, Franchione had hoped James would make that
transition, but James is ``a guy that can't seem to turn his
springs into falls,'' Franchione said
</P>
<P>
   Franchione added that ``if you drew up bodies, you'd draw them
up like Cedric James.'' James is 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and runs a
40-yard dash in between 4.3 and 4.4 seconds. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ UCLA is no longer an option for the 2001 schedule. The Frogs
and Bruins couldn't shuffle dates to make it work, and UCLA settled
for a game with Kansas. Louisiana Tech, Marshall and Pittsburgh
remain the leading possibilities for TCU's two openings next
season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Franchione said he hopes receiver Ahmed Kabba returns to TCU
in the spring. Kabba, who transferred from Oklahoma and sat out
last season, left the team for personal reasons last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ As of Monday, close to 9,900 season tickets had been sold for
the upcoming season. Since the school began keeping season-ticket
figures in 1961, the school record is 12,056 in '85. The current
total is the sixth highest. TCU's home schedule kicks off Sept. 16
against Northwestern. For ticket information, call (817) 257-7967.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four temporary suites will be erected this season above the
stands in the north end zone, next to the scoreboard. nn

L.A. POLICE PUT DOWN MELEE AFTER FREE CONCERT AT DNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO, DONNA HUFFAKER, LISA MASCARO AND JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day of peaceful protest ended Monday night with
volleys of bottles and other objects being hurled at police -- who
drove 10,000 demonstrators away from Staples Center with a massive
force of officers on horseback, motorcycle and foot.
</P>
<P>
   The melee erupted about 7:30 p.m. as President Clinton took the
podium at the Democratic National Convention and the
anti-authoritarian Los Angeles band Rage Against the Machine was
concluding its concert outside the arena with ``Killing In the Name
Of.''
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators climbed the 12-foot fence keeping them
away from Staples Center. Others grabbed at television news cameras
and attacked a radio reporter when police ordered the area cleared
and began moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Officers sprayed pepper spray and rubber bullets to disperse the
crowd, which responded by throwing pylons, cans, bottles, asphalt
and a handicapped-parking sign. Other signs were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were hurt, none seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accused the police of overreacting, but Los Angeles
Police Department officials said the growing violence of the crowd
required action.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of the crowd inside the area became very
violent. It's unfortunate because earlier in the day most of the
crowds were very lawful,'' said Cmdr. David Kalish, department
spokesman. ``It became necessary for officers to actively move
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred mounted officers, and some on foot or
motorcycle, forced the crowd back several blocks through a freeway
underpass.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were kept inside Staples Center until the protesters
were cleared away and there was no threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegate Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer of the
Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, was caught in the melee and
said he was shoved by officers despite identifying himself as a
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were absolutely out of line,'' he told The
Associated Press. ``They should be ashamed of themselves. Is this
what they use our taxpayer money to train for?''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd said the police action was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a protester. I've never seen L.A. get crazy like this.
I just came down here to see the action,'' said a 23-year-old
Canoga Park man who identified himself only as Jeremiah. ``They're
doing a good job, but they're still cops.''
</P>
<P>
   The melee started after Rage Against the Machine, known for its
CD ``The Battle of Los Angeles,'' left the stage and East L.A. band
Ozomatli was starting its set.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was generally peaceful until the final song of the
90-minute concert.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was screaming the lyrics from Rage Against the
Machine's last song and making obscene gestures toward Staples
Center while Hillary Rodham Clinton's image was projected on a
big-screen TV outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   A protest group wearing all black, known as the ``Black Block,''
started over a security fence, yelling ``This is what a police
state looks like!''
</P>
<P>
   A police commander took the stage and told the crowd the
demonstration was over and said, ``Everyone has to disperse or you
will be subject to arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were told they had 15 minutes to leave, but fires
broke out among the crowd and only about 1,000 people left before
police sent in the mounted officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't give people enough time to go,'' said Gillian
Claycomb, a 19-year-old UCLA student. ``We were totally obeying the
law. We were protesting in a peaceful way -- dancing and singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said police didn't give clear direction and pushed
protesters in a variety of directions.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Vargas, 28, of Los Angeles said he was hit with a rubber
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone at the end got hit. It's absurd,'' Vargas said.
``Everyone was in the motion of leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all dispersing as we were told and they rolled up on
us with their horses and began hitting us with their batons,'' said
Kelly Brand, 34, of Los Angeles who was at the protest with the
American Indian movement. ``I was trying to get out and I asked the
cop which way to go, he said, `That way,' and hit me with his
baton.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand had a bloody, five-inch gash below his left shoulder
blade.
</P>
<P>
   Police were pushing protesters away from the area. Some
protesters lay down and linked arms.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Carter of the National Lawyers Guild, which is monitoring
police action, said everything was ``fine until they decided to
shut down the concert.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the crowd started throwing various objects over the
fence toward a line of riot police.
</P>
<P>
   A police commander then ordered the power turned off. As
concertgoers filtered out of the area, police on horseback, with
batons drawn, rushed in to move people away from the fences.
Officers in riot gear then fired pepper spray and rubber bullets
into the crowd.
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We're deploying en masse,'' said California Highway Patrol
Assistant Chief Stan Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Before the melee, Edward Harris, a Department of Justice
community service officer, estimated the crowd size at up to 10,000
people. There was one arrest for a person crossing a police line.
</P>
<P>
   A mix of protesters and music fans came to the protest site
after a day of rallying against corporate globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Activists decried corporate globalization during the day and
partied into the night. And the convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bunch of hogwash,'' said Mike Deaver, an 18-year-old
from Seal Beach who came out for the Rage show. ``What's the
point?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, firefighters sprayed water to cool off
the crowd. Most in the crowd had been protesting during the day and

``scowling cops in welding visors trying to intimidate us. They're
lined up like angry Rockettes. I don't know how that helps the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Rincon, a 26-year-old Los Angeles health educator, took
the day off to come to the protest with her 7-month-old son, Sammy.
</P>

ANY SLEUTH KNOWS RANGERS' WOES NOT IN BOOTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way the newspaper reports have been reading the past week,
some jobs are apparently on the line after all in Arlington. Prime
suspects may have finally surfaced in the collapse of the Rangers
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't I think of this?
</P>
<P>
   Blame the team broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, it all makes good sense, too. For example,
there's Eric Nadel. Despite being immensely respected nationwide
for his 22 years in the local radio booth, Nadel has simply not had
a good season with the home-run inning. Or Bill Jones on TV _ his
``call to the bullpen'' has repeatedly been a bad connection.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us had failed in doing our homework on these kind of
broadcast negatives until it was reported that Nadel and radio
partner Vince Cotroneo, along with Jones and his TV analyst, Tom
Grieve, were all still working without contracts for next season.
And also had been given no assurances they would be back in 2001.
Very suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Then the quote last week from team president Jim Lites that all
the broadcasters would have to be ``evaluated,'' sounded rather
threatening where future job security is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I feel like a member of the Boulder Police
Department. How did I miss such obvious suspects? Was it a case of
simply chasing the wrong clues? Instead of shaking down the
broadcast booths, I had a totally different list of Mr. and Mrs.
Ramseys to bring in for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin had been handcuffed and read his rights, but team
owner Tom Hicks made bail for the general manager. Hicks cleared
Melvin of job-loss repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same for Johnny Oates. He also will be working here
again in 2001, so sayeth Judge Hicks. The manager walks on a felony
charge of his team playing bad ball.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland? To suggest _ no, make that ``demand'' _ the
closer be traded at the end of July almost was turned into a
federal case. Everybody except the ACLU jumped to Wetteland's
defense, despite Wetteland having no defense. See blown saves.
Wetteland is still here, too. And figures to be back next season,
with a nice raise and an extended contract. How comforting.
</P>
<P>
   On and on it goes. Hicks said Melvin and Oates would skate for
this season, then Melvin and Oates have allowed most of the
clubhouse to do likewise. At least that's the way it looks.
</P>
<P>
   But, by gosh, when it comes to the broadcasters, hey, let's get
tough out there in Arlington. Fire 'em all. Or fire some of them.
And if that's too extreme, then at least make them all sweat new
contracts like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, before this latest evidence surfaced, the way I had it
figured was the radio guys and the TV guys had had a much better
season than any of the baseball types. And also a much better
season than Lites and his business-side staff, too. Junking up the
ballpark with that outfield advertising is a crime against good
taste and should be punishable by doing two-to-10, hard time.
</P>
<P>
   Or can that also be blamed on the broadcasters?
</P>
<P>
   Nadel refused comment when asked about his situation Monday, but
please give me the name of one team official who would actually
have the gall to look a pro like Nadel in the eye and tell him he
won't be coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, no,'' Lites answered Monday. ``I don't mind getting
bad publicity when we deserve it, but there are no hidden agendas
with our broadcasters. I think we've got a quality group. I like
them. The broadcasters are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   They are?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have new contracts to work out with them, and those have to
be resolved to everyone's satisfaction,'' Lites added. ``That would
be a possible hangup, but I'm not anticipating it.''
</P>
<P>
   To me, Lites has been craw-fishing on the subject, based on his
comments the past week in two different papers. But again, Jim says
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a chain of command here which leads to Mr. Hicks,''
Lites answered, ``and getting everyone in town at the same time has
been a problem. But give it a week, and we'll have everything
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Lites added, ``This is really a nonissue.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, that's good. If so, it needs to stay that way. There is
plenty of 2000 blame to go around in Arlington, but let's keep that
blame where it belongs. nn

RAVING MAD ABOUT THE RAVENS' CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Baltimore Ravens are Super Bowl-bound.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you can stop laughing now. Really. Put away the
straitjackets and call off the guards.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL these days, at least one team rises from the ashes
every season. In 1996, it was the second-year Jacksonville Jaguars
and the second-year Carolina Panthers. The next year, it was the
lowly Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 1998, the Atlanta Falcons made it to
the Super Bowl. And if, before last season, you predicted the St.
Louis Rams' victory against the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl
XXXIV, well, then, enjoy your early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, history repeats itself. Again. And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   So why not the Ravens in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has had 11 Pro Bowl selections over the past two
seasons. It will start nine first-round draft picks. It has an
offensive genius as head coach. It has a defense that puts the fear
of Ray Lewis in opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens. Super Bowl champions. It has a nice ring to
it, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that's pressure,'' Ravens coach Brian Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   These are not your father's Cleveland Browns. They are not your
Baltimore Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Since giving up their name, colors, heritage and Cleveland in
1996, the Ravens are 24-39-1. They have the worst TV ratings in the
NFL, and 69,084-seat PSINet Stadium has drawn more than 69,000 only
twice since opening in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltimore hasn't had a team this good since the Colts won
their third consecutive AFC East title in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the most ardent Ravens' supporters _ even those
secure enough in their manhood to drive around in a purple van
complete with a Ravens' head _ have not made their reservations for
Tampa, Fla., yet. Not only do they refuse to believe, but they
label anyone who picks the Ravens to represent the AFC in Super
Bowl XXXV as ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's optimistic,'' said Dave McGettigan, a
season-ticket holder and the proud owner of the Ravens' party van.
``But I hope you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   Champions are built on hope ... and defense.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's defense ranked second overall last season and was
sixth in points allowed. Only six teams scored more than 20 points
against the Ravens last season. Only five times did the Ravens
allow more than 300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get the offense putting up just 20 points a game, we
can do a lot of things,'' Ravens linebacker Jamie Sharper said.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one thing not to love about the Ravens: Tony
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Billick loves Banks, but he understands the lack of confidence
everyone else has in his starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play defense the way we play, people are going to
take notice,'' said Billick, who was the offensive coordinator in
Minnesota two seasons ago when the Vikings set an NFL scoring
record with 556 points. ``I think that's what everybody's optimism
is based on. Offensively, we have some weapons. The biggest
question mark people are going to qualify it as: Well, what will
Tony Banks do? We've got some weapons, but that's going to be the
qualifier.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks' passing statistics are almost the same as Tennessee
quarterback Steve McNair over the past three seasons. McNair, who
has had running back Eddie George behind him, has completed 692 of
1,238 passes (55.9 percent) for 8,072 yards with 41 touchdowns and
31 interceptions. Banks, who has had a committee of journeymen
running behind him, has gone 662-for-1,215 (54.5) for 7,925 yards
with 38 touchdowns and 35 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It was after the Ravens' 35-8 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on
Oct. 21 that Banks replaced Stoney Case as the team's starter.
Banks went 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens were 6-3 in their last nine games, scoring 229 points
after scoring only 95 in the first seven.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time in his playing career, Banks will have
the same offensive coordinator and the same offense for successive
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but feel better,'' Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   You can take this to the bank: The Ravens are Super Bowl-bound.

   Set for last Olympic shot, Thompson wins 100 freestyle
</P>
<P>
   By DANNY ROBBINS
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jenny Thompson came to the U.S. Olympic Swimming
Trials four years ago thinking it would be her last time at the
event. Her plan was to qualify for the Olympics, take her best shot
in Atlanta and get on with her life.
</P>
<P>
   But when she made the team only as a relay swimmer, a role that
did not measure up to what she had expected, she was hurt and
confused, wondering whether her career should end in such a sour
way.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Quick, Thompson's coach, remembers telling Thompson
before the Games she could ``go through the motions'' and still
take home some relay medals or truly enjoy the experience as well
as win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day in practice, there was fire in her eyes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The passion that kept Thompson, 27, in the pool the last four
years has raged at the 2000 trials, pushing her to victories in the
100-meter freestyle and 100 butterfly and giving her the chance to
accomplish in Sydney all the things she missed in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the 100 freestyle Monday, Thompson broke her own
month-old American record and touched ahead of 33-year-old Dara
Torres for the second time at the trials. Thompson and Torres, both
of whom train with Quick at Stanford University, also were one-two
in the 100 butterfly finals last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson now has the opportunity to end her career in Sydney by
winning the individual gold that has eluded her (she won a silver
medal in the 100 freestyle eight years ago in Barcelona and five
gold medals in relay events in Atlanta and Barcelona).
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fly, I felt so much relief,'' she said. ``I was
definitely going (to Sydney). This race was more of a dress
rehearsal for Sydney. I felt like I managed the crowd well. It'll
be 10 times louder in Sydney, but that's something I'll be
preparing for.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson led wire-to-wire and won in 54.07 seconds, improving on
the 54.27 she recorded in July. Torres was second in 54.62. Third
place went to Ashley Tappin, who won a relay gold medal in 1992;
fourth went to Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals in Atlanta
but now must overcome the effect of two shoulder surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   With Tappin, 25, and Van Dyken, 27, joining Thompson and Torres
as relay competitors, the United States will have a relay team with
an average age of 29, veritable golden girls in swimming years.
</P>
<P>
   Also winning in American-record time Monday at the Indiana
University-Purdue University Natatorium was Kristy Kowal, who took
the 200 breaststroke and gained a place on the team after finishing
third in the 100 breaststroke, missing a berth by one-hundreth of a
second. She had also been third in the 100 breaststroke at the
trials in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal won in 2:24.75, breaking an American record set eight
years ago by Anita Nall. Second in 2:26.79 was Amanda Beard, who
won silver medals in both breaststroke events in Atlanta at the age
of 14 but has not competed at that level since.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Lenny Krazelburg and Tom Dolan both won for
the second time. Krazelburg took the 200 backstroke to complete his
anticipated sweep of the backstroke events. Dolan won the 200
individual medley, adding that victory to the 400 IM title.
</P>
<P>
   The freestyle duel between Thompson and Torres lacked the energy
of the butterfly, largely because Torres did not challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swam faster at a meet a few weeks ago, so I'm not exactly
pleased with my time,'' said Torres, who is making a comeback after
being out of swimming for seven years. ``My legs were pretty much
gone in the second 50. I'll have to make some adjustments in the
next four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick, who is serving as the coach of the U.S. women's team,
said one thing that needs to change is Torres' tendency to burn
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mentality is to go and go,'' he said. ``It looked like
Jenny was letting Dara do some of the work on the first 50.''
</P>
<P>
   After the butterfly, Quick had been critical of both Thompson
and Torres, saying the race was slow because the two swimmers had
been paying too much attention to each other and not focusing on
their own efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently taking those words to heart, Thompson concluded her
portion of the trials with her best performance. She was entered in
the 50 freestyle but will not compete in the event because she will
have a full plate in Sydney, where she could have five medal
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really pleased with it,'' she said of her effort in the
100 freestyle. ``I felt it was a well-managed and well-executed
race. I'm pleased to get a best time in such a high-profile
situation.''

   Holt gets show of support as Astros clobber Pirates
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know any better, you'd think Chris Holt had been
the victim of some sort of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, justice was served to the benefit of a pitcher who
all too often has been a victim of poor run support. The Astros
made up for past neglect Monday night, delivering one big inning
after another in a 16-2 slaughter of the Pittsburgh Pirates at
Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou led the attack as he became only the fourth Astro to
achieve back-to-back two-homer games. The last to do it was Glenn
Davis in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's eye, still a bit discolored from the line drive that
smacked him 10 days earlier, looked like something you might find
on the menu at a Cajun restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he carved up the Pirates, pitching six no-hit
innings before Brian Giles broke up the gem with an infield single
to lead off the seventh inning. Enrique Wilson's sacrifice fly with
one out in the ninth ended Holt's bid for a second career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling in about the second inning that Holtie was
doing something special,'' Astros shortstop Tim Bogar said. ``(The
hitters) had no idea what was coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Pirates pitchers had no idea what hit them. The Astros
established a season high for runs in a game and tied their best
effort in the hit column; they had 19 hits and 14 runs in Sunday's
victory over the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 runs are the most the Astros have scored in consecutive
games since they scored 30 on successive nights in June 1995. The
14-run margin of victory was their largest in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Six Astros had at least two hits, and four had two or more RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminds me of 1997 when I was still playing with aluminum
bats (at Rice),'' left fielder Lance Berkman said. ``Our offense
has been pretty potent. There's not a letdown in the order.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Tony Eusebio and Bogar _ the Nos. 7 and 8 hitters
_ led the assault with four hits apiece, and Alou tied a career
high with five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt locked in,'' said Alou, who is hitting .383 with seven
homers and 18 RBIs in his last 22 starts. ``I go through periods
like this every year. I'm seeing the ball very well. The whole team
is hitting; hopefully, we'll keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonder the abundance of run support didn't send Holt
(5-12) into shock. The Astros have averaged just 2.4 runs in his 12
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris' stuff is so good that with just a little refinement, he
could turn his 12 losses into 12 wins,'' manager Larry Dierker
said. ``Jeff Bagwell told me a couple of weeks ago that guys on
other teams come down to first base and say, `How does (Holt) ever
lose?'''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who improved to 2-1 with a 1.11 ERA in seven career games
against the Pirates, has three of the Astros' four complete games
this season. The other was turned in by Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering what happened to him in his last start, you
wouldn't have thought Chris was a candidate for a complete game,''
Dierker said. ``But he did a great job. I'm proud of him for being
able to go all the way, especially considering how much we used the
bullpen (6 innings) Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring five first-inning runs in Sunday's rout at
Philadelphia, the Astros greeted Pennsylvania's other team with
four runs in the first inning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman hit an RBI double, Richard Hidalgo and Eusebio drove in
runs with singles, and Alou added a sacrifice fly in the fast
start.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio extended his hitting streak to 17 games _ longest ever
by an Astros catcher and the longest for any Astro since Luis
Gonzalez's club-record-tying 23-game streak in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros topped their first-inning outburst with five in the
third as Eusebio and Bagwell contributed two-run doubles and Bill
Spiers drew a bases-load walk.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Jose Silva (7-7), to whom the Astros showed no
more respect than a pitching machine, saw his night end mercifully
in the third. He allowed nine runs on nine hits and three walks in
2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about our offense,'' Holt said. ``My job
is a lot easier when we score 16 runs and get 19 hits. I felt good
out there. I was working both sides of the plate with my fastball,
and I went back to my strength and tried to get ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little timid early because of last time. But I was
itching to get back out there. I actually wanted one hit back to
me, just so I could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou hit the first of his homers _ a solo shot off reliever Marc
Wilkins _ in the fourth inning, and his second homer cleared the
railroad tracks above the left-field wall in the fifth.

TIGERS MAUL MARINERS FOR 18 HITS, 15 RUNS

   SEATTLE _ It's basically a simple game.
</P>
<P>
   Pitch the ball, catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And, just for variety, hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners haven't made it simple in the past few days. But
they've made it simple for the Indians. All Cleveland had to do
Saturday and Monday was wait for a Mariner mistake, then
capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the worst, a four-error, three-wild pitch, one-balk
performance in a 10-4 loss so thoroughly atypical of what the
Mariners and their fans are used to seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as bad baseball as we've played all year,'' shortstop
Alex Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez didn't get slapped with an error himself, but he spent
considerable time after the game slapping himself for not cutting
off a throw from center fielder Al Martin, a play that resulted in
Martin get charged with a needless error and starting pitcher
Freddy Garcia getting charged with an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have cut the ball off,'' Rodriguez said. ``We know
the formula to win. The last couple of days we haven't paid
attention to the formula. So in that sense it's a positive. It's
not that it's a mystery why we've lost. We know what we've done
wrong and we know how to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first inning set the tone when Kenny Lofton was safe on the
first of two errors by third baseman Carlos Guillen. Lofton was at
second base with one out when Manny Ramirez hit a fly ball to deep
center. Martin made the catch and got the ball back to the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez let the ball go, and the throw skipped by second
baseman Mark McLemore, too. Lofton, who was tagging up on the play
not only made it to third, but he came around to score as the ball
rolled around the infield.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the kind of play that's typical of the Mariners _ but
it is the kind of play that's typical of the Indians. The top three
men in the Cleveland batting order _ Lofton, Omar Vizquel and
Roberto Alomar _ are fliers, and they combine that speed with
daring on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton forced that error, and Vizquel's dancing off third base
forced Garcia into a balk that scored the first of three runs in
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is in the midst of making a run for the playoffs,
having moved into a tie with Oakland for the wild card Monday, and
the Indians and Mariners could be first-round opponents.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Mariners have adjustments to make. Containing that
speed is priority one.
</P>
<P>
   As egregious as the seven errors made in the three-game series
are, there is every reason to believe the Mariners _ second in the
league in defense _ will bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   A more pressing concern is the lack of control shown by the
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners walked six batters Monday, and four of those were
instrumental in producing Cleveland runs. Add to that the two
eighth-inning walks issued by Brett Tomko on Saturday that led to
two runs, and there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to throw more first-pitch strikes,'' Garcia said.
``When I don't, that's when I get in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That logic is good, as far as it goes. But pitching coach Bryan
Price said Garcia is putting too much pressure on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy's out there trying to make the perfect pitch,'' Price
said. ``When he doesn't, he gets so locked into the frustration of
it. I don't think I've been able to help him as much as I should in
the middle innings when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have high hopes for Garcia, who was a 17-game
winner as a rookie last season. He spent most of the first half
this year on the disabled list, and pitched well in his first few
games back. But his past three starts have seen him walk 12 batters
in 17 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is such that manager Lou Piniella and Price are
discussing whether or not to skip Garcia once in the rotation. The
Mariners have a day off on Thursday and another off-day next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a managerial decision,'' Price said. ``If it happens,
we'd take advantage of it by working some things out in the
bullpen. We can iron out Freddy's delivery a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia would just as soon skip being skipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can work in the bullpen,'' Garcia said. ``I need to get out
there again and throw first-pitch strikes.''

   ``It looks like I've grown to be too much for myself to
handle,'' widow Marguerite Daigle tells her daughters, Mahalia and
Penny, one day in 1977, and with that she allows herself to be
taken to a convalescent home for alcoholic women, leaving the
girls, who are 15 and 8, in the care of a baby-sitter, Isabel
Flood. That Flood is a religious zealot and militant right-to-lifer
is something Penny already knows. She suspects, in fact, that her
older sister wants to replace their mother with Isabel. The truth
is that Mahalia craves structure and finds it in Isabel while the
rebellious Penny has other things in mind - their divergent needs
are reminiscent of the young sisters in Marilynne Robinson's

   (Pantheon, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Get out your hankies, folks, the tears start early. Fortunately,
the cry is worth the trouble. Cobb has written a brief but potent
reflection on death and grief, subtitled (beginitalic)A
Conversation for the Living(enditalic). In essays about her
experiences with her parents and friends, she discusses the
transcendent opportunities hidden within the act of facing death
with loved ones and the healing process that follows great
suffering. She laments that too many people struggle with both.
Why, she asks, ``is it easier to express our grief for an English
princess in a French tunnel than it is to visit a dying neighbor
down the block? Would that we could bring a fearlessness to a
friend's deathbed or to a grieving family as easily as we now bring
a casserole to an already full table on the day of the funeral.''
Her book is a thought-provoking look at something we all face
eventually, a rite of passage that ``dares us to define what really
matters.''

   Alice Neel first painted herself, wearing only her eyeglasses
and holding an artist's brush, just four years before she died in
1984. She was 80 and looked it. ``Unsmiling, ungiving, the portrait
is not calculated to please anyone, least of all the misshapen
sitter,'' writes Ann Temkin, a curator at the Philadelphia Museum
of Art. ``Like much of Neel's work over the course of five decades,
the painting is happy to look wrong.'' One can't help but think
that the outspoken Neel would have delighted in that description of
her work, the bold, honest portraits that so often ``looked wrong''
(one is her depiction of Joe Gould, the Greenwich Village ``bum''
immortalized by Joseph Mitchell in ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' the
profile that appeared in the(beginitalic) New Yorker(enditalic)).
This retrospective of Neel's work contains 75 paintings and
watercolors and a discussion by many of Neel's subjects on the
sometimes unsettling experience of sitting for her.

   In March of 1895, a 26-year-old Irish dressmaker named Bridget
Cleary was tortured and burned to death by her husband, who had
come to believe that she was a changeling left behind by fairies.
Bridget had been clever, ambitious and sexual - it was even rumored
that she'd had a lover. Her murder, the ensuing trial of Michael
Cleary and a group of his relatives and neighbors charged with
aiding in the murder caused a sensation in the British newspapers,
coloring the debate over home rule in Ireland and heightening the
perception of the Irish peasantry as savages. Bourke's retelling of
the murder and its reflection of the religion and politics of the
time is exhaustively researched and thick with details. She calls
the crime, which was rooted in superstition and confusion, ``the
sort of human tragedy in which nobody is entirely to blame or
entirely innocent, and there are no winners.''

   ``It looks like I've grown to be too much for myself to
handle,'' widow Marguerite Daigle tells her daughters, Mahalia and
Penny, one day in 1977, and with that she allows herself to be
taken to a convalescent home for alcoholic women, leaving the
girls, who are 15 and 8, in the care of a baby-sitter, Isabel
Flood. That Flood is a religious zealot and militant right-to-lifer
is something Penny already knows. She suspects, in fact, that her
older sister wants to replace their mother with Isabel. The truth
is that Mahalia craves structure and finds it in Isabel while the
rebellious Penny has other things in mind - their divergent needs
are reminiscent of the young sisters in Marilynne Robinson's
wonderful novel (beginitalic)Housekeeping(enditalic). Penny's
narration has all the clear-eyed honesty we expect from a child,
which makes it the perfect voice to tell a surprisingly funny story

   Tom Horton takes a gander at George W. Bush's environmental
record as Texas governor; Wil S. Hylton profiles Hugh Hefner (an
assignment that - surprise - requires extensive research at Playboy
mansion parties); Barry Walters surveys a slew of Beach Boys
reissues; and Chris Heath examines the Tao of Keanu, which is -
surprise again - way heavy. At one point, Heath asks the shirtless
cover-boy actor/bassist a vague question about wanting to direct.
``He lets out a kind of quiet sigh,'' Heath writes. ``At its worst,
it's like this. You ask Keanu Reeves a question and {hellip} just
wait. Out in space, planets collide, stars go supernova. On Earth,
forests fall, animals screech and roar. People shout and rant and
weep with anger and joy and just for the hell of it. And, all this

<P>
   ``AMERICAN DEMOGRAPHICS''

<P>
   The cover story examines the marketing competition for the
adventure-travel crowd, a demographic growing wider and deeper and
more sore by the second. Cash-heavy seniors are indulging in the
boonie-based perspiration arts as are footloose boomers and their
skateboard-toting kids. Sales of recreational gear and togs now
reportedly top $80 billion. Two-thirds of all Americans wear or use
such goods at least once a month, up from 50 percent just six years
ago, the magazine says. (Presumably freeing up a lot of room in
bowling alleys, perhaps a fine topic for an upcoming report.) The
second feature looks at domestic migration trends among the
rootless-professional class, concluding that consumption habits of
New Economy workers will enhance greatly the quality of life for
aficionados of quaint ethnic restaurants. (beginitalic)Opa!
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   ``AIR &AMP; SPACE''
</P>
<P>
   Earthbound readers will enjoy the high-flying features about
colorful commercial paint jobs on airliners, the Northrop F-20
Tigershark and a brief history of America's pre-NASA space program.
The cover story isn't really about the goofy car-plane hybrid
pictured there but rather an overview of the aviation photography
of Ben Ross. As it turns out, an airborne Ross shot of the Convair
adorns the studio wall of writer Chad Slattery. The 1948 photo
``captured something essential about postwar America.'' Slattery
writes. ``I look at that picture today and feel the era's
confidence, its faith in technology, its extravagant and often
reckless consumerism.'' The issue's don't-miss feature, though, is
a collection of pre-World War I letters from Marine Corps pilot
Francis Evans to his lady friend, Elizabeth Kibbey, who would later
become Evans' wife. It's a lovely time-capsule look at the
open-cockpit days.
</P>
<P>
   ``BRILL'S CONTENT''
</P>
<P>
   A small box floating on the cover says, ``Skepticism is a
virtue.'' We're down with that. Other cover words reference stories
about dishy (beginitalic)New York Times (enditalic)media writer
Alex Kuczynski, a David Halberstam update of (beginitalic)The
Powers That Be (enditalic)and a detailed look at Joan Didion's
influence on a bunch of contemporary writers, including Maureen
Dowd and Anna Quindlen. In the cover story, Seth Mnookin looks at
George W. Bush's relationship with the press and concludes that the
candidate's sometimes-goofy affability is winning the affection of
at least a few members of the traveling press corps. One conclusive
pull quote sums it up best: ``Bush has neutralized the biggest
question about his candidacy, his perceived lack of intelligence,
by letting reporters see that he is a sharp enough guy when engaged
in casual conversation.'' The skeptical cover headline labels
Bush's chummy tactic ``The Charm Offensive.''

FEDERAL DRUG WAR UNDERMINES LEGITIMATE MEDICAL ADVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, when California voters passed Proposition 215, which
made the use of marijuana legal for legitimate medical purposes,
federal law enforcement agencies began a new war on drugs targeting
both the sick and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents have arrested and charged AIDS and cancer
patients in California, who used medical marijuana to ease their
pain and nausea, with violating federal drug laws. And the federal
government has threatened sanctions against California doctors who
provide candid medical advice to patients about the medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It is a two-pronged attack that is meant to indirectly
intimidate voters who are compassionate enough to want medical
marijuana available for those it helps deal with their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana has been documented to relieve nausea and some levels
of pain in cancer and AIDS patients. Cancer patients taking
chemotherapy can suffer from intense bouts of nausea. AIDS patients
swallow a cocktail of drugs that can cause almost immediate nausea
and the inability to hold the drugs down. In some cases, the
usually prescribed drugs for nausea do not help, not even the
$40-a-pill, so-called Cadillac anti-nausea drug _ but a little
marijuana does.
</P>
<P>
   Before Proposition 215 was passed, California doctors routinely
encouraged some of their patients to try marijuana to relieve their
symptoms when traditional drugs didn't work effectively. But when
California and other states began to pass medical marijuana laws,
the Clinton administration panicked. The administration decided to
make an example of California by cracking down on its doctors and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been threatened with the loss of their prescription
drug licenses, suspension of medical licenses and even criminal
prosecution _ all for telling a patient that, in the doctor's best
medical judgment, the patient may benefit from the medical use of
marijuana and that from a medical perspective it would be advisable
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, possession of marijuana is illegal. Under
California law, medical use of marijuana is legal. Most Western
states have passed medical marijuana laws. There's a tug of war
going on between the federal government and the states on this
issue. Doctors and their patients are being trampled in this
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Under California's Proposition 215, marijuana distribution
centers will give certain patients medical marijuana without a
written recommendation from a doctor. Some centers only require a
diagnosis. A doctor's recommendation is not a prescription for
marijuana, but a doctor's recommendation does exempt a patient from
prosecution under state drug laws. Doctors can neither prescribe
nor dispense marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a
class action lawsuit in a federal district court on behalf of a
number of California doctors and patients. The lawsuit named Barry
R. McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control
Policy, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala as defendants. The lawsuit
requested a preliminary injunction against the defendants to stop
them and their agents from enforcing or threatening to enforce
federal laws that would penalize doctors for communicating with
their patients concerning the risks and benefits of medical use of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and patients won the lawsuit. On April 30, 1997,
U.S. District Judge Fern M. Smith issued a preliminary injunction
to stop the federal government from threatening or prosecuting
doctors for recommending medical marijuana to their patients, for
providing a copy of the patient's medical chart to that patient or
for testifying in court regarding a recommendation that a patient
use marijuana to treat an illness.
</P>
<P>
   The judge wrote in her decision: ``Because the First Amendment
protects physician-patient communication up until the point that it
becomes criminal, defendants may not prosecute California
physicians unless the government in good faith believes that it has
probable cause to charge under federal aiding and abetting and/or
conspiracy statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was ineffective. The difficulty arose in defining
``recommendation.'' The federal government continued to contend
that a doctor can discuss medical marijuana, but not recommend it.
Nor would the government explain the difference between discussion
and recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after winning the lawsuit, doctors still felt they
would be prosecuted if they talked to their patients about the
medical use of marijuana. Therefore, they have remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lawsuit, the federal government had managed to
insert itself between doctors and patients and erect a wall of
silence under the threat of prosecution or sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   So, on Aug. 3, Graham Boyd of the ACLU's Drug Policy Litigation
Project urged a federal district court to permanently block the
federal government from gagging California doctors who think it is
good medical advice to recommend marijuana for specific patients.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Aug. 9, Boyd explained the reason for this
new legal action, ``When the government regulates in the area of
speech, it has to do so very carefully. When it tells us there are
certain things that we can say and other things that we are
forbidden to say, it needs to be very clear about where that line
is. Otherwise people, in order to make sure they don't violate the
law, will often steer well clear of the forbidden zone. So if the
government draws a line that is not clear, if they make
prohibitions that are vague, then it leaves the person who is being
regulated, leaves the doctor, really unable to determine what is
safe to say and what is potentially quite dangerous to say in terms
of their livelihood and staying out of prison. And therefore,
doctors will just avoid the subject altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in California simply want to know what they can say
about the medical use of marijuana and where it might be advisable
and still remain safe from prosecution. That's the reason for this
follow-up litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are requesting a bright line, a clear demarcation
between legal speech and unlawful speech. Boyd spelled out the
ACLU's proposal for a bright line: ``The exact kind of
communication a doctor can make and the context in which he can
make it. So if a doctor says to a patient in the examination room,
'I recommend marijuana,' that's protected. It doesn't matter what's
in the doctor's head. It doesn't matter what the patient ends up
doing. That speech is protected. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that even that bright line will solve the problem
with a determined drug czar and a recalcitrant administration.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has done everything it could to block the
implementation of California's Proposition 215.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, with the number of states having passed medical
marijuana laws and states considering it on this November's
ballots, it is time for Congress to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could create an exception to the prohibition on the use
and possession of marijuana. It has done so for another Class I
drug, peyote. Peyote may be used by members of the Native American
Church _ for religious purposes only. Certainly, Congress can _ in
its concern for those who are seriously ill _ create a federal
medical exception for the possession and use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Creating a federal exception would be the compassionate thing to
do. The right thing. And it would derail this intensifying clash
between states' rights and federal authority. One would think that
a conservative Republican Congress should want to give states their
proper due on this important issue.

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: GOP IN THE ENEMY'S LAIR
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seen threading his way through a bevy of Democrats
at their annual convention: Republican National Chairman Jim
Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson has taken on the role of ``rapid-response attack dog''
in responding to the Democrats' sallies. But he also made some
now-it-can-be-told news of his own.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a reporter's query, he confirmed that the
Republicans chose Philadelphia as the site of their 2000 convention
to pre-empt the Democrats from holding their convention there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if we hadn't have moved, Al Gore would have gone to
Philadelphia,'' Nicholson said. ``Pennsylvania is in play in
November. Fortunately, we got to pick first.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Democrats could have trailed the GOP parade into
the City of Brotherly Love. Both major parties held their
conventions there in 1948. But the city's host committee, led by
former Philadelphia mayor (and current Democratic general chairman)
Ed Rendell, had only enough money in the till to support one such
mega-event.
</P>
<P>
   From delegates to media, most people here complain about how
little access they have to the convention floor, the hot parties
and the celebrities who attend them.
</P>
<P>
   Not Aaron Harber. If anything, he's got too much access.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get double invitations to everything,'' Huber sighed Sunday
night, knee-deep in celebrities at a party sponsored by People for
the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harber is a triple threat here. The host of a Boulder,
Colo., TV show, ``Spontaneous Combustion,'' Harber may be the only
person at this convention _ or any other, in fact _ who is a
credentialed member of the media, a delegate (from Colorado for
Gore) and a member of the electoral college.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a delegate twice before, for Gary Hart in 1984 and
Bill Clinton in 1996. He has figured out how to use his power here
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have unlimited floor privileges and I'm going to abuse
them,'' Harber said with a grin. ``I'll use them about half the
time and then share them with alternates, friends and anyone
willing to pay $100.''
</P>
<P>
   Over a pleasant outdoor lunch at a Santa Monica watering hole,
Arianna Huffington, chief organizer of the so-called Shadow
Conventions in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, wondered why Sen. Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., co-author of the McCain-Feingold campaign reform
bill, wasn't speaking at the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she noted, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who had also
spoken to her group, got a prime-time slot in Philadelphia. And had
not Al Gore recently pledged to make the McCain-Feingold bill ``the
very first piece of legislation I will submit to Congress'' as
president?
</P>
<P>
   Her lunch companion suggested Feingold hadn't exactly helped his
standing with party regulars by coming before Huffington's group
Sunday and blasting the upcoming convention, which is being
</P>
<P>
   held just down the street, as (along with the Republicans) as
``the worst display of money and corruption in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been saying that while George Bush may outshine
Al Gore on the personality meter, when it comes to the issues
voters care about most, Gore will come out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is not an instinctive politician,'' Stan Greenberg, the
prospective nominee's official pollster for strategic planning,
told reporters Monday. ``I have no doubt he'll be heard on the
issues, but it won't be as easy as it is for a more glib
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's most recent national poll, taken Aug. 8-10, found
Gore running nine points behind Bush _ about mid-range in the
current basket of presidential match-ups. Perhaps more significant
</P>
<P>
   was the poll's list of issues that prospective voters think the
government should deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Eight: education (20 percent), moral decline (17),
health care (16), retirement and Social Security (14), taxes and
crime (8 points apiece), the economy and the environment (5 each).
</P>
<P>
   But then came some worrisome news for the Democrats: by a margin
of 39 to 38 percent, slightly more voters trusted the Republicans
more to do something about these key issues than the
</P>
<P>
   Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia Democrats gathered in Los Angeles, the newest
addition to their delegate list _ Sen. Zell Miller _ was back in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller became an automatic delegate to the 2000 gathering after
being appointed earlier this month to succeed the late Sen. Paul
Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who delivered a keynote speech in 1992 that gained
national attention, and listened to a convention radio broadcast
during the birth of one of his sons, chose to spend this convention
week in Georgia, touring military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Miller spokesman Rick Dent said the two-term governor who left
office in 1998 never planned to go to this year's convention even
before the Senate appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But political scientists say the strategy of running his own
campaign in Georgia rather than mingling with party leaders and
raising money in the land of Hollywood legends is also a strategic
move that makes it harder for Republicans to tie him to President
Clinton and other national Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was in Washington last week, taking care of his Senate
transition, when the Democratic ticket made a highly-publicized
stop in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``His priorities right now are the bases this week and spending
as much time as possible on policy and getting up to speed,'' Dent
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic party officials won't be able to seat an alternate to
substitute for the absent Miller, who toured Fort Stewart in
Hinesville on Monday and was scheduled for trips to Augusta's Fort
Gordon and Warner Robins Air Force Base on Tuesday and Thursday.

EYAK POURS FUNDING INTO CONFERENCE CALL SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With another $60 million in venture funding in hand, Boston
telecommunications start-up eYak Inc. is finally ready to tell the
world what it's up to: a low-cost way of offering telephone
conference calls through Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   eYak has made a long run in ``stealth mode,'' punctuated only by
announcements that it landed former Federal Communications
Commission chairman Reed Hundt for its advisory board and ex-New
England Telephone chairman Paul C. O'Brien as a director.
</P>
<P>
   The record of eYak's founders, David Friend and Jeff Flowers,
has excited curiosity in local telecom circles about the new
venture. The two men have started four other companies, including
FaxNet, sold last year for $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 million funding round being announced this week brings
the company's total backing to $76 million. The new funds are being
poured into building what eYak officials call one of the world's
largest ``telecom bridge'' facilities at a Somerville, Mass.
location to serve up to 100,000 participants in conference calls by
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While market prices will be determined by phone companies that
buy access to eYak and resell services, Friend last week said he
expects they will charge far less than the current range of 20 to
50 cents per minute per participant that industry leaders such as
AT&AMP;T, Sprint, and WorldCom charge for prearranged conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   Friend said eYak's technology can handle calls at about
one-fifth the cost of standard conferencing systems, which should
allow carriers to slash prices substantially. In time, Friend said,
arranging eYak casual conference calls _ such as a chat among
several family members _ should cost no more than placing a
long-distance call to one person now.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-month-old eYak is using an Internet protocol system to
connect callers to each other. The system can handle far more calls
than traditional voice-circuit bridges and can offer innovative
services such as ``streaming'' live recordings of calls to
listeners' computers through their Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The system can also support conference callers sharing images
from their computer screens while they speak, through the eYak Web
page, as well as other enhanced calling services.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, most users of eYak will have their calls from the
phone network converted through a Cisco Systems gateway device into
Internet format for conferencing. But as more and more carriers
build Internet-protocol data networks supporting voice, those calls
can be fed directly into eYak and at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're positioning ourselves a little bit ahead of the wave,
but we think in the future voice is going to be just another
application on IP backbones,'' Friend said. The company plans to
add another domestic conference bridge site, probably in the
Midwest or Texas, as well as sites in Asia and Europe, where use of
conference calling sharply lags the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Friend's view has found widespread agreement on Wall Street,
where shares of Sonus Networks of Westford, a leading start-up
maker of voice-over-Net switches, have soared more than 900 percent
since the May initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Unisphere Solutions of Chelmsford, Mass. and Convergent Networks
of Lowell, Mass., which also offer converged voice-data switching
gear, are aiming for public offerings this year and hope to match
Sonus's market success.
</P>
<P>
   eYak's new funding round is being led by $20 million from UBS
Capital Americas. Also participating are meVC Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, Tudor Investment Corp., Deutsche Bank Alex Brown,
Siemens, and iBasis Inc. of Burlington, Mass., a leader in
international calling routed over the Net. Earlier funders Venrock
Associates, Zero Stage Capital, and Bain &AMP; Co. have also put in
more money, eYak said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Chip Moore, an eYak board member and UBS Capital partner:
``We think eYak's technology is revolutionary and will take over
the enhanced voice market.''

if BellSouth truly cannot handle daily orders for thousands of
customers to switch providers, then it really isn't ready for local

IBM GETS EXTREME IN ITS SEARCH FOR YOUNG TALENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard senior A.J. Shankar has never had any trouble finding a
summer job. His studies in applied mathematics and expertise with
computers have made him one of those ``golden geeks'' so eagerly
sought after by Internet companies. He's done multiple stints at
new tech companies that offer lots of cash and stock options; he
could have done the same again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shankar picked long hours, a lower pay rate, and a
chance to work on something really cool at a company not known for
being cool: IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked for three start-ups,'' Shankar says, ``and none of
them were as interesting as this is.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about his work on Sash, a piece of Linux software
that'll help amateur programmers easily produce complex and
sophisticated programs. Shankar and a team of bright undergraduates
have spent the summer grinding out the code that'll make it work.
IBM provides a salary, room and board, and the best laptop and
desktop computers that money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're treated like mature developers,'' says Shankar's
colleague, Andrew Wu, a junior at the University of Illinois. In
exchange, IBM gets relatively cheap labor from a band of absolutely
brilliant youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   IBM calls the program Extreme Blue, and the company values it
not only for the work the students do but also because it gives IBM
first crack at the world's best computer students.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of the program were planted in 1995. John Patrick,
IBM's vice president for Internet technology, was working on
projects to build large heavy-duty Web sites to provide the public
with information on major sporting events, such as the Olympic
Games in Atlanta. During the summer months, Patrick began hiring
bright college students to work on his projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet had actually started in a university
environment,'' said Patrick. ``We found it very useful for students
to be involved because they knew about the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Patrick noticed that the same students came back the
next summer and the next, excited by the chance to work on
real-world computing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, IBM already hired lots of summer interns, but these
kids were different. They were unusually smart and strongly
motivated, and they worked as much for the challenge as the
paycheck. Patrick and his colleague, IBM distinguished engineer
David Grossman, realized they'd stumbled across a superb way to
hire the next generation of distinguished engineers. ``We thought,
well, if it works for us on this scale, let's try and expand,''
said Grossman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ad hoc hiring, Patrick and Grossman set up a rigorous
program to identify and woo the best of the best. They culled
resumes from the nation's top colleges and subjected the candidates
to intense interviews.
</P>
<P>
   One common question: How do you design a high-security vending
machine? The idea wasn't to find the ``right'' answer, but to see
if the students had a basic understanding of the difficulties
involved and confidence they could tackle the problem. The goal,
said Patrick, was to find ``24 really good computer science
students who have no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Extreme Blue team came to IBM's Cambridge subsidiary,
Lotus Development Corp., in 1999. Students were divided into seven
teams, each led by an experienced IBM engineer, each devoted to the
creation of practical software that IBM planned to bring to market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one team developed improved software for managing
large Web sites. IBM will use this software to manage its Web site
for the Olympic Games in Sydney. Another project, Gryphon Message
Broker, enables a Web site to automatically send updated news
headlines to Internet computers around the world. IBM used this
product to provide up-to-date scores from the Australian Open
tennis tournament earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick was so pleased with the results that he doubled the size
of the project. This year, there are 48 Extremists _ half in
Cambridge, Mass., and half at IBM's research operation in San Jose,
Calif. The Cambridge team was recruited from the nation's top
schools: Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Georgia Tech, the University of
Illinois, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Cambridge team is totally devoted to software for
the open-source Linux operating system. All their work will be
published on the Internet, allowing fellow Linux programmers around
the world to offer improvements, criticisms, and even a few geekish
insults. ``Everything we write, people will be able to see and make
fun of,'' Shankar said. That's a strong incentive to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Shankar is part of the team that's creating Sash, a program that
will allow someone with limited coding skills to write powerful
programs. ``There are very, very few hard-core C hackers,'' says
Ari Heitner, a team member from Carnegie Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   But while few people know advanced languages like C or
C(plus-plus), many thousands can write simpler scripting languages
such as HTML or Javascript. In the Sash system, a script writer
will be able to write Web-based applications that can automatically
run advanced program modules downloaded from an online code
library. Instead of having to learn how to build a simple
spreadsheet program, the Sash user will be able to find a
prepackaged one and have it work with his other code.
</P>
<P>
   Another Extreme Blue team is designing a drag-and-drop interface
to work with Sash. Other projects include an effort to port IBM's
Workspace-on-Demand network management software to Linux, and a
Linux program that can be used to ``benchmark'' the performance of
computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all work. IBM keeps the Extremists entertained with
outings to museums, Red Sox games, and the like. After all, the
idea is to entice them to come to work for IBM once they graduate,
not to work them to exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, these students love to work _ so much so that most
of them plan to continue working on their Extreme Blue projects
once they return to school. IBM will continue to pay them for the
hours they work, and will let them keep the company laptops for as
long as they contribute fresh code.
</P>
<P>
   For the Extremists, the chance to work on real-world computing
problems is far more than a part-time job. It's a vital part of
their education, and perhaps the best part. ``This is like another
class,'' said Shankar, ``except it's cool.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bucking all predictions, US venture capital deals notched a new
record in the second quarter, as companies landed $19.58 billion in
financing, 14 percent more than in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The number of companies reaping funds inched up 1 percent, to
1,432, according to the Boston Globe-PricewaterhouseCoopers Money
Tree Survey. If venture capitalists showed a reluctance to quicken
their deal pace on the heels of the April technology stock dive,
they weren't stingy with their money: The average funding round
rose 13 percent to $13.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   New England remained the most active region after Silicon
Valley, as local startups grabbed 13.3 percent of the funds
invested nationally, or a record $2.61 billion, up from $2.42
billion in the first quarter. Silicon Valley claimed 35.1 percent
of total venture funding, or $6.87 billion, while the Southeast
ranked third, at 7.8 percent, or $1.54 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest sector in New England was telecommunications,
outpacing software, networking, and other technology sectors for
the first time in the survey's history, while consumer and
business-to-business financings sagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The b-to-b bloom has fallen off,'' said Bill Collatos,
managing general partner at Spectrum Equity Investors in Boston.
``People are now focused on the reality that b-to-b is only as
effective as the infrastructure that supports it.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming demand for telecommunications services _ from voice
and data lines to wireless technology _ is seen as a vast
investment opportunity for at least another five years. Consumers
around Boston were reminded last week of how integral these
services have become, as the workers' strike at Verizon
Communications made it harder to get directory assistance, new
lines, or repairs on modem hook-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, data traffic has taken over voice traffic on
the nation's telecommunications systems with the soaring use of the
Internet. Three years from now, data is expected to account for as
much as 70 percent of all the traffic, said Sanjay Mewada, director
of telecom/e-business analysis at the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tree,'' Mewada explained. ``As the trunk gets
bigger, the branches get bigger, and the connection points have to
become faster and more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of young companies scrambling to tackle this
problem, many of them led by former executives of Lucent
Technologies, AT&AMP;T, MCI, and the former Baby Bells. Fiberoptics _
light signals pulsing through glass fibers _ are attracting big
money, as are wireless technologies. And all the companies have
different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Bridge Communications of North Andover received $102.5
million of third-round financing in the second quarter, the
second-biggest funding the Bay State has seen. A Wallingford,
Conn., fiberoptics company, Cidra Corp., reaped $100 million, while
four other Massachusetts companies involved in communications
received more than $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Gray, a Boston partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers'
Technology Industry Group, marveled at the super-size deals being
inked in the region _ more than double the biggest financings 12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some companies may be recasting the way they
describe themselves to shed the unfashionable Internet category and
fit into telecom. At the same time, he said, ``The true telecom
companies need a lot more money than Internet companies do to
succeed.'' Such spending goes largely to hardware, research and
development, and building out networks.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum Bridge has just leased 100,000 square feet of new space
in Andover, more than tripling its current 30,000 square feet in
North Andover. The company has grown from 90 employees at the end
of 1999 to 220 now, and it expects that count to hit 300 by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Zona, Quantum's chief executive, said raising money has
been relatively easy. The company is backed by big name VCs,
including Atlas Venture, BancBoston Capital, New Enterprise
Associates, and Texas Pacific Group, among many others. He thinks
venture capitalists are betting heavily in the sector because
revenues and profits are clearly in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two technologies will be left standing _ optical
technology and wireless,'' Zona said. ``If you want capacity and
you want a high-speed experience, you're only going to get that
through optical technology.''
</P>
<P>
   David Barry, senior editor of Venture Capital &AMP; Information
Technology, a Wellesley-based trade journal, said part of the
allure of the communications companies for investors is that they
are attractive buyout candidates for the telecom giants, from Cisco
Systems Inc. and Lucent to Nortel Networks Corp. and Sycamore
Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions are coming earlier in the startups' lives and
at big premiums, Barry observed. ``You can start a company and
throw a few million dollars into it, and a Nortel will come along
and pay a billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Nortel has done a string of acquisitions. In July,
it agreed to buy Alteon WebSystems, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., for
$7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   If telecom enjoyed an embarrassment of riches in the second
quarter, the Web darlings of late 1999 went begging.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet-related companies nationwide saw their funding
rise 7.5 percent to $11.67 billion in the quarter, service
companies and applications players garnered the biggest share of
that money. Content sites, business-to-business companies and
e-commerce sites lost their luster after the April stock-market
dive and saw their financings drop off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sector rotation has been really, really fast,'' said Geoff
Yang, founding partner of Redpoint Ventures in Silicon Valley,
during a conference call hosted by the National Venture Capital
Association. ``There's no question that the shift in the public
markets has caused a shift in where VCs invest.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering window had closed abruptly in April
and May, sparking fears that venture capitalists would fund fewer
companies if they couldn't take other companies in their portfolios
public. But the IPO market has since rebounded to record levels _
and the venture money keeps flowing, but into different sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Top IPOs in the second quarter included Sonus Networks, a
Westford voice-infrastructure products company, which has soared a
stunning 763 percent. StorageNetworks Inc., a Waltham data storage
player, has seen its stock jump 330 percent, while shares of
Charles River Laboratories Holdings Inc., a Wilmington drug
development company, have risen 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, $36.7 billion of venture investments
nationwide have outpaced all of 1999, when $35.6 billion was
invested. Analysts and people who work with venture capitalists
said while the pace remained vigorous, deals were being done in
less haste than in the prior two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of investing feels less frantic than it did last
quarter,'' said Jesse Reyes, a vice president with venture
economics in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to worry that communications is overheating, just as
b-to-c and b-to-b did? That time could be just around the corner,
pros warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems all the momentum money is moving into
communications,'' Yang said. If the financing trend follows what
happened in the Internet arena, copycat companies will soon start
to surface, trying to muscle in on hot sectors. ``We haven't seen
that yet,'' Yang said. ``But it wouldn't surprise me.''
</P>
<P>
   Collatos of Spectrum said surely all the telecom startups won't
make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these companies are being acquired on promise, not
proven revenues,'' he said. ``That sounds remarkably like the
Internet environment of the last three years.''

ONCE THE MONEY'S PUMPED IN, THE RESTRUCTURING BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Once the money arrives, the ax can fall swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 45 days after Boston's Bain Capital pumped $50 million
into a high-tech spinoff of Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co., the company
has a new strategy, a new CEO, and 80 fewer jobs _ the result of a
24 percent job cut.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Interpath Communications Inc., is an application
service provider, or ASP, which runs Web applications and provides
data services for large and midsize companies. It is now 65 percent
owned by Bain Capital, a powerful private-equity firm. The other 35
percent stake is held by Interpath's former parent, a Raleigh,
N.C.-based utility, which also invested $50 million in late June.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fox, Interpath's executive vice president in charge of
strategy and alliances, calls the firings a ``final transition
step'' after two months of rejiggering strategy and stripping away
anything at the company not related to the ASP business.
</P>
<P>
   Who led the process? Not just the investment guys at Bain, but
their cousins at Bain Consulting, who sat by the Interpath
executives and helped them develop their new business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a very targeted plan right now, which is something
we haven't had before,'' Fox says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it hasn't been an entirely enjoyable process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very challenging,'' Fox concedes, ``and it's been
very encouraging.'' He says cutting costs and duplication are
important under the new regime, especially with $100 million at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the most prudent deployment of that funding
commitment,'' Fox says. ``We don't want to be another one of these
Internet companies just bleeding money left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   While start-ups with venture backing lately have been feeling
pressured to spend more cautiously, that pressure has always
existed in the private equity realm. There, firms like Bain Capital
make big bets to acquire a controlling interest in a company, with
a goal of quickly improving its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Barry, senior editor at the Private Equity Analyst in
Wellesley, notes that in most private equity deals, ``They're
investing because there's something wrong.'' He adds: ``They're
doing what needs to be done and turning it around.''
</P>
<P>
   The people at Interpath must be aware they're not part of a big,
old-economy utility any more. Bain recently installed its pick for
chief executive, Joel Schleicher, a former Nextel president. And
the spinoff recently acquired a leading Australian ASP, Alta
Internet Business Centres, as part of a new plan to expand
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   If Bain has its way, Interpath will surely go public down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Names are a funny thing in the new economy. They can be clumsy,
as start-ups settle for odd domain names. They are sometimes
lucrative. Or cute. And occasionally they're something to fight
about.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Wine, the New York restaurateur who ran the famous Quilted
Giraffe in the go-go '80s, has bought up dozens of domain names
that he thinks could pay off, from the quirky to the outright
funny.
</P>
<P>
   He has names from EatCaviar.com and EatOlives.com to
BakeCake.com and GrillSteak.com. He's also got SipCognac.com and
DrinkSake.com.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it gets better. He also owns WirelessDonuts.com,
WirelessCurry.com, and WirelessBurgers.com. Perhaps easier to
understand are WirelessBars, Hotels and Inns.
</P>
<P>
   Wine, a Tufts grad, envisions a world where, if you were in San
Francisco on business and wanted to find a burger joint, you could
simply consult the Web device you carry around with you. Granted,
the information you'd get might be biased. A burger seller could be
a candidate to get behind Wine's burger site, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a technology guy,'' Wine says. But, as he sees it,
``wireless is kind of a brand of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fighting end of the name business, note that the eRoom
Systems Technologies Inc., a Las Vegas room service company that
went public recently without a bang, is not the eRoom Technology of
Cambridge, Mass., with lots of venture backing, a trademark on the
name, and a Web-based project-management product.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beir, CEO of the Cambridge eRoom, says names matter more
than they ever did before, because ``the Web puts more information
at everybody's fingertips.'' He's confident the two companies are
so different they won't be confused. But, he notes: ``They should
have been more careful.''

UPSTART LOOKS TO UNSEAT GAMING'S GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; OAKLAND, Calif. _ Every once in A while, a plan comes along
that seems so outrageous and suicidal that it forces people to pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Gildred, 29, has come up with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   A nobody in the clubby world of Silicon Valley, Gildred is
starting Indrema Corp., a company making the first video game
console to use the Linux operating system. Linux is known as the
renegade software credited with loosening Microsoft Corp.'s iron
grip on the market for computer operating systems. It is also known
for its cuddly penguin mascot.
</P>
<P>
   And Gildred is Mr. Penguin on his wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   He is taking on Sony Computer Entertainment, Microsoft, Sega
Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co. _ Goliaths in the video game
business.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the Valley of Dreams, where people are encouraged to
think big, brash, and bold. Gildred's plan is nothing if not bold.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what he's up against. Microsoft recently said it will
spend half a billion dollars just to market its game console, the
X-Box, due out in the fall of 2001. Sony, the Godzilla of gaming,
will unleash its much-anticipated next-generation console, the
PlayStation2, in October. Sega has sold 2 million units of its
DreamCast console, and expects to sell another 3 million in the
next year. In Nintendo's arsenal are Pokemon, the cartoon
sensation, and a new console currently under tight wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indrema clearly has its challenges lined up,'' said P.J.
McNealy, a senior analyst with the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
   It's entirely possible Indrema will crash and burn, even before
next year when its console is scheduled to hit store shelves. The
Valley is littered with similarly quixotic efforts. But this is
also a Valley of Dreams populated by a handful of unlikely
survivors, including Apple Computer Corp., once an unruly upstart
in an IBM-dominated world. And there is, of course, Napster Inc.,
which is turning the entire music industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Indrema have going for it?
</P>
<P>
   In a word: Linux. The operating system has a fanatical following
of engineers who work tirelessly to crank out Linux software.
Gildred is betting the grass-roots Linux crowd will come up with
the Blair Witch Project of video games. Gildred also says the
Indrema platform will be easier than other closed, proprietary
platforms for developers, making it cheaper and faster to make
games for the Indrema. The typical video game takes 18 months and
several million dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Indrema is also lining up support from other companies,
including Red Hat Inc., Linuxcare Inc., and CollabNet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do is enable innovation and creation, so developers
can make it to market without spending a lot of money,'' said
Gildred, who founded OpenSoft Corp., an Internet software company.
``We're reducing the barriers to entry for developers, and that
changes all the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   To have half a chance, Indrema has to change the rules, which
are heavily stacked against the start-up. One rule is that it takes
a fortune to build a brand name. It's unclear whether Indrema,
backed by angel investors who typically don't invest more than $1
million each, has the resources to go up against Microsoft's
upcoming $500 million marketing blitzkrieg.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge has to do with the console itself. Billed as
an ``entertainment system,'' the Indrema is expected to be able to
play digital MP3 music files, browse the Internet, play digital
video discs, record television programs, support interactive
television programming, as well as play video games such as Quake
III Arena and Unreal Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``A platform needs focus,'' said Ed Fries, vice president of
games publishing at Microsoft. ``If it does everything but bake
bread, is it necessarily going to be the best gaming console?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Indrema has to find developers who will make
blockbuster games, said McNealy. With fewer than 50 employees,
Indrema is battling companies with hundreds, if not thousands, of
in-house game developers.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Linux comes in, said Gildred. The open source
operating system makes it easier for independent developers to
create games for Indrema than for proprietary systems of their
rivals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a new player with no name recognition, the only way
to get in is to change the rules,'' said Gildred. ``We're going to
redefine what it means to develop software for games.''

ENTERTAINMENT: GOING INTERACTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Couch potatoes beware. Interactive television is coming.
</P>
<P>
   A whole industry is emerging on the notion that people will want
to click, surf, and shop on their TVs. Its members met this month
in Los Angeles at the eTV World convention.
</P>
<P>
   While keynote speaker and Liberate Technologies CEO Mitchell
Kertzman enthused over the future of interactive television, most
attendees were still trying to defend against the obvious question:
Do people really want to interact with their TVs?
</P>
<P>
   Television is a passive technology. Turn on, tune out.
</P>
<P>
   It's true industry-sponsored research shows that a majority of
interactive TV viewers will click on their screens. But most do so
only out of curiosity and return to their programming, said Dennis
Marshall, market development manager for a San Francisco cable
channel experimenting with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just want to see what happens,'' said Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, very little happens. That's because programming for
interactive television is still embryonic. Aside from the ability
to play virtual Jeopardy and buy cookbooks, the iTV landscape is
still pretty bare, even in Europe, where there are about 7 million
users. That's all going to change, according to Forrester Research
in Cambridge, which projects interactive TV to become a $20
billion-a-year industry by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stabs have been made at iTV, starting in 1979 with
Warner Amex's service in Columbus, Ohio. In 1995, both GTE and Time
Warner made separate failed attempts. This time, executives say the
Internet will change everything. It will enable viewers to rent
movies or games whenever they want. Users will also be able to
teleconference, get sports statistics on demand, choose camera
angles during sports broadcasts, send e-mail, surf the Web, and buy
that lovely pink sweater Jennifer Aniston wears on her TV show,
``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will viewers want to do any of that after a hard day in
their interaction-packed jobs? A recent survey commissioned by Red
Herring magazine shows ambivalence. Consumers liked choosing camera
angles, ordering movies, video conferencing, and being able to
watch their favorite programs whenever they wanted. Dead last on
their list of likes: shopping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a company to keep an eye on, literally. PacketVideo, the
first company in the world to transmit video over a cellular
network, is now giving consumers something to watch: Marvin the
Martian. In a deal with Warner Bros., PacketVideo in San Diego will
be distributing four animation series over its wireless technology,
with Marvin as the extraterrestrial spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only consumers who buy Compaq's iPaq Pocket PC can see
the cartoons by using a wireless Internet connection. But Rob
Tercek, PacketVideo's president and a former Sony Corp. executive,
envisions a future in where videos can stream wirelessly to any
gadget, including cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, few will want to watch full-length movies on a
three-inch screen, Tercek acknowledges. There will be other uses.
Among them are news clips, music videos, short films, animation,
games, and checking on ``traffic cams'' or ``nanny cams,'' Tercek
predicts. While Finland and Japan are already capable of wirelessly
transmitting Internet data at speeds comparable to dial-up
connections, the United States is at least 18 months away from
being able to support wireless streaming video on a mass scale. In
other words, don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tethered populace can watch the first cartoon
series on traditional network television that began as an Internet
``webisode.'' Called ``Starship Regulars,'' the science fiction
spoof started as a cartoon on Icebox.com, a Los Angeles-based Web
site that develops original animation. The series debuts this month
on Showtime's Sci-Friday lineup.

BAY STATE START-UP QUICKDOT QUIETLY ROARS TO LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Flying under the mass media's radar, a little
start-up company here has quietly attracted nearly 5 million global
subscribers for a new Internet communications service that melds
instant messaging, traditional e-mail, and the digital equivalent
of Post-It Notes.
</P>
<P>
   QuickDot.com has employed ``viral marketing'' _ or friends
getting friends to sign up _ to enroll 4.8 million users for its
messaging service, the company is reporting. It plans to bring the
service to wireless phones later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar in some ways to free Internet-based e-mail systems such
as Microsoft's Hotmail, Quickdot offers the equivalent of a
no-charge Web-based blackboard on which people can leave short
notes for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Based on new subscribers inviting other people to ``dot'' with
them, people can create a messaging system separate from their
often spam-laden e-mail inbox to focus on a small group of friends,
family members or business associates with whom they most want to
communicate over the course of a day.
</P>
<P>
   After assembling one or more groups of people, such as a work
group and a social-life group, users log in to the Quickdot page
and get a two-column display. The left side shows
</P>
<P>
   the most recent message written by a sender, and the right side
shows the most recent response the subscriber has sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem that we're solving is really pretty simple: Make
it easier to stay in touch with that core, inner-circle group of 10
or 20 people that most matter to you,'' said John Wang, Quickdot's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickdot doesn't replace e-mail for me'' or many other users,
Wang acknowledged. But it simplifies talking to ``the top of my
pyramid or my innermost circle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Quickdot subscribers may use the system to post a
note to 10 friends (such as, ``Do you want to meet at the movies
tonight at 7?'') and check the site to see who has responded they
are coming. Or a group of people working at a company can use it to
post short reminders or sales leads for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Gardner, director of messaging and directory services with
the Aberdeen Group, a Boston consulting firm, said: ``It has some
of the virtues of instant messaging, but it doesn't require the
other person to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner says he thinks the service could prove especially
popular among people under 30 who are most likely to have joined
the instant messaging craze _ especially teenagers who these days
may be far more likely to spend an evening ``I-M-ing'' with friends
rather than talking over the phone as their parents might have at
their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole young-adult class of user is much more in tune with
it, but I appreciate the value of it in the overall spectrum of
communicating,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Quickdot's rapid growth is comparable to Hotmail, the free
Web-based e-mail service launched in California on Independence Day
1996. In little over a year, before the Net was as widely accepted
a phenomenon as it is today, Hotmail attracted 5 million
subscribers. That drew the eye of Microsoft, which bought the
company for an undisclosed sum in December 1997 when it was up to
10 million accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, under the aegis of Microsoft's MSN portal, Hotmail
has grown to 67 million active users globally, subscribers who used
the account at least once in the last three months. As of May, MSN
Hotmail said it was signing up new users at the rate of 270,000
accounts per day, driven in part by the same word-of-mouth
phenomenon as Quickdot.
</P>
<P>
   Wang came up with the idea of offering the equivalent of
Web-based Post-it Notes while awaiting the birth of his daughter
two years ago. He founded the company in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It has been backed by $6 million from Charles River Ventures and
Comdisco. By relying on no-cost recruitment by existing members
instead of advertising campaigns, it hopes to be able to turn a
profit from business partnerships and banner ads shown at the top
of its page.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Quickdot, which uses the Exodus Web page
hosting service in Waltham, has deliberately been trying to avoid
publicity in order to make sure its technology can accommodate
rapid growth. It has also sought to amass a large subscriber base
before a bigger player such as America Online or MSN caught on and
decided to offer a similar service.
</P>
<P>
   Quickdot officials now feel confident they are ready to begin
trying to match Hotmail-like growth. Given the rate of growth so
far, Wang is bold enough to say: ``If you do the math, eventually
we touch the whole human race.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next phase of growth, Quickdot has developed a system to
bring its technology to wireless phones. Already being used
internally by the company's 35 employees, Wang hopes to launch it
commercially this fall. Quickdot estimates that more than 50
percent of its users already own a wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Microsoft and Yahoo have launched efforts to make their
e-mail service available over Net-connected wireless phones from
AT&AMP;T Wireless, Nextel, Sprint PCS, and Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   But using a phone screen to scroll through an e-mail inbox laden
with junk mail to open worthwhile messages can be frustrating, and
composing responses with the keypad is tediously slow.
</P>
<P>
   Quickdot's wireless version has been configured to show first
the most recent new messages received from ``dotting partners,''
and would allow users to send back precomposed responses such as
``Acknowledged _ will get back to you later.''
</P>
<P>
   Another feature would allow a user checking Quickdot messages to
press a single key to place a call from the phone to the sender,
based on people listing phone numbers with the service.

FIRMS MOVE US TOWARD WIRELESS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look in back of any computer and you'll see a bird's nest of
tangled wires. There are keyboard, mouse, and printer connections,
and probably a link to the corporate network or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Take a good look, because in a few years many of those wires
will likely be gone. Keyboards and mice will invisibly broadcast
their commands to the computer. The computer will communicate with
the printer in the same way. In many businesses, the corporate
network will be completely wireless. Even Internet service will be
broadcast to the computer, at speeds rivaling today's high-speed
data wires.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready for a wireless world, where electronic devices of
every type _ laptops, palmtops, PCs, even cars _ talk to each other
without any sort of physical hookup. New data broadcasting systems
already are on drawing boards, or beginning to appear in new
products. When all of these new systems are finally in place, a
power cord may become the only wire many of us ever need.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being in a meeting, your laptop on the table in front of
you. Suddenly you realize that you forgot to bring a vitally
important document. But just as the shock hits you, a message pops
up on your computer screen: ``Never mind. I brought it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's your business partner, seated in front of her laptop, 10
feet away. She saw the look on your face, guessed the reason, and
fired off a message to ease your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she might have typed: ``Didn't YOU bring it?'' It
doesn't matter. The important thing is how two people sitting 10
feet apart can send messages to each other's computers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible thanks to Bluetooth, a new technology that'll
begin appearing in electronic devices later this year. Bluetooth is
a short-range radio data networking system that enables devices to
talk to each other at speeds approaching 800,000 bits per second
over distances of up to 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem absurd to design a broadcasting system with such
short range. But consider the distance between a keyboard or mouse
and a computer, or the distance between the computer and the
printer. Bluetooth was designed to link all of these devices to one
amother without ever having to plug in a wire.
</P>
<P>
   Says Mike McGuire, a wireless networking analyst at the research
firm Dataquest: ``It's going to be very cool for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluetooth could also allow quick data connections between all
kinds of electronic devices. A Bluetooth chip in a car, for
instance, could allow the driver to pump gas and drive away; the
Bluetooth-equipped pump would ``talk'' to the car and arrange
payment. Add Bluetooth to a palmtop computer or cell phone, and
there'd be no need for a credit card. Your chip would just
broadcast the data to a chip in the store's cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bluetooth evolves the way we think it will, it'll be a very
ubiquitous technology,'' says Jeff Clark, program director for
technology development at IBM Corp.'s Personal Systems Group, based
in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to exaggerate the tech industry's eagerness to bring
Bluetooth to market. Since the technology was first proposed in
1997, more than 1,800 of the world's top hardware and software
makers have banded together to create a global standard to ensure
that all Bluetooth products will be compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ranging from IBM to a tiny British start-up, Cambridge
Silicon Radio, are designing Bluetooth chips and the software to
make them work. Wireless titan Motorola has begun making Bluetooth
devices that can be plugged into the PC Card slots of existing
laptops, or installed in automobiles at the factory. International
Data Corp. recently predicted that nearly 450 million devices
worldwide will use Bluetooth by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But Bluetooth won't catch on overnight. As a network technology,
it faces the standard chicken-and-egg problem. Bluetooth is of
little use until millions of people have it, but those millions
won't buy it until other millions already own it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the system suffers from a rather ironic technical
problem: Bluetooth signals may be scrambled by signals from a more
powerful wireless networking system, one that could be used to link
all of the computers in an office or home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's coined a clever name for this networking system; it's
simply called by its technical name, IEEE 802.11. But this
technology, which is already widely available, offers ordinary
people a simple alternative to costly and confusing wire-based
local area networks, or LANs.
</P>
<P>
   By adding 802.11 network transceivers to a group of computers,
they can all begin talking to one another at speeds of up to 11
million bits per second. That compares to the 10 million bits per
second found in many wired office LANs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with wired networks have no reason to switch to
802.11, especially since upgraded network hardware now allows
transmission speeds of 100 million bits or even 1 billion bits over
wired networks. But a company setting up a new office might use
802.11 to create a quick, cheap wireless LAN. And homeowners with
no desire to string ethernet wire all over the house might find
802.11 a happy alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer Inc. has already staked out the home networking
market. The company's AirPort wireless LAN system uses the 802.11
standard to let a houseful of Macintosh computers communicate
cordlessly at distances of up to 100 feet. On the PC side, a number
of companies, including Boston's Zoom Telephonics Inc., are making
add-on 802.11 adapters for home and business use.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough sell so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market did not take off as fast in 1999 and even 2000 as
we had anticipated,'' admits Zoom spokesman Larry Hancock. He
blames an upgrade in the 802.11 software standard that boosted its
speed but caused potential buyers to wait for the dust to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock now expects surging demand for 802.11 products, based on
his company's estimate that more than a quarter of all American
homes now have two or more machines and thus an incentive to hook
them up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, 802.11 and Bluetooth don't always get along. Both
services use the same general region of the radio spectrum, but
802.11 signals are far more powerful than Bluetooth waves. As a
result, 802.11 networks can sometimes disrupt Bluetooth signals.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers are working the problem at both ends, looking for ways
to make the two systems play nicely together.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major design challenge for some of the guys,'' says
Dataquest's McGuire. And one that'll put a damper on the market for
either Bluetooth or 802.11 _ or both.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's another major wireless technology on the
horizon, spurred by demand for high-speed Internet access. Millions
of Americans still can't get access to high-speed cable modem or
DSL telephone service. So a number of companies are moving to bring
them fast Internet service via the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Cooper helped invent the cellular phone when he worked
for Motorola. Now Cooper is chairman and CEO of ArrayComm Inc.,
which has designed a cellular-type system called iBurst that can
deliver megabits of digital data to mobile computer users or
stay-at-home types.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do voice,'' says Cooper. ``The system is designed
specifically for the Internet. . . . We're using all of the
bandwidth for data.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the iBurst system can pump data so much faster
than the 9,600 or so bits per second provided by today's cell phone
modems.
</P>
<P>
   iBurst divides an area into multiple cells, each with a total
data capacity of 40 million bits per second. The amount available
to each user varies by the number of users logged on to a cell at
any given time. In heavy-demand areas, more cells can be added to
boost available bandwidth. And because the system uses the cellular
approach, subscribers aren't tied down to a single location.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the service isn't intended to be used by someone
moving quickly, such as a commuter train passenger. But it would
enable a laptop user to go from his home to the public library and
instantly get high-speed Web access when he arrives. The system
would also enable a new generation of cell phones that could easily
download videos or music recordings for later use.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper believes his system could make a profit while charging
consumers just $25 a month. But for now, iBurst remains vaporware,
confined to ArrayComm's San Jose labs. It'll cost billions to
deploy such a system nationwide. But at least one major corporation
thinks it can be done. In April, Sony Corp. invested $6 million in
ArrayComm. Then, in June, the FCC granted the company a trial
license to test its service in San Diego next year. If it works
according to plan, Cooper hopes to deploy iBurst in 100 US cities
by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   For people who need Internet speed but not mobility, the
solution could be MMDS, or multipoint multichannel distribution
service. Basically it's broadcast Internet, with high-speed data
streams radiated from towers scattered all over a city. Customers
install receiver antennas similar to those used by satellite-TV
subscribers, and instantly get access to 1 million bits of data per
second.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless phone company Sprint is a leading proponent of
MMDS, and has deployed the service in Phoenix and Tucson, where
consumers pay $40 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Conway, vice president of marketing and product development
at Sprint's broadband wireless group, says 5,000 Phoenix residents
have signed up since May, even though the company has not
advertised the service. Conway credits word of mouth as well as
``broadband envy,'' an ailment that afflicts Internet users who
can't get cable modem or DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom Inc., Sprint's erstwhile partner in a merger recently
blocked by the federal government, is conducting its own MMDS trial
in the Boston area. If the system pans out, customers won't need to
wait for the phone or cable company to plug them into the Internet.
And if they add Bluetooth and an 802.11 wireless LAN, they won't
need to plug in much of anything.

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the wrestling industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WCW and Vince Russo are going to fire Goldberg. Not likely.
Despite the scenario played out at the ``New Blood Rising''
pay-per-view, Goldberg is not going anywhere and Russo is not going
to fire him. Expect this to become the WWF's long-running Vince
McMahon-Steve Austin feud come to life in the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   And who says Vince Russo lacks any original thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   In case the WCW doesn't get it, the wrestling fans do. For
example, at the pay-per-view, announcer Michael Buffer proclaimed
Booker T ``the people's champion.'' What did the crowd do, they
chanted ``Rocky, Rocky'' for the whole match awaiting the WWF's
people's champion, The Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Now if Vince only had some 20-something kids he could get to
help him ...
</P>
<P>
   _ With Vince McMahon's return to ``Raw'' expect to see a battle
for power in the WWF between McMahon and commissioner Mick Foley in
the fall. Foley still holds WWF crowds and his antics have been
some of the most popular in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerry ``The King'' Lawler returned to the ring last week.
Lawler has been making appearances in the ring for the WWF minor
league organization in his hometown of Memphis. Lawler will battle
Tazz at ``SummerSlam.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Which bring us to a possible WCW or should I say NWA rip-off.
WCW commentator Mark Madden says he thinks the feud between Tazz
and Lawler is a tribute to former Georgia Championship Wrestling
announcer Gordon Solie, who spent years working with a heel
broadcast partner _ Roddy Piper. Eventually, Piper punched out Don
Moraco in defense of Solie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of ``SummerSlam,'' here's the most recent set of
matches. The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Kurt Angle for the heavyweight
championship; Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho; Undertaker vs. Kane;
Edge &AMP; Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. the Dudley Boyz for the tag
team title and Val Venis vs. Eddie Guerrero for the
Intercontinental Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also Steven Regal will return to the WWF for the Aug. 28 ``Raw
is War.'' Regal has been working in Memphis for the WWF. He is
trying to return from a series on injuries that has kept him on the
shelf for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Now Napster is going to have problems. The WWF's next CD _
``WWF The Music Volume 5'' _ is available for a free download on
the Internet's embattled free music site. And Napster thought
Metallica was angry.
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``Smackdown'' the WWF hyped the movie ``Highlander: End
Game.'' It will open in theaters on Sept. 1 and the WWF's Edge
appears in a few scenes.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to WWF announcer Jim Ross' weekly report, ``Stone
Cold'' Steve Austin met with his neurosurgeon last Thursday for an
examination of his surgically repaired spine. Dr. Lloyd Youngblood
feels that Austin could possibly return to action as early as
October. Austin will have another exam in six weeks. Of course with
the time off, Austin met with an orthopedic physician in San
Antonio about his knees and whether he is wearing the proper braces
to heal.

 &HT;    Online banking growing rapidly
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That traditional but unconvincing excuse _ ``The check is in the
mail,'' has gotten even flimsier for the 10 percent of U.S.
households who bank on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10.5 million households used online banks last year
for bill-paying, checking accounts, credit cards and loans, buying
certificates of deposits or other financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many. ``People's money is something they are
always interested in following,'' said Jim Bruene, editor and
founder of the Online Banking Report newsletter. ``Online is an
easier way to do it, rather than waiting to look at a printed
statement once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors: More families have access to the Internet. Banks
have made it easier to use. And the array of services has
increased.
</P>
<P>
   More banks have rushed in to compete for that business, too.
Search for U.S.-based banks at www.onlinebankingreport
</P>
<P>
   .com, and you will find 789 listings. Some are only online. Many
more are subsidiaries of existing banks, large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond convenience, some online banks also offer higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit than
conventional banks, no monthly fees and free online bill-paying
services.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors account for rapid growth since the first
online banking services appeared in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. You can't make cash deposits. You can
make direct deposits of your paychecks, but you have to mail in
other checks. ``Some people are really not happy with the downtime
until their money is deposited in their accounts,'' said Greg
McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be delays paying bills. A number of corporations,
such as AT&AMP;T, will accept electronic payment now. About half of
bill payments are made by that swift route, according to Bruene.
But the rest go from your online bank by mail.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based
watchdog organization, found that some online banks make it hard to
get questions answered, through the banks' Web sites or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   True online banks have no ATMs, of course. Nor do they have
branch offices where you can talk to real people about real
problems. ``People want to work with someone they trust with their
money,'' Bruene said. ``Who do you trust more than your existing
bank?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruene expects rapid growth to continue. He believes 15
million households will use online banks or credit unions by the
end of this year, and 20 million by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will be happy with that. One recent study showed that the
cost of a full-service teller transaction is $1.07. The bank spent
27 cents for each ATM transaction _ but only 1 cent for
Internet-based transactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to open an online account, it pays to shop
carefully.

   Interest rates differ considerably on checking accounts and CDs.
No-fee checking accounts and bill-paying are the norm, but not
universal.

Network Bank is best overall, Wachovia is the easiest to use and
USAccess Bank has the lowest overall cost.
</P>
<P>
   It will also pay to ask yourself some questions. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Am I comfortable with computers?
</P>
<P>
   Online banking requires basic computer skills and confidence to
entrust both money and financial information to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you amenable to banking with an entity you can't tangibly
see?'' asked Bankrate.com's McBride. ``The primary objection seems
to be placing your money with an institution that is more virtual
than traditional bricks and mortar, and that may be in a different
part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What services do I want?
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost accounts are an attractive feature, as are the
relatively high interest some online banks pay on checking accounts
and CDs. A tidy process for bill-paying attracts others.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're accustomed to meeting your money at the
neighborhood ATM, you'll have to consider how much the fees will
be. If you remember Jimmy Stewart as the infinitely kind banker in
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' rest assured you will not meet
him _ or any other real person _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How do I know an online bank is safe?
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action recommends looking for ``128-bit encryption,''
the standard in the industry, and for a written guarantee to
protect account holders from losses due to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   You should also visit www.fdic.gov to check whether the bank
you're considering has deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do I still want face-to-face contact?
</P>
<P>
   Most people do. At least 95 percent of online bank customers use
the online services of a traditional bank, according to Bruene.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is the trust that comes from maintaining an
existing relationship with a bank, he said.

 &HT;    Online banking growing rapidly
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That traditional but unconvincing excuse _ ``The check is in the
mail,'' has gotten even flimsier for the 10 percent of U.S.
households who bank on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10.5 million households used online banks last year
for bill-paying, checking accounts, credit cards and loans, buying
certificates of deposits or other financial services.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many. ``People's money is something they are
always interested in following,'' said Jim Bruene, editor and
founder of the Online Banking Report newsletter. ``Online is an
easier way to do it, rather than waiting to look at a printed
statement once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors: More families have access to the Internet. Banks
have made it easier to use. And the array of services has
increased.
</P>
<P>
   More banks have rushed in to compete for that business, too.
Search for U.S.-based banks at www.onlinebankingreport
</P>
<P>
   .com, and you will find 789 listings. Some are only online. Many
more are subsidiaries of existing banks, large and small.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond convenience, some online banks also offer higher interest
rates on checking accounts and certificates of deposit than
conventional banks, no monthly fees and free online bill-paying
services.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors account for rapid growth since the first
online banking services appeared in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. You can't make cash deposits. You can
make direct deposits of your paychecks, but you have to mail in
other checks. ``Some people are really not happy with the downtime
until their money is deposited in their accounts,'' said Greg
McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be delays paying bills. A number of corporations,
such as AT&AMP;T, will accept electronic payment now. About half of
bill payments are made by that swift route, according to Bruene.
But the rest go from your online bank by mail.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based
watchdog organization, found that some online banks make it hard to
get questions answered, through the banks' Web sites or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   True online banks have no ATMs, of course. Nor do they have
branch offices where you can talk to real people about real
problems. ``People want to work with someone they trust with their
money,'' Bruene said. ``Who do you trust more than your existing
bank?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruene expects rapid growth to continue. He believes 15
million households will use online banks or credit unions by the
end of this year, and 20 million by the end of 2001.

 &HT;    Funny you should ask
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Kristofor, my son and only child, insists
that his frequent phone calls home are nothing less than an
adventure into never-never land where he often hesitates to ask me
what I'm up to fearing that I'll answer him
</P>
<P>
   truthfully. He does assure me, however, that my ``differences''
are entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, I know of no differences, and I tell him so. Unless,
of course, this morning counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mum,'' he chirps from his end of the long distance line.
``What's shaking?'' I ask him if he can hold. He says he can.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty seconds later, I'm back. ``Nothing,'' I tell him. He's
confused. ``I'm answering your question. Nothing's shaking around
here.'' He wants to know why I'm chuckling and I tell him it's
because of all the times I asked him the same
</P>
<P>
   question and he gave me the same answer. Kind of like the son
becoming the father of the woman _ or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he wants to know why, if I'm doing nothing, I'm
breathing so hard. I should have lied, but it's not my style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to crawl back in the office window and I was afraid I'd
drop the shovel,'' I explain. There's a moment's silence which
means he's waiting for more, so I keep going. ``When you called, I
was head-first out the office window
</P>
<P>
   with a shovel in my left hand, and at the same time trying to
get a grip on the sill with my right. I didn't think it would be a
good idea to let go of either one, so I wrapped my left leg around
the shovel thinking that would give me a
</P>
<P>
   free hand to reach through the window and pick up the phone.
Then, when I tried to crawl back in to talk to you, somehow the
shovel got cross-ways in the window and I had to mess with it to
get it back in. It's heavy, and that's why
</P>
<P>
   I'm breathing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   When he doesn't say anything right away I figure he's trying to
visualize the situation before he hollers at me. It doesn't take
long. ``Mom,'' he says sternly, ``haven't I told you to stay off
the porch roof _ with or without a shovel...or a broom...or
whatever else you might have decided to carry out the window with
you? You're going to roll off and mess up your new landscaping.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason, I explain, that I couldn't let go of the
shovel _ because it would have slipped down the roof and landed on
a holly bush. Then it occurs to him to ask what exactly I was
intending to do with the shovel.
</P>
<P>
   The raccoon is back, I tell him, and has chosen a spot on the
roof, right next to the downspout, for his outhouse. Delicacy keeps
me from even trying to describe the foul heap of droppings directly
under my bedroom window, but at
</P>
<P>
   least now I know where my raspberries have gone.
</P>
<P>
   When the phone rang, I was crouched on the roof trying to figure
out what to do with the mess once I had it on the shovel. I
couldn't very well dump it into the newly-planted front yard. How
would that look? Holly, hosta, and a pile of
</P>
<P>
   raccoon doo? Nor could I give it a good fling and run the risk
of hitting a neighbor out for a morning constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   I'd thought about maybe shoveling it into a bucket and lowering
it over the roof's edge on a rope, but quickly realized the odds of
my following the bucket over the gutter were tilted in favor of
gravity. I imagined the headlines in
</P>
<P>
   tomorrow's paper: Gibsonburg eccentric maimed in fall from porch
roof _ mysterious substance in bucket under analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor suggested I call someone. And say what, I asked him.
``Hello? 9-1-1? Can you come right over? I'm having a raccoon doo
doo emergency.'' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, my situation brings to mind the old pilots' lament
about running out of ideas and altitude at the same time _ which is
exactly what I have done.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with the raccoon, it's business as usual _ on my
roof.

 &HT;    Sen. Ellis asks right questions about criminal justice in Texas
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Cruz was all of 12 mentally when Texas stuck a poison IV
in him last week.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he had 33 years to grow up didn't make it so. With
an IQ of between 64 and 76, his body was all man, but his mind was
wedged somewhere between Pokemon and Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Retarded though he was, Cruz was bright compared to Felipe
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has an IQ between 40 and 50. A functional
kindergartner, he spent 13 months in jail without legal
representation _ unable to read, unable to understand the charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Rodriguez was released from a Panhandle jail when a
judge dropped charges of burglary and arson. It is unclear exactly
what the man did. Without counsel, he had confessed to burning two
vacant buildings in Tulia, Texas. Ultimately he was ruled
incompetent to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two retarded men, one flushed away, one locked away for a year
without representation. Texas justice.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Cruz's crime _ a rape and stabbing _ was horrific. The
jury ruled he knew right from wrong. A 12-year-old ought to.
</P>
<P>
   In its last session the Texas Legislature came close to passing
a bill sponsored by State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, to prohibit
executions of the retarded. Twelve states do. Gov. George Bush
opposed the bill, saying current laws suffice to establish mental
competence. But competence and retardation are separate issues. The
question: Do we execute a child trapped in a man's body?
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Texas' response: Don't bother us with such questions.
</P>
<P>
   One who won't stop asking is Sen. Ellis. He has been one of
Texas' chief advocates for better criminal representation for the
poor and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Rodriguez, the mental kindergartner jailed for more
than year without legal representation, reminded observers of
another Ellis bill, this one vetoed by Bush. It would have required
an attorney for indigent defendants within 20 days of being
charged.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would have allowed counties to set up public
defender offices.
</P>
<P>
   Legal representation of the poor is strictly a local matter in
Texas. The state spends no money on it. It also has no minimum
standards for when someone without representation must be assigned
an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The more one examines the situation, the more one realizes that
the two chief benefits of having lackluster court-appointed
attorneys are (1) dollars and (2) cents. They save taxpayers money
by not presenting a zealous defense, not straining the docket with
appeals, sometimes not even showing up.
</P>
<P>
   It is so easy to let these things slide. Unless someone has a
loved one thrown in jail or has his own hide hanging, why should
one worry about the rights of the accused?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately we have someone like Ellis. He was front-and-center
pressing for a re-examination of the case against Roy Criner,
convicted in connection with a 1986 rape and murder in Montgomery
County. DNA tests found that the semen in the victim wasn't
Criner's. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Recently a district judge requested a pardon for Criner. Monday,
Bush said that he will grant it.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't more people asking the questions that Sen. Ellis
asks? Why are rights of the accused such a hard sell? Expedience,
expedience.
</P>
<P>
   As for the execution of one more retarded individual, the act
reveals the death penalty to be as much a matter of disposition as
it is justice.

HOUSTON'S BLUE OCTOBER TAKES ANTHEMS OF ANGST AND HOPE TO A
NATIONAL STAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL D. CLARK 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
HOUSTON _ Blue October lead singer Justin Furstenfeld offers a
variety of reasons for writing more than 200 songs in just 12 years
about pain and emotional loss. If you have enough time, he'll tell
you every last one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   High school loneliness, dalliances with drugs, depression and
hospitalization are a few of the factors he cites for his expansive
output.
</P>
<P>
   One need know little else about the 24-year-old Houston
songwriter/vocalist than his musical role model: morose alt-rocker
Morrissey, former lead singer of the Smiths, whose hit songs bear
titles like ``Girlfriend in a Coma,'' ``Heaven Knows I'm Miserable
Now'' and ``Unloveable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say that Morrissey taught me about lyrics,''
Furstenfeld says. ``I feel like he personally gave me permission to
write music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands about opening your closet and getting into some
really dirty (issues). Why be fake?''
</P>
<P>
   Furstenfeld has heeded the advice since he started writing at
age 12. He admits to lashing out and feeling awkward as a kid,
closing up with drug experimentation as a young adult, and creating
drama in his life so he could fall backward into it right into his
early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he picked up a pen, however, that the outlet for
personal salvation, as well as his career, became apparent. It
started as poetry he would shape in creative writing classes at
Houston's High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, but soon
turned into song lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   After playing with the well-received but unpolished Houston band
Last Wish, he teamed up with fellow student and violinist Ryan
Delahoussaye to form Blue October in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   With one independently released album, ``The Answer,'' that sold
thousands of copies locally, and hundreds of songs still in the
vault, it appears Blue October is poised to perform on the national
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Furstenfeld and his bandmates _ Delahoussaye, drummer
(and brother) Jeremy Furstenfeld, guitarist Brant Coulter and
bassist Matt Novesky _ were signed to Universal Records. Universal
released the group's major-label debut, ``Consent to Treatment'' on
Tuesday. The band will kick off its national tour with a hometown
performance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Furstenfeld's closet will be open for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you exactly the first time I saw Blue October,''
says Michael Rand, the Michigan-based manager who secured the deal
with Universal. ``I was actually at a restaurant in Houston to see
another group. These guys were also on the bill, and the songs just
blew me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical for Furstenfeld _ a handsome guy who wakes up every
morning stressing over how ugly or heavy he perceives himself to be
_ he remembers that night about 18 months ago with less confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were at a seafood restaurant, and I was so upset because I
thought we were selling out,'' Furstenfeld recalls. ``I really
didn't want to play for people eating shrimp, but it turned out to
be the best show we could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Rand asked Furstenfeld how many other songs Blue
October had like the ones it had just played _ moody art-rock songs
with a pop edge that create dark pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, Furstenfeld told him. Rand asked Justin to come to New
York and play them. All of them.
</P>
<P>
   The group was signed to Universal four months later.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Furstenfeld knew early on that he was not the kind of kid who
was going to end up in a cubicle wearing a suit and tie. He was
born in the Heights neighborhood of Houston, and was drawn to the
city's artsy, open-minded Montrose art and coffeehouse community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for my experiences and this band, I would
probably be somewhere like . . . college,'' Furstenfeld says,
emphasizing the word as if it were synonymous with prison or
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Every year at HSPVA, he auditioned for the choir ensemble, the
Singing Boys of Houston. He didn't make the choir cut, but always
felt at home in the more liberal ``high school with ashtrays''
approach to artistic education.
</P>
<P>
   Some students didn't wear shoes. Others didn't wear shirts. Many
kids smoked cigarettes. More important, he felt the curriculum
better fit his interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't do sports, I got a 500 on my SAT, and I was always
sitting around writing poetry,'' Furstenfeld says. ``I knew I
couldn't go to a regular school. I wanted to write plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwriting wasn't available until his senior year, so he spent
the next three years learning to open himself up to expression in
the HSPVA theater department.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people taught me how to take my guard down,''
Furstenfeld says of his teachers. ``I wouldn't have (graduated high
school) without them.''
</P>
<P>
   With little interest in college, Furstenfeld took to hanging out
around Houston's downtown warehouse district. His old haunts
introduced him to drug culture.
</P>
<P>
   He describes his lifestyle back then: sitting around, doing
psychedelics and then writing about it.
</P>
<P>
   To clear his head, and keep Blue October together, he moved to
San Marcos, where he took a job at the San Marcos Treatment Center.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Furstenfeld found himself hospitalized. His life
``completely broke apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I worked in a mental hospital, and the next day I'm a
patient,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with depression, he now takes medication to regulate
his body and emotions. The medication makes him groggy on occasion,
but he is easier to be around these days. It's less difficult for
him to keep friends and communicate with his girlfriend, Mamie. Yet
sometimes, he lets doses slide just so the emotions so vital to his
creative process have time to well up inside. His favorite illicit
drug now is his own untreated emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the things Furstenfeld takes on the road with him, the item
he cherishes most is his confessional altar. A childhood friend got
Furstenfeld the mini-enclosure for disclosure and redemption and
attached his phone number to it.
</P>
<P>
   The simple message: Call anytime you need to talk. Furstenfeld
has used the number many times since work for ``Consent to
Treatment'' began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost touch with my life a long time ago and now feel like
kind of a nomad,'' Furstenfeld says. ``If I fall, I get back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to Blue October's album, you can almost go through the
steps of addiction, submission and rehabilitation with Furstenfeld.
The band's locally produced album, ``The Answer,'' was a slow,
loping, downbeat set inspired by Furstenfeld's uncontrollable
post-high school malaise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consent to Treatment'' brings us along to the realization of
his depression and his seeking help. One song, ``Retarded
Disfigured Clown,'' is spoken-word poetry about embracing the weak
and outcast. It gives way to tightly wound guitar self-analysis
that stretches to string-quintet symphonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independently Happy'' spins around a live-wire spark from
speaker to speaker with the gradual scaling of a U2 ``The Joshua
Tree''-era anthem. ``Libby I'm Listening'' and ``Amnesia'' sound
like updates of Peter Gabriel's best pop hits. The album cover,
featuring Furstenfeld's face covered in fake grass and miniature
street signs, evokes the images of Gabriel's ``Sledgehammer''
video.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the album could keep Blue October on the road for a
year or more. Many rock stars see touring as a chance to break away
from past acquaintances. Not Furstenfeld. It's clear life away from
Mamie could give way to a whole new trail of songs about loneliness
and grief.
</P>
<P>
   He has done a lot of growing up, but he talks about Mamie like a
swooning high school freshman, still not convinced that the popular
senior girl would date him.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure if he'll be moving to L.A. immediately with her,
or if he'll return to Houston for his next break.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my soulmate, and I know we'll be together,'' he says.
``I'm not sure where I'll be returning to, but at least I'll have
plenty of places to couch-surf between here and California.''
</P>
<P>
   To learn how the saga ends, we'll just have to wait for the next
Blue October album.

 &HT;    Online banking growing rapidly
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That traditional but ut than conventional banks, no monthly fees
and free online bill-paying services.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors account for rapid growth since the first
online banking services appeared in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. You can't make cash deposits. You can
make direct deposits of your paychecks, but you have to mail in
other checks. ``Some people are really not happy with the downtime
until their money is deposited in their accounts,'' said Greg
McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com.
</P>
<P>
   There may also be delays paying bills. A number of corporations,
such as AT&AMP;T, will accept electronic payment now. About half of
bill payments are made by that swift route, according to Bruene.
But the rest go from your online bank by mail.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based
watchdog organization, found that some online banks make it hard to
get questions answered, through the banks' Web sites or on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   True online banks have no ATMs, of course. Nor do they have
branch offices where you can talk to real people about real
problems. ``People want to work with someone they trust with their
money,'' Bruene said. ``Who do you trust more than your existing
bank?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruene expects rapid growth to continue. He believes 15
million households will use online banks or credit unions by the
end of this year, and 20 million by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will be happy with that. One recent study showed that the
cost of a full-service teller transaction is $1.07. The bank spent
27 cents for each ATM transaction _ but only 1 cent for
Internet-based transactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to open an online account, it pays to shop
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates differ considerably on checking accounts and CDs.
No-fee checking accounts and bill-paying are the norm, but not
universal.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to check on what other services are offered.
The array varies considerably from one Web bank to the next.
</P>
<P>
   You can find frequently updated reports of interest rates at
www.bankrate.com and rankings of online banks at www
</P>
<P>
   .gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among its rankings, Gomez says Atlanta-based Security First
Network Bank is best overall, Wachovia is the easiest to use and
USAccess Bank has the lowest overall cost.
</P>
<P>
   It will also pay to ask yourself some questions. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Am I comfortable with computers?
</P>
<P>
   Online banking requires basic computer skills and confidence to
entrust both money and financial information to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you amenable to banking with an entity you can't tangibly
see?'' asked Bankrate.com's McBride. ``The primary objection seems
to be placing your money with an institution that is more virtual
than traditional bricks and mortar, and that may be in a different
part of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What services do I want?
</P>
<P>
   Low-cost accounts are an attractive feature, as are the
relatively high interest some online banks pay on checking accounts
and CDs. A tidy process for bill-paying attracts others.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're accustomed to meeting your money at the
neighborhood ATM, you'll have to consider how much the fees will
be. If you remember Jimmy Stewart as the infinitely kind banker in
the movie ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' rest assured you will not meet
him _ or any other real person _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How do I know an online bank is safe?
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Action recommends looking for ``128-bit encryption,''
the standard in the industry, and for a written guarantee to
protect account holders from losses due to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   You should also visit www.fdic.gov to check whether the bank
you're considering has deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do I still want face-to-face contact?
</P>
<P>
   Most people do. At least 95 percent of online bank customers use
the online services of a traditional bank, according to Bruene.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is the trust that comes from maintaining an
existing relationship with a bank, he said.
</P>

 &HT;    Parents need to set up family priorities
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ At times it is necessary or desirable for both
parents in the family to work. The old idea that a women's place
was only in the home has been modified. Many women work outside the
home to enhance their self-esteem. They may find it desirable to be
a full-time homemaker when the children are young, but enjoy the
economic and psychological rewards of work outside the home when
the children are older.
</P>
<P>
   However, many family conflicts are the result of ineffective or
inappropriate ordering of priorities by both the father and the
mother. For either one, placing one's job before one's family will
almost always result in some sort of problem within the family.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps that can be taken to increase the likelihood of
successful parenting are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   Set aside regular and frequent times for the whole family to sit
down and spend time talking about how each person's needs are being
met, or unmet. Then use this information to modify each family
member's responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Try, if possible, to have one parent at home when the children
come in from school. Children are full of news about their day and
need someone to listen to them. This time, immediately after
school, gives a parent a chance to hear about successes or
failures, and take care of the inevitable cuts and scratches that
occur. By helping with, or supervising, a time for homework, the
parent can teach good study skills and habits. Having a relaxed
setting after school and in the evenings also is important for
healthy family development. Many businesses have flextime as an
option that can be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Establish definite responsibilities and share these
responsibilities. When possible, each family member should
contribute to the family chores.
</P>
<P>
   Set aside definite periods of time when the family can be
together as a unit, such as at dinner time, or on weekends, and
learn to protect this time by resisting activities that interfere
with this time. A picnic, some family recreational activities, and
eating meals together can help promote family cohesiveness and
security.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically examine the health of the family unit to see if
pressures are building because both parents are working. Try to be
objective. If signs of stress are occurring, consider seeking some
professional help before things get too bad and disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that setting priorities and frequently reviewing them
can help keep things in perspective. Both parents working outside
the home is not always a problem, but the psychological health of
the family should be monitored closely to watch for signs of
stress.

   ECOM-NET-ARTISANS _ In Berea, Ky., a center of traditional
Appalachian crafts, artists are slowly coming to terms with
e-commerce. For example, Virginia Petty, who makes one-of-a-kind
baskets, says, ``I put the pictures up (on my site), and if anybody
wants to buy them, they can,'' she says. ``I'm not into
marketing.'' Del Martin, who has been selling Mission-style antique
furniture and high-end rugs from his living room since 1995, uses
his Web site, www.jaxrugs.com, to show his customers new designs
and to link to eBay. ``Jax Rugs could survive without the
Internet,'' he says, ``but I'd have to stop buying and selling the
antiques, which I love doing.'' A report on how one small town is

<P>
   BEREA, Ky. _ Sometimes Sarah Culbreth and her husband, Jeff
Enge, can go days without seeing a single client at their ceramics
studio in the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains here.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other days when a stream of clients and even a
busload of 50 tourists will visit Tater Knob Pottery and Farm to
see the potters work and buy their ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   That pace is just right, and is in fact the balance they
envisioned when they moved in 1992 to the 30-acre farm outside of
Berea, a small college town renowned for its arts and crafts in
rural Kentucky, about 90 miles southeast of Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, e-commerce is making its way into their lives. They
have a Web site (www.taterknob.com), and get orders by e-mail
messages. But they do not accept credit cards yet. ``I have all the
work I can think of ever wanting to do,'' Culbreth said. ``We see
the Web site as, `OK, what are we going to put on there and make it
worth our while to check our e-mail every day?'''
</P>
<P>
   As an out-of-the-way center of specialized products _ antiques,
and crafts by artisans working in the Appalachian traditions _
Berea would seem an ideal laboratory for the transforming powers of
the Internet. And commerce here is moving online _ but slowly,
fitfully, in ways as individual as the craftspeople themselves.
Many of the artisans are trying to figure out whether the
technology will help them maintain the lives they have created or
force them from the traditions they cherish.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, young people are most comfortable with the
change. At Berea College, which charges no tuition as such,
students work in various campus jobs to pay their way, including in
a thriving furniture and crafts operation. For more than 50 years,
the college has produced a mail-order catalog with items ranging
from beds to brooms. In many ways, e-commerce was a natural
addition because the operations for order-taking and distribution
were in place.
</P>
<P>
   The college introduced its secure-order site in August 1999, and
now www.bereacollegecrafts.com offers about 50 items. Steve Fain,
the director of Berea College Crafts, said the college had
processed about 600 orders from the website since it came into
being, taking in about $20,000 in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Snapp, a computer consultant, worked with the Berea Chamber
of Commerce to create Berea.com, which links Berea College Crafts
and some of the other craftspeople in town. He is trying to move
more local artisans toward e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most artists and craftspeople are nontechnical,'' Snapp said.
``So we start out slowly, by looking at just getting their names on
the Web. Then, when they see a real success, like Berea College
Crafts, they start to come around to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first craftspeople to set up a site in Berea was
Charles Harvey (www.charlesharveywoodwork.com), who makes
Shaker-style chairs and boxes but does not sell them online. ``My
strategy about the Web was not to encourage people to press a
button, and it will arrive on their doorstep three days later,'' he
said. ``My work takes time. Instead, my site is where people can go
to get information about my work and about Shaker furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Petty, who makes one-of-a-kind baskets, goes further,
but not much. ``I put the pictures up, and if anybody wants to buy
them, they can,'' she said. ``I'm not into marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bereans who are dealers in antiques and other rare items,
the Internet can provide a lifeline. Del Martin has been selling
Mission-style antique furniture and high-end rugs from his living
room since 1995. He uses his Web site, www.jaxrugs.com, to show his
customers new designs and to link to eBay, where he auctions his
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jax Rugs could survive without the Internet,'' Martin said,
``but I'd have to stop buying and selling the antiques, which I
love doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are others who adamantly reject the Web, like Harvey's
girlfriend, Teresa Cole, a potter who shares a storefront with him
in Berea. ``I absolutely hate the time I have to spend at the
computer,'' she said. ``It's so frustrating to use so few of my
senses at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of fierce defense of the slower pace of Berea against
a high-speed modem invasion prevails among many traditional
craftspeople. But some are softening.
</P>
<P>
   Take Warren May, who hand crafts traditional dulcimers (stringed
musical instruments). He sells about 500 a year in his shop, but
only two or three through a site at a gallery in town. May said he
did not have a computer in his home or in his shop because he
thought that time spent on computers was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   But even he has come to recognize the benefits of e-commerce.
``Craftspeople are usually so isolated,'' May said. ``Computers
give us tremendous outreach, not just to customers but to other
craftspeople. With computers you can reach people all the way from
Podunk Holler to New York City.''

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIJING _ Somewhere in the Turkish highlands this summer, a
camper will bed for the night with a Chinese-made tent and sleeping
bag, courtesy of a Turkish sporting goods wholesaler that bought
hundreds over the Internet from a Chinese company earlier this
year. It is the kind of transaction that many people hope is the
beginning of a revolution for China's formidable economy.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions for revolution are ripe: China is relaxing
central government control over its vast export machine, and the
Internet is linking that machine to buyers worldwide. Furthermore,
e-commerce is cutting through China's archaic distribution system,
a fragmented, multilayered realm that harks back to the nation's
feudal past. The government is also bringing the country's growing
online population new services, from Internet auctions to
electronic matchmaking.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many barriers, both cultural and technical. And
for all the talk of the Internet's rapid spread, only a fraction of
the country is wired. Of those, only a fifth has shopped online.
The chief concern among consumers is the security of online
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that debt has always been scorned in
China, and collection is a challenge in a country that still has
only rudimentary rule of law. The nation's banks recently began
issuing true credit cards, but they are rare. And while many people
have debit cards, few trust using them online.
</P>
<P>
   So it will be a long time before China's e-commerce sector can
support more than a few big companies. The nation's Ministry of
Information Industries predicts that online transactions will reach
$42 million this year, more than six times last year's total. That
is far from enough to go around for the 1,100 consumer-oriented
e-commerce Web sites in the land.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the state of e-commerce in China for
business-to-business, business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer
sites:
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS trade is the most promising because the
country has never developed a national distribution system, despite
the centralized administration of China's state industrial
conglomerates. Instead, production was localized _ nearly every
province had its own textile industry, tobacco factory, etc.
Selling products from one province to the next often required going
through Beijing. Meanwhile, the state-owned foreign-trade
corporations monopolized foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not much better now. The right to export is
still controlled, and state-owned corporations continue to dominate
foreign trade. Domestic distribution remains fragmented. But
e-commerce presents a way to cut through the bureaucratic thicket.
</P>
<P>
   Several business-to-business Web sites are providing the conduit
that China's traditional distribution system lacks. Sites like
MeetChina.com and Alibaba.com go further, bringing China to the
world. Even China's state trade companies are exploring the
cybertrade routes.
</P>
<P>
   From a blue cubicle in a white-tiled building in northwestern
Beijing, Rao Qinfu types into the Alibaba site the specifications
for an industrial ice-making machine designed for fisheries. The
mandate from his employer, the China National Technology Import and
Export Corp., is to see whether the Internet is a workable
marketing tool.

   Rao, 28, is an eager Alibaba convert. ``It's free, and you get
quick feedback because it's one of the services with lots of people
online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a sort of industrial clearinghouse that draws
together buyers and sellers from 186 countries and regions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems. Because the site is free, few customer
inquiries are serious, Rao says. After six months, he has not sold
anything other than the tents and sleeping bags to the Turkish
wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ma, Alibaba's founder, says his main goal is to be the
premier business-to-business site for China's smaller exporters.
Investors, who include Goldman Sachs, the Softbank Corp. of Japan
and Investor A.B. of Sweden, have pumped $25 million into the site.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER companies are the most common type of
e-commerce start-up here. Because of China's byzantine distribution
system, online sales theoretically give anyone with a Web site
national reach. And direct sales cut out the multiple
intermediaries who help inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   At 8848.net _ whose name, derived from the height of Mount
Everest in meters, reflects the company's lofty goals _ Chinese
customers can buy books, software and computers. But in a country
rife with counterfeit goods and shoddy merchandise, China's
look-and-feel shopping habits are hard to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Tan Zhi, 8848's president, speaks frequently at universities,
hoping to engender online shopping habits among China's plugged-in
generation. ``We have to change people's way of thinking,'' Tan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to bring about that change involves flawless execution,
so the company has built a cavernous ``fulfillment center'' in
northwestern Beijing, where staff members roller-skate down
warehouse aisles loaded with goods. The skaters gather requested
items onto a conveyor belt that delivers them to the packing
department, where delivery trucks wait.
</P>
<P>
   Logistics is the biggest challenge for companies like 8848,
which came under early criticism for unreliable delivery by a
subcontractor. Now the company relies on the national postal
service to deliver goods and collect money for cash-on-delivery
orders, which is how most people pay despite the company's
agreements with several banks to clear their customers'
transactions online.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business is slow. The company's transaction volume in
September was nearly $1.2 million and rose to $1.5 million by
November, but the company stopped providing figures to the public
at the end of last year. It says that growth remains high, but that
the company's new business-to-business service accounts for most of
today's transactions.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-TO-CONSUMER: Dozens of local online auction sites have
cropped up, though few generate enough activity to qualify as real
businesses. Part of the problem is trust; the kind of mutual
confidence that makes the transactions of America's eBay work is
rare in China.
</P>
<P>
   Eachnet.com, China's largest auction site, has solved that
problem by creating local sites that encourage transactions by
people in the same city who can meet before exchanging cash. The
total value of transactions settled on the site averages around
$2.5 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Eachnet eventually wishes to charge users a ``success'' fee, but
it currently makes nary a penny from those deals. Instead, it would
like to make money by renting space on its site to other
e-businesses.

   RACE-THEORY (San Francisco) _ Jon Entine, a Jewish American, and
Alondra Oubre, an African American, have little in common

<P>
   When I became president and COO of Harley-Davidson's motorcycle
division in 1987, the hard work of saving the company was done. We
had survived seven arduous years of crisis. But we faced an
altogether new challenge _ sustaining progress. How to do that?
</P>
<P>
   For me, the answer was clear. We needed to create an environment
where everyone at Harley took responsibility for the company and
its future. I believe that a leader should mind the interests of
all stakeholders, of course, but also be an outspoken advocate for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are hardwired, like me, to be a leader who shares
rather than exerts power, the command-and-control model is hard to
avoid. The top management job carries certain expectations on
behalf of employees, colleagues and the outside world. It takes
trust on the part of employees and discipline on the part of the
leader to push back on those traditional expectations and create a
company where everyone owns decisions and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVAL MODE
</P>
<P>
   My career with Harley-Davidson dates to August 1981 when I
joined as CFO, just two months after a group of 13 Harley managers
had bought the company from AMF in a leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson had a poor reputation for quality and
reliability, and it was behind the curve on product design and
development. Break-even points were high; market share was falling.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the company faced tough competitors: Honda and
Yamaha. It's no wonder that in 1980, when AMF engaged an investment
bank to sell the division, it found no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Vaughn Beals, formerly AMF's group
executive for the Harley division and now chairman and CEO of
Harley-Davidson Inc., and the leadership team (of which I was
member) cut the overall workforce by 40 percent _ affecting
salaried and hourly workers. All remaining salaried employees
agreed to a 9 percent pay cut, frozen for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, it appeared that Beals and the team might pull
off a miracle. The company had introduced its Evolution Engine in
1984, and that, combined with the new Softail product line, began
to make some money.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was also having some success with special programs
started to help its dealers attract and retain customers. Important
improvements were made on the operating side of the business, and a
financial restructuring positioned the company to go public.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, the prognosis looked good. Manufacturing costs were
falling; reductions in in-process inventories and associated
carrying costs saved about $40 million a year. Our quality had
improved. Our dealer network was revitalized and growing. When we
went public in July, the offering raised $25 million more than the
underwriters had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ENGINES OF CHANGE
</P>
<P>
   Once it was clear the present was in good order, it was time to
think about the future. I didn't have a plan beyond knowing that
capturing the ideas of all the people at Harley was critical to our
future success.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gelb, then vice president of manufacturing, and John
Campbell, vice president of human resources, and I were meeting a
lot back then to talk about how to improve operations. One idea we
came up with was gain sharing _ a program to allow all employees to
share in the company's financial success. But organizational-change
consultants quickly explained that the gain-sharing program had
been created at the top and was about to be imposed from the top.
So much for inclusive leadership!
</P>
<P>
   GOOD INTENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We explored several other ideas and posed many questions: How
does constant crisis management affect a workforce? How _ in the
absence of a crisis _ can we create an environment where employees
care about the company on a personal level and work together to
improve individual and overall performance?
</P>
<P>
   One consultant, Lee Ozley, talked a lot about the psychologist
Abraham Maslow. Maslow had a theory that absent a crisis, people
rarely commit to a program imposed on them. But they will willingly
commit to a program they help create. That thought made a huge
impression on me. In late 1988, we agreed to start a series of
programs intended to elicit ideas from our employees.
</P>
<P>
   First we approached the union leadership of the roughly 700
employees in the Wisconsin operations and asked them to help us
create a vision for the business. Ozley had warned us that it would
take 12 to 18 months to prepare people for such a process. But I
decided we couldn't wait. I wanted a new labor-management
relationship approved before our union contracts expired, in three
months.
</P>
<P>
   We were able to put in place one-year contracts with each local
union that included the joint vision-building process. Over the
next several months, many people in the Wisconsin operations worked
hard to craft a joint vision. First, about 70 leaders, union and
management, wrote down ideas for what Harley should become. Then a
facilitator met with them in groups to build consensus. Finally,
all 70 people met for three days to forge a shared strategic vision
for Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   When we rolled the ideas out to the rest of the company _ an
audience mainly of salaried employees _ one asked, ``Who
represented us in this process?''
</P>
<P>
   I was ashamed. Once again, we had behaved like traditional
managers by not including everyone. But we quickly set up two
groups of salaried employees to share the making the vision work.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our leaders weren't prepared to implement the
dramatic change the plan called for. In fact, the implementation
came off like a forced march, sending mixed messages and causing
confusion on both the shop floor and in the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the largest local union opted out of the
process after two years. Although the joint visioning process did
not succeed as we had hoped, it laid the groundwork for shared
leadership agreements with the unions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES RICH WANT?
</P>
<P>
   In March 1989, I became CEO. I soon decided that it was time to
bring together the company's 60 senior executives at an offsite
meeting. I wanted them to get to know one another and begin to work
as a truly unified team.
</P>
<P>
   We developed a program featuring two expert speakers on the
issue of change and one outside CEO who had led a major change
effort. After the presentations, we broke into smaller
cross-divisional, divisional, functional and cross-functional
groups to talk about what we'd heard, what we thought we could
accomplish and how we could do it. I visited each cluster with the
speaker so people could ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   On many easels that groups were using to record their ideas, I
was dismayed to notice the question ``What does Rich want?'' I
thought we had been so clear that the point was not to figure out
what I wanted but to figure out what everyone wanted for the
company. At the closing session, I let loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution, and I'm not going to lead it,'' I said.
``You need to lead it.''
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the office on Monday, a colleague was waiting
for me. ``You know, you really stuck a pin in our balloon at that
session,'' she said. ``We were doing fine. We were getting to know
one another, expressing our fears as well as our thoughts about
what we wanted for the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And then I realized my mistake. What was important were their
expectations. And they were happy. Too frequently, we as leaders
try to satisfy ourselves rather than others.
</P>
<P>
   The second session went well. By the third, we had jettisoned

   ONGOING PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   I retired as Harley's CEO in 1999, and I now serve on its board.
Looking back, I believe I succeeded in my journey to be a different
kind of leader. Harley's culture has changed, but the work is not
done.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming a culture takes time. Everybody hasn't fully bought
in to the inclusive approach. We still have people who think they
know all the answers, but they are getting fewer in number. We
still have people who just want to bring their bodies, and not
their minds, to work. But their ranks, too, are dwindling, too.
</P>
<P>
   We've been transforming ourselves since the buyout and will
still be at it 10 years from now. It is a journey that will never
end unless we let it.

<P>
   Many buyers on the Internet routinely use shopbots _ software
agents that automatically canvass the Internet looking for the
cheapest price for a given product.
</P>
<P>
   Now e-businesses are deploying agents of their own. For example,
the online retailer Buy.com is reportedly using price-comparison
software that automatically adjusts its prices to undercut
competitors' prices.
</P>
<P>
   But if all online sellers deploy armies of such pricebots, would
the result be self-destructive cyber price wars and digital mayhem?
</P>
<P>
   The question is hardly moot. Within the next decade, the
Internet could be populated with billions of software agents
exchanging information goods and services with one another and with
people.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, numerous computer
simulations have been run to explore how an agent-based economy
might function. The findings derived from those simulations raise
profound questions about the way businesses _ and the entire
economy _ will operate in the future. As commerce increases on the
Internet, a company's success may be determined as much by its
skill in programming its bots as by the wisdom of its business
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   One simulation model investigates how software agents might set
the prices of a commodity, such as a computer memory chip or a copy
of John Grisham's latest novel. Using the model, the behavior of a
variety of pricebots with different levels of sophistication was
studied.
</P>
<P>
   One simple bot, for example, uses trial and error to raise or
lower prices incrementally in an effort to maximize profits. A more
sophisticated agent makes pricing decisions based on detailed
information about competitors' prices and buyers' price
sensitivity, use of shopbots and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   With this copious information, the pricebot applies a short-term
optimization approach (dubbed ``myoptimal'' for myopically
optimal), and calculates the price that will maximize profits under
the assumption that competitors' prices remain fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the models are somewhat idealized and focus on only
about a half-dozen pricebot strategies, the results raise
provocative issues. If all pricebots rely on the trial-and-error
strategy, their collective behavior will evolve toward tacit
collusion in which they each maintain high prices and healthy
profits. If one of the pricebots adopts the myoptimal strategy,
however, it will garner higher profits at the expense of the
trial-and-error agents.
</P>
<P>
   But if all the pricebots make the switch, then endless price
wars ensue. The bots continually undercut one another until the
price reaches a certain lower limit, at which point they
re-establish a higher price, touching off a new round of
undercutting. Each pricebot actually fares worse than if all had
just maintained a trial-and-error approach.
</P>
<P>
   When all the agents are myoptimal, the one with the most
up-to-date information on competitors' pricing reaps the greatest
profits. Companies would therefore be highly motivated to program
their bots to scan competing sites and databases constantly, with
the advantage going to the fastest and most relentless repricers.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, suppliers' Web sites could be overwhelmed by
price queries from competitors' pricebots _ and the entire Internet
could be gridlocked.
</P>
<P>
   To deter such abuse, sellers may have no choice but to charge
pricebots (and shopbots) for price information. This possibility
hints at a powerful principle that could govern an agent-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that information goods and services are neither
overused nor underprovided, shopbots and pricebots may evolve into
full-fledged economic agents functioning as buyers, sellers and
intermediaries to facilitate all facets of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, researchers at the Watson Center have begun to
investigate how companies might avoid destructive bot wars by
developing more intelligent pricebots that can adapt to their
environment and anticipate the future. One promising approach is
based on reinforcement learning, in which agents learn optimal
pricing policies that maximize long-term profits. These
forward-looking pricebots have outperformed trial-and-error and
myoptimal agents.
</P>
<P>
   And when two forward-looking pricebots compete against each
other, they refrain from excessive undercutting because they
anticipate retaliation. Future research will investigate how larger
communities of such agents would perform against one other.
</P>
<P>
   Also of great interest is the behavior of agent-based markets
for complex products. Various models have been developed in which
sellers' bots not only set prices but also determine product
quality or configuration.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a bot could be used to create different versions of
an online journal, each with a unique set of articles, and to
adjust prices accordingly _ all in response to customers' demand
patterns and competitors' actions. Preliminary results reveal
several possible scenarios, including complicated cycles in which
both price and product parameters oscillate indefinitely _ an
undesirable situation for both sellers and buyers.
</P>
<P>
   To compete effectively on the Web, businesses will need to
understand the market dynamics of large communities of software
agents. Companies can use simulation studies to develop mechanisms
and strategies that will help them avoid potential pitfalls such as
price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligently designed bots can help businesses capitalize on
(and create) a flurry of information goods and services that will
rise as quickly and pervasively as the growth of the Web _ and that
will affect the world even more profoundly.

   VITAMIN-SOURCES-MED _ Steak may contain plenty of vitamin B-12,
but your body can absorb the critical nutrient more easily from a
bowl of cereal or a cheese sandwich, says a new study.
</P>
<P>
   That's critical information for the nearly 40 percent of
Americans who the study says may be on the verge of vitamin B-12
deficiency. A lack of B-12 puts people at risk for problems such as
pernicious anemia, loss of sensation, balance disorders and
dementia. A B-12 deficiency also can increase the risk of heart
disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a really serious problem nutritionally and one
that's under-recognized by doctors,'' says lead researcher
Katherine Tucker, an associate professor of nutritional
epidemiology at Tufts University. The findings, based on a study of
3,000 adults from their mid-20s to age 80, are reported in a recent
issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-BRAIN-MED _ It's one thing to have a song in your heart,
but you might have one in your brain, too. Musical hallucinations
experienced by a man with brain injury have led researchers to
identify a part of the brain where they think familiar songs might
be encoded.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual case study -- about a German man with a lesion on
his brain who reported hearing ``Our Beautiful Country of
Brandenburg,'' a popular song about his birthplace -- was described
in this month's Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ZINC-COLDS-MED _ High doses of zinc may cut how bad your cold is
and how long you have it, but taking so much for too long may
affect blood production, among other things, says the latest study.
</P>
<P>
   People who took 80 milligrams of zinc -- more than five times
the recommended daily amount of 15 milligrams -- for up to five
days had cold symptoms for 4 1/2 days; people who didn't take the
zinc had cold symptoms for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything below 15 to 30 milligrams of zinc (per day) isn't
harmful,'' says Dr. Ananda S. Prasad of Wayne State University
School of Medicine, who co-authored the study. ``But we have to
have some education (about the uses of zinc), because taking more
than that over a long period of time is not recommended. Too much
zinc abuses copper in the body and therefore needs to be monitored
very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study appear in the Aug. 14 issue of the Annals
of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   LASER-PSORIASIS-MED _ For the millions who suffer from psoriasis
and vitiligo, swift and complete relief may have finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The source of hope for people with the two disfiguring skin
diseases is a new hand-held device called the eximer laser. Apart
from working quickly, it seems to have no side effects because it
targets only damaged skin, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   The eximer laser, which uses ultraviolet-B light, can clear up
the conditions in a fraction of the time required by older
ultraviolet laser treatments, doctors say. It also reduces the risk
of skin cancer, a problem with the older lasers.
</P>
<P>
   BRAIN-MARROW-MED _ Feeling something in your bones may be more
than an expression. A new study claims that stem cells from your
own bone marrow might someday help repair your brain and central
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean significant improvement for people with
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple
sclerosis and people who've had strokes and traumatic brain
injuries, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers at the University of South Florida College of
Medicine say they have induced stem cells from human bone marrow to
differentiate into neural cells, at least in the laboratory.

   XO-SAUCE-SOLVED (Undated) _ Dining out has its pleasure and its
mysteries. XO sauce is both. I recently developed an infatuation
with it. The flavor was intriguing: salty and sweet, hot and sour.
In it I could see tiny bits of dried shrimp, garlic, chilies and
scallop. There were very thin chopped-up noodles, too, and nearly
microscopic chips and flecks of unknown ingredients. If this was
XO, I had to get to the bottom of it. By William Grimes.

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>

   LOS ANGELES _ Downtown Los Angeles is the perfect urban setting
for the Democratic National Convention. There's nothing there. This
week there's an even bigger nothing there.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Los Angeles sprawls around downtown like vibrant
little nations of every conceivable ethnic group, and do they care
about Al Gore, politics and the convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said businessman Max Chung, standing outside the
HK Market in the San Gabriel Valley suburb of Rowland Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a little of Bush's speech a couple of weeks ago,'' said
software engineer Kumar Kobi at the nearby China Muslim Restaurant.
``Now where did he give that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about that kind of thing,'' said Norma Marin at
her family's restaurant, Maria's Corner, in East L.A. ``I care
about work, family and my life. I don't get into politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, from my point of view, the convention might as well be
happening on the surface of the moon,'' said Arnold Herr, owner of
a bookstore on Fairfax Avenue. ``I'm here seven days a week. It's
hard for me to get excited. Who gives a Fig Newton?''
</P>
<P>
   I drove for hours around Los Angeles to find out three things I
already knew.
</P>
<P>
   One: Nobody cares about the Democratic National Convention, even
though the nothingness of it dominates the news.
</P>
<P>
   Two: Nobody cares about politics, George W. Bush or Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Three: L.A. is very, very big.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. also has to be the most American place there is, despite
all the bad things people say about it.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman who works in a clothing store along Pacific
Boulevard in Highland Park told me, ``I don't care about politics.
I'm too busy partying.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her where to find the best partying, and she waved her
arm toward the steaming sidewalks teeming with people, and she
said, ``Everywhere. Wait till later. Things will really get
hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that the folks in Highland Park drink Corona and
Negra Modelo while the folks at the Skybar of the ultrahip Sunset
Strip Mondrian Hotel drink $1O pina coladas?
</P>
<P>
   No, they're all partying, and doing a better job of it than the
delegates at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all the delegates. As I drove through West Hollywood,
I saw a party down an alley and crashed it.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a party at the gay community center for the
more than 200 gay and lesbian delegates. They care about politics
and they know how to party.
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd ate amazing food catered by the highly rated
Border Grill, a band played so loudly people had to back into the
art gallery to continue schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its reputation for partying and smooth surfaces, L.A. is
famous for violence and riots. But as I cruised by the Staples
Center, all I saw was a sort of a movie set for a riot. You see all
kinds of commercials and shows being filmed around L.A., but those
seem real, unlike the demonstration I saw. Not to mention the whole
convention.
</P>
<P>
   There were more cops and police cars than in all the movies and
TV shows ever filmed. While police helicopters provided an ominous
reverberating soundtrack, hundreds of protesters against the death
penalty and police brutality drifted by at the end of their
free-Mumia march.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100-degree heat, they looked like they would have been
glad to have the fire hoses turned on them. They at least needed a
good party, with lots of cold ginseng soda.
</P>
<P>
   The real protest against the political system and politicians is
the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all the same,'' said Whitney Day, standing outside the
Traveller's Rest Baptist Church in the Florence neighborhood.
``They just want to get in office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so many people are distrustful of government today,''
said Jessie Payo, a student at Burbank High. ``Things have changed.
We're cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my school, we've had all our funding cut for the arts,''
she said. ``Still, we have the best bands in the state. That's
because we care about music.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Los Angeles and American dream, and it's hard to see
what politicians and conventions have to do with it.
</P>

 &HT;    Madam President?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's next, ``Vice President Ken''?
</P>
<P>
   The joking perhaps was inevitable when the nonprofit group the
White House Project teamed up recently with Mattel and Girls' Inc.
to launch a President Barbie doll. With a politically correct
helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand nuclear war and an
unintentionally funny advisory on the back of her box _ ``Podium
not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this Leader of the Free
(Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous light.
</P>
<P>
   But only if that's what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew you have to start with what exists,'' explained Marie
Wilson, president of The White House Project, which aims to
``change the political climate'' so women can mount successful
campaigns for U.S. president and other high offices. ``What exists
is eight Barbies in every little girl's bedroom. She's not a
throwback to them, she's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   So are a lot of people these days when the subject turns to a
woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, as they will be at the
Democratic gathering beginning Monday in Los Angeles; and both
George W. Bush and Al Gore reportedly included a woman on their
``short list'' of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's been 16 years since Democratic presidential nominee
Walter Mondale made New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro the
first _ and only _ female candidate for vice president. Since then,
the only woman to contend for the top spot on either major party's
ticket, former Republican Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole, couldn't
muster enough money or support to stay in the race through the
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro is surprised no other woman has joined her in the
history books as a major party's nominee for president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be this long,'' Ferraro said last week
from the Virginia offices of her employment consulting firm, where
she was also preparing to be a Fox News commentator on the
Democratic convention. ``I don't find it disheartening. But I do
feel we need more women than we have in the Senate and the
governors' mansions, and that's disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the idea of Madam President? That's the
question being pondered by political observers everywhere who, like
Ferraro, are somewhat bewildered by the fact that one ultimately
unsuccessful run at No. 2 is all American women have to show in the
year 2000. It's even the focus of a new book _ ``Madam President:
Shattering the Last Glass Ceiling'' _ in which co-authors Eleanor
Clift and Tom Brazaitis come to this conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a woman president of the United States. When?
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly anyone asked predicts a woman president will
happen _ eventually _ but that's pretty much the only point of
agreement among them.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who express cautious optimism _ ``I think a
woman is going to pop up at the right time and be a really viable
candidate,'' said Georgia insurance consumer's advocate Cathey
Steinberg, who represented DeKalb County as a Democrat in the state
Legislature for 14 years and lost a close congressional race to
U.S. Rep. John Linder in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   'GLASS CEILING IS STILL THERE'
</P>
<P>
   Others contain a certain amount of pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about the glass ceiling,'' said Matt
Towery, the author of ``Powerchicks: How Women Will Dominate
America'' and a former Republican lieutenant governor candidate and
Georgia state representative. ``The glass ceiling is still there.
There just needs to be a bubbling up that will cause it to shatter.
What I didn't realize was how long it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who sound downright ticked off by the
whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something very sad about us still having this
deep-seated ambivalence about power in the hands of women,'' said
(presidential historian) Carl Anthony, pointing out that Turkey,
Pakistan, Ireland and other nations where women have far fewer
rights than their American counterparts all have elected female
presidents or prime ministers. ``This is sort of mind-boggling. It
throws all the statistics out the window and puts it on an
emotional and irrational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since, when it comes to presidential elections these
days, women seem to do everything except actually take the oath of
office. Bush's campaign press secretary and Gore's campaign manager
both are female, and the two men rely heavily on their wives for
everything from making convention speeches (Laura Bush, notably,
told the GOP delegates she hoped there'd be a female president
someday) to helping them pick a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some who say that the country has squandered
valuable time by focusing more on first ladies instead of potential
female presidents. Yet there's nothing new about first ladies
playing an active role in their husbands' campaigns or
administrations, nor about intense media and public scrutiny of
them, according to Anthony, author of ``First Ladies: The Saga of
the Presidents' Wives and Their Power, 1789
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from ``Gender Gap'' voters in 1992 to ``Soccer
Mecision in the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, say people like Towery, that means a woman
should have been running for vice president this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected both parties to pay more attention to potential
female candidates th ``Women run up against circular logic and
competing arguments,'' continued Cordery, such as that they're
``too weak'' to make tough decisions like sending troops to war.
``But women who are strong enough to be president are `too strong,'
`strident,' `manly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers also work against them, said the White Hovice president
in the film ``Air Force One.'' Or, yes, bombardin a multicultural
array.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's a matter of putting more women in positions that
are considered traditional presidential springboards. In a country
that's 52 percent female, only three governors and nine U.S.
senators are women. As those numbeately, she also had the Texas
juggernaut to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   `ush's political swallowing of the entire Republican part of the
government and his formidable fund-raising abilities, she was a
very credible candidate,'' Ferraro said. ``I don't think you need
anything more than that if you're a woman candidate. If you have
the opportunity to run, run!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen King is addicted to writing. It isn't a matter of liking
to write or even loving it. He needs it, chemically, the way years
ago he needed his cocaine and his beer, sometimes a case a day.
``Writing is just this great big conduit, this outflow pipe that
keeps the pressure nice and even,'' he says. ``It just pours all
this (expletive) out. All the insecurities come out, all the fears
_ and also, it's a great way to pass the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been able to make a career of it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd be dead. I would have drunk myself to death or drugged
myself to death or committed suicide or some goddamn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, he almost died anyway. He and his family were
staying at their lake house in western Maine. It was late afternoon
and King was finishing up his daily four-mile walk. As usual, he
was carrying a book. Although he often reads while walking _ on
dirt roads, for instance, or down Broadway while visiting New York
_ he was not reading at the moment, for this stretch took him up a
steep hill alongside a small highway.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a blue Dodge minivan crested the hill and pinballed
King off its windshield. He came down in a clump. His head was
bleeding, his lap seemed to be turned sideways and he saw that a
bone in his right leg was pointing in the wrong direction, skyward,
bulging out of his jeans. A short while later, one of his lungs
collapsed. This was all happening in a blur, literally, for King's
eyeglasses were missing. They had somehow landed on the front seat
of the minivan. They would help convince Bryan Smith, the man
driving the van, that he had hit a person and not, as he first
thought, ``a small deer.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, after King knew he would survive but before he
knew if he would walk again, he resumed writing. His wife, Tabitha,
who is his rock and his redeemer, set him up at a makeshift desk in
the back hallway of their Victorian sprawl in Bangor. It reminded
him of the laundry room in their old trailer, where he wrote
``Carrie,'' back when he washed motel sheets for a living and she
sold Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sat in a wheelchair, propped up by foam cushions,
brimming with pain and painkillers. Besides the fractured hip,
mangled leg, collapsed lung and lacerated scalp, he had four broken
ribs and a chipped spine, and he had lost 50 pounds. He didn't feel
like working, but a voice in his head _ yes, Stephen King, like his
characters, hears voices _ told him to.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an opposite of writer's block, King has it. As a
teen-ager, he would come home from a Roger Corman movie, write a
novelization in two days, mimeograph a few dozen copies and sell
them at school for a quarter each. By the time he was a college
sophomore, he had five finished novels in a drawer. Last month, his
hyperproductivity paid off yet again. Reaching into another drawer,
he pulled out a novel called ``The Plant'' and did something with
it that made worldwide headlines: he published it himself.
</P>
<P>
   A few months earlier, he became the prince of e-publishing by
releasing, through Scribner, an Internet-only novella. Its success
tickled him, and made him yearn for an even closer-to-home
publishing experience. Enter ``The Plant.'' Instead of a mimeograph
machine, he used his Web site to release it; instead of a quarter a
copy, he suggested a $1 payment for the first installment, with
more to come only if 75 percent of the downloaders paid up. ``My
friends,'' he wrote on his Web site, ``we have the chance to become
Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the novel's plot _ a writer sends a man-eating plant to
a publishing house that rejected his manuscript _ Big Publishing
did its best to appear unruffled. ``I don't feel particularly
threatened,'' said Susan Moldow, the publisher of Scribner, King's
offline publishing house. The literary agent Mort Janklow told a
reporter, ``That's a fellow sitting up in Maine having fun, but
it's not a way to run a business.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after ``The Plant'' was released, King said in an e-mail
message: ``I'm satisfied with the downloads _ about 40,000 as of 4
p.m. yesterday, and we're estimating a total pay-through of maybe
88 percent. Let Mort Janklow put that in his pipe and smoke it!''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the hubbub was the novel's provenance. King began ``The
Plant'' back in the early 1980s but shelved it because it too
closely resembled ``Little Shop of Horrors.'' It was distributed
only to the people on his Christmas-card list. ``If I gave someone
a coffee maker and they sold it at a yard sale, it wouldn't bother
me,'' he said at the time. ``If they want to sell 'The Plant,'
fine. It's theirs. They can tear out the pages and use 'em for
toilet paper, if that's what they feel like doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be what his friends mean when they call him a genius.
After all, who but the chairman of Stephen King Inc. would think to
turn 15-year-old toilet paper into an Internet rage?
</P>
<P>
   The book he finished in his wheelchair, meanwhile, ``On Writing:
A Memoir of the Craft,'' will be published in _ yawn _ early
October. With paper and cloth and glue. For King, 52, it was one of
the scariest books he has written. While a large part of it gives
point-blank advice to the aspiring author (``The adverb is not your
friend''), it also tells the true story of how writing saved
Stephen King from the sort of life _ or death _ that he has instead
had the luxury of turning into fiction.
</P>
<P>
   He has two offices in Bangor: one in the house for writing, the
other in a low-slung flesh-colored building near the airport. This
is where he and two assistants manage the empire that has arisen in
the wake of more than 40 books and nearly as many films based on
the writing of Stephen King and Richard Bachman, King's
pseudonymous counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Monday morning, mid-June, almost a year to the date of
his accident. King uses one red metal crutch to get from his pickup
truck to the office door. He is sick of the crutch. At a recent
reading in New York, he was determined to appear without it but was
stymied by three steep flights of stairs. Once onstage, however, he
leaned the crutch against a wall and limped to the microphone. He
got a standing ovation. King, as his longtime editor puts it, ``is
the rock star of writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after telling his assistants, Marsha and Julie, how nice
they look, King lowers himself into a jungle-print recliner. He
appears healthily haggard, if that's possible _ still underweight
but generally fit. He's wearing faded jeans, a blue sweatshirt and,
on his feet, soccer socks (maroon-and-white stripes) and karate
shoes (soft white leather). The combination invokes something like
a woodsman who breaks at lunch for ballet. At one point in the
conversation, he raises his right pant leg to illustrate the story
of visiting his beloved Red Sox at spring training: ``Nomar comes
over, Bret Saberhagen comes over, Tim Wakefield comes over, and Tim
goes, 'Come on, get it up, get it up!' They wanted to see the leg,
and they all knew what the injury was.''
</P>
<P>
   The major scar, running the length of the calf, is surrounded by
any number of puckers and pockmarks. The leg is not pretty (maybe
it never was), but it's there. Attached to the rest of him. ``I
tell Tabby this is the bonus round,'' he says. ``And I believe it,
man. I have a lot of pain, but there's so much that doesn't hurt,
that I'm capable of. To be able to walk around, to still be able to
make love to my wife _ because that could have gone as well, it's
just a physiological thing. I'm grateful for everything that I
have, and I try to stay as grateful as I can, because it doesn't
matter how much money you've made or how rich you are or whether
your book's on the Internet or anything else. If you snap your
spine, you're a quad, and mine was chipped in five or six places,
almost down to the bare wires in a couple of places, so I'm very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   His desk is stacked with books to be autographed, the rest of
the office thick with Kingalia. It traces the arc of a long and
variegated and uniquely successful career: a ``Green Mile''
director's chair, a ``Pet Sematary'' rug, a chipper little sign
reading ``Redrum'' (if you have to ask ... ). In the bathroom,
there's a framed photo of a very large woman in a bathtub,
presumably a fan, with a thought bubble above her head: ``A Ton of
Fun?''
</P>
<P>
   King doesn't want for fans. In the summertime, tour buses idle
outside his house. On the Internet, King rumors swarm: his minivan
encounter was not an accident (false); he is suffering from
writer's block (false); someone else _ maybe his wife, also a
novelist _ actually writes some of his books.
</P>
<P>
   That rumor is also false, as far as anyone can tell. Still,
King's prolificacy borders on promiscuity. ``You almost expect when
he refers to 'the boys in the basement''' _ King's term for his
internal muses _ ``that maybe there are real people, doing at least
his typing,'' says Chuck Verrill, a literary agent who is also
King's personal editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since King went back to work, he has written the
second half of ``On Writing''; ``Riding the Bullet,'' the e-novella
whose success prompted a storm of the-future-is-here coverage; the
better part of a haunted-house screenplay for a six-hour ABC
miniseries; and a 900-page novel, ``Dreamcatcher,'' which opens
with a group of hunters coming upon a man who claims to have been
lost in the woods. (He finished another novel, ``From a Buick
Eight,'' just before his accident, but its release has been pushed
back, in part because it involves a nasty car crash.)
</P>
<P>
   As King says in ``On Writing,'' the first draft of a novel
shouldn't take more than three months. That, after all, is how it
works for him. He writes seven days a week, with the stereo turned
up loud (lots of Eminem, Kid Rock and Wilco these days), but he
often knocks off by lunchtime. Friends say that despite his ambling
disposition, King is fiendishly focused and gets more done per hour
_ whether writing or not _ than any other human they know. ``He's
curious about everything around him,'' says Kathi Kamen Goldmark,
who founded the Rock Bottom Remainders, the authors-only rock band
that includes Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry and, on
rhythm guitar, King. ``You can't mention a book he hasn't read, you
can't mention an obscure musician who he can't sing a lyric of one
of his songs.'' King's brain is known as an extraordinarily fecund
place, constantly sprouting jokes, opinions and, above all, story
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   King alone fails to marvel at his output. That would be like a
sprinter gloating over his speed. What does delight King is his
forward momentum. He is not only the richest and most famous living
author but also among the most entrepreneurial. A few years ago, he
pulled a Dickens and published ``The Green Mile'' in six serial
installments. (At one point, all six volumes sat on The Times's
best-seller list.) Earlier this year, he released a short-story
collection exclusively as an audiobook. Even his contract with
Scribner is an anomaly, sacrificing gigantic advances for a bigger
piece of the back end. (He doesn't remember the specifics, he says:
``I think the deal is a million dollars a book and split the
royalties pretty much down the middle.'')
</P>
<P>
   And now he has given e-publishing a kick-start. ``Riding the
Bullet,'' released in March, was the world's first mass e-book,
with more than 500,000 downloads. The number of actual readers was
another question because the encryption caused countless computers
to crash. Still, thanks to King, online publishing seemed a real
possibility at last. (Never mind that the Web was already swimming
with downloadable music and movies; even though plain words are far
easier to upload, it was somehow taken for granted that Big
Publishing would be the last one in.)
</P>
<P>
   King was stunned by the success of ``Riding the Bullet.'' In
Scribner's office pool, he had predicted 16,000 downloads. Now he
wanted to try again. He made up a wish list: a downloadable story
without encryption ... released in serial form ... with
honor-system payments ... published by ... ME! Thus was ``The
Plant'' brought forth from its drawer and posted on
www.stephenking.com.
</P>
<P>
   The media worked hard to turn King's insurgent act into a
writers' revolution. It is probably not. Most writers, unlike King,
can't book themselves onthe ``Today'' show and ``Good Morning
America'' on the day of their launch. Most writers, like Carlos
Detweiller of ``The Plant,'' would make more of an impact by
sending a man-eating vine to the publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   For King, though, anything is possible and, in time, probable.
``I've continued to say yes to these things rather than kind of
pulling back and saying, Well, I'm going to write a book a year,
and that's what I'm going to do,'' he says. ``I dislike writers who
behave like old cart horses, dozing their way back to the stable.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has written a how-to-write book laced with memoir. Some
critics, King says, ``think I can't write,'' and he knows how ``On
Writing'' will sit with them: ``Like the town whore trying to teach
women how to behave.'' He doesn't care. In the book, he even
invites his readers-writers to submit their work to him. He's
thinking about publishing the best offerings in the paperback
edition.
</P>
<P>
   Such approachability is a major upside of King's down-to-earth
reputation. Even in his native Maine, where celebrity is considered
a sort of disease, he is extraordinarily well regarded. It doesn't
hurt that he and his wife are world-class philanthropists, but
their just-folks nature is just as deeply appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more upside to his earthiness. ``He said
to me recently,'' Verrill says, ``that one of the advantages of not
being an acclaimed literary novelist is that you get to write about
stuff like ...,'' and here Verrill names a variety of bodily
functions that are regularly featured in King's work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, King wants to write from the gut and be an
acclaimed literary novelist. His complaints are by now familiar:
the literary establishment has long misunderstood popular fiction,
and just because he sells millions of books, serious readers won't
take him seriously. King has recently made headway. His novels have
come to be reviewed more respectfully; a Hawthorne-ish short story
he wrote, ``The Man in the Black Suit,'' won a 1996 O. Henry Award.
King was happy for the award, ``but it made me feel like an
impostor too,'' he says. ``Like someone made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In the main, King is right: serious readers generally haven't
read him. When they do, they are usually impressed. Cynthia Ozick,
for instance, had never given King much thought until they did a
reading together. ``It dawned on me as I listened to him that,
never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes _ this man
is a genuine, true-born writer, and that was a revelation,'' she
says. ``He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a
literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history.
It's not glib, it's not just contemporary chatter and it's not
stupid _ that's a bad way to say that something's smart, but that's
what I mean.''
</P>
<P>
   If King wanted to find the genesis of his bad reputation, he
might try looking in Hollywood. Except for ``Carrie'' and ``The
Shining,'' most early King films _ think ``Pet Sematary'' or
``Maximum Overdrive'' or ``Children of the Corn'' _ were dopey
gorefests. As King the author became a brand name, his movies gave
serious readers everywhere reason not to read him.
</P>
<P>
   But as his writing matured, so did the films. In 1986, Castle
Rock released ``Stand by Me,'' a sharp coming-of-age film based on
a King novella. Castle Rock has since made five more King films:
``Misery,'' ``Needful Things,'' ``The Shawshank Redemption,''
``Dolores Claiborne'' and ``The Green Mile.'' Each one was a few
thousand percent better than ``Children of the Corn.'' Too bad for
King that Castle Rock wasn't around in the 1970's. On the other
hand, he often hurts his own cause. Last year, King gave himself a
party at Tavern on the Green to celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the publication of ``Carrie.'' It was a fancy night, full of
literary VIPs, capped off by ... a highlight reel including the
goriest moments in King's film repertory.
</P>
<P>
   King never set out to be a horror writer and doesn't consider
himself one now. Horror, he implies, is a cheaper version of fear,
and it's the fear he's interested in: the frantic bleats in a
protagonist's mind more than the monster causing them. Two of his
recent works, ``Hearts in Atlantis'' and ``Bag of Bones,'' seemed
intent on minimizing the monstrous. They are driven by character,
not scenario, and are each rooted in sober realism. They are big,
serious-ish books; Scribner even classed up their dust jackets. But
by story's end the ghosts have arrived. A reader feels almost as if
the writer wanted to resist but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   A reader feels more of King at work than of most writers. His
narrative voice, extraordinarily controlling and full of wry
intrusions, is always right in your ear, just outside the
campfire's light. But what most makes King unique is that he fully
exploits the writer's great natural advantage: he is the one making
up the story. If there is a single trait common to most of King's
writing, it is the reader's feeling that the author is playing God.
He can and will make really bad things happen to his beloved
creations. He will then watch them confront this evil, occasionally
offering aid. Finally, after they've been scared witless and have
proved themselves worthy, they are welcomed back into His warm
embrace, humble and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' a novella that King published
last year, is a good example. In it, a 9-year-old girl gets lost in
the woods and ends up praying to her hero, the Red Sox pitcher Tom
Gordon, to help save her. It is a simple, beguiling, frightful
story. It begins in innocence, passes through the valley of the
shadow of death and ends with a benevolent wink of an author's
note: ``The woods themselves are real. If you should visit them on
your vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps ... and try to stay
on the path.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he might soon retire _ ``I think that my trick bag is
pretty well empty'' _ but instantly cautions that he probably won't
be able to. Those who know him well agree. He is preternaturally
driven, they say. But by what?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Silver, a Bangor friend and one of King's lawyers, says
that ``he's just a competitive guy who wants to be the best at what
he does.'' King has befriended John Grisham _ a few years ago, they
paid their own way to the National Book Awards, in sly protest of
being perennially unconsidered _ but he is bothered by the
inferiority of other best-selling authors. ``I never wanted to be
content with being, let's say, a Robin Cook or even a Michael
Crichton, who's a little bit better,'' he says. Of Danielle Steel
and Mary Higgins Clark, he complains, ``These people are selling
fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   If King's Internet orgy proves anything, it's that he likes
attention, a lot. What doesn't drive King is money. ``The truth is,
Stephen King is rich because he never set out to be rich,'' says
Susan Moldow of Scribner. ``If the money mattered to him, it
wouldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is, many times over. Responding to an e-mail query about
his finances, he wrote: ``I don't know how much I make in a good
year. Gross could be $40 million, I'd think. What finally nets out
is maybe a third.'' For the movie of ``The Green Mile'': ``I think
I got $3 million plus a piece of the back end (up to a certain
point). The movie has earned, unlike most of them, so I think I'll
see some back end. I saw some from 'Stand by Me,' too. Mostly
(people won't believe it) the movies are just sort of fun. Like
investing in some weird margin stock like United Kurmfurling or
Yermal SpringTronix. I can't break my finances down further than
that, and you are impudent to ask (I say it without rancor, but you
know it's true). The money isn't very important. The idea is to
take care of your family and have enough left over to buy books and
go to the movies once a week. As a goal in life, 'getting rich'
strikes me as fairly ludicrous. The goal is to do what God made you
for and not hurt anyone if you can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-hurting-anyone credo is important to King, and personal.
When he was 2, his father ``did a runout.'' King grew up with his
mother and older brother, on the move and poor. In ``On Writing,''
he recalls this childhood with typical candor (which can be very
moving) and typical scatalogical flair (which will probably keep
him, for now, on the wrong side of Art). His mother set high
standards, worked like a martyr, encouraged his writing; he loved
her. Shortly before his first book was published, she found out she
had uterine cancer. ``We could hear the pause after each rasping
breath she drew growing long and longer,'' he writes. ``Finally
there were no more breaths and it was all pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, King's own family is his greatest happiness. He speaks of
Tabitha with the ardor of a newlywed and the awe of a Lourdes
pilgrim. It was Tabitha who, about 15 years ago, gave him a choice:
clean up or move out. He was a mess; he says he can't really
remember writing ``Cujo'' at all. Tabitha took him before a group
of family and friends and emptied his trash can onto the rug. Out
poured, he writes, ``beer cans, cigarette butts, cocaine in gram
bottles and cocaine in plastic Baggies, coke spoons caked with snot
and blood, Valium, Xanax, bottles of Robitussin cough syrup and
NyQuil cold medicine, even bottles of mouthwash.'' He bought a
little time, as addicts will do, but soon started treatment and
stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   King seems genuinely surprised that he has lived to see his
first grandchild. He and Tabitha have had an eventful marriage;
friends say it is one of the strongest they have seen. For Tabitha,
who has published seven novels, it cannot have been easy being the
No. 2 writer in this two-writer home. Worse yet, for years they
shared a publisher. Tabitha's last manuscript got caught in limbo
when Elaine Koster, Tabitha's editor and Stephen's paperback
publisher, left Penguin Putnam in 1997. Stephen wound up signing
his lucrative deal with Scribner. Tabitha's novel wound up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Now two of their three children are writers, Joe near Boston
(who writes under a pseudonym) and Owen in New York (who doesn't).
``I read Joe's stuff, and I kind of relate to it because it's like
plot-driven, it's high conflict,'' King says. ``Owen is more like
this sort of _ I don't want to dis him but _ Bret Easton Ellis. I
don't know, more like flavor-of-the-month, New York
relationships.'' The Kings' daughter, Naomi, is a Universalist
minister. ``I tell her, and I think it's true, that Unitarianism is
God for people who don't believe in God, and she just laughs.''
Naomi, who once owned a restaurant in Portland, Maine, now lives in
Chicago. ``She met a woman out there, and she's going to marry this
woman or have a commitment thing or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the whole family was up at the lake, including
Joe's wife and infant son. It was the first time in six months they
had all been together. On June 19, a Saturday, Owen was returning
to New York, so his father dropped him at the airport, drove home,
took a nap, then headed out for his daily constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had just walked into his apartment when he got a phone call
from Tabitha: his father had been in an accident. He flew back.
King had been airlifted to the Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston. Tabitha, Joe and Naomi arrived, and later, Owen. ``What
they did to me there was apparently set something in my leg,'' King
recalls, ``and there's this horrible scream _ it came out to where
they were signing papers. Joe turned pale at that. The nurse gave
them a form, a do-not-resuscitate kind of thing. Tabby said Joe
realized it was serious and he just left, went out for a while. He
had his Red Sox cap. He put the cap over his face until he was in
control.''
</P>
<P>
   King, leaning forward in his recliner, takes a pause, and a
breath. ``Later, they all gathered around.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's fully choked up. He whispers, in a model of Maine
understatement, ``They're good people.''
</P>
<P>
   King's near-death, as the facts came forth, unspooled like a
scene from his novels, full as they are of automotive menace and
rural blunderings. The driver who hit him, 42-year-old Bryan Smith
of Fryeburg, is known locally as a bit of a simpleton. King recalls
a sheriff's investigator visiting him in the hospital and saying,
``That Pepsi can has more IQ than Bryan Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith hit King, his minivan was well onto the right
shoulder. He had been distracted by his Rottweiller's trying to get
into a food cooler. Smith came back and sat with King to wait for
the ambulance. A woman and three children soon joined them.
According to her, Smith apologized and told King he had never even
gotten a parking ticket before, to which King replied, ``Well, I've
never been hit by a car before.''
</P>
<P>
   The local weekly, The Bridgton News, later reported that Smith
actually had a long history of driving violations. He had been
convicted for operating under the influence, driving to endanger
and failure to stop for a police officer. Once, after running
several cars off the road, he pulled into his driveway and promptly
passed out on his lawn, in view of the police officer who had been
chasing him. In 1998, his license was suspended three times but
each time was restored.
</P>
<P>
   At it turned out, Smith has a brother, Everett, on the Fryeburg
police force. The sheriff's deputy who responded to the King
accident, Matt Baker, used to serve on the Fryeburg force with
Everett Smith. And the only eyewitness Baker took a statement from
on the scene was his own uncle, Chip Baker. ``It's not nepotism,
it's ineptness, that's what I would credit those police departments
with,'' says Lisa Williams Ackley, who covered the story for The
News.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were enraged when it was announced that only
misdemeanor charges would be pressed against Smith. The accident,
they felt, should be treated as a seriously criminal act. ``They
should have impounded the vehicle, and they should have tested him
for drugs and alcohol at the scene, and they didn't do it,'' says
Warren Silver, the Kings' lawyer in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Silver had gone to western Maine shortly after the accident to
investigate it and meet with Smith. He came home with an idea that
he prayed Smith hadn't had: the 1985 blue Dodge Caravan, fresh with
King's dents, might fetch a frighteningly high price on eBay. The
next day, Silver called Smith, offered him $1,500 for the van and
had it shipped back to Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   King wants to use the van for a charity event: three
sledgehammer swings for $5. ``But my wife is kind of like, 'Why
don't we just get past this whole thing,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles at his own grisly perseverance. He takes off his
glasses, rubs his eyes, puts the glasses back on. They are the same
lenses he was wearing that day; only the frames had to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he still wearing them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that I wanted to say that things that we ordinarily
would see as quite fragile aren't necessarily that fragile,'' he
says. ``It's true of the glasses, and it's true of me. I got bent,
I got busted around a lot, but I'm still here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman ws reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since been
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

 By ELIZABETH WEIL  
 c.2000 Elizabeth Weil  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about wealth and space and America and Russia,
and it begins with one man, Walter Anderson _ 46 and worth almost a
billion dollars. He lives in Washington _ the city he grew up in, a
city he hates; his hatred of the government is, as he puts it,
``personal'' _ in an apartment adorned with a painting he
commissioned based on a Smashing Pumpkins lyric, ``I am still just
a rat in a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we are,'' Anderson explains, ``rats in a cage. And
we're going to gnaw through the bars because we've got about a
30-year window here, and we'll starve if we don't get out.'' The
cage Anderson refers to is Earth itself, and he has taken it upon
himself to ensure we get off. In 1989, Anderson gave $80,000 to the
International Space University; in 1991, $100,000 to the Space
Frontier Foundation; in 1995, $5 million to start the Foundation
for the International Nongovernmental Development of Space; and
between 1996 and 1999, $35 million to build the Roton, a manned,
reusable spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few months ago, in one of our periodic check-ins, he
rang me up. ``I'm calling from the little phone!'' he said. ``I'm
in Russia!'' Anderson was midway through three days of talks with
Yuri Semyonov, president of the private Russian space corporation
Energia, and in a move that would later marginalize NASA from the
Anderson-Russia-America love triangle, he was arranging on behalf
of a new company, called MirCorp, to lease the space station Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had been dreaming of leaving Earth since he was a
little boy. He wired the Russians $7 million before he even signed
Mir's lease. Anderson put up $21 million in seed money toward a
lease that will eventually cost $200 million a year. It will give
MirCorp the rights to Mir for the remainder of its lifetime, the
use of two or three manned Soyuz rockets and two or three unmanned
Progress rockets annually, exclusive control over Mir's visitors
and technologies, 40 days of active operation and the privilege of
fixing Mir up. All of this has put Anderson more cozily into bed
financially with Energia, thereby creating a situation highly
threatening to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The American space agency, after all, was already embroiled with
the Russians in the way-over-schedule, way-over-budget, politically
Pollyanna-ish International Space Station, a project announced 17
years ago under President Ronald Reagan, one that was already the
subject of several congressional hearings and that space patriots
in Washington were determined to make ``the only space in space.''
Specifically, at the time Anderson leased Mir, NASA was blaming the
Russians for being two years behind in launching the service
module, or living quarters, for the International Space Station.
(It was finally launched on July 11.)
</P>
<P>
   A less brusque man than Anderson might have chosen to sweet-talk
and pacify the NASA brass. But Anderson is arrogant in such
matters, and is, as he terms himself, an anarcho-capitalist. He
flies around the world in his private jet pledging allegiance to
the laws of global free trade. Thus, instead of calling NASA,
Anderson called his friend Chirinjeev ``Baboo'' Kathuria, 35, a
megamillionaire Sikh. Kathuria told Anderson that he, too, was
``interested'' in Mir, which in megamillionaire-speak meant he was
willing to chip in $4 million to help form MirCorp and start
upending the last century's notions of international relations in
space.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp is registered in Bermuda, run out of Amsterdam and
structured as a 40-60 partnership with Energia (38 percent of which
is owned by the Russian government). Anderson's plans include
rehabbing the station and expanding its volume to nine or 10 times
its present size. He wants to sell joy rides on Mir to wealthy
individuals (Dennis Tito, a 59-year-old money manager and former
rocket engineer, is the first to sign on, planning to spend 10 days
on Mir sometime early next year) and advertising on Mir to
commercial companies (``We'll paint it up like a Nascar'').
Anderson expects to offer access to Mir equipment to corporations
and governments and to sell intellectual rights on Mir's
considerable patents so that, as Anderson puts it optimistically,
``NASA won't be able to build so much as an air lock without paying
MirCorp something first.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he intends to move into even more dubious but
potentially lucrative markets, like in-orbit satellite assembly and
satellite repair. I do not know if Anderson's vision amounts to a
dream or a pipe dream, a gift or a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is loose-limbed and gangly, with an oddly
unused-looking body. He favors black jeans, suede sport coats and
moccasins. Ever distrustful of his fellow men, he zealously guards
his personal privacy; his name is not on the marquee of his office
in Washington, and neither are the names of his companies. In the
alternative space underground, which Anderson has bankrolled pretty
much singlehandedly, he is known, by those who know him at all, for
being generous, ruthless, overimpassioned, incisive, philanthropic,
libertarian and shy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Anderson was one of the first 300 employees at MCI; in
1984 he founded Mid Atlantic Telecom, a regional long-distance
carrier and the first to integrate phone and voicemail service.
Seven years later he started Esprit Telecom Group, cracking into
the newly deregulated European market. That same year, he created a
British Virgin Islands-based holding company called Gold &AMP; Appel,
named after ``The Golden Apple,'' the second volume in the 1970s
sex-and-conspiracy-theory cult pulp trilogy, ``The Illuminatus!
Trilogy.'' He has more or less doubled his capital every year
since. In 1998, Anderson sold Esprit for $1 billion in stock and
assumed debt. He presumed he would need all that money to build
rockets and space colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now with this Mir thing,'' Anderson says, tapping the tips of
his fingers together, ``if it works, it's such a nice shortcut.''
</P>
<P>
   I ask if it won't make NASA extremely nervous _ a lone,
superwealthy ubercitizen challenging its authority and dominance in
space?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life,'' he says, his eyes lighting up like a
teen-ager's, ``if the U.S. government doesn't try to kill me, I
probably won't have succeeded in meeting my long-term goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Among spacers _ the polite name for space obsessives _ such
sentiments are not uncommon. Anderson was 4 when Sputnik flew, 15
when Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon, 19 when Eugene
Cernan left the last moon-dusted boot mark. And Anderson still
seems not to have recovered fully from the magic of those memories,
from the implicit promise, now broken, that someday soon we will
all be living in the heavens, shouldering power packs and wearing
jumpsuits in a better, higher, lighter world.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old, 130-ton Soviet space station Mir, designed to
orbit only five years, has been spinning almost a decade beyond its
expected life. The station suffers many nicknames _ the porcupine,
the dragonfly _ most referring to its ungainly assortment of
modules and solar arrays. Inside, it's sorely in need of
remodeling. For the past 10 years, the station has been beset by
significant money problems. As early as 1992, top Russian officials
were comparing their own space program to a chicken: ``You cut off
its head, and it runs around the yard for a while thinking it's
still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1990s, Mir suffered a string of high-profile,
high-altitude disasters _ a collision, a fire, several massive
computer shutdowns _ troubles so vast and so economically
intimidating that Energia's president, Semyonov, decided to deorbit
his outpost and call in his final crew. NASA, ever covetous of
Russian resources for the International Space Station, waxed
ecstatic. That is, until in a move that the chairman of the House
Science Committee would call ``a real kick in the jaw,'' Anderson
flew in his jet to Moscow to meet with Semyonov, playing the board
game Risk on the way. Among the first things Anderson said to
Semyonov was, ``I don't necessarily agree with the views of my
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's first foray into the commercial space sector proved a
huge debacle. He financed the development and construction of what
he hoped would be the first generation of privately financed manned
space transports: the Roton rocket, a vehicle initially conceived
to be 65 feet tall and shaped like an upturned egg. On the skyward
end of the Roton, four rocket-tipped rotor blades were to flail,
while the landward end would feature a 22-foot-diameter rotating
rocket engine ringed with 96 fuel nozzles, each slightly larger
than a can of Coke. When complete, the Roton was to be the world's
first single-stage-to-orbit, fully reusable rocket. But when the
project ended, Anderson had instead spent $40 million on the
oddest, tallest helicopter on earth. In its last flight test, the
Roton flew 1,400 yards down a runway in Mojave, Calif., at a speed
of 53 mph and an altitude of 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's second foray, MirCorp, seems to be going better,
thanks largely to his decision to handle MirCorp, he says, ``like a
business,'' something almost all other private space companies
neglect to do. To make MirCorp financially sound, Anderson joined
forces with a newcomer to the space world, his fellow telecom
tycoon Kathuria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mir is definitely a real business,'' Kathuria says,
``definitely undervalued'' and ``definitely cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Anderson not amassed nearly a billion-dollar fortune from an
offshore holding company or had he not nurtured a libertarian
obsession with government evil, you might wonder if he has
intentionally upset the historic and economic status quo. But
Anderson is a 21st-century antihero. He clearly knows how to
manipulate economic arrangements to produce the effects he wants.
Thus you have to assume it's by design that the Russians sound
swoony and triumphant about the MirCorp deal (``Investment not so
good from their part,'' a chief Energia officer gloats, suggesting
he outmaneuvered Anderson) while Daniel Goldin, the NASA
administrator, sounds defensive, embarrassed and left out. ``My
feelings are bruised,'' Goldin uncorks effusively in a thick Bronx
accent from his Washington office. ``I have a hurt. I'm not saying
MirCorp shouldn't have done what they did. I'm just saying I'm in
the book, they've got my number and it might have been nice if they
called.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin sounds conflicted and disrespected, like a sidelined
mafioso. Conflicted because, theoretically at least, he favors
space commercialization. ``Competition is great!'' rings one of his
mantras. Under Goldin's watch, NASA has contracted out some $3
billion annually with fledgling space businesses. At the same time,
however, his lumbering bureaucracy has burned through, almost
literally, some $60 billion on the International Space Station. In
1999, NASA suffered one of its worst years ever, losing two robotic
Mars landers.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich credited Goldin with making ``space as boring as
possible.'' The Economist magazine dubbed the International Space
Station ``the black hole in the sky.'' Thus Goldin is sincere in
saying, ``If MirCorp can finance Mir and get an unsubsidized
positive cash flow, I think that's fabulous!'' But he also finds it
deeply humiliating to explain to Congress why (a) he lacks the
clout to force the Russians to abandon Mir and meet their
International Space Station milestones and (b) a certain
international financier is able to negotiate far better prices with
the Russians than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that money is being diverted,'' Goldin
protests, intimating that the Russians may be siphoning money from
the International Space Station and dumping it into Mir. ``I'm just
saying the arithmetic doesn't add up. I read in the papers that
private United States investors paid $20 million for six weeks of
operation of the Mir space station, a Soyuz vehicle, a Progress
vehicle. They got the operations center. They got the training. And
now I understand they're going to get another flight up there? The
Russians charged us, last year, $65 million for one Soyuz vehicle!
And $135 million for two! I'm just saying that it's frustrating,
year after year, when the Russian government doesn't give us any
vehicles to work with. So like I said, I have some bruised
feelings. And the arithmetic! I'm confused.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, MirCorp will send Dennis Tito, its first
citizen-explorer, into orbit. Energia will provide Tito with rocket
transportation and cosmonaut training while NASA, on the sidelines,
will continue feeling bruised and hurt, continue its public
kvetching, continue exerting pressure on Putin to dump his old heap
into the sea.

PETTIJOHN DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ It is amazing what you stand to lose when
someone decides to end an argument with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard ``Duke'' Pettijohn, 23, has a degree in child and family
studies from Syracuse and wants to be a mentor someday. The
Mattapan, Mass., resident also has worked for theater groups and
performed at the local civic center, and sees acting in his future
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn was the 1995 Boston Globe Defensive Player of the Year
as a linebacker for West Roxbury High and All-Big East as a junior
defensive end last year at Syracuse. It's difficult for him to keep
visions of the NFL at bay as he approaches his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having all that going for you as you run down dark
streets, fleeing a knife-brandishing attacker _ the fallout from a
heated discussion, then a brief skirmish, between groups at a
tavern moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine noticing _ while running _ that your neck feels warm.
You place your hand over the spot and your palm becomes covered
with blood. It is then you realize that one of the guys got to you
with his knife, slashing you behind the left ear and stabbing you
in the shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine losing your would-be assailant in the chase, being
picked up and placed in a truck by a woman driving by, then, while
going past the scene of the altercation seeing your teammates and
friends still being attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get out to help, actually, and she locked the doors
and took off and drove around,'' said Pettijohn of the incident
that occurred near campus last Oct. 31, hours after Syracuse's
24-23 loss to Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   The fight erupted outside Sadie's Place, a bar Syracuse
officials had warned students about. Pettijohn and his teammates
and friends had stopped by to pick up another teammate before
heading off for an early-morning snack.
</P>
<P>
   The club was emptying out, and while patrons were milling
around, words were exchanged between the Syracuse contingent and
local residents reportedly involved in a street gang. Things
quickly became heated, then turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn was chased for about 40 yards before being picked up,
and the woman drove around a corner near the site of the melee just
as police and ambulances arived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I got out,'' said Pettijohn, ``and (teammate David Byrd)
was sitting on the curb. I thought he was all right, just tired or
something. But he was, like, delirious, because his ear was almost
cut off. He was stabbed in the back. My friend Myles (Thomas) was
in the street and he got the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went to him and tried to comfort him, and I also tried to
calm my friend Danny (Moore) down, because he had a third-grade
concussion. He was out of it. I had to be calm, because I wasn't
even thinking about the fact that I'm bleeding, trying to stop him
bleeding. So (paramedics) told me to stop and took me in one
ambulance and him in another ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, a senior cornerback, suffered severe neck and shoulder
wounds, reportedly losing nearly 60 percent of his blood. Offensive
tackle Giovanni DeLoatch suffered cuts to his back, right arm, and
right ear.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Pettijohn's friends, who had come from Boston for the
game, were wounded. Moore was hospitalized briefly with a stab
wound to the back, but Thomas, a teammate of Pettijohn's at West
Roxbury High and a 1996 Globe All-Scholastic, was hurt badly. His
liver reportedly was lacerated and bled into the sac surrounding
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the hospital, said Pettijohn, ``He went into cardiac
arrest three times.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn was fortunate that all he lost that night was a desire
to frequent such night spots. His desire and ability to play the
game he loved remained intact. He missed the game against Temple
the following week but came back and played strongly in the final
three.
</P>
<P>
   His friends pulled through, too, though he said Thomas must have
additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is doing outstanding,'' said Pettijohn. ``We just went away
and he was back to his old self again, bugging out and having fun.
That motivates me and that makes me focus and work hard this summer
just seeing how close he was to dying to where he was now and how
hard he fought. It moves me to work hard and try to better
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn, who is already known for an all-out, aggressive
approach to football, has recommitted himself to a successful
campaign and dedicated the upcoming season to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 2, when Syracuse opens against Buffalo, Pettijohn
will try to improve on a 1999 season that established him as one of
the top defensive linemen in the game, even though he is small by
standards for the position (6 feet 1 inch, 244 pounds). He led the
team with 10.5 sacks (for losses of 72 yards) and had 45 tackles
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing with Duke is the intensity level he
brings,'' said Syracuse defensive ends coach Jerry Azzinaro,
formerly of the University of Massachusetts and BC. ``He brings the
same level on every snap, for four quarters, for 12 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzinaro said Pettijohn also is excellent in pass coverage, and
his ability to both rush the quarterback and defend receivers was
key in the Orangemen's 20-17 Music City Bowl victory over Kentucky
last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my size, I start off at a disadvantage going against big
offensive linemen,'' said Pettijohn, who had 10 tackles in the bowl
game. ``I have to play as hard as the person in front of me, if not
harder. I have to play 125 percent throughout the game just to have
some type of advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I like winning. I'm overly competitive. I leave the
bowling alley sweating.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn enters this season with 17 career sacks, tied for
sixth in school history. He tied a school and Big East record with
four sacks against Pittsburgh last season.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who played his first season in college as a
linebacker, was asked move to defensive line because of the team's
lack of depth there, then was relegated to third string _ behind a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frustrated and nobody would hear me,'' he said. ``Nobody
was telling me what I was doing wrong, and I felt like I was alone.
I figured if I had to go through another year of this, ain't no
need of me being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn considered transferring but changed his mind after a
conversation with his mother, Vera.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just frustrated because he knew what he could do,''
said Vera Pettijohn. ``He talked to the coaches at UConn, but he
stuck it out. It's not like him to quit; he just wanted some
encouragement to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I stuck it out,'' said Pettijohn. ``The freshman went down in
the Rutgers game (third game of the season). I went in and just
played, and the rest is history. I just showed them what I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pettijohn said the incident last October has made him more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out, but I'm more wary of my surroundings and people
around around me,'' he said. ``I just like stay to the back. I
don't go out as much now. I chill with my girlfriend more than
anything.''
</P>

HIGH OIL, GAS PRICES FORECAST FOR WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATHRYN TONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New Englanders can expect to pay as much for heating
oil this winter as they did during last winter's painful price
spike _ about $2 a gallon. What's more, natural gas prices are
forecast to be considerably higher than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, natural gas bills could be more than 50 percent
higher this winter than last, a US Energy Department forecast says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are projecting that natural gas prices at the wellhead will
increase by about 55 percent this winter . . . compared to last
winter,'' said the report. Those wholesale price increases will
probably be passed on to retail customers, the report added.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: low inventories that cannot meet growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last month five Massachusetts gas companies _ Bay State Gas,
Berkshire Gas, Boston Gas, Colonial, and Essex County Gas _
received approval from the Massachusetts Department of
Telecommunications and Energy to raise rates. The increases range
from 30 percent to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Bay State Gas, for example, are already paying 51
percent more, said Rob Wilson, a spokesman for the agency. That
means an average household, using 200 therms a month in winter,
will be paying $44 more a month. (A therm is a unit of volume by
which gas is measured.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many oil consumers have switched to gas heat
or are contemplating doing so, due to last winter's high oil costs.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale natural gas prices in the United States have increased
65 to 75 percent since last year, causing consumer prices to rise,
said Demetri Karousos, associate director at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates.
</P>
<P>
   But natural-gas customers are not the only people affected by
dwindling stock, he said; homeowners who use oil can expect high
prices if inventories don't increase in time and the winter brings
normal cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have the same conditions as last winter; the signs
are already there,'' said Kevin Lindemer, senior director at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``Where we are right now,
inventories are low, and it could be a challenge for the industry
to build stocks this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   During last winter's oil price spike, New England consumers were
paying as much as $2 a gallon, and prices could hit the same level
this year, said Bill Veno, director of the oil and environment
group at Cambridge Energy Research.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices in New England are significantly higher than
the nationwide average, which is projected to be $1.15 per gallon
by February, according to the Energy Information Administration,
part of the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of inventory has caused so much concern that US Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson met with 300 New England oil dealers late
last month to discuss ways to prevent another price hike.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast oil inventories are 45 percent lower than they were
last year, Richardson said at the meeting, held in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, industry leaders proposed tax incentives for
distributors who store more oil on site in order to increase
inventories, said Michael Ferrante, president of the Massachusetts
Oil Heat Council, based in Wellesley.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Richardson's support, Congress is unlikely to pass
such tax incentives in time to increase inventories for this
winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because heating oil production historically kept pace with
demand _ which is no longer the case _ US oil refineries have
focused on churning out gasoline for summer travel, instead of
generating heating oil, Ferrante said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have higher reserves of oil during the summer to
tide us over as we go into the winter,'' Ferrante said.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' cut in
production early last year also contributed to dwindling supplies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices for this winter partly depend on whether
Saudi Arabia follows through on its promise to increase crude oil
production to 500,000 barrels a day, Ferrante said.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Saudis break away from the other OPEC countries and
increase production, heating oil prices should decrease because of
increased inventory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies such as Amoco, Exxon, and Shell have cut back on
exploration for both gas and oil because of two globally warm
winters and the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, said James
Sinclair, director of public affairs at Holyoke-based ISO New
England, which administers the wholesale electricity market in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But while stockpiles of natural gas have been dwindling, demand
for the fuel has shot up because electricity plants have been using
more gas to generate power, he said. All of the 10 new electric
power plants springing up in New England will be using natural gas
as their primary power supply, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   Although natural gas reserves have been discovered in Nova
Scotia, they won't push down prices this year, said Tim Evans,
senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus, a financial publishing
company in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with last winter's oil prices, some consumers
switched to gas heat. Boston Gas has received double the usual
conversion requests since last winter, said Michael Connors, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   John Krukiel of Rockport took advantage of Boston Gas's offer of
free heating equipment, which did not include $3,000 in labor
costs, to replace his 45-year-old oil furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've experienced sharp price increases, like this last
winter,'' said Krukiel, a self-employed carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on last winter's oil price spike, Boston Gas, Essex
Gas, and Colonial Gas are offering free furnaces to homeowners
converting to gas.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates warn that converting to gas will not
bring down energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural gas is going to be expensive for at least another
couple of years,'' said Larry Chretien, executive director of the
Boston Oil Consumers Alliance. A nonprofit organization based in
Jamaica Plain, it is not affiliated with either the oil or gas
industry, Chretien said.

FOR GAYS, IT'S A FAR DIFFERENT CONVENTION SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WEST HOLLYWOOD _ Two weeks ago it was supposed to be a big
deal that Republican Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who is
gay, was permitted by George W. Bush to speak to the Republican
National Convention for a few minutes _ about foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this supposedly grand, inclusive gesture, Kolbe
was greeted with virtually no applause and insulted by a few
hundred delegates, many from Bush's Texas, who turned their backs
on him and committed the sacrilege of using prayer as a political
demonstration tactic.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush in tacit agreement, meanwhile, his party officially
sanctioned overt discrimination in employment, government, military
service, and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats went through that ritual ice-breaker 30 years ago at
the convention in Miami Beach that nominated George McGovern, with
a legendary San Francisco activist named Jim Foster, who has since
died.
</P>
<P>
   This week, more than 200 openly gay and lesbian delegates will
be part of the typically raucous Democratic family that is gearing
up for this year's election. As starkly as the difference over tax
goodies for the rich is about to be painted, the Democratic Party
is as antidiscrimination as the Republicans are for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrill of being able to sit at the table after all these
years is beyond description,'' says David Mixner, one of the
founders of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a cog in a growing
network that helps gay candidates from both parties. ``We can bring
a passion against injustice along with a determination to be free.
And it doesn't just apply to us, it applies to the entire nation;
it is the gift we bring, and we have so much to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more than $2.5 million in candidate support in recent
years doesn't exactly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, Mixner's very early support of Bill Clinton,
and Clinton's support for gay rights, helped establish Mixner's old
friend as a force in the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mixner was indeed thrilled, but far from triumphalist on Sunday.
``A lot of the people I love don't have birthdays to celebrate
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in '72, it took months of backstage and semi-public
brawling to get Jim Foster onto the podium in Miami Beach. Down the
stretch of primaries, the forces behind Humbert Humphrey used the
speaking request as one of the clubs the late senator used to club
McGovern with in the decisive contest out here.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Mixner recalled that there were exactly two
openly gay delegates at the convention in New York that nominated
Jimmy Carter. And in 1988, when 20 gay delegates were present as
Mike Dukakis was nominated in Atlanta, an offer to raise serious
money for the Democratic ticket was quietly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also important milestones, beginning with
McGovern's more open, gutsy, and gracious move in support of Jim
Foster _ as a contrast to Bush's awkward tolerance of Kolbe in
Philadelphia 28 years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Walter Mondale was the first presidential candidate to
attend a gay political dinner to ask for and pledge support.
</P>
<P>
   Three years before that, Edward Kennedy had been the first to
run for president with overt gay support. I remember when he
personally attended one of the small fund-raisers that helped him
win the California primary, mingling with super-rich financial and
movie types as well as the local chapter of Dykes on Bikes, the
motorcycle club. On the way to the hillside private home, Kennedy
actually stopped his motorcade on Sunset Boulevard to move Jim
Foster (who was supporting him) into his car so they would arrive
and be photographed together.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda remains forbiddingly long. In 39 states, gay people
can be fired on a boss's whim with no recourse. ``Don't ask, don't
tell'' in the military remains a thin cover for harassment and
injustice, and Bush supports it. American social policy is riddled
with official prejudice, and homophobia may no longer be
politically correct but it is alive and symbolized by the casual
congressional bigotry of Dick Armey and Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The victory fund's major speaker was House Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt, a longtime supporter of gay rights. Gephardt noted
that conservative control means the literal banning of votes on
measures to end job discrimination and punish hate crimes, bills
that might otherwise pass.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't just preaching to the choir. Gephardt's most
eloquent words were a call on the gay community, with political
presence a reality and genuine victory in sight, to forgive the
society that has spurned them, ``to lead by your excellent example
of the power of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   As a turnout motivator, Mixner tells the story of legendary
activist Peter Scott, who died here shortly after the 1988
election. On his deathbed, Scott refused an absentee ballot. He was
carried by his friends to a car, but insisted on going the last
yards into his precinct on his own. He would have crawled if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It is not for nothing that the victory fund's slogan is that gay
people are not just making a difference; in close elections they
have been the difference.

 &HT;    Madam President?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What's next, ``Vice President Ken''?
</P>
<P>
   The joking perhaps was inevitable when the nonprofit group the
White House Project teamed up recently with Mattel and Girls' Inc.
to launch a President Barbie doll. With a politically correct
helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand nuclear war and an
unintentionally funny advisory on the back of her box _ ``Podium
not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this Leader of the Free
(Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous light.
</P>
<P>
   But only if that's what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew you have to start with what exists,'' explained Marie
Wilson, president of The White House Project, which aims to
``change the political climate'' so women can mount successful
campaigns for U.S. president and other high offices. ``What exists
is eight Barbies in every little girl's bedroom. She's not a
throwback to them, she's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   So are a lot of people these days when the subject turns to a
woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, as they will be at the
Democratic gathering beginning Monday in Los Angeles; and both
George W. Bush and Al Gore reportedly included a woman on their
``short list'' of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's been 16 years since Democratic presidential nominee
Walter Mondale made New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro the
first _ and only _ female candidate for vice president. Since then,
the only woman to contend for the top spot on either major party's
ticket, former Republican Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole, couldn't
muster enough money or support to stay in the race through the
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro is surprised no other woman has joined her in the
history books as a major party's nominee for president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be this long,'' Ferraro said last week
from the Virginia offices of her employment consulting firm, where
she was also preparing to be a Fox News commentator on the
Democratic convention. ``I don't find it disheartening. But I do
feel we need more women than we have in the Senate and the
governors' mansions, and that's disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the idea of Madam President? That's the
question being pondered by political observers everywhere who, like
Ferraro, are somewhat bewildered by the fact that one ultimately
unsuccessful run at No. 2 is all American women have to show in the
year 2000. It's even the focus of a new book _ ``Madam President:
Shattering the Last Glass Ceiling'' _ in which co-authors Eleanor
Clift and Tom Brazaitis come to this conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a woman president of the United States. When?
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly anyone asked predicts a woman president will
happen _ eventually _ but that's pretty much the only point of
agreement among them.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who express cautious optimism _ ``I think a
woman is going to pop up at the right time and be a really viable
candidate,'' said Georgia insurance consumer's advocate Cathey
Steinberg, who represented DeKalb County as a Democrat in the state
Legislature for 14 years and lost a close congressional race to
U.S. Rep. John Linder in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   'GLASS CEILING IS STILL THERE'
</P>
<P>
   Others contain a certain amount of pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about the glass ceiling,'' said Matt
Towery, the author of ``Powerchicks: How Women Will Dominate
America'' and a former Republican lieutenant governor candidate and
Georgia state representative. ``The glass ceiling is still there.
There just needs to be a bubbling up that will cause it to shatter.
What I didn't realize was how long it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who sound downright ticked off by the
whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something very sad about us still having this
deep-seated ambivalence about power in the hands of women,'' said
(presidential historian) Carl Anthony, pointing out that Turkey,
Pakistan, Ireland and other nations where women have far fewer
rights than their American counterparts all have elected female
presidents or prime ministers. ``This is sort of mind-boggling. It
throws all the statistics out the window and puts it on an
emotional and irrational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since, when it comes to presidential elections these
days, women seem to do everything except actually take the oath of
office. Bush's campaign press secretary and Gore's campaign manager
both are female, and the two men rely heavily on their wives for
everything from making convention speeches (Laura Bush, notably,
told the GOP delegates she hoped there'd be a female president
someday) to helping them pick a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some who say that the country has squandered
valuable time by focusing more on first ladies instead of potential
female presidents. Yet there's notnge,'' said Anthony. ``That's not
to say that, like, in 24 years we might not have a stay-at-home
presidential spouse. But generally speaking, we will be seeing more
and more women who have had careers in the White House. That could
get us more used to the idea'' of a woman president.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLING COMPETING MYTHS
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from ``Gender Gap'' voters in 1992 to ``Soccer M
contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a myth to say that there are no qualified women,'' said
Stacy Cordery, a Monmouth (Ill.) College associate history
professor who's writing separate biographies of President Theodore
Roosevelt and his daughter, the legendary Washington political and
social figure Alice Roosevelt Longworth.

   ``Women run up against circular logic and competing argumentur

   RAISE WOMEN'S POLITICAL PROFILE

   Wilson says the solution lies in everything from increasing the
numbers of and awareness culture with images such as Glenn Close as
the highly competent vice president in the film ``Air Force One.''
Or, yes, bombarding little girls' bedrooms with ``President
Barbie,'' available inr, the only credible candidates who emerged
were in governor's offices or Senate seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Dole. She had the background and the guts to get into
the race, Ferraro said. Unfortunately, she also had the Texas
juggernaut to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think if Elizabeth Dole hadn't run into George W.
Bush's political swallowing of the entire Republican part of the
cs, the more I've become convinced that timing and luck are a lot
of it,'' Steinberg said. ``It will take timing, the right
personality and wanting to do it. And I think when those pieces fit
together, there will be so many women running, we'll wonder why it
was ever a big deal.''

`SCATTER' NEARLY PULLS IT ALL TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it receives scant attention in the United States, there
is a Triple Crown in Canada, too. There are major differences in
the way the Canadian Triple Crown is conducted, as compared to the
US version, but the two had one similarity this year: a son of Mr.
Prospector lost out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter The Gold, like Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus,
is an offspring of the late, great sire, who was an awesome
sprinter. Scatter The Gold may not be anywhere near the same class
as Fusaichi Pegasus, whose stud rights were sold for $70 million,
but the Ontario-bred won two legs of his Triple Crown, losing his
bid in Saturday's Breeders' Stakes. Fusaichi Pegasus won only one
leg, losing the Preakness to Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Triple Crown is run over two tracks and two
surfaces. The Queen's Plate at Woodbine is raced first, followed by
the Prince of Wales Stakes at Fort Erie, both on dirt. The third
leg, the $500,000 Breeders' Stakes, returns to Woodbine and is
raced over turf, which provides a stiff test of a horse's
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Scatter The Gold was a maiden, with several near misses, when he
took the Queen's Plate June 25 by better than 4 lengths. He then
captured the Prince of Wales July 23 by a neck, and earned a chance
to become the seventh Canadian Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Scatter The Gold camp was confident going into the finale.
``He gave a pretty good indication in his one start on the turf
(finishing second in a maiden affair) that he likes the grass,''
said trainer Mark Frostadt. ``He got in a lot of trouble and came
with a big run at the end. I think he'll get better hold of the
grass. I'm pretty happy with what our situation is now. I thought
the real test would be the Prince of Wales, and he had a rough trip
and overcame it. I'm more confident coming into this race than I
was the Prince of Wales.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Scatter The Gold, sent off at 3-5, finished third behind
Lodge Hill (7-2, $9 to win) and Master Stuart (who went off at
7-1). Scatter The Gold stalked the early pace from the outside, but
when the real running began, Lodge Hill came flying from sixth
place and drew off to win by 3 lengths in the time of 2:28 4/5.
Master Stuart outfinished the favorite by a neck to gain the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wasn't the same horse I've gotten used to,'' said
Scatter The Gold jockey Todd Kabel. ``He washed out in the post
parade and just didn't give me the turn of foot he usually does
when I ask him to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Lodge Hill, trained by Todd Pletcher, is a more accomplished
turf horse than Scatter The Gold, having previously run five times
over the grass. A son of Cozzene, Lodge Hill had also been a maiden
when he ran sixth in the Queens' Plate. He won a maiden race at 1
1/4 miles at Belmont July 9 impressively enough to make him a
threat in the Breeders' Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great trip,'' said Mike Smith, who rode Lodge Hill.
``He was a little confused early. But once he got among horses on
the backstretch, he jumped right into the bridle and took me
anywhere I wanted. I think it was better for him being on the
inside because he tends to look around. The only anxious part was
when I had to find a place for him to run. Once I did, he exploded.
When he made the lead, he put his ears up, so I stayed busy on him
just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a race we've been pointing for all along,'' said
Pletcher, one of the top trainers in the US. ``The distance and the
turf were what he wanted. We decided to experiment in the Queen's
Plate, and he actually ran a pretty decent race, considering he
broke poorly and spotted the field several legnths. He was closing
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Scatter The Gold is no Fusaichi Pegasus, and Lodge Hill is no
Red Bullet, but they are two nice horses and will be heard from
again.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rock washed out
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rain in Salem, N.H., forced the cancellation of
Monday's card at Rockingham Park following the second race. Safety
became a concern as the surface turned sloppy, and the jockeys and
management agreed to call it a day. Live racing is expected to
resume Wednesday . . . The Travers, to be held at Saratoga Aug. 26,
is starting to shape up as a strong race, as both Red Bullet and
Dixie Union, winner of the Haskell at Monmouth Aug. 6, are pointing
toward the $1 million contest. Red Bullet has been idle since
running a disappointing third in the Dwyer at Belmont July 9. After
the race, it was found Red Bullet was suffering from a virus. On
Aug. 10, Red Bullet zipped 5 furlongs in 1:00 4/5 over the Oklahoma
training track at The Spa, pleasing his connections. ``He's almost
over the virus,'' said trainer Joe Orseno. ``He looked super
galloping out. He wasn't blowing at all. Obviously, we were
disappointed we had to skip the Haskell, but I have plenty of time
to get him ready for the Travers.'' Dixie Union will continue to
train at Monmouth. ``It's quiet at Monmouth, and he's doing well
there,'' said trainer Richard Mandella. ``I think he'll recover
better and get a better start on his training there.'' . . .
Fusaichi Pegasus will not race again until the fall, but he did
pass the veterinary examination that will allow the $70 million
stud deal to go through. The agreement calls for him to stand at
Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky., after he completes his career,
with the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 4
scheduled to be his last start.

&HT;     GORE SHOULD BID THIS CATHOLIC GROUP ADIEU 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If Al Gore wants to waltz to the music of the
Catholic Church, he might think twice about penciling in the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights so high on his dance
card.
</P>
<P>
   Based in New York, the league bills itself as ``the nation's
largest Catholic civil rights organization,'' which may or may not
be true. It certainly is the most hyperbolic and vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, when William A. Donohue took over stewardship of the
Catholic League, it has become increasingly sensitive _ and shrill
_ about any and every possible utterance or event that could be
interpreted as ``anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   One example, from its 1999 annual roundup of victimization, is
an item about former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell in the
``overwhelmingly Catholic nation'' of the Philippines. During her
appearance, Halliwell reportedly advised her audience to use birth
control to help limit population growth. She also made a pitch for
safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic League's conclusion: Halliwell ``offended the
sensibilities of Filipino Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to such sensibilities that Gore has surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The group's remarkably wordy Web site brags that the league was
behind the decision by Gore and the Democratic National Committee
to punish Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., for planning a
fund-raiser at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sanchez knuckled under late last week, Donohue demanded
that the congresswoman ``should be fired by Vice President Al Gore
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent Donohue's keen nose for Catholic bashers, one might
wonder why the league believes that ``Catholics have every right to
object'' to a bipartisan fund-raiser for Hispanics at Hugh Hefner's
house.
</P>
<P>
   According to Donohue: ``The Playboy Foundation has written huge
checks to Catholics for a Free Choice, a front-group for
anti-Catholics trying to get the Vatican kicked out of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. Most people think that Catholics for a Free Choice
exists primarily to help keep abortion safe, legal and private.
They think that the group's beef with the Vatican's United Nations
seat is because Rome continually blocks U.N. support for
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   But William A. Donohue and the Catholic League are not most
people. They see unabashed Catholic bashing everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in a Daily Catholic newspaper press release
trumpeting Donohue's selection as one of the top 100 Catholics of
the century, he was described as ``the 52-year-old thorn in the
side of Catholic bashers everywhere, from ABC Network to Disney to
the print media.'' In a three-page biography, posted on the paper's
Web site, Donohue emerges as the John Wayne _ or maybe Charlton
Heston _ of Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   Before Donohue came along, says the bio, the Catholic League was
run as a ``grass-roots program without ever gaining any real
credibility or clout with the all-powerful media.'' But ``almost
immediately after assuming his new position . . . Donohue went into
action.''
</P>
<P>
   That action was based on Donohue's realization that ``the
Catholic League had to be a greater force to offset today's brand
of anti-Catholicism so prevalent in print and broadcast media, as
well as a powerful voice to convey . . . that Catholics have had
enough and are no longer going to stand for the defamation that has
become more virulent and more pervasive than in any time in
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his many achievements, says the bio, is Donohue's
``attack'' on the short-lived ABC series, ``Nothing Sacred.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Though ABC and Disney won't admit it, it was the pressure of
Donohue's criticism and call for a nationwide boycott that finally
axed the show,'' the bio crows.
</P>
<P>
   When Donohue became director, he ``wanted to take the Catholic
League to the prestigious status enjoyed by such organizations as
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
the Jewish Anti-Defamation League,'' the bio says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he done this, ``he has forged this status without
catering to the political and special interest groups as the NAACP
and ADL and a plethora of other civil rights groups have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the bio further insists of Donohue:
</P>
<P>
   ``Under his leadership, the Catholic League has intensified its
efforts to defend Catholics in all walks of life, in school, in the
workplace and in politics without getting politically involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gore, take a hard look. The folks at the Catholic League
only lead when they dance. Break out of lock-step with them and
they'll step on your toes. Real hard.
</P>

PATRIOTS SEND BRISBY ON HIS WAY, SIGN EX-GIANT CALLOWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Gone is Drew Bledsoe's security blanket, Ben
Coates. Gone, too, is deep threat Shawn Jefferson. Gone, now, is
Vincent Brisby, a receiver Bledsoe came into the league with in
1993 and a player he was very familiar with and confident in.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Brisby seemed ready to assert himself as a starter, the
Patriots pulled the rug out from under him. Monday, they released
Brisby and signed receiver Chris Calloway, a 10-year NFL veteran
who had been released by the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots aren't making this easy for Bledsoe. He's had to
get to know his offensive line all over again, he's working in his
fifth offensive system in eight years, and now he'll have to get to
know another new receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was somewhat surprised to learn that Brisby was one of
eight cuts made by the team, including fifth-round pick Dave
Stachelski, a tight end out of Boise State who never got on the
field after various injuries and homesickness made it clear to the
brass that he might not want to play professional football for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Three other receivers were cut _ Tony Gaiter, Matt Bumgardner,
and Aaron Bailey _ along with defensive backs Cory Gilliard, Rodney
Rideau, and Mike Woods.
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe's play has been a little unsteady in the preseason,
consider that his offensive line has been in shambles, he's had no
tight end to speak of, and the running game, as usual, has been
almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby joins fullback Sam Gash, running back Curtis Martin,
center Dave Wohlabaugh, and receivers Jefferson and Coates as key
offensive personnel who have departed Foxborough in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby, who declined to speak on the record, was beside himself.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Michael George, said, ``It was a shock to Briz. He
thought he'd had a very good camp and preseason, and he was playing
with the first unit. There were no signs that the team was
displeased with him in any way. He was working hard, and it seemed
the Patriots were going to get good production out of him. It's
hard for him because he's been with the team so long.''
</P>
<P>
   George said he was already negotiating with the Colts and Jets
for Brisby, who had survived one renegotiation after another in New
England. He was the insurance in case someone went down, and, as
George said, he was working with the starting unit. But things
seemed to change in Friday's exhibition game against Washington. He
saw some action in the first half but didn't reenter until the
third quarter, when he made a 35-yard reception down the left
sideline in the two-minute offense.
</P>
<P>
   The only hint of dissatisfaction with his receivers given by
coach Bill Belichick was that he said some were running poor
routes. He never specified which ones. But when asked about the
receiver situation after Friday's game, the coach said it was
``Brisby's job to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby was scheduled to earn $1.5 million this season before he
renegotiated to reduce the team's salary cap hit. In the new deal,
he was scheduled to earn $750,000 with incentives that could bring
the salary up to $2.3 million. The Patriots are responsible for his
$750,000 signing bonus, which counts against their cap.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby was told that the Patriots have seen enough of Tony
Simmons to believe he can be a starter along with Terry Glenn, with
Troy Brown staying in his third-receiver role.
</P>
<P>
   There's obviously a role for the 32-year-old Calloway, who got a
one-year deal at the minimum salary of $440,000. He was released by
the Falcons in the offseason after they signed Jefferson. A
fourth-round choice of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1990 out of
Michigan, Calloway had his best years with the Giants (1992-98) and
is third all-time in receptions for New York. Patriots quarterbacks
coach Dick Rehbein was an assistant with the Giants during
Calloway's time, and he obviously had a big say in bringing
Calloway here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year with Atlanta, Calloway appeared in only 11 games,
making six starts. His play deteriorated when a streak of 120
consecutive games was broken when he was deactivated for a game
against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving the wide receiver purge was Sean Morey, who hasn't
gotten many reps the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Stachelski, from Marysville, Wash., was going some personal
problems in addition to being homesick. He had left the Patriots
during rookie camp and decided to have his surgery on his balky
right knee. He returned to camp and suffered a toe injury. By then,
Harvard's Chris Eitzmann had passed him on the depth chart.
Stachelski allegedly was involved in a one-car accident in
Foxborough after falling asleep at the wheel, but the details were
never confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The eight cuts came nine days before the Patriots have to reduce
their roster to 65.

BULLPEN IS THIS TEAM'S SAVING GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be shocked, but the Red Sox have the best bullpen in
baseball. They've found a formula for success and they're sticking
with it, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the formula came in handy Monday night in a 7-3
victory over Tampa Bay that seemed improbable when ace Pedro
Martinez left the game with stiffness in his shoulder after just
four innings. The combined efforts of Hipolito Pichardo, Rod Beck,
and Derek Lowe kept the Devil Rays off the scoreboard for the next
five innings. That gave the offense time to rally _ with three runs
in the sixth and four more on a dramatic grand slam by Rico Brogna
in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was that simple. Lowe (3-4) got the victory and the Red Sox'
bullpen lowered its collective ERA to 3.71 _ best in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those outs were precious outs,'' said manager Jimy
Williams. ``Our pitchers were able to keep the game close.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's departure came at a particularly bad time for the
Sox. Tampa Bay had taken a 3-0 lead in the third inning, and two
members of the bullpen, Rich Garces and Bryce Florie, were
available for only limited duty after a two-week road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But Pichardo held the fort for two innings (two hits, no walks,
three strikeouts), and the Sox tied the game in the sixth. Beck
took over for the seventh and eighth (one hit, one walk, two
strikeouts), getting Tampa Bay to hit into an inning-ending double
play in the eighth. Lowe allowed two hits in the ninth but escaped
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a great job again today,'' said pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan. ``Pichardo came in and did a great job. He settled our
club down after the loss of Pedro. That helped get momentum back on
our side. Beck did an outstanding job as well. You know, these guys
are all gamers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, some fans were clamoring for Lowe to be a starter
and turn over the closer role to somebody else. That might happen
one day, but not as long as the formula still works.
</P>
<P>
   ``A closer is only as good as the guys who pitch in front of
him,'' said Lowe. ``It's a great confidence-builder to know that
you can go to the bullpen at any time. We were able to put up five
zeros and keep the team in the game, and then come up with a
dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garces had trouble yesterday and Florie the day before. It was
really up to Rheal Cormier or myself. This was a big win. I imagine
that if Cormier was in there, he would have done the same kind of
job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen works as a team,'' said Kerrigan. ``There is a
real good mix here. They kind of take care of each other. You try
to get guys settled into their roles as quickly as possible.
Pichardo is not quite like he was before, but he can still throw
91-94 m.p.h., with movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garces has been at it for three years. Cormier and Florie are
in their second year in a support role. Beck has filled in nicely.
We never said there would be a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces, who is 7-0, said, ``It was harder earlier in the season.
The starter might only go 4-5 innings and the bullpen had to take
over the rest. But we keep battling. You never know what is going
to happen. You've got to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned how to get ready mentally to play for what
their particular roles were,'' said bullpen coach John Cumberland.
``Anytime you get into postseason, the bullpen is usually the key
to winning or losing.''

AN OBERAMMERGAU PILGRIMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OBERAMMERGAU, Germany _ Mary Magdalene is having a beer. A large
delicious draft Weihenstephaner Weissbiere. She's sitting at the
bar in a jolly restaurant, the Zauberstub'n, chatting with Vladimir
Zerebni, the resident man for all reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir, the nimble, mustachioed owner, tends bar, waits on
table, and has better hands than your usual barmeister. Throughout
the evening he takes time to display his legerdemain by performing
very entertaining interludes of magic. He says he ``worked as a
magician in Las Vegas for 10 years but I wanted to come home and
have my own place.''
</P>
<P>
   I had asked him if there were any prominent biblical figures in
the joint, and he introduced Mary Magdalene, whose lovely chestnut
hair trails well below her shoulders. She wouldn't be weeping and
wailing for doomed Jesus the next morning _ her day off _ so, ``I
like to have a night out. But,'' she says with a smile, ``please
don't take my picture drinking beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. Everybody deserves privacy on a night on the town,
and this is one of them for Mary Magdalene, a local woodcarver
whose straight name is Helga Stuckenberger. A couple of beers, an
evening meal with friends listening to recorded country and western
music. Presently Helga/Mary will return to an emotional, clamorous
Jerusalem, a few blocks down the street. She will be there in an
indelible drama of salvation depicted movingly on the stage of the
Spielhaus (theater).
</P>
<P>
   Oberammergau's Jerusalem has been re-created as the Jerusalem of
Jesus for nearly four centuries. Mary Magdalenes come and go. Helga
gets into her skin and psyche every other day, alternating with
Ursula Burkhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not acting, I'm carving,'' she says. ``In the 1990
play I was Veronica. I guess I'll always want to be in it, whatever
part they give me. Even a bystander in a crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberammergau, a spotless, charming Bavarian village of 5,300,
mostly farmers and woodcarvers, seems a stage set itself. With
brightly-painted stone houses, the gaudily rococo, domed church of
St. Peter and Paul and a mountainous backdrop, it's a magnet
pulling visitors on a sort of pilgrimage from across the planet.
The religious, the curious, the theatrically-minded pour in to
witness the ``Passion Play'' that runs for just five months (164
performances through Oct. 8), but only every 10 years. This is the
year again, launching, as you may have heard, a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Justly proud of their prized theatrical possession, portraying
the last days of Christ's life on earth, the good burghers throw
themselves into the production as though their own last days
depended on it. Some 2,200 men, women, and children of the village
(only Oberammergauers need apply) are the cast, earnest _
well-coached _ amateurs, from stars to extras. Plus amateur sheep,
goats, horses, chickens, doves, and the Palm Sunday donkey.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a compelling spectacle (with orchestra and chorus)
long before anybody ever heard of Cecil B. DeMille and Hollywood
``spectaculars'' _ 1633, to give you the inaugural date. Then the
townsfolk fearfully prayed that if spared from the bubonic plague
ravaging the land, they would offer this dramatic tribute to God.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oberammergau's isn't the world's only ``Passion Play,''
it has endured the longest (with a few time-outs for such
scene-stealers as a couple of world wars), and had perhaps the best
results. After one incursion, prompting the villagers' vow to take
the stage, the Black Death did stay away. No more plague deaths
were reported in this tranquil valley that is guarded by snowy
ranges and a peak called Kapel, built like Gibraltar. And the show
went on. And on. And on.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody beyond the cast has some involvement: ushers,
ticket-takers, stagehands, and cogs in the local economy, keeping
4,200 daily invaders fed and housed. You can't stay for more than a
night. Check into a hotel or bed-and-breakfast, see the play the
following day, and get out of town to make room for the next
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The drive from Munich proceeds across lumpy green hills, meadows
illuminated by wildflowers and pastures munched in by cows. From
the skiing village of Garmisch Partenkirchen, scene of the 1936
Winter Olympics, the last six miles twist through a chocolate and
vanilla landscape: dark peaks decorated by snow.
</P>
<P>
   The B &AMP; B operated by Ursula Heber and Karl Behner is roomy and
immaculate, the breakfast sumptuous. ``You need a good breakfast,''
says Ursula. ``It's a very long day at the playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But a short walk to get there. A pleasant and amusing stroll
populated by such fairy tale characters as Little Red Riding Hood,
Hansel and Gretel, Puss-in-Boots _ early Disney? _ who peer down
from vivid murals on stone-walled, wooden-balconied homes. Kitsch,
but nicely done. Relax _ the Trapp family never appears.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the play, stretching from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (with
an ample luncheon intermission), is a marathon sit, it grips you
throughout. It's all in German, but brisk mountain air, flowing
into the barrel-roofed auditorium from the open stage, is a helpful
stimulant. Bring scarf and coat, as well as a libretto.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of 50 voices robustly sets the scenes. Some of them are
preceded by brief, stunning Old Testament tableaux (called
prefigurations) to allow changes of scenery. In lavish colors, the
actors perfectly still, they seem freeze-frames. Among them: Daniel
surrounded by four lions and protected by an angel; Moses with the
tablets, later at the burning bush; Cain and a flattened Abel; the
suffering Job.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus arrives in Jerusalem on the Palm Sunday donkey, and the
familiar, timeless tale begins to unfold. Throngs of common people
love him. The council of priests, apprehensive that he may cut in
on business, hate him. The occupying Romans are indifferent,
although their boss, Pontius Pilate, accedes to the demands by the
high priests, Annas and Caiaphas, that Jesus has to go _
permanently, on a cross.
</P>
<P>
   Costuming is brilliant. Contributing to a dazzling atmosphere
are the priests in rich robes and lofty, wide-topped tubular
headgear, vain King Herod sporting royal purple, breastplated Roman
soldiers. The Last Supper is eaten, Judas hangs himself starkly,
and finally Annas and Caiaphas have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus is flogged and crowned with thorns. He struggles and falls
beneath the weight of his cross, and is helped by Simon the
Cyrenian on the awful way to Golgotha. The sound of nails being
hammered is chilling. Then the three crosses of Jesus and his
criminal companions in agony are lifted upright by the soldiers.
The condemned three are cleverly, realistically attached to the
timber. Their ache is genuine, however, if not fatal. Hanging there
for more than a half-hour is a tremendous physical strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be in great shape,'' says the other Mary
Magdalene, Ursula Burkhart, whose family is prominent. One of her
brothers, Anton, is Jesus. Another, Stefan, is a Jesus antagonist,
the ranting demagogue Caiaphas.
</P>
<P>
   Anton Burkhart and Martin Norz take turns as Jesus but the
thieves, Stefan Muller and Thomas Steidle, are crucified every day.
Some of the moonlighting thespians in leading parts do get paid.
Jesus tops the payroll. Norz, a laborer, and Burkhart, a forester,
make $21,000 apiece for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are demanding roles,'' says an elder with a fluffy white
beard, Karl Fuhrler. He plays Gamaliel, a priest who defends Jesus.
``They need the rest days. But I work in my woodcarving shop on the
day Karl Hartle is Gamaliel.''
</P>
<P>
   The day that began in the warmth of summer sunlight darkens and
cools as the crosses are raised. A scowling sky unleashes rain.
Appropriate, almost on cue from producer-director Christian Stuckl.
Are these special effects? An Oberammergau theatrical shtick?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened like that, too, when I was here in 1990,'' says my
friend, Aurelio. ``Maybe every 10 years the late afternoon weather
accommodates mournfully for the crucifixion scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the resurrected Jesus is momentarily back on stage, and
Mary Magdalene will declare, ``I know that my savior lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Believer or not, you are stirred.
</P>
<P>
   It costs $3.5 million to put on the show, and $7 million more
was spent on renovating and enlarging the theater. A profit is
made, plowed back into the production and various civic projects of
the village.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio, wanting something carved by Mary Magdalene
Stuckenberger, finds a small, handsome lamb at Fuhrler/Gamaliel's
store. ``We're coming back in 2010,'' she says to Fuhrler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they rewrite the plot?'' I ask. She frowns.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrler says, ``Why wait that long? We're here, and it's just as
beautiful the other nine years.''

EAST HADDAM: AMERICA, EARLIER, WITH SONGS IN ITS HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HADDAM, Conn. _ When you cross the old, steel swing bridge
over the Connecticut River, you enter the village of Goodspeed
Landing and another era: the sunny, upbeat and supremely confident
one of turn-of-the-20th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   That was the age (and outlook) of George M. Cohan, the ``Yankee
Doodle Dandy'' showman of old-time Broadway. It was also the heyday
of The Goodspeed Opera House, a white, wooden wedding cake of a
building that has been a riverside landmark here since 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Close to being demolished at one time, the Goodspeed was rescued
and restored in the 1960s and is dedicated to the preservation and
advancement of American musical theater. On the boards now and
through Oct.7 is ``George M,' a revival of the 1968 Broadway
musical about the ebullient Cohan, who composed the show business
anthem ``Give My Regards to Broadway,'' as well as such sentimental
ditties as ``Little Nellie Kelly'' and rousing patriotic songs like
``It's a Grand Old Flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Unabashedly old fashioned even when they were written, Cohan's
songs and sentiments certainly harmonize beautifully with the
Victorian decor of the Goodspeed, a jewel box of a theater, and are
still capable of bringing tears to the eyes of supposedly jaded
21st-century theatergoers. The Goodspeed has superb acoustics and,
as in Cohan's day, no microphones are used _ or needed _ to fill
the theater with music.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Connecticut River Valley has some of the oldest towns
and villages in the country, most remarkably well-preserved and
redolent of an historic past. One of the sights of East Haddam, and
a patriotic shrine of sorts, is the ``Little Red School House''
where Nathan Hale taught school for a year. Hale was the young Yale
graduate who declared ``I regret that I have but one life to give
for my country'' just before his execution by the British as a spy
during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The area also has a long theatrical as well as patriotic
tradition and a reputation for being ``Broadway with trees.'' When
the Goodspeed Opera opened, for instance, many of its patrons and
performers arrived from New York City by steamboat, disembarking at
the theater's own landing. Excursion and sightseeing boats, most of
which are designed to resemble 19th-century vessels, still ply the
river. One of the pleasures of attending a performance at the
Goodspeed is mingling with other theatergoers on the opera house
terrace at intermission and watching the river traffic pass by.
</P>
<P>
   The five-story opera house, the tallest building on the banks of
the Connecticut, is one of the sights always pointed out to
sightseeing boat passengers. Another, also a kind of theatrical
landmark, is Gillette Castle.
</P>
<P>
   A fantastical fieldstone building standing on a high bluff
overlooking the river, the castle was built by the actor William
Gillette who made a fortune portraying Sherlock Holmes in a
melodrama that he toured the country with for more than 30 years.
Gillette's 125-acre estate is now a state park. The castle _ which
has hidden passageways, secret rooms, and a replica of Holmes's
cluttered study at 221B Baker St. _ is currently closed for
renovations. But the beautiful grounds of the estate, which has
sweeping views of the river and valley, are open for walking and
picnicking.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger boats no longer operate between Manhattan and East
Haddam, but the Big Apple is only about a two-hour drive away, and
the opera house can draw on the full resources ofthe New York
theatrical community to stage productions of Broadway quality.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the East Haddam theater, there is also a
satellite company in the posh neighboring community of Chester.
While the Opera House specializes in classic musicals, Goodspeed's
Chester venue, the Norma Terris Theatre, showcases new and
experimental productions, some of which go on to larger venues.
(Among the past Goodspeed productions that made the big time are
``Annie'' and ``Man of La Mancha.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now having its world premiere through Sept. 3 at the Norma
Terris is the new musical ``Summer of '42,'' based on the 1971 film
and earlier novel by Herman Raucher. The Goodspeed produces three
musicals a year and is open from April through December.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional summer stock also flourishes in the area. The
Ivoryton Playhouse on Main Street in Ivoryton, a village of the
town of Essex, is said to be the nation's oldest professional,
self-supporting theater.
</P>
<P>
   As the name suggests, Ivoryton used to be in the ivory business:
it manufactured piano keys, letter openers, fans and assorted
bric-a-brac from imported elephant tusks. Built in 1908 as a
community center by the ivory company, the barn-like but endearing
playhouse has helped launch many show business careers. Among them,
that of local resident Katherine Hepburn, whose home is in nearby
Old Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   A summer stock theater since 1930, the Ivoryton Playhouse for
the past 14 years has been the home of the River Rep, a repertory
company that presents a mix of comedy, drama, and musicals from
mid-June through Labor Day. Children's Theatre is presented Fridays
at 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing through Aug. 19 is a production of ``The Heiress,''
an acclaimed play based on the Henry James novel of family intrigue
and set in 19th-century New York. River Rep will finish its season
with a contrasting period piece,``The Mystery of Irma Vep'' a comic
Victorian murder mystery that will run Aug. 22 to Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone in patriotic fervor by the Goodspeed Opera
House, the River Rep's production that preceded ``The Heiress'' was
a rollicking, highly professional performance of ``1776,'' a
musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This
is the Lower Connecticut Valley, where yesterday and today
comfortably coexist, and so the show was sponsored by the Griswold
Inn in Essex _ which opened its doors in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   Now as then, the rambling Griswold, known locally as ``the
Griz,'' is the social center of Essex. An an affluent town with
lots of unpretentious charm, Essex routinely makes lists of ideal
places to live.

MAJORING IN THE MINORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NATHAN COBB  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a record, and you can look it up: nine New England minor
league baseball parks in eight days, a meandering July journey
covering 1,218 highway miles, assorted rain delays, a gaggle of
fuzzy mascots, and too many hot dogs. You might say I majored in
the minors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   I started in Portland, Maine, (Sea Dogs) and ended a week later
in Pawtucket, R.I., (Red Sox) but the route was decidedly indirect.
It took me to Burlington, Vt., (Expos) and Pittsfield (Mets) before
leading me on a five-stadium Connecticut ramble through Bridgeport
(Bluefish), New Haven (Ravens), Waterbury (Spirit), New Britain
(Rock Cats), and Norwich (Navigators). True, scheduling conflicts
kept me away from Lowell (Spinners) and Nashua, N.H., (Pride) but
the former was the visiting team when I was in Pittsfield and the
latter in Bridgeport. So I figure I scored a perfect 11.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of statistics, I sat through 76 innings, 78 runs, 14
home runs (including one inside-the-park job), and a one-hitter. I
viewed prospects, castoffs, phenoms, has-beens, rookies, and
veterans. I sat in crowds that ranged in size from the 60 or so
souls who watched the independent Spirit on a drizzly Thursday
night to the 9,230 faithful who cheered for the triple-A PawSox on
a muggy Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The journey happened because my wife and teenage son wanted to
go to Hawaii. Hawaii, which I've visited, is a nice enough place,
but it hasn't had a professional baseball team since 1988. The
importance of this fact cannot be explained to someone who isn't a
ball fan. So my family went to Maui and I motored off to see, among
other sights, the last-place team in the northern division of the
Eastern League and the second-place team in the northern division
of the eastern division of the Northern League. You got that?
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just baseball that hooked me. It was minor league
baseball. When you're comparing the minors to the majors you're
talking chummier parks, more convenient and often free parking,
lower ticket prices ($5 to $11 in my case), folksier fans, and
friendlier help. At Portland's 6,860-seat Hadlock Field, where many
of the Sea Dogs' Eastern League games are sold out, I watched an
usher voluntarily fetch a new box of popcorn for a little girl who
had spilled hers during the fervor of a late-inning rally. Quick
now: Could such a thing happen at allegedly Friendly Fenway? Not
likely.
</P>
<P>
   But if the players one encounters on New England's minor league
fields vary widely _ from can't-miss 21-year-old New Britain third
baseman Michael Cuddyer to former National League gold glove winner
and current 36-year-old Bridgeport second baseman Jose Lind _ so
does the ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Burlington:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the experience,'' Bill Barry, a Vermont Expos
follower, said in urging me to eschew the $2 parking near
4,000-seat Centennial Field on the University of Vermont campus and
instead take a shuttle bus from a free lot about a mile away. He
was right. I bumped along local streets with other jabbering fans
before being deposited near Centennial's 78-year-old grandstand.
``Did you know Birdie Tebbetts was born right here in Burlington?''
one rider asked me, referring to the 1940s major league catcher. I
had to allow as how I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   My seat for the New York-Penn League night game was behind home
plate, but I immediately carved out some turf at the Hot Corner Pub
&AMP; Grill, next to the left field foul line. Only a chain link fence
separated me from the conversation of the young players in the
visiting Batavia Muckdogs' pullpen, dialogue that dealt exclusively
with baseball and young women, although not necessarily in that
order. Nearby, a group of locals wouldn't let Muckdogs coach Dan
Roberts, son of Philadelphia Phillies hall of fame pitcher Robin
Roberts, walk past without a howdy-do and a welcome to the Queen
City. Meanwhile, the public address announcer revealed the winner
of the dirtiest-car-in-the-parking-lot contest. The atmosphere was
akin to a community picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider Bridgeport:
</P>
<P>
   The reading material for visitors to the executive offices of
the Bluefish isn't periodicals such as The Sporting News or
Baseball America. Instead, it's Chief Executive and Fast Company.
And why not? The Ballpark at Harbor Yard is as slick as they come
in the minors, a $19 million, 5,300-seat, city-owned edifice with
20 luxury boxes that lease for $25,000 per annum, a spacious
Bluefish Gear Shop, and a private Harbor Club for folks who've
ponied up $1,100 for season tickets. ``The amenities and facilities
are a large part of our success,'' Bluefish assistant general
manager Steven Schoenfeld said, adding that the team is averaging
about 4,200 fans per contest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived in Connecticut, the state was experiencing
monsoon season. So the game I attended at Harbor Yard was a rainy
seven-inning make-up of the previous night's washout. It started at
5 p.m., two hours before the regularly scheduled game, and only a
handful of fans were in the spiffy park. The Bluefish are part of
the three-season-old unaffiliated Atlantic League, which means
their players, unlike most minor leaguers, are not under contract
to major league clubs. They range in age from 23 to 36, from former
prospects who never rose from the minors to onetime major leaguers
taking their last cuts. As they played, they were saluted by toots
from passing Amtrak trains. Meanwhile, Butch Hobson, manager of the
visiting Nashua Pride and onetime skipper of the Boston Red Sox,
did his arm-waving best to persuade the umpires to call off the
game, in no small part because his team was losing badly. He was
unsuccessful. The umpires and the players endured the rain for more
than two hours, as did the rest of us. Final score: 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was my longest day. It had begun at 6,200-seat Yale Field in
New Haven with a 90-minute rain delay of an afternoon Eastern
League game between the Ravens and the Reading Phillies. (Park and
Recreation Day! Hundreds upon hundreds of screaming kids!) After
the home side lost, 2-0, I made my way 19 miles southwest to the
game in Bridgeport (Cap Night!) before heading 27 miles north to
Waterbury, where the Spirit were hosting the Catskill Cougars for
two games (Lebanese Night!), one of them another make-up contest
from the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   Except the Lebanese had the good sense to stay out of the rain,
which was falling yet again. ``They called at 2 p.m. and opted for
a rain date,'' lamented Kevin Walsh, the Spirit's business manager,
as he stood in near-empty, 3,000-seat Municipal Stadium, hard by
Steele Brook. Even Sammy Spirit, the team's costumed eagle, had
stayed home. ``I've got three-quarters of an inch of water in the
outfield,'' Walsh fretted. ``This better stop soon, because
tomorrow is Italian-American night, and we're giving away Beanie
Babies, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spirit are another independent team. They operate in the
16-team Northern League, and they suffer small crowds and bad
lighting. But I also learned this in Municipal Stadium as midnight
approached and I sat with about 30 other baseball nuts in a heavy
mist while watching the home team win the nightcap, 4-1: They serve
major league homemade french fries here, the best on the New
England baseball circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, each park I visited had its small and not-so-small
quirks. In Portland, fans attempted to inspire the locals by
stomping their feet on the metal grandstand and thereby creating a
sound akin to rolling thunder. In Pittsfield's funky 4,500-seat
Wahconah Park, the sun set behind the centerfield fence, directly
above the Bettinger Lumber sign, where it has been known to blind
batters, catchers, and umpires to the point that games have been
delayed until it has dropped below the treetops. At remodeled Yale
Field in New Haven, which dates back to 1927, the original
hand-operated scoreboard still graces the original 35-foot-high
green centerfield fence, which is constructed of metal taken from
old battleships.
</P>
<P>
   But there are enduring similarities among minor league
ballparks, too. You are unlikely to attend a game that lacks 1.) a
local amateur singer warbling ``The National Anthem,'' 2.) an
assortment of fan participation contests, especially a sack race
and a dizzy bat race, 3.) Queen's ``We Will Rock You'' played over
the public address system, 4.) an advertisement on the outfield
fence that implores players to ``Hit It Here!'' 5.) a slingshot
T-shirt giveaway, and 6.) a dancing, prancing, high-fiving,
hand-jiving, toe-tapping, hand-clapping mascot.
</P>
<P>
   I found baseball away from the field, too. Winding through
Montpelier, Vt., I made my way to a small but thorough exhibit at
the Vermont Historical Society titled ``Baseball in Vermont: An
Endearing Love of the Game.'' In Brookfield, Conn., I pulled off
the highway to take 40 whacks at the All-Star Indoor Batting Range
and Baseball Academy. And at Mystic Seaport on the Connecticut
coast, in a restored 19th-century print shop, I perused a specialty
of the house: ``The Rules and Regulations of the game of Base Ball
as adopted by the Mystic Oceanics Base Ball Club in the 1860s.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. As I headed east, the skies began to brighten.
In sweet little 6,146-seat New Britain Stadium, I saw the Rock Cats
lose to the Altoona Curve, 7-4, and stayed to watch the sky light
up. (Postgame Fireworks Night!) At 6,270-seat Senator Thomas J.
Dodd Memorial Stadium in Norwich, where the Navigators beat the
Reading Phillies, 1-0, in 10 innings _ the Phillies seemed to be
following me _ the first 2,000 kids received free bats (Bat Night!)
and I discovered the perils of being in a place where 2,000 kids
have bats in their hands. And finally, at 10,031-seat McCoy Stadium
in Pawtucket, where folks fished for autographs by dangling
programs and other objects into the dugouts from above, I snoozed
on the grassy berm in left-center field as the PawSox fell to the
Columbus Clippers, 8-6. I was plumb baseballed out.
</P>
<P>
   Total cost of the eight-day trip: $947.75 including tickets,
programs, souvenirs, motels, food, gas, tolls, and parking. I
figure such a bankroll would last about two days on Maui. And you
can look that up, too.

   Even though Labor Day is on the horizon, vacation season isn't
over. Here are a few ideas for quick getaways:
</P>
<P>
   Vacation close to home. In Boston, the Colonnade Hotel offers

off Copley Square. Call 617-424-7000.
</P>
<P>
   Head to the suburbs. The Sheraton Braintree offers a quick
``Perfect for Families'' package that includes overnight
accommodations in one of its just renovated rooms, use of the
indoor/outdoor pool, four movie passes to the General Cinema (which
is within walking distance), and an in-room Pizzeria Uno pizza
party. The package is $159 plus taxes. Call 781-848-0600.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Take a sail &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The vintage schooner Wendameen offers a relaxing overnight sail
out of Rockland, Maine, for $170 a person. Carrying just 14
passengers and four crew, the schooner leaves the shipyard at 1:30
p.m. Once the schooner is underway, guests can join in the hoisting
of the sails or just relax. In the evening there's dinner on deck,
then conversation while anchored in a quiet cove. Captain Neal
Parker serves breakfast before returning by 10 a.m. For
information, call 207-594-1751.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ride a bike &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like joining a bike tour for an up-close and
personal vacation experience. Bike Riders Tours is a small company
with a world of adventures awaiting. The Boston-based firm
(800-473-7040 or www.info(at)bikeriderstours.com) covers New
England, Canada's Atlantic provinces, Italy, France, Spain and

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Take off
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Get grossed out &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Place in Toronto is offering ``Grossology _ The Impolite
Science of the Human Body,'' and reportedly kids can't get enough
of it. The exhibit explains just how the body creates all that
oozy, mushy, crusty, scaly, and stinky stuff. But hurry: Learning
about all that gross stuff, from burping to barfing, ends Sept. 4. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Bermuda getaway &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a new casual, natural Bermuda to discover at Daniel's
Head, the island's newest resort with some 50 freestanding cottages
along _ and over _ the water. TNT Vacations has a three-night
package at $579 including air fare from Boston. For information on
this or other ``out of the blue'' Bermuda offers, call 888-468-6846

   Tickets for the 2000 Olympics are now available on the Web.
While some popular events are sold out, a good selection of tickets
is still available. Check out www.olympics.com. Hotel rooms in

the exclusive Olympic ticket agent in the United States. The
California travel agency also sells packages including air, hotels,

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Movie festivals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every city seems to be holding movie festivals these days. Here
are three with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   The second annual B-Movie Film Festival is set for Aug. 26-27 in

</P>
<P>
   For the world's longest film festival, head to the Fort
Lauderdale Int'l Film Festival Oct. 16-Nov. 12. Screenings are also
in Miami, Hollywood, and Boca Raton, Fla. Festival organizers say
it's an opportunity to see great films that may never reach
theaters or video stores and a chance to meet up-and-coming
filmmakers and celebrities. The film schedule will be announced on
Sept. 1. For the listing, call 954-760-9898 or visit www.fliff.com.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, the second annual Little Italy Open-Air Film
Festival continues through Sept. 29. Feature-length Italian-themed
films will be shown every Friday at 9 p.m. The films are projected
out of Little Italy resident John Pente's third-floor bedroom
window onto a blank billboard ``screen'' across the block. The
screenings are at the intersection of High and Stiles streets in
the heart of Baltimore's Little Italy (more than 20 Italian
restaurants are in the area) in an open-amphitheater style. Folding
chairs are provided. For Baltimore information, call 888-BALTIMORE.

STROLLING IN BOSTON WITH A RED HOT MAMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was big in voice, big in size, and big in heart. And when
she belted out her signature song, ``Some of These Days,'' the
audience would cheer and clap, and that applause was like food to
her.
</P>
<P>
   She was Sophie Tucker, known as the Last of the Red Hot Mamas.
But she wasn't always Sophie Tucker, the wonder woman of vaudeville
and burlesque. She was once little Sonia Kalish Abuza, a
Russian-Jewish immigrant who spent most of the first eight years of
her life in Boston's North End, beginning in 1884.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie, as admirably portrayed by actress-historian Linda Myer,
takes us back to the North End, as one of several stops in a weekly
walking tour conducted by Historical Entertainments. While doing
so, she tells us not only about her career but also about the
city's Jewish immigrant experience, an important and sometimes
overlooked part of the story of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The tour begins at the International Institute of Boston at 1
Milk St., downtown. Sophie _ Myer never steps out of her role, so
we'll call her Sophie _ is wearing a frilly dress, pearls, long
gloves, and a hat festooned with flowers, feathers, and
butterflies. She sets the scene: It is 1928, she's been a
singer-comedian for 20 years, and she's back in Boston to do some
shopping before heading out to Hollywood to break into the
newfangled ``talkies.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sophie and her visitors stroll downtown, she tells how many
of Boston's Jewish immigrants initially became merchants and
tailors, and evidence of that is visible today. She pauses across
from a large department store, started by the sons of a peddler
whose name in the old country was William Katz. But, Sophie tells
us, he wanted to Americanize that name and came up with ``Feline''
because cats (Katz) are felines. The immigration officer, though,
spelled the name ``Filene.'' And that's how one of America's most
famous stores came to bear the name Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   She next stops across from a trio of downtown buildings that are
now dingy and empty but once were dream palaces that, according to
Sophie, represented ``the theater history of Boston in a
nutshell.'' One was B.F. Keith's Savoy, the first vaudeville
theater in the nation, where immigrants wouldn't need much English
to enjoy the elephant acts, jugglers, dancers, and singers. Next to
that was the Bijou, where Sophie got her start doing four shows a
day _ in blackface. And next to that is a building that symbolizes
what ``completely destroyed the vaudeville scene'': the Paramount
movie house.
</P>
<P>
   It's on to once-wild Scollay Square (now the colorless
Government Center), where because her luggage containing her makeup
arrived late, Sophie stepped onto the stage of the Howard Athenaeum
_ better known as the Old Howard burlesque house _ one night in
1908 with no blackface makeup and sang as herself for the first
time. ``The house went wild,'' she happily reports. (She did get
into trouble with Boston's censors occasionally; some of her lyrics
could be interpreted more than one way.)
</P>
<P>
   The walk, during which Sophie breaks out in song occasionally,
continues into the North End, with its red-brick buildings and
narrow streets. Today, visiting the North End is like stepping into
Italy, but when Sophie lived there, the area was populated
principally by 7,000 Jews, 7,000 Italians, and 6,000 Irish. Sophie
and her family lived on Prince Street, in the area bounded by
Hanover, Endicott, and Flint streets known as the Jewish Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   She offers lots of detail about the old days in the North End
and the immigrant desire to succeed. But before we adjourn to the
historic Union Oyster House for lunch, she walks up Copp's Hill
Terrace and looks out at the sea. ``To think,'' she says, ``I came
over in steerage in my mother's arms. But now I sail first class
and entertain royalty.'' Then she utters a phrase that has been
said by many people about many things:
</P>
<P>
   ``Only in America.''
</P>
<P>
   (The Sophie Tucker walk, the first of four planned Immigrant
Trail walks, takes places Thursdays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
through Sept. 1; walks will then resume in mid-September through
foliage season. Tickets are $39, including the walk, the ample
lunch, taxes, and tips. For more information about this and walks
with Benjamin Franklin, Abigail Adams _ also portrayed by Myer _ or
Calvin Coolidge, call 781-648-0628.) &QL;

Travel Trivia: What is the largest American island on the East
Coast? (Answer at end of column.) &QL;

In a name: Denver's lower downtown section is nicknamed LoDo. &QL;

Today's loopy law: All fire hydrants in Danville, Pa., must be
checked one hour before all fires. &QL;

The name's the same, but . . .: Why is it that the French seaport
Calais is pronounced Cal-AY but the Maine city with the same name
is pronounced CAL-is? &QL; 
 &QL; 
What does it all mean? Originally, London's Millennium Dome had
projected an attendance of 12 million this year. That figure has
been revised downward to 7 million. Now comes word that if
attendance at Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany, continues at its
present rate, the year's attendance will be 12.5 million, compared
with an initial projection of 40 million. Do these figures sound
the death knell for such fairs of the future? Is the gee-whiz
element gone in this age of computers? It's a possibility. &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's contest time: Got a wacko idea for a trip anywhere in the
world? Something like visiting every Elvis memorial, for instance.
Your outrageous fantasy could win you up to a million flier miles

   Regarding the loopy laws we often print, Joe Pike of Natick,
Mss. writes: ``Dumb Laws are notorious for being urban legends,
mis-statements, old laws superseded, or downright fiction. . . If
the loopy law is a real law, you should be able to give the
standard reference as would be shown in a law book or court
record.''

guide to Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Namibia lists seven countries that
the desert is in: Botswana, Zambia, South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Namibia, Angola, and Zaire. Our source, Merriam-Webster's

WHEN CULTURES CROSS BEHIND THE CAMERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Mann, who is white, will direct the much-anticipated
film biography of boxing legend Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee, who is black, has a major problem with this.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-pugnacious filmmaker has long-believed the telling of
black stories is best left to black people. Said an unnamed source
quoted in the (N.Y.) Daily News, ``Spike felt that only a black man
could do justice to the story of (Ali).''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Lee has expressed this particular
viewpoint. A few years before he got the nod to direct his 1992
epic, ``Malcolm X,'' he told the New York Times that he had ``a big
problem'' when it was announced that Norman Jewison would direct a
film aboutthe slain civil rights leader. Never mind that Jewison
had on his resume two stellar films dealing with race relations and
starring African-Americans _ 1967's ``In the Heat of the Night''
and ``A Soldier's Story'' in 1984. With regard to the Malcolm X
story, Lee still maintained ``blacks have to control these films.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's comments again raised the prickly question of who ``owns''
certain stories. Can a white filmmaker properly portray the lives
of African-Americans? Should a black filmmaker be allowed to tell
the story of a Puerto Rican family, or a tale set in an Asian
community?
</P>
<P>
   Though Lee won't be there, several filmmakers will gather to
discuss so-called cross-cultural filmmaking at the second annual
Roxbury Film Festival, which kicks off Thursday at Northeastern
University in Boston. The three-day event will feature screenings
of more than a dozen full-length films, documentaries, shorts, and
animated films, as well as a panel discussion on cross-cultural
filmmaking Saturday in NU's Raytheon Amphitheater in Egan Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rumblings about cross-cultural filmmaking come at an intriguing
time in the movie business. This summer has been an especially
successful time for African-American filmmakers and actors with
three films _ ``Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, and
starring his brothers Shawn and Marlon, who also wrote the film;
Martin Lawrence's ``Big Momma's House,'' and ``The Nutty Professor
II'' starring Eddie Murphy _ all topping the magic $100 million
mark.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that recent successes can overshadow the daunting
issues still facing filmmakers of color. Blacks, for instance, are
still more likely to curry widespread favor in comedic, not
dramatic, roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same stereotypes being born over and over again.
Martin Lawrence is doing the same laughing and dancing character,
and unfortunately, that's the perception (mainstream audiences)
have of us that sells,'' said Andrew Millington of Jamaica Plain,
whose film, ``Guttaperc,'' will be shown at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not down on them because they have to work, but as a
community we have to think seriously about how we will marshal our
forces to present different perception of who we are,'' Millington
said. ``And it's something which has to come from the community. We
understand best how to present ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Millington, who was born in Barbados, finds suspect films about
African-American lives and history directed by white filmmakers.
Having worked with Ethiopian-born Haile Gerima on his 1996 slavery
film, ``Sankofa,'' Millington believes such films as Steven
Spielberg's ``Amistad'' and Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Toni
Morrison's ``Beloved'' missed the mark. (Both films faltered at the
box office, though it likely had more to do with the public's
aversion to films dealing with slavery than the skin color of the
filmmakers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They both had the perspective of white directors,'' he said.
``And I'm not sure they could come to grips with the traumas the
(African-American) culture has endured, and has emerged from.''
Although films like ``Amistad'' and ``Beloved'' may never have been
made without Spielberg and Demme, Millington said, ``Sometimes I'd
rather they not touch it. We have to consider whether or not we are
better served by these films.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, filmmaker Natatcha Estebanez contends a culturally
collaborative process can yield rich, provocative films. Her film,
``Blue Diner,'' tells the story of a Puerto Rican woman who
mysteriously loses her ability to speak her native language.
Estebanez, who is Puerto Rican, coproduced and cowrote the film,
with director Jan Egleson, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can Caucasians tell the story of a Puerto Rican family? Well,
no. But we collaboratively can do that, and that's the only way in
which that can be done,'' Estebanez said. ``I, as a Puerto Rican
woman, feel 100 percent confident of the authenticity of the
language and the story line of our film. This is a perfect example
of how two people from different cultures can build on each other's
strengths in telling a powerful, dramatic story while keeping a
very authentic voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always exceptions such as Wim Wenders's
enchanting documentary, ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' which
highlighted some of Cuba's great musicians in their homeland. At
first, Estebanez wasn't sure if she should like the film because
Wenders is German, but ultimately, she told herself, ``This is a
beautiful, honest piece'' regardless of who directed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt that Spike is right in many ways in saying there
has to be a place for us folks to tell our own stories. I feel very
empowered that I've told my own story,'' Estebanez said. ``But I
think we're in transition. I think the arts have to reflect how our
culture is opening to collaboration. I say if you bring people
together from different cultures with different strengths, and you
can combine them and enhance the story.''

&HT;     COURT RULES EX-CONVICT UNFIT TO PRACTICE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The California Supreme Court says a San
Francisco man who bludgeoned his sister to death in 1975, and
served prison time for manslaughter, is morally unfit to practice
law in California despite numerous testimonials of his
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Since kicking a drug habit in the early 1980s, Eben Gossage has
graduated from Sonoma State and Golden Gate University Law School,
done volunteer work for an environmental law foundation, a
battered-women clinic and a project for young addicts, started a
successful real estate business, and lined up character references
from such notables as District Attorney Terence Hallinan, San
Francisco Supervisor Sue Bierman and state Senate leader John
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   But in a unanimous ruling Monday, the court said a series of
run-ins with the Department of Motor Vehicles in the late 1980s and
early 1990s for offenses such as driving without a valid license or
proof of insurance, and failure to pay the fines promptly or appear
in court, showed Gossage's rehabilitation was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pattern of misconduct suggests a conscious and habitual
lack of respect for the judicial process,'' the justices said in an
unsigned ruling. ``The fact that Gossage has so recently disobeyed
court orders, and has sustained several new convictions for such
conduct, indicates that meaningful rehabilitation has not yet
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also said Gossage failed to list the vehicle offenses,
or three of his four forgery convictions from the early 1970s, on
his 1994 application for State Bar membership, which specified that
all crimes had to be listed. Gossage said he had forgotten about
the forgery cases and hadn't realized the vehicle crimes were
misdemeanors that had to be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage passed the bar exam on his first try in 1993, but the
Committee of Bar Examiners found that he lacked the moral character
to practice law, a profession that now has nearly 170,000 members
in the state. The bar's disciplinary court ruled in Gossage's
favor, over the dissent of one judge. Monday's ruling endorsed the
dissenter's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``They missed an opportunity to send an important message, that
in our system we appreciate it when people come back,'' said
Gossage's lawyer, Ephraim Margolin. He said Gossage wasn't
available to discuss the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   However, a legal ethics expert, Jerome Fishkin, said a would-be
lawyer's failure to disclose past crimes is a common reason for
rejection. ``Ultimately the system will fall apart if judges can't
rely on the basic honesty of lawyers,'' he said.

BEE SEASON 
By Myla Goldberg 
Doubleday, 304 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eliza is 9 years old. She's not crazy about the fourth grade,
and when she comes home, she watches a lot of after-school specials
(it's the 1980s, so that's all there is on TV). There's nothing
remarkable about Eliza. At school she is neither picked on, like
her older brother, nor picked out for achievement as a ``talented
and gifted'' student, in the parlance of that era.
</P>
<P>
   One day she finds her metier: She can spell better than anyone
in her class _ anyone in her school, in fact. After winning all of
her school's spelling bees, she moves on to the district-wide bee,
and wins that one too. She advances to the New Jersey statewide
competition.
</P>
<P>
   With each successive step she grows more consumed by her
newfound talent. Soon she's looking at word lists in class, at
recess, and (more important) at home. There her father, a cantor
and a student of Jewish mysticism, welcomes her into the sanctum of
his study, where they ponder words and quiz each other spelling-bee
style.
</P>
<P>
   This is the outline of Myla Goldberg's ``Bee Season,'' her first
novel. But what starts as a story about the uneasy world of
spelling competitions becomes a riveting family drama in which
almost everyone _ mom, dad, brother, and sister _ ends up feeling
alienated and betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Here the nuclear family is given a twist: It's mom who's absent
and erratic, dad who's frantically trying to keep home and family
together. Mom in this case is Miriam, an estate lawyer who's in
charge of making money while Saul stays at home to cook and manage
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam is not a typical mother. An eccentric woman with
rudimentary social skills, she devotes her free time to reading,
writing letters to the editors of obscure publications, and
deep-cleaning the kitchen. She rarely sleeps. Glimpses into her
past reveal the death of both parents during her college years and
a lifelong fascination with perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Her few awkward attemps to relate to Eliza include the gift of a
kaleidoscope she'd saved from her own childhood. Hoping to share
with her daughter her fascination with how the colors and shapes
change with each turn of the toy, she withdraws as if stung when
Eliza's response doesn't match her own. Miriam copes with the
disconnection in her life by shoplifting, which, although it takes
a dangerous turn, attracts scant attention from her family _ until
she gets arrested.
</P>
<P>
   All the family members are caught up in their own problems, at
the center of which is the competition between Eliza and her
brother, Aaron, for Saul's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron had been his father's star pupil. His belief that he's
special, destined for a life connected to his family's synagogue,
is threatened by the reality that beyond this world, he's
overmatched. His lowly status among schoolmates, overly cautious
driving, and shame about his changing body mark him as not merely a
teenager but someone for whom growing up is a form of torture.
</P>
<P>
   His breaking point comes when Saul's focus shifts to Eliza, to
the exclusion of the guitar lessons that once served as his bridge
to his father. Questioning his father's love leads Aaron to
questions of religious faith. A chance meeting with a stranger in a
park leads him to Hare Krishna, which he practices with all the
passion and energy he can't otherwise channel. This he manages to
conceal from the family until he decides to leave home.
</P>
<P>
   Saul is not the family savior, though that's the role this
character casts for himself. His single-minded devotion, first to
Aaron and then to Eliza, comes from a typical parental ambition to
see his children excel where he failed. After trying to change
Aaron's mind about giving up Judaism, Saul reaches his breaking
point in an argument with his son over Miriam's arrest. Aaron
refuses to believe the real reason for her absence from the family;
Saul's rebuke gets personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true? God, Aaron, if you want proof, just look at
yourself. Like mother like son. For the past few weeks you've been
going around in an orange robe telling me about the heavenly
planets and rebirth and sniffing the hand you use for your prayer
beads like it had been touching a woman. . . . When I was your age,
I had friends. Real friends, not religious freaks who only saw me
as one more body to sell flowers in an airport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bee Season'' offers glimpses into the worlds of mysticism,
Jewish and otherwise, and paints a very convincing portrait of
mental illness. But its real power lies in its ability to convey
the story of a family on the point of collapse. There are sweet
moments, especially in the closeness between Aaron and Eliza. As
brother and sister confide worries about their parents, Eliza calls
up a memory that fixes Aaron's place in her world. And as Goldberg
spins this kaleidoscopic story until the pieces fall satisfyingly
into place, it becomes a lot less relevant whether Eliza wins the
spelling bee than whether her family stays intact.

RINGING IN PAST GLORY

<P>
   It's a good thing boxing has a grand past.
</P>
<P>
   The present is just too cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Even usually bland blow-by-blow announcers are expressing
unbridled opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Saturday night, when John Ruiz hung tough
against Evander Holyfield but lost a controversial unanimous
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime announcer Steve Albert called it ``highway robbery.''
Albert's colleague, Bobby Czyz, was equally disenchanted; the
former light heavyweight champion had Ruiz winning five of the
first six rounds and 9 of 12 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime gave viewers a chance to score each round via an
Internet poll, and they too had Ruiz winning, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not the first time boxing announcers have gone
haywire. Howard Cosell was at his best when denouncing the
barbarity of the sport. More recently, HBO's Jim Lampley has been
openly disdainful. After Lennox Lewis and Holyfield fought to a
controversial draw on March 13, 1999, Lampley said, ``Boxing's
cesspool has opened up once again to emit an unconscionable odor.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though boxing hasn't had glory days. HBO, in fact,
airs a documentary Thursday at 10 p.m. on what many believe to be
one of the greatest fights of all time: the first bout between Joe
Frazier and Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier beat Ali fair and square in that one. There was no
controversy, no cries of ``I was robbed'' by Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali and Frazier stood for much more than prizefighters,'' said
Ross Greenburg, HBO Sports senior vice president and executive
producer. ``This fight, five years in the making, clearly
positioned Ali as the symbol of the civil rights struggle and
anti-Vietnam movement, while Frazier was unfairly viewed as the
symbol of the pro-war, conservative segment of American society.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier didn't see it that way; he wanted only to knock out Ali.
His son, Marvis Frazier, told HBO about his father praying before
the fight: ``I said, `What did you pray?' He said, `I asked the
Lord, Lord help me to kill this man because he's not righteous.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong documentary also details how Frazier lent Ali money
and Ali repaid him by calling Frazier an Uncle Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really, I believe, hurt my dad, he gave his
heart and soul to help a brother and then that brother comes back
like a knife and cuts him,'' said Marvis Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Joe Frazier admits that he has said some cruel
things about Ali's present battle with Parkinson's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swallowed a lot of razor blades, and sometimes they cut
inside, you know?'' Frazier told HBO. ``I would live rambunctious
and would say some of the things I shouldn't say . . . I want to
throw the towel in. I am willing to say . . . to all the fans, all
his family, if I have done anything wrong to him, `Hey, man,
forgive me.' ''

</P>
<P>
   The Golf Channel took some heat for airing taped coverage of
Tiger Woods instead of live coverage of the Buick Open's first
round last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cable station had three hours dedicated to tournament
coverage, 4-7 p.m., and spokesman Dan Higgins said the goal was to
have a mixture of highlights from the morning and live coverage of
the afternoon. What actually aired was about two hours of Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little too much,'' Higgins said. ``We wanted more
balanced coverage. But we went a little too far on Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS's weekend coverage of the Buick Open had decidedly
un-Tigerlike numbers. Saturday's coverage earned a 2.2 rating and 7
share, while Sunday's earned a 4.3 rating and 11 share.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has the PGA Championship this weekend, and rest assured
Tiger will be the focus. CBS Sports president Sean McManus has said
in the past that he privately roots for Tiger because of the
phenomenal ratings he generates.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's coverage airs Saturday and Sunday from 1:30 p.m. to 6:30
p.m., with early-round highlight shows on Thursday and Friday
nights after ``Late Show with David Letterman.''

   NBC women's basketball commentator Ann Meyers came down hard on
the Houston Comets' Cynthia Cooper for taunting the crowd during a
playoff game at Sacramento Saturday. ``She's knocking down some big
shots and playing some good defense,'' Meyers said. ``The one thing
I don't appreciate is taunting the opponent, taunting the crowd. I
think you lose a lot of respectability as a player when you do
that, and she's got one of the best games around in this league.
But to be embarrassing your opponent like that . . . I've never
appreciated that in a player. You know what happens. It comes back
to haunt you.'' . . . ESPN's ``2-Minute Drill'' game show, with
host Kenny Mayne, debuts Sept. 11 and continues every Monday, with
a Thursday edition added beginning Oct. 12. The championship airs
on Christmas Day.

IT COULD BE SEASON'S BEST NIGHT _ OR WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thick fog enveloped gloomy old Fenway and the Citgo
sign served as a lighthouse while the SS Jimy Williams threatened
to sink into the Mystic River.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox trailed the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 3-0. Pedro Martinez
left after four innings with stiffness in his pitching shoulder.
The Yankees were winning in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Could it get any worse? Just when the staggering Sox finally
make it home _ miraculously afloat in the American League East and
the wild-card hunt _ Pedro gets hurt and the Sox fall behind the
bottom-feeding Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Then the skies cleared and the world was righted as New England
homeboy Rico Brogna came up in the bottom of the ninth and hit a
walk-off grand slam to propel the Sox to a 7-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, Rico's ``welcome home'' shot will help heal Pedro.
The Sox simply can't afford to lose their ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how it feels tomorrow,'' Pedro said through Sox
spokesman Kevin Shea before departing Fenway. ``I just had a stiff
shoulder. It just didn't feel right. It got to a point where I
didn't want to chance it. It's not worth it, going out there and
getting hurt again and going on the disabled list. Especially
now.''
</P>
<P>
   This team has overcome a lot of adversity. The Sox have proven
they can win with key people on the shelf. They've ignored the
clubhouse turnstile (Lou Merloni Monday became the 48th teammate),
exiles of respected veterans, the suspensions of Pedro and Carl
Everett, and the rift between the manager and general manager. They
lost John Valentin for the season and never had Bret Saberhagen or
Tom Gordon. They even survived Nomar Garciaparra's stint on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   They've stayed in contention despite a salami-bat offense that
has them next-to-last in runs in the American League. The Red Sox
are stayin' alive even with fewer runs than the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   But they cannot survive a new injury to Pedro. Not now. It would
be too much to ask. Pedro has already done a shift in the penalty
box and spent time on the DL with a strained oblique muscle on his
left side.
</P>
<P>
   This was Pedro's 21st start. He started 29 games in 1999 and 33
in '98, his first season with Boston. The Sox need him every fifth
day from now through October. That's why the Nation held its
collective breath and hoped Jimy &AMP; Co. were just being overly
cautious with The Franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro had no-hit stuff at the start. He struck out the side in
the first and the red guys in center field prepared for a long nite
of K-posting. Did they bring 27 Kards, just in case? Pedro had five
strikeouts after two.
</P>
<P>
   Then came trouble. With two on and one out in the third,
Venezuelan second baseman Miguel Cairo lofted a 325-foot pop fly
into the second panel of the left-field screen. It was not unlike
Bucky Dent's season-killer of 1978. It was Cairo's first home run
in 522 at-bats, going back to July 20, 1999. It was the first
three-run homer allowed by Pedro since Sept. 19, 1998 (Mike
Cameron).
</P>
<P>
   Pedro faced eight batters in the third and gave up a double in
the fourth. That was his last inning. The Sox trailed, 3-0, when he
departed. He threw 63 pitches, 43 for strikes. It was his shortest
starting appearance since July 18, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said he noticed something in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've seen a guy pitch as many games and innings as I've
been privileged to see him, you just know when something's not
right,'' said Kerrigan. ``The ball just wasn't coming out right.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Williams, there was little discussion about the
move to remove.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just came out of the game, that's all,'' said Williams. ``I
went back to the clubhouse to see him after he came out. Now we'll
just wait until tomorrow and see how he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kerrigan, Martinez was examined by team physician
William J. Morgan before leaving the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same problem as in Toronto (June 25),'' said
Martinez. ``I didn't want to pitch with it like I did before. But I
feel a lot better now and, hopefully, it's just from the jet lag
and I'll feel better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an occupational hazard,'' said Kerrigan. ``When you
consider the travel and where we've been and the conditions he had
to pitch in tonight. Let's see how it is tomorrow. Hopefully, it's
just a one-day thing. He was fine yesterday and he was fine in
between starts.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't know for a while, that's for sure. There's no sense in
the Sox announcing what they plan to do, and we'll probably go into
the weekend still uncertain of Pedro's status. Kerrigan said it's
quite possible that Martinez would take his regular turn Saturday
against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   So for now it goes down as the best night of the year. And as
long as Pedro Martinez is OK, it could go down as the season
highlight. But if Pedro doesn't recover immediately from the
shoulder stiffness that took him out of the pulsating victory, it
becomes the worst night of the year. Plain and simple.

 HERNDON, Va.: ... Controllers Association.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the nation's commercial airline traffic is concentrated
east of the Mississippi, and the FAA and the airlines have
identified seven choke points in a triangle from Boston to Chicago
to Charlotte, N.C. Officials hope to have procedures in place later
this year to deal with some of the choke points. Other strategies
will take longer to implement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these choke points are caused simply by the increased
air traffic. As a result, at airports such as Chicago's O'Hare,
planes are forced to wait until an opening in an air corridor is
available.
</P>
<P>
   When there are ground holds for congestion, or because of bad
weather, the arrival rate at airports is also reduced. The FAA sets
the reduced number of arrivals in Herndon, and allocates slots to
the airlines based on their share of the schedule. Airlines then
decide which planes will use the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the slots go to general aviation, which includes
business jets. That a plane with three people gets a slot while 250
people on a jumbo jet wait strikes some as inefficient _ and
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, where the FAA would not have to provide
equal access to airports, we would be able to send them someplace
else,'' said the Massport aviation director, Thomas Kinton.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term solution would be to change the way the system works
so planes are no longer guided by older ground-based navigation
aids, but rather by satellites, which would allow pilots to fly
outside air corridors and in most cases take more direct routes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a program by Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass. to develop a
highly reliable system to augment the accuracy and reliability of
global position system signals is way behind schedule and over its
original budget.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project, known as the wide area
augmentation system, was supposed to be available next month. But a
test last December to determine if the system could detect errors
in the signal failed three times. While that is not a problem for a
motorist using the global positional system, for an airplane on
final approach with limited visibility, it could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when the wide-area system will be operational,
but FAA officials insist it will anchor the system of the future
and will help alleviate congestion once planes are at cruising
altitude. Yet it will not end delays. It is a big sky, but there
are only so many airports where planes can take off and land,''
said Schwitz of the controllers union. ``Satellite-based navigation
will reduce fuel burn and flight time en route, but it is not going
to help when those planes need to get on the ground. If you have 50
planes trying to land at the same airport at the same time, we'll
still have to line them all up and put them in a holding pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates the nation's 25 busiest airports will handle
63 percent of the 670 million passengers who will fly this year and
experience 86 percent of all delays. Of those airports, 15,
including Boston's Logan International, are considering adding a
runway between now and 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``More pavement helps, but it will not be the silver bullet,''
said Paul Galis, the FAA's deputy associate administrator for
airports. ``Most of the plans are designed to accommodate more
traffic, and in that respect Boston is sort of unique.'' He said
that Boston would increase capacity by only about 5,000 operations
a year, while a new runway in St. Louis is expected to generate
more than 200,000 additional operations.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's schedule, like any aiport's, is built around ideal
operating conditions. And in good weather, the airport can handle
about 120 planes an hour by using three, or even four, runways. But
because planes must land and take off into the wind, when the wind
is from the northwest Logan drops to two, and sometimes just one,
runway.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed runway would be designed for smaller, slower planes
to land in northwest wind conditions, increasing the rate at which
larger, faster planes can land on Logan's existing northwest
runway. ``We have snow, ice, fog, and wind _ and the wind is the
one delay condition that we can do something about,'' said Kinton,
Massport's aviation director.
</P>
<P>
   But community opposition to Logan's proposed runway is strong,
as is oppostion to runway projects nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard choices will have to be made at all levels of government
with communities around the country to ensure that we have the
infrastrcture in place to accommodate anticipated demand,'' Garvey
said recently. Garvey has asked for a study of the Logan runway
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FAA, NASA, and the Volpe Center in Cambridge,
Mass. are working with Flight Safety Technologies, a company based
in New London, Conn., to increase efficiency by letting planes fly
closer together on final approach.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern on final approaches are so-called wake vortices,
small horizontal wind spirals that extend back from a plane's
wingtips. The larger the plane, the larger the wake vortex, which
are powerful enough to force small planes out of the air. The
system under design would draw on previously classified technology
used to locate submarines to detect when the vortices are present,
and when wind conditions are such that they would dissipate more
quickly. With no vortices present, the separation between planes on
final approach could shrink, allowing a few more aircraft to land.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the wake vortex detection system works, it will
improve efficiency only marginally. Increasingly, air
transportation officials say the airlines must take responsibility
for simply placing too many demands on the system.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, congestion in the sky has reached
unprecedented levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some times of the day we have more demand than we can handle,
and the number of hours in the day when that is true is
expanding,'' said Steven Brown, FAA's associate administrator for
air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has started offering lower flying altitudes to avoid
delays. While aircraft may not operate as efficiently at 24,000
feet as they can at 32,000 feet, that program is being used more
frequently, Kies said.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new phenomenon in aviation is the use of regional
jets, and they are also causing some delay problems. The regional
jets, which are replacing slower and lower-flying turboprops, fly
at the same altitude as bigger jets but at a much slower speed.
``It is like coming up on a tractor on the interstate,'' Schwitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives and passengers, however, love the regional
jets because they have greater range than turboprops and provide
jet service to many new markets.
</P>
<P>
   And executives say it is unfair for the FAA to blame airline
scheduling for delays. ``That is such a red herring,'' said David
Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transportation Association. ``Every
one of those people knows that if 20 planes are scheduled to depart
at 8 a.m., that is not a wheel's-up time. They can all push back at
8, then taxi out and get in line to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Fuscus said, ``the government has a responsibility
to meet the travel demands of the public _ that is a basic
underpinning of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, however, insists the airlines must do their share in
helping to solve a problem with no simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our great challenge is: Can we keep up with the growth we are
seeing?'' she said in a recent interview. ``Some of the discussion
is focusing only on air traffic control. This is a multifaceted
problem with lots of causes . . . and it has to have a multifaceted
solution.''

   Like most parents in car-crazy America, Stephanie Brown trembled
when her children began to drive. Sure, they were plenty careful
when she rode shotgun. But would her Saturn become a Ferrari in her
absence?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking solace, Brown turned to MyParentsCare.com, one of dozens
of fledgling firms cropping up across the country that promise to
turn teen terrors into responsible drivers.
</P>
<P>
   For $99.95, MyParentsCare.com gave Brown a ``How's My Driving?''
bumper sticker that allows other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists
to call a 24-hour toll-free hotline if Zachary or Lyndsay Brown
made reckless lane changes, sped, or failed to yield. The company
promised Brown a full report of any calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son didn't like the idea one bit, but that thing is on my
car,'' said Brown, who owns a stationery store in York, Pa. ``The
funny thing is, I find myself cooling it down when I'm behind the
wheel now because that sticker is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if these start-ups appeal to the scariest common denominator
_ many companies brandish teen highway fatality statistics on their
Web sites _ some mental health specialists question the benefits of
such heavy-handed control tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, insurance companies and safe-driving advocates from
New Hampshire to California say they remain unconvinced that the
bumper stickers work, and have balked at the constant stream of
requests by monitoring companies to endorse and underwrite their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bumper stickers go to the heart of issues of parental
control and trust,'' said Ronald P. Rohner, director of the Center
for the Study of Parental Acceptance and Rejection at the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may indeed be many teens with no problem with these
bumper stickers because they already feel loved and trusted by
their parents,'' he said. ``But if the teenagers feel like the
bumper stickers are a sign of mistrust and control, it could have
the exact opposite effect that the parents desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rohner and others say they have a hunch the bumper
stickers will do plenty to moderate bad driving habits among
younger, inexperienced drivers. But even so, Rohner said, the
better driving could come at a price: fractured family relations.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the monitoring companies _ some of which are
nonprofits _ say many parents are using the stickers as positive
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at 1997 highway accident rates lends the programs
moral authority, they say. Teenage drivers are nearly 50 percent
more likely to be in car accidents than the next most
accident-prone age group, according to the National Highway
Transportation Safety Board. They're also 32 percent more likely to
be involved in fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever had to tell a parent their teen was killed in a
stupid car accident, it's all worth it,'' said Tom H. Deats, owner
of the nonprofit, 800-4MYTEEN, and a 26-year patrolman for the
Arlington, Texas, Police Department. ``I think parents are so busy
working they don't have time to take personal responsibility for
their kids. These stickers put more eyes on the kids. It helps
parents parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Deats, who was at the vanguard of the trend when he began his
company in 1994, now has 2,000 bumper stickers on cars from Georgia
to the state of Washington. Convinced that his company is saving
lives, Deats said he has sunk $40,000 into the venture to keep it
afloat. Along the way, he has persuaded 60 municipal court judges
across Texas to offer his bumper sticker program as an alternative
sentencing option for reckless teen drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Donaldson, president of the Vermont PTA, saw a few such
companies offering their services at the recent national PTA
convention in Chicago, including MyParentsCare.com and its
subsidiary, RatMeOut.com. She returned hoping that schools across
her state would promote the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that anything that encourages more parent
involvement is a positive thing,'' she said. ``This breeds more
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sense among parents who buy the stickers that they've
placed a governor on their children's driving, insurance companies
say they want empirical proof before they start slashing premiums
to those who slap on the stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these people are well-meaning and they truly want to
prevent teens from being in crashes, but there is nothing to
suggest these programs work,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman
for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. ``Kids think
they're invincible. Perhaps the threat of sanctions will do
something, but stack that up against peer pressure, and you
probably don't have much.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, many of America's truck fleets have
enrolled in vehicle monitoring programs, with results that have
certainly caught the attention of the insurance industry. As a
rule, companies that belong to such programs witness declines in
accident rates of about 20 percent, enough to win reduced premiums.
Most of the time, insurance companies themselves pay for companies
to enroll, said Joe Zingale, executive vice president of Driver's
Alert Inc. of Florida, the nation's largest fleet monitoring
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Zingale said he doubts the viability of the teen driver
monitoring programs. He should know. His company tried it in 1990,
and gave up soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``With teens, they rip the decal off, or they cover it up, and
the prank calls are crazy,'' Zingale said. ``You get a kid who
pulls into the high school parking lot with one of those decals on
his car, and you're telling me all his buddies aren't going to race
over to the pay phone to break his chops? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Smith, who runs the Exeter, N.H.-based Parents Against
Speeding Teens, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a similar program, but the phony phone call
factor really troubled us,'' said Smith, whose son, Jason, died in
an auto wreck at age 16. ``This issue is too important for that. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of such credibility problems, many of the for-profit
companies have failed because they have trouble finding repeat
customers _ teen drivers are teens for just so long, after all.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even though the field of teen driver monitoring
only took off in the past few years, parents can have a difficult
time finding a company to serve them. Of the more than one dozen
companies with Web pages offering such services, more than half
lead to toll-free telephone numbers that have since been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my wife and me had such an original idea when we
came up with this,'' said Mike Hill, president of the 2-year-old
877-SAF-RIDE. Hill said he works nights as a Wal-Mart supervisor to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're over $10,000 in the hole right now,'' Hill said. ``We
have to walk a tightrope between sending out a harsh message and
being a total jerk. You don't want to use scare tactics, but the
truth is, if you watch the news at night, it is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohner, a professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut's
School of Family Studies, said he's not surprised that such
businesses are cropping up at this point in US history. With
frightening stories in the media about school shootings, Internet
predators, and rampant drug use, parents are seeking ways of
feeling they're in control, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are perhaps over-aware these days,'' Rohner said. ``It
sounds like kids are going to hell in a handbasket and that they're
in grave danger everywhere they turn.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, even though the majority of parents in the
United States wield moderate discipline, many families might be
seduced by the bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fan of Big Brother, but from my knowledge of the
American family, I don't see this trend as a sign that American
parenting is going off in the wrong direction,'' Rohner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndsay Brown, 16, who still operates under her learner's
permit, said she's not nearly as resentful of the bumper sticker as
her brother was. In fact, she said, it has lent her driving
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got one report so far, and it was someone saying I was
driving well,'' she said. ``When I get my license, my Mom said,
she'll let me take (the car) out more because she knows she can
trust me. It gives me more privileges.''

SOME TECH STOCKS GO THROUGH ROOF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You can argue about the sky-high prices of technology stocks
until you're blue in the face. But there is no debating how those
same companies have delivered on towering expectations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Watching one local technology company after another report
quarterly financial results over the last few weeks produced a
stack of anecdotal evidence that business, at least measured in
revenues, was going through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   A more thorough review of recent performances at companies that
make up the Globe's High Tech 50 stock index prove the anecdotes
were no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   We narrowed the field to 33 companies, principally eliminating
companies so young they don't have 12-month track records as
publicly owned businesses. Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Fourteen of the remaining companies had at least doubled
quarterly revenues compared with the same period the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   --Revenues for the group, which were $6.1 billion, had grown by
53 percent over the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --Subtract giant EMC Corp. from the picture and revenues for the
remaining 32 companies soared by 68 percent in the same comparison.
</P>
<P>
   --Revenues for the entire group increased about 18 percent
compared with results from the previous quarter, just three months
earlier. That gain was strikingly consistent among companies of
different sizes, though the percentage was higher among our
smallest category of firms.
</P>
<P>
   Generating that kind of business growth is critical for many
high-tech companies because their stock values are so high they
require evidence of a booming future to be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   With some high-profile exceptions, sales of technology gear and
services was especially strong across the country during the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think valuations are clearly an issue but there's no doubt
these companies are in hyper-growth stages,'' said Steven Demirjian
of Westfield Capital Management in Boston. ``There's no slowdown
here or overseas, and in some cases it's accelerating.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance within the Globe's High Tech 50 benefits from a
large number of companies in particularly hot businesses at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of semiconductor equipment companies such as
Teradyne Inc. are selling products at record levels. Massachusetts
boasts more of its share of high-end telecommunications equipment
companies, which sell into perhaps the hottest market of them all
today. Companies that help other businesses plan and manage their
Internet operations are doubling revenues year to year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, this is an unprecedented boom in technology,''
said Rob Joseph, a technology analyst at State Street Research and
Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had other powerful technology cycles, but they've been
much smaller. The breadth and strength of this event are companies
dot-comming themselves and building infrastructure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Close to home, smaller technology companies predictably grew
business faster but even the larger competitors were able to rack
up extraordinary revenue gains during the second quarter (among
companies with fiscal years that do not match up with the calendar,
we simply measured results from the most recently reported
quarter).
</P>
<P>
   A dozen companies with quarterly revenues between $50 million
and $100 million reported combined sales growth of 82 percent
compared with the same period a year ago. Growth dipped to 44
percent for eight companies with revenues ranging from $100 million
to $500 million and the two companies in the $500 million to $1
billion quarterly range (Teradyne and Analog Devices Inc.) averaged
81 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the good news, there are still reasons to be
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor equipment makers go through business cycles and
many investors believe the industry is about the slide downhill.
Some big customers, particularly cellular phone makers, have warned
about softness in their forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting companies and technology integration firms can barely
handle demand for their services today, but will those big
corporate clients need as much help a few years from now when they
are more experienced on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the telecom equipment companies. How long will
the gold rush last and how many companies really will call
themselves winners five years from now?
</P>
<P>
   Even if explosive growth extends into the future, stock prices
have a habit of absorbing the good news and creating even higher
expectations. At some point the bar has to be set too high.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient Inc. nearly doubled revenues in its second quarter,
great news that would have cut its price-to-earnings ratio to about
100. But Sapient's stock price just rose higher, and now stands at
about 141 times expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuation is an issue (in all technology stocks), but there's
no doubt where the growth is,'' said Demirjian at Westfield
Capital. ``To some degree they're priced to perfection.''

CAN GORE CONNECT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Clinton era ended _ sort of _ Monday night.
Now it's Al Gore's turn to define an era of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bill and Hillary Clinton will be around for quite a while;
self-absorbed people always linger longer than they should. But
when it comes to victory in November, it's about Gore or it's over
for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Can the vice president finally connect with voters?
</P>
<P>
   So far, this convention is not helping him do it. It's not just
the irony of the Democrats' search for the political center in a
city that doesn't really have a geographic one. It's also the
problem of positioning Gore as the leader for the future, during a
week that showcases the party's recent, controversial past _ the
Clintons _ and its ancient, controversial past _ Jesse Jackson and
the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats need to get the focus away from history.
One way to do it is to encourage voters to make each candidate take
the readiness test: Who is more ready to be president?
</P>
<P>
   Readiness can be measured three ways. Who has the personal
experience? Who understands issues and policy? Who represents the
values of the American people?
</P>
<P>
   Gore should be able to argue that he is more ready than Bush for
the top job. But his resume is not working as it might to convince
voters he would be the stronger leader. That's because people base
their vote on more than paper credentials. Too many voters still
don't know who Gore is or what he represents. What they do know is
confusing. In the campaign so far, Gore changed his message as
often as he switched from suits to casual garb.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech on Thursday night is expected to stress experience
and policy, to show he is more than ready to be president. But what
about values _ the turf made slippery by Clinton _ that Bush is
obviously trying to claim?
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his campaign staff still don't get it, as they showed
with their silly reaction to the now infamous fund-raiser at the
Playboy Mansion. Voters don't expect prudery or censorship from the
inhabitant of the Oval Office. They just want a president they can
respect.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most effective moments for the Republicans in
Philadelphia came when Laura Bush talked about the ordinary people
who come up on the campaign trail, displaying photos of their
children and expressing their longing for a president they can look
up to.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits may do so, but Gore shouldn't underestimate the
importance of that genuine emotion. He doesn't have to insult
Clinton personally in his speech on Thursday night, but he should
explain how his personal code of conduct would be different from
his predecessor's.
</P>
<P>
   The second front to the values battle is about policy _ where
should this country be headed?
</P>
<P>
   Bush vaguely defined the goal as compassionate conservatism, a
concept difficult to understand but still with a nice ring to it.
Gore, too, needs to define a goal or theme, one that energizes the
party's base, but doesn't scare away the Independents.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign 2000 turns on two things: personal values and the
politics of prosperity. In Philadelphia, Bush and the Republicans
paid lip service to those left behind. In Los Angeles, Gore and the
Democrats need to do more. They can rightly take credit for the
good economy; now they need to show how they would put it to its
highest and best purpose for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of plenty, there is quite an unfinished agenda in
America, and it affects more than those we think of as ``poor
people.'' Issues like education and health care resonate with
voters in the center whom both parties are trying so hard to woo.
Bush did a good job of speaking to that center in Philadelphia.
Gore needs to do a better job here.
</P>
<P>
   It could be much, much harder to accomplish in Los Angeles. In
this sprawling world, streaming with celebrities and shiny black
Mercedes, the center is easy to overlook. Is Gore ready to find it
at last?
</P>

GETTING PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sunday was a bad day for the third person, notes John
Carroll, managing editor of WBGH-TV's ``Greater Boston,'' who found
two novel errors in that one day of newspaper reading.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the item in the Boston Herald on Louis Markakis:
``The ex-Big Dig `liaison' apparently loves himself, hates his
former bosses and speaks of himself in the second person.'' The
example? ``Markakis, who in Boggsian fashion often refers to
himself as Lou . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, editors: That is not ``second person.'' Markakis (and
Wade Boggs and Bob Dole) are using third person when they refer to
themselves by name, as if they were other people: He, she, they,
them are third person pronouns. Second person, grammatically
speaking, is you (or thee, thou, youse, or y'all, depending on your
idiolect). True, Jay McInerney managed to write all of ``Bright
Lights, Big City'' in second person _ ``When the acrobat passes the
hat you throw in a buck. You walk west, without any firm
destination in mind'' but it's not easy. Unless you're in front of
a mirror, telling yourself what a jerk you were last night, you
rarely refer to yourself in the second person.
</P>
<P>
   What next? On the same day, The New York Times offered a brief
profile of The Rock, after the pro wrestler's appearance at the
Republican National Convention. Quoth the reporter: ``He speaks of
himself almost entirely in the first person. As in, `The Rock says
. . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe second person is a bit obscure, but first person, as
surely almost everyone knows, is I, me, we, and us. The Rock is
using not first person, but third.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary citizens don't need to know these labels to speak
English; when there's a pronoun problem, it's usually whether to
say I or me, her or she, not whether I am he or you are he and you
are me and we are the walrus. But for journalists, there are some
special situations to consider.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the news writer's standard third person, meant to
communicate objectivity and distance, can sound bizarre in a
column, where the author may have to refer to himself: Suddenly the
subject of the piece is speaking to ``a reporter,'' who sounds like
a shady third character on the scene. H.W. Fowler, no advocate of
the new journalism, hoped English would move beyond this
awkwardness: There is ``no sound reason'' for saying the present
writer or your reviewer, he wrote in the second edition of Modern
English Usage. ``Writers are showing a disposition to be bolder . .
. in the use of I and me, and the practice deserves
encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   The first person plural also provokes a certain skittishness in
newsrooms. The editorial we is fine in editorials, which are meant
to represent the collective opinion of the institution _ a sort of
democratized version of the royal we. But some journalists dislike
the ``indefinite we,'' the pronoun that presumes to include the
audience; they fear that pronouncements like ``We're an overweight,
sedentary, TV-addicted nation'' will offend readers who are not
overweight, sedentary, or TV-addicted.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I think those newspersons underestimate the power of
denial: Even readers who are plump couch potatoes won't necessarily
see themselves in that generalized we. In any case, this usage is
long established, and the experts have never had a problem with it,
as long as the scope of the writer's we is both clear and
defensible. We rest our case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One giant step
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Enormity has been one of the bloodiest usage battlegrounds of
the past half-century, and the holdouts are losing. Most people now
use enormity to mean ``immensity,'' despite the insistence of usage
handbooks that it connotes immense wickedness, and not simply
``enormousness.'' Word maven William Safire conceded the battle
nearly 20 years ago, though The New York Times style guide still
insists on the ``monstrous'' meaning.
</P>
<P>
   So does my friend Betsy _ but she says the end must be near now
that Lynne Cheney has joined the revisionists. ``The enormity of
the honor . . . is just sinking in,'' Cheney said, both at the
Republican convention that nominated her husband as the
vice-presidential candidate and in later interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When a conservative supporter of rigorous education _ and one
with a doctorate in literature, at that _ goes around rejoicing at
the ``enormity of the honor,'' it's probably time for the
preservationists to abandon hope.

JEWS FEAR STIGMA OF GENETIC STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researcher Ann Pulver thought she was doing American Jews a
favor when she recruited them for a genetic study of schizophrenia
and manic depression. She felt it could give Jews a head start in
knowing their risk for two potentially devastating mental
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston and elsewhere, many Jews saw this as yet another
chance for the public to stigmatize the genetic health of Jews _
and now in the murky world of mental illness. Some Jewish leaders,
already worried about discrimination against Jewish women who test
positively for a breast-cancer gene mutation, reacted anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we being singled out?'' said Nancy Kaufman, director
of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston.
``These studies have created an enormous amount of anxiety in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish leaders complain that these studies trigger horrific
reminders of Nazi mass murders based on the notion of Jewish
genetic inferiority. Others are quick to emphasize that today's
genetic studies are intended to help people, not hurt them, but
genetic privacy is a touchy subject for many Jews: Jewish groups
led the recent passage of a Massachusetts genetic privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   While at her lab at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
in Baltimore, Pulver heard a woman over the phone scream at her,
``How dare you do this to the Jewish people!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Jew,'' replied Pulver, a response that has often quieted
her critics. ``Please don't speak for me.''
</P>
<P>
   American Jews are reassessing their role in today's frenzy over
genetic research, trying to decide just what the impact will be if
they continue to allow their relatively homogeneous genes to be
used in laboratory studies.
</P>
<P>
   What scientists so often seek are the blood samples of Ashkenazi
Jews, which represents 90 percent of this country's 6 million Jews
who emigrated from eastern and central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Like other isolated groups, such as the Icelanders, Finns,
American Indians and the Amish, Ashkenazi Jews have a rather
homogeneous gene pool because they descended from common lineages
and tended to marry within the same group.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the genetic similarities between members of the
group, patterns of genetic mutations are easier to spot, improving
the odds that researchers can find the genetic roots of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also like to study American Jews, in particular,
because, as a group, they tend to be pro-science and cooperative
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews in general are eager to do for the next generation,''
said Jane Matlaw, chairwoman of the Jewish Women's Coalition on
Breast Cancer in Boston. ``If it's going to help my children and
grandchildren, take my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jews understand the cool rationale as to why their genes
are so coveted by scientists, they worry the reasoning will be lost
on the public who may be misled into believing Jews have more
genetic disorders than other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society doesn't do well with subtleties,'' said Judith Tsipis,
a biology professor at Brandeis University. ``We live in an era of
one-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazi Jews have been the focus of genetic studies
investigating cancers related to the breast, ovaries, prostate
glands and colon, as well as Pulver's study into schizophrenia and
manic depression. Other studies have focused on autism and deafness
among Ashkenazi Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the popularity of Jewish genes for study should be a plus,
not a negative, for the community, said Nancy Tung, director of
cancer risk and prevention at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``How lucky for the Jewish population that we're learning so
much about our illnesses,'' said Tung, who is of Ashkenazi Jewish
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Tung said she bristles at the ``anti-genetic study'' bias that
she thinks is developing in Boston, as too many people raise fears
about discrimination in insurance and employment. While these are
real fears, she said, they should not stop some women with a
significant family history of cancer, for instance, from securing
medical information that can save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ashkenazi Jewish women have a 2.5 percent chance
of having one of three known genetic mutations that predispose a
woman to breast cancer. On average, women have less than a 0.1
percent chance of having one of these genes.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman has this mutation, Jewish or not, her chances of
developing breast cancer by age 70 ranges from 55 percent to 85
percent, compared to 10 to 12 percent for noncarriers.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who knows she has that genetic mutation has options,
such as increasing the frequency of mammograms and testing, or the
extreme measure of a double masectomy, Tung said. Still, these
women at least have the option of doing something that could save
their lives, she said, while most breast cancer gene mutations
affecting other groups have yet to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should consider it a good thing that we know more about our
population,'' Tung said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Delman, 41, wanted to help advance science when he
rolled up his sleeve and participated in Pulver's study. He said he
wanted to do what he could to advance research into manic
depression, which has hobbled him since his teenage years and
throughout his studies at Tufts University and the University of
Pennsylvania Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Delman, who heard about Pulver's study through an ad in the
Jewish Advocate, said manic depression appears to run in his
family, as a grandmother also suffered from manic depression. He
declined to say what side of the family this grandmother is from,
saying he doesn't want to risk stigmatizing one side of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that he has some concerns about how genetic
findings _ some of which could be released from Pulver's lab as
early as this fall _ will be reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashkenazi Jews might become associated with manic-depressive
illness and schizophrenia,'' said Delman, a mental-health advocate
who recently got married and now works for the Massachusetts
Consumer Satisfaction Team, which assesses mental health services.
``That can be a danger. Information has to come out the right
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stigma issues intensify as genetic studies on Ashkenazi Jews
move from rare disorders that do affect them disproportionately,
such as potentially lethal Tay-Sachs disease, to more common
cancers and illnesses. It's quite another issue when they choose
Ashkenazi Jews as targets of research simply because they are a
convenient homogeneous ethnic group residing within the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews could become stigmatized as having high-risk gene
pools,'' said Michael Grodin, director of medical ethics at Boston
Universty School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   To address stigma issues and more, the National Institutes of
Health is holding its first conference, at the end of next month,
on ``responsible collection and use of samples'' for
population-based genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of a variety of ethnic groups, including
Americans of Jewish, African, Asian and Latin ancestry, are being
invited to attend, said Judith Greenberg, the NIH organizer of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, synagogues and Jewish organization have taken part in
educational campaigns to explain the flurry of information about
genetic diseases in the Jewish population. Still, many are cautious
about this new wave of research and screen carefully what
information comes through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not open the door to let anyone waltz in,'' said Rabbi
Gershon Gewirtz of Young Israel in Brookline, an Orthodox
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lewis, cofounder of Refuah, a Massachusetts-based support
group for families with mentally ill members, mostly of Jewish
descent, said these genetic studies can trigger painful memories
for many people. While she credits Pulver with a ``low-pressure''
approach, she said many possible recruits turn away, not wanting to
divulge family histories, some of which can be quite painful,
particularly when mental illness is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Pulver said she recognizes the courage it takes for people to
take part in her study, but she firmly believes Ashkenazi Jews will
utimately be helped, not harmed. She calls her project the ``family
study,'' with hopes that Jews will see this as an effort to learn
more about their genetic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my Orthodox Jewish grandfather would be proud of the
work of his granddaughter.''

   A. Most vitamins are colorless _ that is, white _ with a couple
of exceptions, such as riboflavin, or vitamin B-2, which is
yellowish-orange, and vitamin B-12, which is dark red. For some
reason, people like to take pills that have more interesting
colors, and dyes like the ones you mention are added. Many dyes are
harmful and the only ones permitted by law in food products are
ones that have been shown to be quite safe. Dr. Knowledge avoids
vitamins with spurious coloring agents, but it's just a matter of

UNION TACTICS: LEGAL LINE IS THIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie producer's car with its windows shot out. Not-so-subtle
threats to shut down a movie set with car horns and bullhorn-toting
pickets. Two-thousand-dollar-a-week union drivers with criminal
records sitting around doing nothing for most of a workday. A
250-pound union negotiator's menacing stare as he cryptically says
a production will include members of his local or else.
</P>
<P>
   Both inside and outside the entertainment industry, many people
find such tactics and practices _ allegedly employed by Teamsters
in Massachusetts and nationwide _ distasteful and troubling. As a
result, a federal grand jury is scrutinizing the practices that
Teamsters Local 25 in Charlestonw, Mass. has used in dealing with
filmmakers trying to get movies shot in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Yet labor law experts say federal authorities have their work
cut out for them _ not only because cases against union officials
are difficult to prove, but because it is not certain that many of
the hardball union tactics movie industry executives complain about
are even against the law.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between what is unlawful and what is not, the
experts say, is often celluloid-thin. The same activity that a
filmmaker might brand intimidation, union officials call legitimate
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line between what is legal what might cross
the line and be improper,'' said Lewis Smoak, a nationally known
Washington labor lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral law here, and the moral law says it's a fight
of survival,'' said Domenic Bozzotto, the former head of Local 26
of the hotel and restaurant workers union.
</P>
<P>
   The law, in many cases, appears to favor the unions. Under a
1973 US Supreme Court decision, U.S. v. Enmons, union officials
cannot be prosecuted for extortion under the federal Hobbs Act for
tactics _ even illegal ones like vandalism and violence _ that
further legitimate union objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can picket and burn equipment or beat people, you can't
charge them under the federal statute,'' one former federal labor
official said recently. ``It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and business leaders have decried Enmons, but
have been unable to get it overturned. In 1997, for example,
Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) unsuccessfully tried to push a
``Freedom from Union Violence Act'' through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vandalism and assaults can still be prosecuted as state crimes,
but a study in the mid-1990s by the National Institute for Labor
Relations Research showed that such cases are rarely prosecuted
successfully. Out of more than 8,700 incidents of union-related
personal injury and property damage reported since 1975, fewer than
300 of the cases resulted in convictions, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The Enmons decision appears to raise the bar for at least one
prong of the investigation by US Attorney Donald K. Stern's office
and the US Department of Labor _ allegations by movie producers
that they are threatened and harrassed into hiring Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but some of the harrassment is legal, experts
say. Noisy picketing _ a tactic Local 25 reportedly used against
the producers of the movie ``Next Stop Wonderland'' _ can disrupt a
movie set, but in many cases it is protected as free speech under
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Disruptive picketing can sometimes be declared an illegal
practice, said Ronald Cohen, regional attorney for the NLRB in New
England, but only under the National Labor Relations Act, which is
a civil statute, not a criminal one.
</P>
<P>
   The Enmons decision does not, however, cover corruption by union
officials, such as bribery or kickbacks or other attempts to line
their own pockets at the expense of their members, experts say.
Federal investigators locally, for example, are investigating
whether Local 25 movie transportation coordinator James Flynn
forced movie producers to rent trailers and equipment from Location
Connection, a company he controls.
</P>
<P>
   The last attempt by federal officials to go after Local 25
officials for enriching themselves at their members' expense ended
with a mixed result.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas of 1994, transportation coordinator
William Winn was convicted of taking accepting a bribe from an
undercover FBI agent posing as a Hollywood movie producer. Local 25
vice president James Moar, however, was acquitted of similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other allegations against Flynn _ that he has padded
payrolls and hand-picked friends with criminal records to work
movie crews _ may be difficult to translate into criminal charges
because they ultimately relate to attempts to help union members
get work. In that context, a threat to shut down a movie set if
Teamsters are not hired, may not be criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of threats in this world that there are
absolutely nothing wrong with,'' said Flynn's attorney, Richard
Egbert.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts also said there is also nothing illegal about
Flynn allegedly selecting friends to work on lucrative movie jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is not technically even against the Teamsters' rules. A new
national Teamster's ``Code of Conduct'' that would make the
selection of members for coveted work like the movie jobs is still
months away from being ratified, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even the new code of conduct recognizes the reality
that ``you are never going to turn the Teamsters into a Boy Scout
troop,'' said Edwin Stier, Special Counsel to the union's
anti-corruption effort, Project RISE.
</P>
<P>
   The draft code, for example, even tells members the proper way
to act toward a mobster who might be a member of one's own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining a relationship with a racketeer who is a member of
one's immediate family is permissible if it is limited to lawful,
social interactions that do not relate to Union matters,'' it
states.

WHEN CANCELLATION STRIKES: A WAR STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Sidebar with AIR-WOES)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of passengers on all airlines is higher now _ more
than 70 percent of the seats on every flight are filled with
passengers who paid for their ticket _ than at any time since World
War II, when commercial aviation was in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy humming and the Internet enabling airlines to
sell open seats at last-minute discounts, planes are routinely full
and airlines never make money by parking airplanes, so fleets are
being fully used.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when a flight with 150 people on it is canceled,
finding 150 additional seats on other airplanes is challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly higher frustration levels among passengers
than at any time in recent memory,'' said David Fuscus, a spokesman
for the airline industry's trade association, the Air Transport
Association. ``It used to be, you'd get on a plane and there would
be no one in the middle seat. Now, there is someone there and
sometimes it is you.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than being stuck in the middle seat that has
passengers up in arms. It's being told you can't get home anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Ernie Paicopolos and Karla Buhsmer with
Opinion Dynamics Corp. in Cambridge, Mass. The two were in Orlando,
Fla., for a three-hour meeting on Friday, July 14, and they
expected to be back in town that night. Although they were flying
on different airlines at different times, neither got back to
Boston until Saturday, because of thunderstorms en route.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, one of the ticket agents on Saturday said to me,
`I can get you out at 11 a.m. on Sunday.' And she said it as if she
was doing me a favor,'' said Buhsmer, who eventually got home by
connecting through Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for her plane at Dulles Airport on Saturday
afternoon, she saw a fellow stranded passenger from Orlando
suddenly appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works for EMC and he said he got so frustrated in Orlando
he rented a car and started driving. At 7:30 in the morning he was
so tired, he stopped, called Delta and said `Where is the nearest
airport?' And he turned the car in at Dulles.''
</P>
<P>
   Paicopolos, who was flying US Airways Metrojet, rebooked on
American. ``I wanted to find a flight that had a first-class
compartment because I figured they would be less likely to cancel
that plane and tick all those people off,'' he said. His hunch paid
off: The American flight arrived on time.

 FRUSTRATIONS AT THE GATE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The line of thunderstorms that had blossomed in
the Midwest was meandering toward the East Coast. Rising up to
50,000 feet, the storms had severed major East-West air routes,
creating havoc in airports from St. Louis to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control
system command center in this suburban Washington town, air-traffic
controllers, airline industry officials, and meteorologists were
trying to make the best of a bad situation. But one of the 11
enormous television screens at the center showed the carnage:
Hundreds of flights along the East Coast were being delayed because
the arrival rate at many airports had been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, which bore the brunt of the most vicious
thunderstorms on July 28, more than 170 flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how things were going, Jack Kies, the center's program
manager, said with a growl: ``Not very good if you are trying to
get somewhere by airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes have become common in this summer of 2000. No one
who flies with any regularity has been immune from the delays and
cancellations that are plaguing an air system that is bursting at
the seams with travelers. But the problems this summer have been
compounded by a spate of bad weather that has exacerabated flaws in
the system ranging from a lack of enough runways at many airports
to overscheduling by airlines to the reliance on a 50-year-old
national air navigation program.
</P>
<P>
   United, the world's largest airline, has been particularly hard
hit. Labor unrest with pilots has forced the airline to remove
thousands of flights from its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the airline, the summer of 2000, indeed the
entire year, is shaping up to be the worst for delays and
cancellations, shattering records set last year. With traffic
expected to increase by about 4 percent a year, many specialists
say that the system is likely to get worse, with scheduling
problems that will leave passengers in the lurch, before there is
any marked improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the FAA has spent $3 billion upgrading
equipment at 20 centers that handle air traffic. That effort has
paid some dividends as equipment-related delays have declined by
more than 8 percent in 2000. Still, through July of this year, the
FAA said, more than 250,000 flights have been delayed, about 10
percent more than last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Delays are up from last year for every month except May and
July, which were down 7.5 and 1.7 percent respectively, according
to the data. Delays through July have surpassed the number for all
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What has many passengers seething is that planes are now so full
that when a flight is canceled airline employees will report that
it could be days before a seat becomes available on another flight
home.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the frequent business travelers, known as road
warriors, who have faced hours of delay, frustrating lines at
ticket counters or the chagrin of seeing their flights disappear
from departure boards. In New York, Leo Mullin, chairman and chief
executive of Delta Air Lines, was trying to get home to Atlanta on
July 28. He was one of tens of thousands of grounded passengers
that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in it up to my eyeballs,'' Mullin said. ``This has been
a particularly difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Aviation Administration chief, Jane Garvey, has
faced delayed flights and has given up trying to get home to New
England some summer weekends. Garvey's most recent flight, from
Dallas to Washington, was delayed an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a passenger and you're stuck, as I was, it's very
frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinpointing the exact number of delays and cancellations is
impossible because the FAA not does include cancellations in its
figures, and the Department of Transportation, which ranks airlines
by on-time performance, does not count a flight delayed if it
leaves the gate within 15 minutes of schedule _ even if it then
sits for an hour waiting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   That confusion was noted recently by Kenneth Mead, the inspector
general of the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this . . . is resolved, the FAA and the air carriers
will continue to blame one another, and the decision-makers'
ability to address the underlying causes such as runway capacity,
air-traffic control equipment and procedures, weather, and airline
scheduling practices will be hindered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise causes for delays may not be known,
specialists say delays are worse in the summer because
thunderstorms make swaths of the sky impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the summer that was supposed to be better than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a collaborative effort
between the airlines and the FAA for weather forecasting and for
alternate route planning that was designed as a short-term solution
to last year's historic delays.
</P>
<P>
   Every two hours, starting at 7 a.m., airline dispatchers in
operations centers, FAA air-traffic facilities around the country,
and officials at Herndon hold a telephone conference call and
discuss a game plan for the following two hours. Frequently, Garvey
listens in to the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ryan, vice president of air-traffic management for the Air
Transport Association, the industry's trade association, says
collaboration between the FAA and the airlines has never been
better. He and airline executives, like Delta's Mullin, say delays
would be worse this summer without the program, especially since
the weather has been more severe this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday, FAA officials defended the
system. They said that about 80 percent of the 14,000 flights each
day depart and arrive on time. But Peter Challan, deputy associate
administrator of the FAA, acknowledged: ``If you are delayed, these
numbers don't mean anything to you.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials from Garvey on down say their first consideration
is safety, and that trying to orchestrate collaboration among
fierce competitors is exceedingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines don't give us too many ideas,'' said Kies, of the
FAA's command center. ``They'll say, `That is an awfully long
alternative route, can't you do something else?' They tend to do
more carping than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference calls have led to greater predictability for the
airlines, but the new collaborative program was also supposed to
maximize the use of available airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not put that into practice aggressively enough,''
Mullin said. ``I don't want to apportion blame, but the FAA is
responsible for managing the airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The national airspace system is supported by radar and
ground-based radio beacon navigation aids that were designed in the
1940s to control and direct planes.
</P>
<P>
   While the sky may seem limitless, the system is a series of
well-defined corridors, or jetways, that extend from radio beacon
to radio beacon. When one jetway is closed, it is as if a lane on a
highway has been shut down _ all the traffic is forced into the
remaining lanes, slowing everything down.
</P>
<P>
   The new program was supposed to open additional airspace,
including some corridors flying over Canada and into the military
airspace along the East Coast. But that has proven difficult.
Canada's privatized air-traffic control system wants compensation
for handling huge numbers of American planes that are neither
taking off nor landing there.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the military's airspace is also challenging. ``In the
past, it has been real hard to get them to give it up even when
they are not using it. But, they are starting to move off that
some,'' said Randy Schwitz, vice president of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After thanking AT&AMP;T, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and other
donors for the scrambled eggs that Democrats were about to eat,
California party Chairman Art Torres had one more important
corporations to praise:
</P>
<P>
   ``And also the great company that has brought joy across America
_ Pfizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the maker of Viagra has a piece of the Democratic National
Convention, which runs through Thursday and includes an estimated
300 fund-raisers and other ``donor maintenance'' parties taking
place from secluded Beverly Hills estates to the Santa Monica Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Even with nearly $450 million raised so far between the major
presidential candidates and their parties, more money will be
collected at the four-day convention. Nominating a president is
only the second most important thing Democrats will accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``As crazy as it may seem given all the money in this
election,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center
for Responsive Politics, which is monitoring fund raising at the
conventions, ``we haven't even reached the peak of the fund-raising
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixing with the powerful and wealthy is Makinson's guerrilla
fund-raising warrior, Holly Bailey. She is spending the entire week
sneaking past the velvet ropes into private fund-raisers to write
daily reports for www.opensecrets.org, the center's Web site
devoted to exposing political fund-raising and corporate
schmoozing.
</P>

   The night before the convention, Bailey found herself at two of
the hottest corporate-sponsored parties, including an event for
``Blue Dog'' conservative Democrats at the Santa Monica Pier, where
blue carpet was laid out and indigo corn dogs were served.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Dog party was sponsored in part by the same Republican
donors that Democrats love to hate: the National Rifle Association,
Philip Morris Cos., US Tobacco and the defense contractor Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Blue Dog Democrats oppose gun-control measures in
Congress and support the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based law firm Verner Liipfert also is sponsoring
a reception at the trendy Skybar on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.
A spokeswoman for Philip Morris, which employs Verner Liipfert,
said the party was a chance to ``share ideas'' with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore in particular has fought for regulating
tobacco companies and for stricter gun-control laws. And gun
control will be a central theme of the Democratic presidential
campaign as Gore contrasts himself with Republican Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the issue of hypocrisy,'' said Scott Harshbarger,
president of the campaign finance oversight group Common Cause.
``This is a party that says, `We're going to fight these
interests,' but in the dark of night, who's paying for these
receptions?''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other major parties include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Mardi Gras-themed event for Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana
sponsored by defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop
Grumman. Both companies want to keep the Pentagon budget growing
under the next Congress and president.
</P>
<P>
   _ A gala at the Petersen Automotive Museum honoring the Missouri
delegation and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, sponsored by
Daimler/Chrysler and the United Auto Workers Union. The auto
industry is concerned about fuel efficiency standards, the
fluctuation of gas and oil prices and global trade among a host of
issues pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reception in Santa Monica for California Rep. Mike Thompson
sponsored by the Wine Institute and several prominent wineries,
which are fighting legislation that would forbid wineries from
selling their product over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Wine Institute spokesman Steve Gross said the Internet bill was
in the Senate, not in the House, where Thompson serves. It is a
stretch, he said, to link the reception to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is chairman of the Congressional Wine Caucus,'' Gross
said, ``and it was really kind of a courtesy from us for him, and
to feature the products coming out of his district.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parties have included a smattering of movie stars.
Low-wattage stars tend to show up at the public events, but people
like Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt, John Travolta and Gregory Peck
appeared at a private tribute for President Clinton and a brunch at
Barbra Streisand's Malibu estate for his presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the objects is to make these deep-pocketed donors feel
like kings,'' Makinson said, ``by mixing with politicians and
mixing with the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention is being sponsored by numerous
powerful corporations, despite an attempt in 1974 to outlaw
corporate donations to conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But now, through ``host committees,'' the major contributors can
give freely to the conventions. The Democratic convention sponsors
include BP Amoco Corp., United Parcel Service, Microsoft and
General Motors, which supplied a fleet of cars. The federal
government is providing $13 million in taxpayer money as well.

UNION TACTICS: LEGAL LINE IS THIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie producer's car with its windows shot out. Not-so-subtle
threats to shut down a movie set with car horns and bullhorn-toting
pickets. Two-thousand-dollar-a-week union drivers with criminal
records sitting around doing nothing for most of a workday. A
250-pound union negotiator's menacing stare as he cryptically says
a production will include members of his local or else.
</P>
<P>
   Both inside and outside the entertainment industry, many people
find such tactics and practices _ allegedly employed by Teamsters
in Massachusetts and nationwide _ distasteful and troubling. As a
result, a federal grand jury is scrutinizing the practices that
Teamsters Local 25 in Charlestonw, Mass. has used in dealing with
filmmakers trying to get movies shot in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Yet labor law experts say federal authorities have their work
cut out for them _ not only because cases against union officials
are difficult to prove, but because it is not certain that many of
the hardball union tactics movie industry executives complain about
are even against the law.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between what is unlawful and what is not, the
experts say, is often celluloid-thin. The same activity that a
filmmaker might brand intimidation, union officials call legitimate
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fine line between what is legal what might cross
the line and be improper,'' said Lewis Smoak, a nationally known
Washington labor lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a moral law here, and the moral law says it's a fight
of survival,'' said Domenic Bozzotto, the former head of Local 26
of the hotel and restaurant workers union.
</P>
<P>
   The law, in many cases, appears to favor the unions. Under a
1973 US Supreme Court decision, U.S. v. Enmons, union officials
cannot be prosecuted for extortion under the federal Hobbs Act for
tactics _ even illegal ones like vandalism and violence _ that
further legitimate union objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can picket and burn equipment or beat people, you can't
charge them under the federal statute,'' one former federal labor
official said recently. ``It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and business leaders have decried Enmons, but
have been unable to get it overturned. In 1997, for example,
Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) unsuccessfully tried to push a
``Freedom from Union Violence Act'' through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vandalism and assaults can still be prosecuted as state crimes,
but a study in the mid-1990s by the National Institute for Labor
Relations Research showed that such cases are rarely prosecuted
successfully. Out of more than 8,700 incidents of union-related
personal injury and property damage reported since 1975, fewer than
300 of the cases resulted in convictions, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   The Enmons decision appears to raise the bar for at least one
prong of the investigation by US Attorney Donald K. Stern's office
and the US Department of Labor _ allegations by movie producers
that they are threatened and harrassed into hiring Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but some of the harrassment is legal, experts
say. Noisy picketing _ a tactic Local 25 reportedly used against
the producers of the movie ``Next Stop Wonderland'' _ can disrupt a
movie set, but in many cases it is protected as free speech under
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Disruptive picketing can sometimes be declared an illegal
practice, said Ronald Cohen, regional attorney for the NLRB in New
England, but only under the National Labor Relations Act, which is
a civil statute, not a criminal one.
</P>
<P>
   The Enmons decision does not, however, cover corruption by union
officials, such as bribery or kickbacks or other attempts to line
their own pockets at the expense of their members, experts say.
Federal investigators locally, for example, are investigating
whether Local 25 movie transportation coordinator James Flynn
forced movie producers to rent trailers and equipment from Location
Connection, a company he controls.
</P>
<P>
   The last attempt by federal officials to go after Local 25
officials for enriching themselves at their members' expense ended
with a mixed result.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas of 1994, transportation coordinator
William Winn was convicted of taking accepting a bribe from an
undercover FBI agent posing as a Hollywood movie producer. Local 25
vice president James Moar, however, was acquitted of similar
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other allegations against Flynn _ that he has padded
payrolls and hand-picked friends with criminal records to work
movie crews _ may be difficult to translate into criminal charges
because they ultimately relate to attempts to help union members
get work. In that context, a threat to shut down a movie set if
Teamsters are not hired, may not be criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of threats in this world that there are
absolutely nothing wrong with,'' said Flynn's attorney, Richard
Egbert.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts also said there is also nothing illegal about
Flynn allegedly selecting friends to work on lucrative movie jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is not technically even against the Teamsters' rules. A new
national Teamster's ``Code of Conduct'' that would make the
selection of members for coveted work like the movie jobs is still
months away from being ratified, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even the new code of conduct recognizes the reality
that ``you are never going to turn the Teamsters into a Boy Scout
troop,'' said Edwin Stier, Special Counsel to the union's
anti-corruption effort, Project RISE.
</P>
<P>
   The draft code, for example, even tells members the proper way
to act toward a mobster who might be a member of one's own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining a relationship with a racketeer who is a member of
one's immediate family is permissible if it is limited to lawful,
social interactions that do not relate to Union matters,'' it
states.

ago. The reasons seem clear: The stock market is far more volatile
than it used to be, management experts say, and directors punish
poor results swiftly. But a new study concludes that not much has
actually changed at the helm of the nation's biggest companies in
the second half of the 1990s. The median tenure of leaders at 65
large companies was the same at the beginning of 2000 _ six years _

   CVN-TEXAS _ LOS ANGELES _ There's a 62-year-old retired
lieutenant colonel who credits the Democratic Party for making it
possible for her to come out of the closet as a lesbian. There's a
former New Yorker who helped invent the zero-gravity toilet that
made space travel more comfortable. There's a former GOP activist
who says she realized she was in the wrong party when she heard Pat
Buchanan speak at the 1992 GOP convention in Houston. And there is
a woman who attended her first Democratic National Convention in

 &HT;    w/COX-ADULT-STUDENTS, COX-ADULT-TYPICAL, COX-ADULT-STUDENT-DATA
 &HT;    BY JOANNE HUIST SMITH
 &HT;    C.2000 COX NEWS SERVICE
 &HT;    DAYTON, Ohio _ Barb Herzog likes her job. The pay is good and
she's often the person her bosses, 10 years her junior, seek when
they have questions.
 &HT;    But despite her expertise in medical finance, the 46-year-old
felt she was at a disadvantage. She didn't have a college
education.
 &HT;    ``I've got the hands-on experience, now I want the degree,''
Herzog said. ``I need a school that will let me do classwork on
airplanes, in hotel rooms, on the Internet.''
 &HT;    While her work schedule is hectic, Herzog begins this fall to
convert on-the-job training into an associate's degree from
Sinclair Community College in Dayton. She joins about 21,000
students who turn to the two-year college each year to update job
skills, change careers or for personal enrichment.
 &HT;    Like Herzog, many of Sinclair's students, with an average age of
31, juggle jobs and family. Sitting in a classroom during the
traditional work week is not an option. Classes have to be
affordable. Learning has to be molded around already busy lives.
 &HT;    From application to graduation, that's what Sinclair tries to
do.
 &HT;    Named an Adult Learner Friendly Institution by the Washington,
D.C.-based Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, Sinclair
has focused on designing courses for adults that are accessible and
moderately priced. At $29.45 a credit hour for Montgomery County
(Ohio) residents, Sinclair is one of the lowest-cost colleges in
Ohio, according to the study. The branch campus of Miami University
in nearby Middletown charges $114 or $163 a credit hour.
 &HT;    Sinclair wants to remove the ``I can't'' from the going-back-to
school scenario, said Dodie Munn, an admissions officer.
 &HT;    ``Coming back to school is a big deal for adults. They're afraid
of failure,'' Munn said. ``Many who come to us don't recognize the
successes they've had in life. We look at where they are and where
they need to be. Then we show them learning options that fit their
needs.''
 &HT;    It's all about choices, Munn said.
 &HT;    Students may take classes at the college's main campus in
downtown Dayton or opt for a video class at 10 area high schools
and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in nearby Fairborn. For
students who can't make it to class during the week, classes are
offered evenings and weekends.
 &HT;    Kathy Ragan, 51, of Huber Heights, Ohio, waited until her four
children graduated from high scse semester, dorm rooms, long
registration lines, ostentatious partying, and all-night cramming
for tests that require regurgitation of lecture notes.
 &HT;    To attract adults, some emphasiz Most colleges have decided that
it would be too costly to sponsor a day care center. But many offer
parents a list of respected providers or sponsor special children's
events. In Brunswick, Ga., for example, student activity fees at
Coastal Georgia Community College help pay for free family movies
and for a Saturday cookout at which a magician or other entertainer
keeps children occupied on campus while their parents use the
library.
 &HT;    The Internet helps some adults tuck lessons into niches in
ttudents tend to view things more from a consumer standpoint, and
their biggest concern is the impact on their family in finances and
time,'' DeGabriele said at Mesa State College, where he counsels
transfer students. ``The idea that a professor would try to have
his only office hours at an inconvenient time, or that a bookstore
or finance office wouldn't be open on evenings or weekenhe maximum
allowable in transfer credits and in experiential credits,''
Denison said. ``We are expected to respond to requests for
schedules tailor-made to one individual student's needs (and) to
eliminate any instructor whom students don't feel is teaching what
they want to know.''
 &HT;    As director of the office of adult learning services in the New
York headquarters of the nonprofit College Board, Carol
Aslanian(cq) advises colleges to adjustincome from their investment
in higher education.
 &HT;    In fact, convenience and lower cost are prime reasons why about
55 percent of adult students go to community colleges, which today
have campuses within less than an hour's drive of the vast majority
of U.S. homes.
 &HT;    ``Adults are the most diverse students in higher education,''
said George Boggs, president of Palomar College, who will leave the
nine-campus California institution ton or learn a foreign language
in preparation for a trip.''
 &HT;    To meet the needs of those students, Palomar supplements its
traditional fall and spring semesters with ``fast-track eight-weeTV
college, weekend college, and four-, six-, and eight-week summer
sessions.''
 &HT;

 &HT;    At National University, the third largest private universit who
are working full-time,'' McCalla said. Technology consultant who
like the idea of taking a course or two between jobs.
 &HT;    Monique La Chappa, 35, who graduated from National in July, said
she worked full-time when she started 42 months ago. But she
switched to a half-time job after she fell asleep on a freeway and
ran into a roadside reflector on the 60-mile drive from San eople's
life better.'' But, she added, ``In fairness, you'd better warn
anyone who is thinking of doing this that I also put 118,000 miles
on my Toyota Tercel, and I'm $35,000 in debt.''

   WASHINGTON _ After breakfast on a school-day morning, Theresa
Johnson double-checks three sets of homework as she packs lunches
into three backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Lindsay, 10, and son Bryantven more than the
national average. Johnson is taking on the heavyweight schedule
because she is growing impatient as she sprints toward the end of a
marathon quest for a bachelor's degree that began
</P>
<P>
   more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the College Board drew up a composite of the 42 percent of
the nation's college students who are 25 or older, the New
York-based organization concluded that, like Johnson, the typical
adult student would are so centered on the party-age, beer-drinking
student whose mommy and daddy are paying for their education.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, she added, ``I'm not knocking it. When I was 18, I was
pretty clueless myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She married after high school, worked in sales jobs before
becoming a paramedic, and had two children before her divorce. Her
ex-husband has since died.
</P>
<P>
   When Bring, she resumed her quest in the spring of 1999 at Iowa
State, where she majors in housing and the near environment and
minors in gerontology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the strongest gerontology program in the state, and I
want to work on designs that make it easier and safer for older
people with dementia to function, whether in Alzheimer's care
facilities or their own homes,'' she said. ``Iy seeks high grades.
In her case, high marks also help her retain the merit-based
scholarships that supplement her federal Pell grant and earnings
from her work-study job as a research assistant.
</P>
<P>
   She pinches some pennies. Her lunch consists of leftovers from
the freezer, heated in a campus microwave because that means the $5
a day that would pay for a sub sandwich, soda and chips on campus
can be used instead for ``baseball cleats or lun your life. It
shows your children that a college education is important,''
Johnson said. ``I've found a strength within myself that I never
thought I had.''

BRITISH AIRWAYS GROUNDS ITS CONCORDES AFTER REPORT BY INVESTIGATORS
 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC grounded its fleet of Concorde
supersonic airliners Tuesday after investigators said they would
urge the withdrawal of the airplane's airworthiness certification
following the fatal Concorde crash near Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways spokeswoman called the suspension of flights _
which halted a plane even as it taxied for takeoff _ indefinite,
but it was unclear whether the move effectively meant the end of
supersonic trans-Atlantic flights, largely the elite preserve of
executives and celebrities over the airplane's 25 years of
commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash near Paris was the only fatal Concorde
accident in the plane's history. When it happened, Air France
immediately suspended flights by its five remaining Concordes, but,
after an initial suspension, British Airways continued to fly the
needle-nosed airliner, which crosses the Atlantic in three and a
half hours. British Airways operates seven Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   British officials declined to say whether Tuesday's suspension
meant that British Airways Concorde flights had also been at risk
since the Paris crash. In that crash, the plane struck a hotel,
killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators concluded five days ago that a 16-inch
piece of metal on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport probably
slashed a tire as the plane hurtled down the runway on take-off at
about 195 mph, scattering debris that ruptured fuel tanks. The
plane took off with a plume of flame spewing from its wing and
crashed soon afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the French
Bureau of Accident Investigations told British Airways early
Tuesday that they would recommend suspending the Concorde's
certificate of airworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   When British Airways learned that the suspension would be
sought, they radioed the pilot of Concorde flight BA 001 as it was
taxiing on the runway for takeoff and ordered it to return to the
terminal, according to British news reports.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We immediately withdrew our supersonic fleet from service this
morning, canceling the Concorde service BA001,'' Rod Eddington, the
British Airways chief executive, said Tuesday. He did not say what
prompted the development, which represented an about-face from the
airline's earlier insistence, after the Paris crash, that its
Concorde fleet should continue flying. A scheduled return flight
from New York Tuesday night was also canceled.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   David Learmount, operations and safety officer of Flight
International magazine, called the suspension of the Concorde's
certification ``very, very rare and very, very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that British Airways had modified its fleet of Concordes
in the mid-1990s to prevent a similar tire-burst from causing
catastrophic damage and, on the basis of that modification, the
airplanes had been permitted to continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   After assessing evidence from the French investigation, however,
British investigators ``must have come to the conclusion that
despite the British Airways modification, the risk is unacceptably
high'' of a crash similar to the one in France, Learmount said.
</P>
<P>
   A suspension of certification, he said, means ``the aircraft is
grounded, and it has to be modified so that the risk is eliminated
or reduced'' to the satisfaction of aviation regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The last such suspension of certification, he said, involved
DC-10 aircraft. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded
the planes for five weeks in 1979 after the crash of an American
Airlines plane in Chicago killed 275 people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   British Airways says Britain's Civil Aviation Authority
supported its earlier decision to continue flying the Concorde
after the airline undertook a series of tests of the fleet's
airframes, engines, tires, wheels and hydraulic systems.
</P>
<P>
   The British accidents investigation branch, a department of the
transport ministry, declined to say why it would make such a
recommendation, referring callers to the Civil Aviation Authority.
The Civil Aviation Authority declined immediate comment.

   Kathy Ragan, 51, of Huber Heigg higher education, even as it
changes them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say 'college student' and most people think of an 18- or
19-year-old. That's because we have a cultural tradition in which
that marks the transition time from adolescence to adulthood,''
said Ken Foster of the University of Utah, who has written four
books on adult learners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the average age of college students now development class,
seminar or workshop in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the deepest reason they enroll is a hunger for
learning,'' said Janice Gordon-Kelter of Houston, dean of special
programs at the University of St. Thomas, which offers a well-known
degree completion program for adults who have earned at least two
years of credits elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other big reason is, they've been laid off or seen others
promoted ahead of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a degree at any age can pay off monetthe financial
support of their employer, and certainly an appreciation of the
value of an education.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Hamby(cq), who directs a degree completion program at
Abilene Christian University for 170 adults up to 72 years old,
said, ``We waste education on 18-year-olds, which I know because I
was once 18 myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He said older students ``absorb new information and theories
like sponges, but they'll challenge the socks off you if yohat
require regurgitation of lecture notes.
</P>
<P>
   To attract adults, some emphasize credit for life experiences
and flexible credit transfers.
</P>
<P>
   Others offer ``stop-out'' policies that retain potential
dropouts by letting a student whose course is interrupted by a
family emergency resume the course when it is offered again.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Denver's Women's Colletertainer keeps children
occupied on campus while their parents use the library.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet helps some adults tuck lessons into niches in their
hectic days of balancing family, work and study. Pat Kapper, a vice
president at the profitable Career Education Corporation, which
offers degrees in 15 states, said, ``Older students also happen to
be disciplined learners (with) son evenings or weekends can bug
them.''

that they were still capable students who had now matured and could

&HT;     TEST SCORE GAP REMAINS FOR STUDENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH
SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Posing a persistent and staggering challenge to
California, results of a statewide achievement exam released
Tuesday show that public schools are failing to educate immigrant
children who are not fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   The results were downplayed by politicians and school officials
who said that children who lack English skills cannot be expected
to do well on an English-only exam. But the results follow a study
released last month by the independent, nonpartisan RAND research
institution comparing national test scores of California's
immigrant and low-income students to scores of similar students in
other states. California ranked dead last in that comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these results should make anyone very happy,'' said
Kenji Hakuta, an education professor at Stanford University.
``California is only beginning to address the issue of how to
educate limited-English kids _ and to understand that this is as
much an economic and resources crisis as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five percent of California's 5.6 million schoolchildren
cannot speak English well enough to understand what goes on in the
classroom. That number is expected to climb in coming years as
Hispanics, who are 40 percent of the student population but 80
percent of all students with limited English skills, become more
than half the student population by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement exam scores are for 4.3 million public
schoolchildren in grades 2 through 11. They are separated into
subgroups: English-fluent and those only partly proficient in
English; boys and girls; special education students; and income
level.
</P>
<P>
   While higher this year than last, the scores for children with
limited proficiency in English are stunningly low and trail behind
their fluent classmates. Since voters approved a 1997 ballot
initiative barring bilingual instruction in the state's schools,
all students have been taught in English. The statewide exam, the
Stanford 9, has been given since 1998 and requires that all
students be tested in English.
</P>
<P>
   As with scores of English-fluent children, year-to-year gains
for those who are not fluent were most prominent at the elementary
level. The scores were also highest at that level, in every subject
and for all children regardless of English proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   But the scores highlight extreme differences between children
who are fluent in English and those who are learning English as a
second language. This year's statewide achievement exam found:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty-one percent of English-fluent second-graders performed
at or above the national average in reading, compared with 25
percent of their classmates with limited-English proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty percent of English-fluent fourth-graders were at or
above the national average in math, compared with 27 percent for
the others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifty-two percent of English-fluent sixth-graders met or
surpassed the national average in spelling, compared with 16
percent of sixth-graders with only limited proficiency in the
language.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-seven percent of ninth-graders scored at or above the
national average in science and 62 percent in social studies,
compared with 12 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of
limited-English proficient ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   State officials touted the gains while touching on the glaringly
low scores of students who have only limited proficiency in
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scores indicate that our focus on improved academic
achievement is taking hold for all groups of students,'' said Gov.
Gray Davis, a Democrat. ``While we still have a long way to go, I
am pleased that as we raise expectations in California schools, all
students are benefiting from our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   State schools chief Delaine Eastin said, ``The good news is that
results for our English learners increased in almost all subjects
and all grade levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our schools serve a population that is extremely diverse,''
she said. ``Children from over 80 different language groups and
cultures enter California's schools each year, and these students
possess a wide range of English proficiency. Not surprisingly, the
results show that it is difficult for students to do well in
academic content areas until they are proficient in English.''

microscopic chips and flecks of unknown ingredients. If this was
XO, I had to get to the bottom of it. A critic's notebook by

vegetables and greens and eat them with a pungent dipping sauce
that usually contains chilies. By Marian Burros.

   So how do national television anchors and tech crews covering

   Because a large number of the CNN workers covering the
Democratic National Convention are Atlanta-based, caterer Bruce
Hecker decided to feed them a Southern-accented dinner Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   There were pork chops with country gravy, catfish, mashed
potatoes, collard greens, corn bread and macaroni and cheese. But
Hecker, a resident of Hidden Hills who owns Bruce's Gourmet
Catering in North Hollywood (a television and motion picture
catering company) and is the co-owner of two restaurants _ Mo's in
Toluca Lake and Woodland Hills _ had added garlic to the potatoes,
given the catfish a sesame crust and served it with a miso
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta be a little L.A.,'' he grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hecker began with a filet mignon in cabernet sauce the
first night he started catering CNN's meals (Aug. 7), and will end
with filet mignon with a shallot demi-glace (this Friday or
Saturday), during this past week he has been serving such intrigues
as grilled escolar with an Asian vinaigrette, seabass in roasted
red pepper sauce, capellini in chardonnay sauce, baby coho salmon
with an artichoke-tomato-corn salsa, farfalle with artichokes and
mushrooms, swordfish with mango salsa and turmeric-scented rice.
</P>
<P>
   The California-style cooking evidently goes over pretty well
with the CNN crew and entire staff, which will amount to as many as
725 meal-takers, including the president of CNN, Rick Kaplan,
anchor Bernard Shaw and host Wolf Blitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much better than Philadelphia,'' opined Blitzer, seated in the
100-seat dining trailer with Steve Redisch, executive producer of
Blitzer's ``The World Today'' show, and Linda Roth, senior producer
at CNN/L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer, Shaw and Bill Schneider, CNN's senior political
analyst, who thinks L.A. food is `` `foofy,' glitzy like Hollywood
and has too many special effects,'' were sharing tables Friday at
lunchtime with nearby stage-hands Michael McLaughlin of Burbank,
Steve Newquist of South Pasadena and Gregg Hay of Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' ``plentiful,'' uttered the stage-hands as they dug
into paper plates piled high from the buffet line.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, though, evidently likes plain, regional food like the
cheese- steaks and the Tasty Cakes in Philly. ``Sometimes you just
want a good hamburger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Philadelphia,'' said Blitzer, ``we had to take our plates
to our work spaces. And this food is healthier. I'm very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   He rates it among the very best during this campaign. Referring
to the food served to CNN at the primaries, ``New Hampshire was
terrible; Iowa was the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the packed trailer on the CNN compound seems to be
thoroughly enjoying the lunch of honey, lime, ginger,
cilantro-marinated chicken breasts with optional creamy cilantro
sauce; hoisin sauce-basted, mesquite-grilled baby back ribs;
basmati rice flecked with tiny vegetables; steamed broccoli; and a
choice of numerous salad bar items.
</P>
<P>
   Meals for the New York-based Fox News Channel entourage _ from
anchors to interns _ are being catered by Wolfgang Puck Food
Company in a tented area on the Fox compound, according to Dana
White, a Fox News Channel publicist from Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing breakfast for 150, lunch for 200 to 250 and
dinner for 250 to 300 people,'' said John Bulla, operating manager
and director of openings for the Santa Monica-based Wolfgang Puck
Food Company, adding that the meal service started Aug. 8 and will
run through Friday. The meals also have a California twist, and
many of the items are similar to those served at the Wolfgang Puck
Cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual yogurts, cereals, fruits, Danish and breads,
breakfast possibilities include quiches and frittatas along with
scrambled eggs, bacon and breakfast wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch might include items such as bacon-wrapped meat loaf,
pizzas, Caesar salad, fresh fruit salad, half-pound chargrilled
hamburgers and hot dogs and grilled veggie sandwiches. Dinner
offerings range from pork ribs and fried chicken to pasta
primavera, sea scallops with pasta, beef quesadillas, lasagne, tri
tip with Austrian potato salad and salmon with garlic mashed
potatoes and asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert fanciers, there are cookies, brownies and biscotti
and on some days special finales like bread pudding, lemon cake,
creme brulee, key lime tarts or tiramisu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is prepared fresh and served buffet style on heavy
clear plastic plates,'' added Bulla, who arrives at 5 a.m. daily
and stays until about 8 p.m. to help chef David Warren with the
cooking tasks and preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 50 percent of the prep work is done at the Wolfgang Puck
Cafe in Woodland Hills and the rest in the full cooking facility
constructed at the downtown site.'' Food is delivered daily and
stored in a 40-foot tractor-trailer with both refrigeration and
freezing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 12-day period, Hecker figures he will have served the
CNN crew some 28,000 meals. That includes around 1500 chicken
breasts each day the dish is on the menu, and 400 pounds of filet
mignon on the last night. CNN's thirst will be quenched by 400
cases of bottled water and 300 cases of soda per day.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hecker fed CNN during the Academy Awards earlier this
year, he said the difference at the DNC is security. The Secret
Service searches every single box, poking through everything. And
only one food delivery is allowed between 1 and 5 a.m. daily, which
means Hecker replaces the refrigerated food truck he keeps on site
every day during the early hours to assure fresh, top-quality
items.
</P>
<P>
   The television crews and anchors definitely won't be going
hungry in Los Angeles. &QL;

<P>
   So how do national television anchors and tech crews covering
the DNC eat during the convention? Very well, it seems _
</P>
<P>
   with breakfast, lunch and dinner dished up in trailers in the
CNN and Fox News Channel compounds just a parking lot away from
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Because a large number of the CNN workers covering the
Democratic National Convention are Atlanta-based, caterer Bruce
Hecker decided to feed them a Southern-accented dinner Thursday
night.
</P>

PARENTS OF TEEN DRIVERS USE MONITORING TO EASE WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eliminates photo)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most parents in car-crazy America, Stephanie Brown trembled
when her children began to drive. Sure, they were plenty careful
when she rode shotgun. But would her Saturn become a Ferrari in her
absence?
</P>
<P>
   Seeking solace, Brown turned to MyParentsCare.com, one of dozens
of fledgling firms cropping up across the country that promise to
turn teen terrors into responsible drivers.
</P>
<P>
   For $99.95, MyParentsCare.com gave Brown a ``How's My Driving?''
bumper sticker that allows other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists
to call a 24-hour toll-free hotline if Zachary or Lyndsay Brown
made reckless lane changes, sped, or failed to yield. The company
promised Brown a full report of any calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son didn't like the idea one bit, but that thing is on my
car,'' said Brown, who owns a stationery store in York, Pa. ``The
funny thing is, I find myself cooling it down when I'm behind the
wheel now because that sticker is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But if these start-ups appeal to the scariest common denominator
_ many companies brandish teen highway fatality statistics on their
Web sites _ some mental health specialists question the benefits of
such heavy-handed control tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, insurance companies and safe-driving advocates from
New Hampshire to California say they remain unconvinced that the
bumper stickers work, and have balked at the constant stream of
requests by monitoring companies to endorse and underwrite their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bumper stickers go to the heart of issues of parental
control and trust,'' said Ronald P. Rohner, director of the Center
for the Study of Parental Acceptance and Rejection at the
University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may indeed be many teens with no problem with these
bumper stickers because they already feel loved and trusted by
their parents,'' he said. ``But if the teenagers feel like the
bumper stickers are a sign of mistrust and control, it could have
the exact opposite effect that the parents desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rohner and others say they have a hunch the bumper
stickers will do plenty to moderate bad driving habits among
younger, inexperienced drivers. But even so, Rohner said, the
better driving could come at a price: fractured family relations.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the monitoring companies _ some of which are
nonprofits _ say many parents are using the stickers as positive
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at 1997 highway accident rates lends the programs
moral authority, they say. Teenage drivers are nearly 50 percent
more likely to be in car accidents than the next most
accident-prone age group, according to the National Highway
Transportation Safety Board. They're also 32 percent more likely to
be involved in fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever had to tell a parent their teen was killed in a
stupid car accident, it's all worth it,'' said Tom H. Deats, owner
of the nonprofit, 800-4MYTEEN, and a 26-year patrolman for the
Arlington, Texas, Police Department. ``I think parents are so busy
working they don't have time to take personal responsibility for
their kids. These stickers put more eyes on the kids. It helps
parents parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Deats, who was at the vanguard of the trend when he began his
company in 1994, now has 2,000 bumper stickers on cars from Georgia
to the state of Washington. Convinced that his company is saving
lives, Deats said he has sunk $40,000 into the venture to keep it
afloat. Along the way, he has persuaded 60 municipal court judges
across Texas to offer his bumper sticker program as an alternative
sentencing option for reckless teen drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Donaldson, president of the Vermont PTA, saw a few such
companies offering their services at the recent national PTA
convention in Chicago, including MyParentsCare.com and its
subsidiary, RatMeOut.com. She returned hoping that schools across
her state would promote the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that anything that encourages more parent
involvement is a positive thing,'' she said. ``This breeds more
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sense among parents who buy the stickers that they've
placed a governor on their children's driving, insurance companies
say they want empirical proof before they start slashing premiums
to those who slap on the stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these people are well-meaning and they truly want to
prevent teens from being in crashes, but there is nothing to
suggest these programs work,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman
for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. ``Kids think
they're invincible. Perhaps the threat of sanctions will do
something, but stack that up against peer pressure, and you
probably don't have much.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, many of America's truck fleets have
enrolled in vehicle monitoring programs, with results that have
certainly caught the attention of the insurance industry. As a
rule, companies that belong to such programs witness declines in
accident rates of about 20 percent, enough to win reduced premiums.
Most of the time, insurance companies themselves pay for companies
to enroll, said Joe Zingale, executive vice president of Driver's
Alert Inc. of Florida, the nation's largest fleet monitoring
company.
</P>
<P>
   But Zingale said he doubts the viability of the teen driver
monitoring programs. He should know. His company tried it in 1990,
and gave up soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``With teens, they rip the decal off, or they cover it up, and
the prank calls are crazy,'' Zingale said. ``You get a kid who
pulls into the high school parking lot with one of those decals on
his car, and you're telling me all his buddies aren't going to race
over to the pay phone to break his chops? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Smith, who runs the Exeter, N.H.-based Parents Against
Speeding Teens, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a similar program, but the phony phone call
factor really troubled us,'' said Smith, whose son, Jason, died in
an auto wreck at age 16. ``This issue is too important for that. We
don't want to cry wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of such credibility problems, many of the for-profit
companies have failed because they have trouble finding repeat
customers _ teen drivers are teens for just so long, after all.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, even though the field of teen driver monitoring
only took off in the past few years, parents can have a difficult
time finding a company to serve them. Of the more than one dozen
companies with Web pages offering such services, more than half
lead to toll-free telephone numbers that have since been
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my wife and me had such an original idea when we
came up with this,'' said Mike Hill, president of the 2-year-old
877-SAF-RIDE. Hill said he works nights as a Wal-Mart supervisor to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're over $10,000 in the hole right now,'' Hill said. ``We
have to walk a tightrope between sending out a harsh message and
being a total jerk. You don't want to use scare tactics, but the
truth is, if you watch the news at night, it is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohner, a professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut's
School of Family Studies, said he's not surprised that such
businesses are cropping up at this point in US history. With
frightening stories in the media about school shootings, Internet
predators, and rampant drug use, parents are seeking ways of
feeling they're in control, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are perhaps over-aware these days,'' Rohner said. ``It
sounds like kids are going to hell in a handbasket and that they're
in grave danger everywhere they turn.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, even though the majority of parents in the
United States wield moderate discipline, many families might be
seduced by the bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no fan of Big Brother, but from my knowledge of the
American family, I don't see this trend as a sign that American
parenting is going off in the wrong direction,'' Rohner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndsay Brown, 16, who still operates under her learner's
permit, said she's not nearly as resentful of the bumper sticker as
her brother was. In fact, she said, it has lent her driving
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only got one report so far, and it was someone saying I was
driving well,'' she said. ``When I get my license, my Mom said,
she'll let me take (the car) out more because she knows she can
trust me. It gives me more privileges.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After an emotional night in which President
Clinton offered a political farewell to the Democrats who have
gathered here for their national convention, delegates reconvened
Tuesday to proceed toward formally making Vice President Al Gore
the party's presidential candidate and new leader.
</P>
<P>
   The major order of business for the Democrats Tuesday was
adoption of the platform. The document puts the party in almost a
lockstep with the Republicans on issues like foreign policy,
military deployment and missile defense. But the platform veers
sharply from the rival party on abortion rights, gun control,
campaign finance legislation and laws aimed at extending rights for
gays.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in his address on Monday night sought to emphasize the
differences between his party and the Republicans. He suggested
that putting a Republican in the White House could threaten the
nation's economic growth. And he criticized Republicans for
opposing the initiatives that he said had strengthened the economy
and helped balance the budget. Most specifically, Clinton ridiculed
Republicans for opposing his 1993 deficit reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It passed by a single vote in both houses,'' Clinton said.
``In a deadlocked Senate, Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote. Now,
not a single Republican supported it. Here's what their leaders
said. Their leaders said our plan would increase the deficit, kill
jobs and give us a one-way ticket to a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   After pausing to savor the applause of the delegates, Clinton
smiled and added, ``Time has not been kind to their predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Los Angeles early Tuesday morning, bound for
Michigan, where he was to meet Gore at a political rally in Monroe,
just outside Detroit, and complete the symbolic handing over of
control of the Democratic Party reins.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The prime-time address Monday was a delicate balancing act for
Clinton. He wanted to rally the delegates and the nation's
enthusiasm over the achievements of his administration in the last
year, but at the same time not let his oratorical skills overshadow
Gore. And while Clinton wanted to promote his chosen successor's
talents and link Gore's policies to his own accomplishments, he
also had to give the vice president his political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touted Gore as ``one strong leader'' and portrayed him
as being at the center of the policy debates and crusades the
administration has pursued, including welfare reform, environmental
protection and job development for the urban and rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anybody else I've known in public life, Al Gore
understands the future and how sweeping changes and scientific
breakthroughs will affect ordinary Americans' lives,'' Clinton
said. ``And I think we need somebody in the White House at the dawn
of the 21st century who really understands the future.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Any question of whether Gore would be the successor to Clinton
as the party's new leader was settled last winter when the vice
president ran up a string of unbroken primary victories against
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But delegates are waiting to see how fully Gore can assume
Clinton's role, not only as the leader on policy matters but also
as the emotional heart of the party. Clinton has long been able to
connect with his supporters in a way Gore has struggled to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will arrive here on Wednesday, the same day that the
convention will conduct the largely ceremonial roll call vote that
will officially make him the Democratic Party's presidential
standard-bearer. The vice president is expected to receive the
backing of all of the 4,339 Democratic delegates here, but it will
be the 68 delegates from his home state of Tennessee who will cast
the votes that put him over the 2,170 he needs to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday night,
ending the convention. His running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman,
arrived here Tuesday morning and is to make his acceptance speech
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Convention opened on Monday to speeches,
pageantry and protests.
</P>
<P>
   Just about the time Clinton was finishing his speech inside the
Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on Monday night, police
officers were using pepper spray, rubber bullets and officers on
horseback to drive away thousands of protesters on the streets just
outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began after a concert that featured the hard-rock
protest band Rage Against The Machine that was attended by about
7,000 people in the area set aside for protests.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The concert ended without incident, but police commanders said
that as the crowd dispersed, at least several hundred protesters
began throwing stones and bottles at police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates and journalists leaving the convention center after
the scheduled events found themselves blocked in by the police
action.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers accused the police of overreacting. But at a
news conference in the Staples Center early Tuesday morning,
Commander David Kalish of the Los Angeles Police Department
defended the police action and said that officers are in ``almost a
no-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will view it as we waited too long,'' he said, ``some
will view it as moving too quickly.'' But, Kalish continued,
``Today, tomorrow or the next day, or the next day, or the next
week, our response will be exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that 10 people had been arrested, but
there were no reports of serious injuries or of major vandalism.
Prior to the disturbance on Monday night, 28 people were arrested,
officials said. On Tuesday morning, the area around the Staples
Center was quiet, without any major protests or confrontations with
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Democrats will feature a list of speakers that
represent the party's traditional base. Gore faces a challenge from
the left in the general election by Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate. And Gore wants to show the liberal wing of the party that
he has not abandoned them by giving speaking time to the Rev. Jesse
Jackson; Gerald McEntee, the president of the American Federation
of State County, and Municipal Employees; and Kate Michelman, the
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, known as NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will also seek to engage long-time liberal
supporters with a dose of party nostalgia. In the lead up to the
keynote address Tuesday evening from Rep. Harold Ford Jr. of
Tennessee, the delegates will hear from Bradley and from two
members of the Kennedy clan: Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the daughter of the
late President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Democrats held their national convention in
Los Angeles, John F. Kennedy received the presidential nomination,
and there has been a concerted effort this week to link Gore to
that legacy. One of the more popular souvenirs being sold here is a
button bearing pictures of both Gore and President Kennedy.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ A friend told Kristy Kowal to puff out her
cheeks, wide enough so he could see, while she waited behind the
starting blocks for the 200-meter breaststroke at the U.S. Olympic
Trials. A few nights before, waiting for the 100 breaststroke, she
had looked as if she couldn't breathe. And everyone knew how that
had worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal, the defending world champion in the 100, had taken third
by a hundredth of a second, touched out by the exuberant Staciana
Stitts from the University of California at Berkeley. Only the top
two finishers go to Sydney. Third place means watching on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal knew all too well what third place meant. Four years
earlier, the same thing had happened. She had been touched out and
aced out.
</P>
<P>
   Now came the 200, her last chance. She should have been tighter
than a childproof cap. But Kowal's friend was right. She always
swims best when she lets loose, dances around before a race,
grooves to some tunes, smiles at the crowd. On Monday, she waved to
people in the stands, looking as if she were about to host a party.
</P>
<P>
   About three minutes later, that's exactly what she was doing.
Kowal won the race, made the Olympic team and set the American
record. All of a sudden, a congregation formed in her lane, a bunch
of young women bobbing, hugging, smiling, crying. The 200
breaststroke had become the feel-good race of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I almost started crying when I was swimming into the
wall,'' Kowal said.
</P>
<P>
   Stitts swam over to Kowal's lane immediately to offer
congratulations, sprinting about as fast as she did during the
race. Stitts finished sixth in the 200, out of the hunt, and she
didn't seem to care a bit. She had her Olympic berth in the 100,
and she desperately wanted the woman she beat to join her in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``She deserves to go,'' Stitts said. ``You know, the 100 was so
close, it could have gone either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stitts also enveloped the second-place finisher, Amanda Beard,
in her arms. Before the race, Stitts shared a set of earphones with
Beard in the ready room, trying to get her motivated with some rap
music. Like Kowal, Beard had heavy sentiment on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Beard had already been to the Olympics, as a 14-year-old in
1996. She won two individual silvers, a relay gold and countless
hearts. With her teddy bear and her big, round eyes, she was
thoroughly endearing.
</P>
<P>
   She went home from Atlanta and became a full-fledged teenager,
piercing her tongue, plus various spots on her earlobe. She grew up
physically, too, sprouting six inches and adding about 25 pounds.
In any other stroke, her new body could have been an advantage. But
the breaststroke is swimming's answer to gymnastics, cruelly
discriminating against the mature female form.
</P>
<P>
   In the finals Monday, only two of the competitors topped 18.
There are exceptions, including 26-year-old world-record holder
Penny Heyns of South Africa. But as one wag once put: ``You can't
have breasts and swim the breaststroke.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, after Atlanta, Beard slumped. She might have been
able to handle the biological changes, but she couldn't overcome a
profound case of self-consciousness. Every time she got up on the
blocks, she could feel the audience's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it was mental,'' she said. ``It was hard to get into
the pool and swim up to people's expectations, or what I thought
were their expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In another event, she might have been able to muscle her way
through. Not in the breaststroke. More than any other stroke, it is
like hitting a baseball. Too much effort spoils the result.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200 the night before, Ed Moses, the undisputed
favorite, went out too fast, lost his stroke and took fourth.
Before the meet, he bleached his hair blonde and put in gold
earrings to declare his intentions. If he hadn't won the 100, he
could have been the great heartbreak of these Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal faced the same predicament. At 21, she couldn't count on
any more chances. In the four years between 14 and 18, Beard hadn't
improved. She had added a second to her time. Kowal, tall and
angular, had stayed at her peak far longer than average.
</P>
<P>
   She won in 2 minutes, 24.75 seconds, the seventh-fastest time
ever. Five of the six best times belong to Heyns. Before Monday
night, the Americans appeared to have no chance of knocking her off
in Sydney. Kowal changed that on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She and Beard emerged from the pool together, then gasped their
way through interviews with NBC. Beard, her body shaking, looked as
endearing as she had in Atlanta, six inches and untold piercings
ago. Back then she told reporters that she loved her silver medals,
that she didn't need to win gold to be happy. She was the perfect
antidote to Nike's triumph-or-disgrace ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   She said she appreciated making the Olympics this time more than
she had in '96. It's the struggle that makes it all worthwhile. ``I
can't breathe,'' Beard said, fanning her face happily, unable to
continue the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal must have understood. The Olympic Trials had taken all the
air out of her before. She got it back just in time.

&HT;     DEVELOPER HAS EYES ON KEY SAN FRANCISCO PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GERALD D. ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly empty and derelict, two undeveloped sites
in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District have posed a
quandary for some two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with near Gold Rush conditions prevailing in a real estate
market that promises an owner sky-high rental profits, the quandary
shows signs of easing.
</P>
<P>
   Shorenstein Co. President Douglas Shorenstein disclosed that the
company founded by his father, real estate titan Walter
Shorenstein, has filed applications to build office structures on
both sites _ the only two undeveloped plots in this historic square
mile.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans a five-story structure at Pine and Kearny
streets, only a few feet higher than the neighboring St. Mary's
Square Park.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes a 19-story office tower at 350 Bush St., which
incorporates the now-shabby, 77-year-old San Francisco Mining
Exchange Building (a city landmark) as a galleria of shops and
restaurants as well as entry to the office tower.
</P>
<P>
   In the Financial District, two more environmentally sensitive
sites scarcely exist.
</P>
<P>
   The first, 500 Pine St., is located across Kearny from the
Shorenstein Co.-owned Bank of America Tower. Walter Shorenstein
proposed a 14-story high-rise there in the late 1970s that would
have cast a shadow on tiny St. Mary's Square Park, which with
Portsmouth Square are Chinatown's only parks.
</P>
<P>
   When that aroused fierce opposition, Shorenstein offered to
landscape the roof of adjacent St. Mary's Square Garage to offset
the shadow and add to the park, but the administration of
then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein (now a U.S. senator) rejected that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The second site, a block away, is co-owned by the Shorenstein
Co. with the Swig Estate of Fairmont Hotel fame. There, too, a
previously proposed 27-story tower would have demolished the
Greco-Roman styled Mining Exchange and blocked sunlight from St.
Mary's Square.
</P>
<P>
   Both locations have historic connotations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pine-Kearny site once held the Kong Chow Temple until its
elders sold the location to Shorenstein.
</P>
<P>
   And reviving proposals for both recalls two of the hottest land
use battles in the city's late 20th century history _ battles so
bitter that they triggered historic changes in San Francisco land
use restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It was after these proposals failed that voters subsequently
passed Proposition K, the park shadow initiative that bans new
construction from blocking sunlight from public open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Further, at urging of the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board
and the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors later
declared the Mining Exchange an official city landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Feinstein-appointed Planning Commission and
the elected Board of Supervisors of that era passed a new Downtown
Plan, requiring that more than 250 architecturally and historically
significant buildings, including the Mining Exchange, be preserved
in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Walter Shorenstein withdrew both high-rise
proposals, leaving both locations much as they appear today.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Doug Shorenstein and Vice President Thomas W. Hart, both
soft-spoken and diplomatic, both aware of their valuable but fallow
hunks of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   As Hart put it, ``The hot market prompted us to take a serious
look at what can be done. If we're ever going to do it (build), we
feel now is the time,'' he added, referring to current rents.
</P>
<P>
   As to why the sites have been left empty and neglected for
years, Doug Shorenstein said, ``The bottom line was, the market was
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's latest office building proposals face zoning
restrictions not unlike those that forced the older Shorenstein to
cancel his plans in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's Square, which has long been shadowed by an old
Pacific Telephone building to its south, still must be protected
from further sunlight blockage. And the Mining Exchange must be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can any new tower on Bush Street be allowed to block
daylight from its neighbor, the historic Russ Building. That
building is owned, incidentally, by Shorenstein's partners on the
proposed Bush Street project, the Swig family.
</P>
<P>
   And the revised Bush Street project entails demolition of the
now-closed Temple Hotel, where at least 17 long-term residents were
evicted last November.
</P>
<P>
   With guidance from architect Jeffrey Heller, who studies
downtown zoning restrictions the way fishermen study tides and
currents, the developers are making a new stab at building, in the
hope that their latest proposals can overcome the same sticky
issues that doomed their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Heller insists the 350 Bush St. proposal can overcome any
questions about shadows on St. Mary's Square because any shadow
would be ``a minor one.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Shorenstein proposes to add some 4,500 square feet to the
little park by landscaping the roof of the company's new five-story
building, and deeding the roof to the city as new public space.
</P>
<P>
   Before the city grants Shorenstein permission to build, the
company must undergo several hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental impact report will probably be required.
</P>
<P>
   The Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board must approve
alterations to the landmark Mining Exchange; the Recreation and
Park Commission, the means of compensating for new shadows on St.
Mary's Square Park; and the Planning Commission for the
demolitions, design of the two new buildings and decisions to grant
them allotments from annual limits of square footage.

RUSSIANS MAKE SECOND ATTEMPT TO RESCUE SUBMARINE CREW  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SABRINA TAVERNISE with DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fighting heaving, icy seas, Russian rescuers lowered a
diving capsule Tuesday to start evacuating 116 sailors trapped in a
sunken Russian nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers aborted their first attempt to retrieve the sailors
because a storm prevented them from attaching the rescue capsule to
an escape hatch, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted navy officials as
saying. The rescuers made their second attempt during a break in
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors are trapped 354 feet below the surface of the
Barents Sea in the Arctic circle. Russian officials at first said
the submarine sank on Sunday, but according to news reports Tuesday
the accident occurred on Saturday _ meaning the supply of air for
the 116 sailors on board was even smaller than had been believed
originally. Officials said they did not know whether any crew
members had been killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine, called the Kursk, is an Oscar II-class submarine
that was completed in 1994. It sank in international waters, about
35 miles from the coast. Besides torpedoes, it normally carries 24
missiles intended to destroy ships.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine plunged to the seabed during a naval exercise and
was badly damaged, officials have said. Itar-Tass reported that a
preliminary underwater investigation showed that an explosion had
probably damaged the bow of the submarine, causing the torpedo room
to flood.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was not carrying nuclear weapons, the navy said,
but was powered by two nuclear reactors, raising concerns about
possible radioactive contamination. But Russian officials said the
reactors had been turned off, and officials in Norway said a
scientific vessel in the area had detected no signs of a
radioactive leak.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have been pessimistic about the chances that the crew
of the submarine could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projection of possible consequences of the accident in the
Kursk for the lives of its crew remains extremely grave,'' the
Russian navy commander, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The crew has not been in radio contact with rescue ships since
the submarine sank. Survivors have been communicating by tapping on
the hull. Oxygen supplies were running low and were expected to run
out in about two days, said one of the submarine's designers,
according to the Russian news agency Interfax. But that projection
was made before it became clear Tuesday that the submarine went
down on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier efforts to hook lines to the submarine to bring it air
and fuel had failed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry of Norway said Tuesday that it had received
a report from Russia saying the accident occurred Saturday and that
the Kursk was found on Sunday. No explanation was given for why the
information was only made public on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported that the Russians had informally approached NATO
officials to ask about the possibility of assistance.

 &HT;    Tinseltown's hottest restaurant cool enough to make Ohio
visitors feel welcome
 &HT;    By D.L. Stewart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ In my fantasies, I am walking into
Spago, the celebrity restaurant, and a smiling host says, ``Mr.
Stewart of Dayton, Ohio. But of course. Your table is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In my expectations, I am walking into Spago, the celebrity
restaurant, and a snickering host says: ``Stewart? Ohio? Give me a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Spago is not the most expensive restaurant in the country.
Dinner at Ducasse in New York City, Charlie Trotter's in Chicago or
Ginza Sushiko, right around the corner here in Beverly Hills on
Rodeo Drive, would cost at least twice as much. And it does not
have the fanciest food. Gary Danko's, Mary Elaine's, Seeger's and
plenty of other restaurants you probably never heard of all have
more Mobil Guide stars.
</P>
<P>
   But Spago arguably is the most famous restaurant in America. It
is this generation's version of 21, the Stork Club and the Brown
Derby. A restaurant known not just for what it serves, but whom it
serves. Its reputation and its success are inextricably linked with
movie stars and millionaires. No report on Academy Awards night is
complete without listing who scored a table at Spago. No edition of
In Style magazine would go to press without at least one Spago
name-dropping article.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads me to suspect that my reception will range somewhere
between desultory and ``fuggedaboutit.''
</P>
<P>
   So when we walk in and a smiling hostess immediately leads us to
a table in the middle of the restaurant, I figure there can only be
one explanation: We are at the wrong Spago.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in fact, two of them in Los Angeles. The original
opened in 1982 in West Hollywood. Since then, owner-chef Wolfgang
Puck and his wife, Barbara Lazaroff, have opened Spagos in Chicago,
Las Vegas, Palo Alto and Tokyo. Plus a string of other restaurants
in just about any location where a large number of people can
pronounce ``sommelier.'' Not to mention countless Wolfgang Puck
Cafes and other Spago Lites.
</P>
<P>
   But the flagship of the food fleet is in Beverly Hil Long before
our senses have had a chance to be seduced, special events manager
Franklin Vermillion is at our table with a war

 &HT;    VALUABLE ARTIFACTS STOLEN FROM SAN ANTONIO MISSIONS
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    SAN ANTONIO _ Once the protectors of Franciscan missionaries and
<TEXT>
Coahuiltecan Indians, it is the Spanish missions here that now need
protecting.
<P>
   Someone is breaking into mission sanctuaries and stealing
valuable religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The crimes have befuddled police investigators and wrenched
hearts in San Antonio, where the archdiocese estimates nearly half
of the city's 1 million residents are Roman Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us cried about it. It's sad,'' said Beatrice Alanis,
who has lived next to Mission San Juan Capistrano for 45 years and
is a member of the parish that still worships there. ``We're still
in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission San Juan Capistrano was the scene of the first burglary,
which occurred on June 25. Someone entered the sanctuary during the
middle of the day when the mission was open for tourists and pried
from the altar four 19th-century paintings of Juan Diego's vision
of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars returned to the mission two weeks ago and broke in
sometime after it closed at 5 p.m. The thieves carted off three
18th-century hand-carved wooden statues of Saint Francis of Assisi,
Saint Joseph and Saint Juan Capistrano, the mission's namesake. Art
dealers said the pieces could be worth tens of thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In between the two crimes, the nearby Mission Concepcion was
twice burglarized. First, a wood carving of the Virgin Mary was
stolen. Then, a glass display case was smashed and an incense
burner and a Latin sacramental book, both antiques, were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of took us by surprise,'' admits David Castilleja,
chief financial officer for the Archdiocese of San Antonio. ``To
some extent, it is almost sacrilege if you take something from the
church. God help the people who did this.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who did this remain a mystery, as do their motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can speculate all day long on whether or not there
is anything to indicate there is one particular motive,'' said Sgt.
Gabriel Trevino, director of the public information office for the
San Antonio police. ``I don't know if there is.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio police have been actively investigating since the
first burglary was reported June 30, Trevino said. There are no
suspects, Trevino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new,'' he said. The investigation ``is still
ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, officers discovered a pedestal from one of the stolen
statues in the bathroom of the Mission Espada. The pedestal might
provide a valuable clue that will help detectives solve the case.
It also might be an indication that the thieves were casing another
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The burglaries have caught the attention of the FBI. Special
Agent Darren Holmes, public information officer in the bureau's San
Antonio office, said federal agents are reviewing the case and are
considering whether to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The burglaries have been strikes not only against the Catholic
church but also the state. The five Spanish missions along the
23-mile Mission Trail are as central to the identity of San Antonio
as the Gateway Arch is to St. Louis and the Golden Gate Bridge to
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million people a year visit the city's most famous
mission: Mission San Antonio de Valero, more commonly referred to
as the Alamo. About half that many visit the city's other four
missions each year: Mission San Jose, Mission San Juan, Mission
Espada and Mission Concepcion.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden among heavy woods and sparsely populated neighborhoods of
shotgun shacks, Mission San Juan Capistrano and Mission Concepcion
are less popular than other mission sites. Their remote locations
and infrequent visitors probably provided burglars ample
opportunity to plan and carry out their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to be a carefully orchestrated thing,'' said the
Rev. James Galvin, an Irishman who celebrates Masses at San Juan
Capistrano in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent break-in seemed particularly well-planned. The
thieves drilled holes through the wooden church doors and inserted
something to dislodge the wooden slats that were supposed to
reinforce the locks. The burglars also knew the door was bolted at
the top and bottom and used a pry bar to attack both locks, Galvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church, tire tracks indicate the thieves used a dolly
to remove the ornate wooden statues and their pedestals from their
perches at the front of the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The missions have proved more difficult to secure than other
Catholic churches, Galvin said, because of their status as historic
landmarks. The National Parks Service controls the mission grounds
and must be consulted before any changes are made to the
buildings &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Because the missions are in national parks, San Antonio park
rangers do not police them. The National Park Service only posts
rangers there from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. There is no admission to the
parks and tourists are allowed to come and go from the missions and
other buildings as they please. A sole ranger is responsible for
supervising the park grounds and interpreting for Spanish-speaking
visitors. The missions are locked when the parks are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the burglaries, the archdiocese has taken steps to improve
security. Its officials met this week with the National Park
Service to discuss ways to better safeguard the missions.
</P>
<P>
   The missions are rich pieces of Texas history. Designed by
Franciscan missionaries, they were built by bands of South Texas
Indians collectively known as Coahuiltecans. Spain financed their
construction to protect its claim to land in the New World and to
proselytize Native American souls to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The reverence bestowed on the missions both by San Antonians _
Christian and secular _ probably lured the church into a false
sense of security, the Rev. Galvin admitted. Also, it appears the
church might not have been aware of the growing popularity of
Spanish Colonial Art in the United States and of how valuable the
statues were as art pieces called santos.

   LOS ANGELES -- In the city of movie stars, leasing limousines is
always a big business.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Democratic National Convention, Brett Ohira of
Paramount Limousine said he still has some limousines available and
is ready to ``make a deal'' to get more convention business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some available this week, and I'm
disappointed,'' he said. ``I kind of thought this would be as big
as the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   The major party political conventions still rank among the
country's biggest meetings in terms of attendance, but they may be
losing some of their luster in terms of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials had projected that the convention, which
opened Monday in the city's spanking new Staples Center, would fill
94,500 room-nights at area hotels. But now they concede the number
is likely to be closer to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Philadelphia, which hosted the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago, the cost of hosting 15,000 journalists
and 20,000 delegates and visitors has escalated -- largely because
the party events are now attracting larger and more militant
protest demonstrations that require added security.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the city said it has put the entire police force
on 12-hour shifts, and brought in officers from the California
Highway Patrol and other police jurisdictions.

   Democratic officials won't speak on the record but concede
privately that they fear some cities might be reluctant to bid for
the party's 2004 convention. Besides the higher costs and fears of
violent demonstrations, the networks are now covering fewer hours
of the actual convention than ever before -- prompting speculation
that the four-day events might be condensed into two or three days
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, which hosted the Republican National Convention in
1988 and bid unsuccessfully for the Democratic and Republican
conventions in 1992, 1996 and 2000, is one city that won't be
scared away, said Mayor Marc Morial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll always be interested in bidding for the conventions
because it is not just the money and hotel rooms, it is also the
visibility it gives your city and the fact that you have important
opinion leaders who come to your city,'' Morial said.
</P>
<P>
   William Raabe, a business professor at Sanford University in
Birmingham, Ala., said the big party conventions make sense for
some cities but not others. Even if the conventions are ``money
losers,'' cities like Chicago, which hosted a successful Democratic
convention in 1996 -- a marked contrast to its bloody Democratic
convention in 1968 -- and Philadelphia, with the 2000 GOP
convention, can get a big public relations boost.
</P>
<P>
   A case also could be made for the benefits to Southern cities
like New Orleans because the conventions are scheduled in the
summer when warm weather generally keeps hotel occupancy rates
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in terms of New York or Los Angeles, I have to think a lot
of the Chamber of Commerce types are saying, `Why bother?''' Raabe
said. ``They'd rather have a vacationer from Michigan who is likely
to spend more money than a delegate from Montana. For one,
vacationers and even delegates to other conventions don't have all
these corporate suites and functions thrown by Silicon Valley, oil
drillers and steel companies. They get bigger and bigger every
year, in effect soft money for delegates, which means that the area
restaurants tend not to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, officials projected that the convention would
generate $132 million in revenue. But some local merchants and
business owners said the estimate seems inflated.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good lunch business today, but it seems to be
our regular customers, not delegates,'' said Jeff Kavin, manager of
Greenblatt's Deli in Hollywood. ``I think these delegates know
deli, but they might not be able to get away from all their
receptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Donnelly, who has driven a cab in Los Angeles for 15
years, said Sunday was ``a great day'' because many drivers took
the day off, and early convention visitors didn't have access to
the chartered buses rented by the Los Angeles host committee to
shepherd delegates around for official convention events.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, I can't get many fares at all because many of the
downtown streets are blocked for security and the protest
demonstrations and the delegates are all being chauffeured around
town in buses,'' Donnelly said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia convention officials say they figure they spent $50
million in cash and contributed services for the GOP convention. It
will take another 60 days to complete a study on how much the GOP
delegates and their guests spent during the four-day event, said
Karen Dougherty Buchholz, president of Philadelphia 2000, the host
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no matter how that turns out, I have to tell you that
we're very pleased with how everything came out,'' she said. ``The
audience that came to our city and region left with a great
impression and it is advertising that you just can't pay for.''

   LOS ANGELES -- In the city of movie stars, leasing limousines is
always a big business.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Democratic National Convention, Brett Ohira of
Paramount Limousine said he still has some limousines available and
is ready to ``make a deal'' to get more convention business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some available this week, and I'm
disappointed,'' he said. ``I kind of thought this would be as big
as the Oscars.''
</P>
<P>
   The major party political conventions still rank among the
country's biggest meetings in terms of attendance, but they may be
losing some of their luster in terms of economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials had projected that the convention, which
opened Monday in the city's spanking new Staples Center, would fill
94,500 room-nights at area hotels. But now they concede the number
is likely to be closer to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Philadelphia, which hosted the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago, the cost of hosting 15,000 journalists
and 20,000 delegates and visitors has escalated -- largely because
the party events are now attracting larger and more militant
protest demonstrations that require added security.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the city said it has put the entire police force
on 12-hour shifts, and brought in officers from the California
Highway Patrol and other police jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials won't speak on the record but concede
privately that they fear some cities might be reluctant to bid for
the party's 2004 convention. Besides the higher costs and fears of
violent demonstrations, the networks are now covering fewer hours

   SAN ANTONIO: called ``santos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (the pieces) were special and very old,'' the Rev.
Galvin said. ``I thought that nobody would even think of stealing
them because where would they sell them?''
</P>
<P>
   But art dealers know the market for santos and other Spanish
Colonial art is booming.
</P>
<P>
   For years, collectors considered the pieces inferior to the
European sculptures. And Europeans still have no interest in the
works of 17th-and 18th-century Mexican artisans known as
``santeros &UR; ''  &LR; _ artists who makes saints. But Americans have grown
to appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago you could get an excellent piece for $2,000,
$3,000 that piece now is probably $40,000,'' said Marianne
Lixie-Gray, proprietor of Que Milagro Ethnic Art Gallery in
Houston. ``The prices are just climbing, climbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Siegfried is the chief conservator of the Art
Conservation Laboratory in San Antonio. Siegfried restored the
statue of Saint Francis of Assisi in 1994 and had talked with the
archdiocese about working on the others.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were high quality pieces, carved in Mexico during
the middle 1700s, she said. They were carved in meticulous detail
in the baroque style and some were inlaid with 23-karat gold, she
said. The faces and hands of the wooden statues were painted and
polished to such a sheen they appeared to be porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it, they are very valuable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While the statues and paintings might have a high market value,
collecting the money might be difficult unless the burglars already
had an unscrupulous &UR;  &LR; art collector lined up as a buyer, Siegfried
said.
</P>
<P>
   The market for santos is fed primarily by priests who sell
paintings or statues to raise money for their churches. But thefts
occur frequently, said Ray Balinskas, who operates an import
business in Houston. Most often, thieves steal santos from Mexican
churches and bring them to the United States to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens from time to time. For someone who wants an art
object, it doesn't matter if it is a church or a home. The church
is probably the easiest place to steal from,'' Balinskas said.
</P>
<P>
   Reputable brokers will push for details from someone selling a
piece to determine whether it is stolen. Also, news of stolen art
spreads rapidly among dealers, Balinskas said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried fears the pieces will disappear in a private
collection if word about the statues is not spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they will disappear in some of our larger cities and
in some of our nice homes,'' Siegfried said. ``It's important that
people realize when they see something in somebody's house they
realize, `Uh oh. That could be one of them.'''

<P>
   &UR; BY JACOB WEISBERG &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We're going to miss him. Even the people who can't
wait to get rid of him are going to miss him.
</P>
<P>
   What we're all going to miss, about a month into the Gore or the
Bush administration, is Clinton's sheer skill at being president.
This has nothing to do with his policies, his views, or his sexual
morality. It's simply a matter of Clinton's astonishing virtuosity
as a public performer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is so good in the public role of the presidency that you
almost don't notice it anymore. Clinton makes a verbal false step
or misjudges the appropriate tone for an occasion once every couple
of years. George W. Bush makes a verbal slip about once every
half-hour. Al Gore strikes a false note in three appearances out of
four.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this watching Clinton speak at a pro-Israel
rally here the other day. Clinton went off on a riff about the
Oklahoma City bombing. I don't have his exact words, but Clinton
described Timothy McVeigh as a poor, sick kid who listened to too
many anti-government tirades from conservatives. There were no
audible gasps from the audience, but this was a fairly shocking
thing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was essentially blaming the Republicans for creating a
climate that led to mass murder. But he did it in such an offhand,
jez-talkin' way that it didn't sound vicious at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could never get away with a remark like that. If he had
uttered exactly the same words Clinton used, it would have sounded
brutally partisan, nasty and unfair. It would have generated
headlines: GORE CALLS REPUBLICANS KILLERS. But it's unfair to
compare Gore's communication skills to Clinton's because Clinton's
are without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech Monday evening was uninspired as a piece of
text. As usual, he attempted little in the way of soaring rhetoric
or memorable lines (Clinton may leave office after eight years
without having delivered a single truly memorable line). His coda,
which reprised all the most excruciating Clintonite cliches, (The
Man From Hope, Putting People First, Building a Bridge to the 21st
Century, Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow) was tacky. Yet Clinton
gave a superb speech nonetheless. He always does.
</P>
<P>
   You could say it was his delivery, but that term fails to do
justice to the way Clinton relates and communicates. Clinton
engages himself in giving a speech the way a great musician engages
a piece of music. He doesn't just deliver it; he embodies it,
expressing himself through his phrasing, his vast repertoire of
gestures, his entire body.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the speech was simple. Clinton set out to do three
things: note the accomplishments of the past eight years, draw a
contrast with Republican policies, and praise Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On the accomplishments, Clinton tossed out a plethora of facts,
figures and specific programs: the lowest unemployment rate in 30
years, the lowest crime rate in 25, the lowest child poverty rate
in 20, welfare rolls cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's success was not a matter of chance,'' Clinton said.
``It was a matter of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the section contrasting Democratic policies with those of the
Republicans, Clinton went after the GOP not with the sledgehammer
of contempt but with the scalpel of irony. He reminded his audience
that Republicans warned that his 1993 economic plan would lead to a
recession and ruin the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans said then they would not be held responsible
for the results of our economic policies,'' Clinton said. ``I hope
the American people will take them at their word.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing his efforts to create a Cabinet that looks like America,
he added, ``If I could get my whole administration up here it would
be as good a picture as anything you saw in Philadelphia a couple
of weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The praise of Gore seemed to me the weakest section of the
speech. Basically, Clinton vouched for Gore and Joseph Lieberman,
saying they would work to continue the successes his administration
has had. ``Al Gore is a profoundly good man,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   I don't disagree. But Gore is not a gifted man. And taking the
stage Clinton occupied Monday night will make that all too readily
apparent.

LIEBERMAN SOLVES HIS HOLLYWOOD PROBLEM

</P>
<P>
   When it comes to political resourcefulness, you have to take
your yarmulke off to Joe Lieberman. According to backstage
accounts, Lieberman's religion was discussed during the
veep-choosing process only as a potential political problem. But
that hasn't stopped him from touting his selection as a bold
statement of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman disagrees with Al Gore about school vouchers and
raising the retirement age, but he has spun Gore's toleration of
these differences as further evidence of Gore's strength.
Lieberman's ally Bill Bennett may have written ``The Book of
Virtues,'' but Lieberman has written the book on repackaging your
liabilities as virtues. When life gives you matzo, make matzo
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lieberman's publicity tour has advanced to its second week,
and the moves are getting fancier.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Democrats suggested that he would firm up their
ticket's stature on moral issues, in part because he has spent
years trying, through shame and intimidation, to cleanse movies,
television, pop music, and video games of gratuitous sex and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, several political talk show hosts tried to turn this
record against him, suggesting that it smacked of censorship and
might scare liberals. Lieberman was ready. His cultural warfare
isn't authoritarianism, he explained. It's anti-corporate populism.
</P>
<P>
   This spin evidently hadn't occurred to Lieberman when he first
appeared with Gore in Nashville last week. At that event, Gore
declared, ``I wanted someone who would fight right alongside me for
the people, not the powerful. ... Joe Lieberman has stood for
working families. ... As attorney general of Connecticut, he took
on big polluters to clean up toxic waste. ... Joe Lieberman has
stood up to the big oil companies and cracked down on price gouging
at the gas pumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a tort-reform advocate and friend of the insurance
industry, neglected to pick up the theme. He spoke of values
separately: ``We will work _ Al and Tipper, Hadassah and I _ to
help renew the moral center of this nation, so that families can be
stronger, children safer, and parents empowered to pass on to their
children their faith and their moral values.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Lieberman has his lines down. He's standing up to
big moral polluters for the same reason Gore is standing up to big
environmental polluters.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on ``Meet the Press'' about the possibility of
``legal restrictions'' on Hollywood, Lieberman swore allegiance to
the First Amendment but added, ``The average family feels as if
it's in a competition with a lot of the stuff ... coming out of the
entertainment industry, and government has to be on the side of
standing with those people to help them, because they feel helpless
against the big entertainment industry. ... This is, if I may say
so, a different kind of expression of what Al Gore has been talking
about, which is standing with the people against the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman described his mission as ``fighting for average
families when it comes to cultural and moral values.``
</P>
<P>
   On ``Face the Nation,'' he delivered the same pitch. When asked
whether Hollywood could ``expect a lot of pressure from the
Gore-Lieberman administration,'' Lieberman rejected censorship but
accused ``the entertainment industry'' of making it ``harder for
parents across America who are trying so hard to give their kids
good values to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the woman I met at a supermarket in New
Haven a couple of years ago who pleaded with me, 'Keep up this
fight.' Because, she said, 'I feel as if I'm in a competition with
the entertainment industry to raise my own children, and they're
(the industry) winning.' And, you know, this is a very interesting
expression of the 'people vs. the powerful' mode that Al Gore's
been talking about. And we want to stand with the people.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``This Week,'' Lieberman repeated his script almost word for
word. The entertainment industry ``makes it very difficult for
parents who are working so hard to give their kids values and
discipline to do so, because, as one mother said to me a couple
years ago ... 'I feel,' she said, 'as if I'm in a competition with
the entertainment industry to raise my kids, and they're winning.'
... A Gore-Lieberman administration will be concerned about what
government can do, within appropriate constitutional limits, to
improve the moral future of America as well as the economic future
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lieberman is attempting here is broad-daylight political
theft. He's trying to recapture cultural conservatism from the GOP
and secure it to the Democratic Party by reframing it in
anti-corporate terms. The culprit isn't just Hollywood, as Bob Dole
characterized it four years ago. It's the ``big entertainment
industry'' _ the cousin of Big Oil, Big Tobacco, the HMOs, and the
big drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   These behemoths are ``competing'' with parents, who are
``helpless'' to resist. And unlike Republicans, Democrats aren't
afraid to say who should step in: ``Government'' must ``fight for
average families.'' Like a diamond carried out of a jewelry store
in a glass of water, the crackdown on commercial filth blends right
into a Democratic populist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just genius. It's chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, this integration of cultural conservatism with
economic progressivism will convince independent voters that Gore
and Lieberman are serious about battling cultural rot, while
reassuring mainstream Democrats that this battle is guided and
limited by the party's values. Explaining the connection will take
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman made a good start on Sunday by appearing on all five
weekly talk shows. Which just goes to show that the credit Gore has
reaped for picking a running mate who won't campaign on Saturdays
is yet another masterpiece of jew-jitsu.
</P>
<P>
   What would really take guts is picking a running mate who takes
the Christian Sabbath so seriously that he won't do ``Meet the
Press.''

</P>
<P>
   Now that its convention is over, will the Republican Party keep
pretending that it likes black people? As the Philadelphia story
would have it, attracting black voters simply means returning to a
proud history from which the GOP has only recently deviated.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the history of the Republican Party's relationship
with blacks is one of a bright start followed by a gradual but
steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, the Republican Party was founded mainly to end slavery,
and for two decades it honorably promoted African-American
equality. Its first presidential nominee, pioneer James C. Fremont,
took a staunch anti-slavery stand in 1856 and ran well, paving the
way for Abraham Lincoln's election four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln was no radical. He believed white men superior to blacks
and opposed the outright abolition of slavery. But he wanted to
stop slavery's westward expansion in the hope that it would die out
_ a position that won him endorsements from leading
African-Americans such as Frederick Douglass and 40 percent of the
overall vote, enough for victory in a four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, the ``Radical Republicans,'' who oversaw
the Reconstruction of the South, brought blacks into electoral
politics. Blacks naturally joined the GOP rather than the white
supremacist Southern Democrats. In these golden years, black
Republicans got the vote and even won elective office (Mississippi
elected the nation's first African-American senator in 1870).
</P>
<P>
   Led by the GOP, the nation ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th
Amendments, which ended slavery and gave black men full citizenship
and the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's abandonment of African-Americans commenced with the
presidential election of 1876. The party had already been
subordinating its agenda of black equality to that of cultivating
Northern industrialists when Ohio Republican Rutherford B. Hayes,
to resolve a contested election, agreed to the notorious Compromise
of 1876. In exchange for their support, Hayes promised Southern
Democrats to withdraw federal troops from the South and to let them
treat blacks as they pleased. Almost immediately, white
supremacist, or ``redeemer'' Democrats regained power, heralding
the reign of Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the compromise also crippled black Republicanism, as
state Republican parties, to compete for white votes, engaged in
racial me-tooism, purging blacks from the party or shunting them
into ``Black and Tan'' delegations whose legitimacy was not always
recognized .
</P>
<P>
   By the Progressive Era, both the Republicans and the Democrats
were generally uninterested in helping African-Americans. One issue
that couldn't be ignored _ though the parties tried _ was the
horror of lynching, which had become rampant in the
post-Reconstruction South. Anti-lynching laws marked the last major
civil rights issue on which Republicans were out in front.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920 Leonidas Dyer, a Missouri Republican from a largely
black St. Louis district, introduced an anti-lynching bill, which
the new Republican president, Warren Harding, endorsed. The House
passed it in January 1922 (231-199, with only 17 Republicans
opposing and eight Northern or border-state Democrats in support).
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though they controlled the Senate too, the GOP
couldn't, or wouldn't, pull out the stops to pass the law. While
Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts supported the
bill, the powerful Idaho Republican William Borah opposed it as
meddling in states' rights and helped Southern Democrats kill it.
The Borah-Lodge rift foretold a schism in the GOP between
Northeastern liberals and a Midwestern and Western Old Guard that
would later scramble the party's racial politics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, blacks were fleeing the South for Northern cities.
There, the Democrats' political machines delivered services and
patronage to immigrants in exchange for their votes, and Democratic
bosses shrewdly absorbed blacks into their system. In contrast,
Republicans missed another opportunity. Their machines (yes, they
existed too) reacted coolly to black voters' demands and to black
politicians' ambitions _ leading many to leave the party.
</P>
<P>
   The realignment crystallized under President Franklin Roosevelt.
In 1932, FDR won just 23 percent of the black vote. Yet he swiftly
bolstered his black support. Gestures such as consulting a ``black
cabinet'' of unofficial African-American advisers surely helped,
but more important were his economic relief programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Depression hit black Americans disproportionately hard, and
FDR's relief programs, such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and
the Public Works Administration, gave them much-needed aid and
jobs. A popular song among Depression-era blacks made it plain:
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt! You're my man!
</P>
<P>
   When the time come I ain't got a cent
</P>
<P>
   You buy my groceries
</P>
<P>
   And pay my rent.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Roosevelt, you're my man!
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, meanwhile, Northern and Western Democrats took the
lead on progressive racial legislation; it was two Democratic
senators who in 1934 introduced the next major anti-lynching bill.
Between 1932 and 1936, writes historian Nancy J. Weiss in Farewell
to the Party of Lincoln: Black Politics in the Age of FDR,
``Roosevelt and the New Deal changed the voting habits of black
Americans in ways that have lasted to our own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans still grasped desperately for black ballots. In
an ideologically divided party, liberal leaders, such as
presidential nominees Wendell Willkie and Thomas Dewey,
incorporated pro-civil-rights language into the platforms. But
their efforts paled next to Harry Truman's.
</P>
<P>
   Truman, the strongest civil rights president the nation had
seen, won 70 percent of the black vote in 1948 with a bold,
progressive racial agenda. He supported a Fair Employment Practices
Commission to fight job discrimination and desegregated the
military by executive order.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s racial liberalism in the GOP was fading fast.
Dwight Eisenhower, a conservative (though not a reactionary ) on
race, opposed Truman on key issues. In 1945 Eisenhower testified
before Congress against integrating the military, and as president
he resisted reviving the FEPC. He opposed the 1954 Supreme Court
decision Brown vs. Board of Education, which ruled that segregated
public schools were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to the inevitable, the 1956 GOP platform endorsed Brown.
Ike remarked that ``you cannot change people's hearts merely by
laws,'' repeatedly justifying his inaction in the face of rising
demands for civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Republican convention, Bush adviser Condoleezza
Rice said the Alabama Republican Party of 1952 registered her
father to vote when the Democrats wouldn't. That may be true, but
in much of the deep South then the GOP was virtually nonexistent.
In Georgia, writes the historian Taylor Branch, ``Barry Goldwater
had trouble drawing crowds to fill even barber shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 1960 election the Democrats, behind such leaders as
Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Herbert Lehman of New York, had
become the unquestioned party of civil rights. Richard Nixon, who
always overestimated his own popularity with blacks, still hoped to
fare well _ Jackie Robinson, for one, endorsed him _ and he
probably had a stronger civil rights record than John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But JFK courted the black vote, famously phoning Martin Luther
King Jr.'s wife, Coretta, when the civil rights leader was jailed.
Kennedy would have commanded the black vote anyway, but the
closeness of the election led analysts to mythologize the phone
call as critical.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the 1964 Civil Rights Act marked the last hurrah
for racial liberalism within the GOP. President Lyndon Johnson,
Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and the liberal Democrats decided
the time was ripe to pass a bill with teeth, their Southern
party-mates be damned. While the Republican leadership took a
wait-and-see position, younger GOP congressmen such as New York's
John Lindsay (who later became a Democrat) and Maryland's Charles
Mathias worked on the bill, helping it to passage in the House over
Southern opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Southern Democrats predictably undertook a
filibuster, which boded ill. Never had civil rights advocates
mustered the two-thirds supermajority needed to close off debate.
At first, few Republican senators were willing to vote to end the
filibuster, believing strongly in states' rights.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes Vice President Hubert Humphrey negotiated
with Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois, a supporter of
the bill. Humphrey claimed that he courted Dirksen as avidly as he
had wooed his wife, Muriel. Dirksen promised to round up enough
Republican holdouts if Humphrey would attach amendments paying lip
service to state and local control. The deal was struck, and after
more than two months the Senate voted 71-29 for cloture, with six
Republicans joining 23 Southern Democrats in opposition 44
Democrats and 27 Republicans voted aye.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Russell of Georgia, the Democrat who led the
opposition, said Dirksen had ``killed off a rapidly growing
Republican Party in the South.'' But Russell had it backward.
Significantly, the opponents of the 1964 law included the GOP's
future leaders, including Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater and Texas
Senate aspirant George H.W. Bush. They knew their electoral success
depended on conservative support in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater's ``Operation Dixie'' in his 1964 presidential race
may have meant surrendering the black vote; LBJ won 94 percent that
year. But it bore fruit four years later. Richard Nixon's
successful ``Southern Strategy'' of 1968 became the blueprint for
Ronald Reagan's Southern inroads and Lee Atwater and George Bush's
Willie Hortonism.
</P>
<P>
   So, if George W. Bush, running under the guidance of Atwater's
protege Karl Rove, can reverse that trend it will be more than a
change in his party's line. He will be declaring, truly, that this
is not his father's Republican Party.

   HURON, Ohio _ A group of chefs from the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain
were sitting on a flatbed pulled by a 1964 John Deere tractor. It
plodded along the field, grumbling the entire way. Off in the
distance, a woman was crouched over a row of herbs with a crisp
white lab coat on her back and a wicker basket at her side. She was
harvesting with scissors.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs, who had come from Washington, D.C., California and
Cleveland, sat in silence, their heads wagging as they took in the
spectacle before them: rows of low bushes, silvery like salmon
skin; delicate pine-green plants; loud-pink flowers; leafy herbs.
The farmer driving the tractor didn't say a word and didn't need
to. This was not like any other farm they had seen before or would
ever see again.
</P>
<P>
   The herbs the woman was harvesting were just one of more than
600 plant varieties on the 70-acre farm. In less than 24 hours
those herbs, meticulously cleaned and gathered in bouquets _ clean,
vibrant, impossibly perfect ones _ would be shipped overnight to
one of the country's top kitchens. For years, Charlie Trotter has
been buying from this farm. More recently, Jean-Georges
Vongerichten and Alain Ducasse have begun ordering. Even Thomas
Keller, whose restaurant rests in what many consider to be
America's fertile crescent, the Napa Valley, orders vegetables from
here.
</P>
<P>
   But this small, fecund plot, called the Chef's Garden, resists
that kind of romance. It's on a flat, humid plain about an hour
west of Cleveland. Here, wedged between vast farms carpeted with
soybeans, corn and wheat, is an extraordinary collection of
culinary delicacies: Mexican tarragon, Vietnamese houttuinia (looks
like basil, tastes like fish sauce), ginger shoots, New Zealand
spinach, purple beans, micro red shiso and melons so sweet you
could cry.
</P>
<P>
   For chefs around the country, this small farm has become their
laboratory, their research and development center and, often, their
trump card. Many farms that sell at the Greenmarkets in New York
City work with chefs to develop new crops and to revive old ones.
But none in upstate New York, or around the country, do it on the
scale that the Chef's Garden does.
</P>
<P>
   Every single sprout that emerges from the farm's rich lake-bed
soil is there for a restaurant. And every one is grown with such
scientific precision and artistic temperament that what comes from
it is something a home cook, even one with a garden out back, will
never see.
</P>
<P>
   When Ducasse calls in an order for 20 pounds of one-inch round
turnips, the farm does not check to see if enough have been
harvested. A team heads out to the field and picks through rows of
turnips, sifting out just the one-inch round ones.
</P>
<P>
   When Douglas Rodriguez, the chef at Chicama, came back from Peru
with a package of seeds for huacaty (a black mint that is as
important to Peruvian cooking as basil is to Italian cuisine) and
culantro (a flat-leaf form of cilantro), he sent them to the Chef's
Garden to have them cultivated. When Andrew Carmellini, the chef at
Cafe Boulud, went to Alsace last year and had a salad of yellow
dandelion greens, he asked the Chef's Garden if it could figure out
how to grow them. (It did.)
</P>
<P>
   Along with 56 varieties of pepper, 11 kinds of melon, 65 of
tomatoes, 27 of lettuce and 16 of eggplant, the farm is developing
varieties of lettuce from Hungary never before commercially grown
in the United States, as well as a blanched mint and a horseradish
shoot that is more gentle than the root itself. And with a moderate
climate and a number of greenhouses, it is harvesting year round.
</P>
<P>
   Without the farm's produce, Rodriguez's fluke ceviche would lack
its beguiling herbal aroma. The Ecuadorean shrimp at Cello would
not have the peppery snap of micro watercress in the first few
bites. And the roasted lupo di mare on braised celery at Felidia
would not have the gentle fresh flavor of chopped micro celery and
wiry garlic roots.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the location is unlikely, so are the farmers.
``We're just a bunch of dumb old farmers,'' says Bob Jones, who
runs the business with his sons, Bobby and Lee. Very few dumb old
farmers, however, have classical music and sharp advertising on
their phone system and refer to their fieldworkers as team members,
let alone do business with Charlie Trotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chefs really run our business,'' Bob Jones said. ``If we don't
grow it, we try to find it and learn how to grow it.'' Precisely
the way the chefs want it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickers need to know that a chef doesn't like flowers on the
thyme but that another chef appreciates the bud,'' Lee Jones said.
In packing miniature heads of curly red leaf lettuce, a team member
washes and trims them one by one, so they are pristine and
flawless. They are then spun dry, packed in a cushioned container
and placed in a padded box. Ice packs are added if the weather at
the destination warrants it.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses didn't always farm this way. Two decades ago, they
ran just another commercial farm, growing cabbage, sweet corn,
peppers and soybeans on 1,500 acres. In July 1980, all that
changed. What appeared to be a heavy rainstorm approaching out of
the northwest turned out to be hail _ hail the size of quarters. It
wiped out their entire crop, and ultimately their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' Lee Jones said. ``We moved out of our
home. They sold my mother's car. We lost the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually they started over, but this time with just five
acres. They grew vegetables _ zucchini, tomatoes, cantaloupes,
beans _ but this time sold them at the farmers' market in
Cleveland. In the first few years, they often had to borrow money
for gas from their neighbors just so they could get to the market,
and they painted the expired license plates on their market truck
with mud so they wouldn't be pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   At the market, Iris Bailin, then a chef at Prescott Ball &AMP;
Turben, a brokerage firm in Cleveland, became a regular customer.
One day she asked Lee Jones if he would sell zucchini blossoms. ``I
laughed,'' he said. ``I said, `Ma'am, that isn't how you eat
zucchini _ you eat the bulb, not the flower.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailin was persistent and after weeks of her requests, Jones
finally took a bunch to her at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Bailin kept buying. And so did many of her chef friends, whom
she told about the Joneses' produce. Pretty soon, half their
business was with chefs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Bob, Bobby and Lee held a family vote to decide whether
they should continue going to the market or try to make a living
selling only to chefs. Lee Jones was adamantly opposed to such a
risk. But he was outvoted.
</P>
<P>
   Their farm has since grown to 70 acres, and they now have 65
employees. The family that owns the farm surrounding theirs has
more than 3,000 acres and only a few people working the land, a
ratio that is about average for a profitable farm today. ``They
think we're nuts,'' Lee Jones said. ``We are, but we're very
committed nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   What made their reputation nationally _ and gave them a weekly
client base of over 200 restaurants _ was the relationship they
developed with Trotter six years ago. Trotter, convinced that
mesclun was passe, called to see if the Joneses could grow
something different, perhaps a mixture of greens like mesclun, but
much smaller. ``They came with their clipboards and tested and
tasted,'' Lee Jones said of Trotter and his cooks. With their
suggestions, microgreens were born. They are now the farm's largest
selling crop.
</P>
<P>
   The old market truck, with dancing vegetables painted on its
sides, is still around. It sits on the farm, bent and rusted, like
an ancient ruin. Around it a cluster of greenhouses has sprung up,
along with a collection of buildings _ offices, packing rooms,
garages _ that is soon to be the world's most complex maze.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, it is like a beehive buzzing with bees. There
are sales representatives and accountants in the offices, packers
out back, maintenance workers, men welding and a group of young
farmers, a number of them interns from Russia, Bulgaria, Slovakia
and Romania, running the greenhouses where the microgreens are
grown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones charts out the 2,800 plantings each year and works
with the field crews. Lee Jones handles the chefs. Bob Jones, a
round man with a face like an old apple, is the man behind the
curtain, orchestrating it all. ``He's part scientist, he's part
doctor and he's a great grower, and he reads and reads and reads,''
Lee Jones said. Not just farming manuals, but at least 10
management books a month.
</P>
<P>
   When they want to try something new, they turn to him. ``A lot
of our information,'' Bob Jones said, ``a lot of our help comes
from books about farming 100 years ago. They relate better to our
farm today.'' When a former intern from Hungary sent them four
lettuce seeds, they used old techniques of crop isolation and seed
selection to increase the yield.
</P>
<P>
   They use old tractors, which they say are more gentle on the
soil, and dated ways of creating microclimates. Being just a few
miles from Lake Erie, they already enjoy a moist coastal climate,
but by planting corn around their fields and rye between rows as
natural wind barriers, they have been able to raise the average
field temperatures by five to seven degrees. As a result, though
the farm is nestled in Ohio, it has a growing season identical to
that of Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bob Jones found a way to force a horseradish root to
grow shoots by planting it deep in soil. The shoots, which grow out
the sides of the root, have the sheen of corn silk and the texture
of a water chestnut. They taste like horseradish without the bite.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that success, the Joneses did the same with ginger
roots. Hops shoots are next. Last year, when they were
transplanting young garlic, they noticed that a dense cluster of
long tender roots had formed. They washed and tasted them. They
were like a cross between garlic and scallion, with the thickness
of a chive. Now, Ducasse buys the young plant _ greens, cloves and
roots _ and uses the whole thing like a scallion with its root
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Blanched popcorn shoots have also gone over well, so next year
they are going to try blanching mint and pea shoots. An effort to
grow an asparagus fern _ the frail plant that grows after the
asparagus is finished _ has just begun. So far, it's turned up a
small, needly plant that is chewy but sweet with a faint asparagus
flavor and a dash of bitterness. They have done their own tasting,
but the real test lies with the chefs to whom they will send the
fern for comment. (The Joneses are not tossing microgreens and
vinaigrette for dinner. They eat mainstream vegetables like
carrots, tomatoes and corn.)
</P>
<P>
   This back-and-forth relationship with chefs has accounted
largely for their success. When Rodriguez gave some of his Peruvian
seeds to farms in upstate New York, the farmers didn't follow
through. The Joneses, however, dedicated most of a row to his herbs
and another to a crop of special peppers, which they sell to him
several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Joneses will also grow something for a single occasion. If a
chef knows he has a large party two months hence and he wants micro
curly cress for one dish, the Joneses will grow a special crop just
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of the chefs who buy from them visit regularly to see
what is growing, to talk about new ideas, to look for inspiration.
The day after the Ritz-Carlton chefs toured the farm, Carmellini,
from Cafe Boulud, stopped by for his annual visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to supply restaurants with their weekly
produce,'' Bob Jones said. ``We want to be there to give them
something that's going to set a dish apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for top restaurants, it's expensive. A 5-by-6-inch plastic
container of microgreens, for instance, is $12 to $26 plus
shipping. Fifty flowerettes of basil tops are $12 to $17.50,
depending on the variety. Cantaloupes average $6 apiece. That's
why, when Carmellini was going around, though he tasted and smelled
everything in sight, he was interested in just a few items. For
certain vegetables, like white asparagus, Carmellini buys as much
as possible when it's in season. But generally, he orders from
Chef's Garden just three or four times a month.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during his visit, Lee Jones took him to the end of
a row where a group of black buckets were overturned. ``Here's an
experiment that flopped,'' Jones said, lifting a bucket. Beneath
was a tight bouquet of white pointy leaves, sad and limp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it!'' Carmellini exclaimed. It was the blanched
dandelion greens he had tasted in Alsace and asked the Joneses to
grow. Weak as they looked, they tasted right. The leaves were
bitter like green dandelion, but less aggressive, and as tender as
a sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Almost giddily, they exchanged ideas on how to improve the
growing method and get the greens going in time for the winter
menu.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Carmellini would stick with his short list of
favorites: New Zealand spinach, heirloom tomatoes, baby basils and
strong, earthy hickory nuts grown by a neighbor of the Joneses. He
uses the hickory nuts with skate sauteed in beurre noisette and
haricots verts. If price were no object, Carmellini said, he would
buy the baby haricots verts from the Joneses, too.
</P>
<P>
   But at $45 a pound, they seemed too indulgent a flourish, even
for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Carmellini will be serving the New Zealand spinach, a
cultivar indigenous to New Zealand that has a small, velvety leaf
with a rounder, less chalky flavor than regular spinach.
</P>
<P>
   He braises sweetbreads in a sauce scented with licorice root, at
the very end tossing in the rigid, succulent leaves. They wilt,
draping themselves over the sweetbreads, and maintaining in every
bite their identity _ a sturdy, minerally leaf that is as integral
and memorable as any luxury should be. Without it, the dish
wouldn't be nearly as good.

THE CASE OF THE ELUSIVE XO 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GRIMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dining out has its pleasure and its mysteries. XO
sauce is both.
</P>
<P>
   Those two cryptic letters flitted around for years in the
storage area of my brain taken up by old B-movie actors whose names
elude me, books I intend to read but have never gotten around to
and unsolved historical puzzles like the origin of bouillabaisse,
which a faithful correspondent demands that I credit to the Greeks.
(He's Greek.)
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, XO moved directly to my frontal lobe. It is one
of the star attractions at a Hong Kong-style restaurant, Ping's
Seafood, and on repeated visits I developed an infatuation with it.
It came with a simple dish of steamed scallops, showing up as a
small, viscous puddle on each shell. The flavor was intriguing:
salty and sweet, hot and sour.
</P>
<P>
   I put my nose right down to table level and studied the
situation. I could see tiny bits of dried shrimp, garlic, chilies
and scallop. There were very thin chopped-up noodles, too, and
nearly microscopic chips and flecks of unknown ingredients. If this
was XO, I had to get to the bottom of it.
</P>
<P>
   A chance remark by a fellow diner heightened my curiosity. He
mentioned in passing that when he grew up in Hong Kong, in the
1960s, XO sauce did not exist. All cuisines change, of course, but
Chinese cuisine seems almost immutable, an endless list of classic
dishes codified eons ago. The very idea of a new sauce on the block
made the search for XO that much more compelling. Unfortunately, no
one seemed to know very much about it. Even knowledgeable
Sinophiles drew a blank when XO came up in the conversation. Books
on Chinese cuisine failed to mention it. I began calling and
e-mailing experts around the world. I queried the very diligent
Hong Kong Tourist Association. I did not turn up a lot. XO, I was
told, was born in Hong Kong fairly recently and usually involved
dried scallops. That was about it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I reached Ken Hom, the cookbook author, at his home in
southwestern France. XO was music to his ears. It turned out that
he, too, had embarked on the same quest, about 20 years ago when he
was giving cooking classes in Hong Kong and kept encountering a
strange new sauce with an odd name. XO.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Willie Mark, an expert on Hong Kong cuisine, Hom
began eating his way around Hong Kong and quizzing chefs and
owners. What was this XO, exactly? Where did it come from? Who
invented it? The two detectives never found the smoking wok _ the
world of food seldom yields clear-cut answers _ but they narrowed
their circle of inquiry tightly enough to make an informed guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group of very expensive restaurants called Sun Tung
Lok, owned by the Yuen family, that specializes in shark's fin
dishes,'' Hom said. ``I think they were the first.'' Then Fook Lam
Moon, a celebrated seafood restaurant in Kowloon, began making it
too. ``They actually started bottling and selling their sauce,''
Hom said, ``which is very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative theory comes from Tian-Sak Wong, who edited the
Hong Kong magazine Food World at the time. Wong credits two
innovative seafood restaurants for the sauce, East Ocean and Tsui
Hang Village.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation for developing the sauce seems beyond dispute.
``I think it's one of those things where restaurants thought, `How
can we squeeze more money out of the customers?''' Hom said. There
was a lot of money to be squeezed in Hong Kong at the time. Why not
take a basic chili sauce, add some expensive ingredients like dried
scallops, give it a marketable name and charge a premium for it? At
the time, wealthy diners were ordering the expensive, aged XO-grade
cognac at dinner and drinking it by the bottle through the meal.
``XO'' had just the right splurgy connotations of luxury, like
Rolex or Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, trends spread quickly. Although connoisseurs
derided XO as inauthentic, and impractical to boot, it caught on as
a status marker. Soon restaurants all over town were making XO,
often throwing in a little twist to establish their own brand, so
to speak. The Regent Hotel, for example, added lemon grass to the
basic recipe of dried scallops, dried shrimp, Yunan ham, shrimp
roe, garlic and chili peppers. Even critics had to concede that the
sauce was getting better. Diners began throwing XO on everything. A
well-known sauce company, Lee Kum Kee, bottled its own version for
the retail market.
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, which probably has more Hong Kong-style
restaurants per capita than any city in North America, XO is more
or less standard at Chinese restaurants. Most of them charge a
supplement of $2 to $5 for the sauce, and at some of the better
restaurants it is bottled and sold for use during major holidays,
like Chinese New Year. ``Quite a lot of restaurants serve it,''
said Alan Yung, the manager of Sun Sui Wah Seafood, one of
Vancouver's highest-rated Chinese restaurants, ``although the
quality depends on the what grade of dried scallop you use. His
version uses dried garlic, dried chilies and uncured Virginia ham.
</P>
<P>
   At Hon's Wun Tun House, a noodle restaurant, XO is sold on the
side, like a condiment. It also appears in beef tenderloin with
wide Shanghai noodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific with any simple stir-fried seafood, like
scallops or prawns with snow peas,'' said Stephen Wong, a Vancouver
food writer who grew up in Hong Kong. ``It's also great with
har-gow, the shrimp dumplings that come with dim sum.''
</P>
<P>
   I have never been to Vancouver, so I can only guess at the XO
there. I did manage to find, at a shop across from the Manhattan
Bridge market, a four-ounce bottle of Lee Kum Kee's XO, which is
regarded as the best of the commercial versions. ``Very good,'' the
man behind the counter told me as he took my $6.75. ``Very good,
very hot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was neither. The sauce tasted excessively fishy, and the heat
was nowhere to be found. It made me appreciate once again the
Ping's version, a baroque creation whose seemingly endless list of
ingredients includes fresh scallops, dried scallops, dried shrimp,
shrimp roe, salted fish, dried ham, fresh green chilies, garlic,
shallots, bacon, noodles and minced chicken. It takes the XO
formula, already a newfangled, gaudy creation thrust upon the world
by an overheated, fast-money economy, and works so many changes on
it that surely a new name is required for this gilded lily. May I
suggest Trump sauce?

IN RIOJA, THE GRAPE IS OLD, THE STYLE ALL NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, the last time I was in Rioja, Spain's
best-known red wine region, many winemakers were frustrated by
their apparent inability to crack the American market. They put
much of the blame on rules that insisted they make their wines
exclusively from local grapes, principally tempranillo and
garnacha, which is called grenache here and in France. The Riojans
looked enviously toward Miguel Torres in the Penedes, near
Barcelona, and to Piero Antinori in Italy, both of them moving
beyond local varieties to make exciting wines from cabernet
sauvignon, the noble grape of Bordeaux and California.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent return trip, it was obvious that things had changed.
Business was booming, there was little if any talk of cabernet, and
it was easy to sense a renewed pride in the traditional Riojan
grapes. Sense it and taste it.
</P>
<P>
   Many wines still spend too much time in oak barrels; many still
lack the backbone and body that cabernet imparts. But many are
beautifully structured and much less oaky than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bodegas are what the Spanish call large wineries like La Rioja
Alta, CVNE, Lopez de Heredia and Muga, all in Haro, and Montecillo
in Fuenmayor. All turn out full-bodied, inky-dark wines with solid
tannic structure, far from the flabby, cherry-colored,
vanilla-tasting varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Spain is still the principal market for Rioja wines, the
Rioja bodegas make immense amounts of wine at the lower end of the
price range. Bodegas Campo Viejo, in Logrono, resembles nothing
more than the Gallo winery in Modesto, Calif. Within its massive
walls are some 50,000 oak barrels and 10 million aging bottles of
wine, give or take a million or two.
</P>
<P>
   While there is little discussion of other Spanish wine regions
among the Rioja winemakers, it's difficult to believe they have not
been influenced by the rapid rise of houses like Ribera del Duero
in the Castilla-Leon region and others in Priorato (where some of
the most successful winemakers are from Rioja), Navarra and even
newly emerging areas like Toro. Amost without exception, these
regions produce red wines that are both rich and elegant, and they
do it almost entirely with the tempranillo grape. Tempranillo goes
by other names in other regions, but it is essentially the same
grape everywhere it grows in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Why have Rioja wines improved? At a conference on tempranillo
this year, winemakers and enologists pointed to various factors,
including two that would surprise no one from other wine regions:
lower yields in the vineyards, and less time in oak barrels. To
grow twice as much an acre as one's neighbor is a worthy
accomplishment _ unless you're growing wine grapes. Lower yields in
the vineyard mean more tannin and more intense flavors in each
grape. Costs go up sharply, but so does quality.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Rioja wines aged for exceptionally long periods.
Cheap commercial wines in Spain can be bottled and sold anytime
after fermentation, like Beaujolais nouveau.
</P>
<P>
   One step up are crianza wines, which must age a year in wood.
Reservas must spend three years in wood and another year in the
bottle before they can be released. Gran reservas, the top of the
line, must age in wood for five years and in the bottle for two
more.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the bodegas go well beyond the rules. In 1988, I
remember tasting Rioja Alta's 1975 Gran Reserva 904. It had spent
10 months fermenting (some wineries do it in three or four days),
seven years in American oak barrels and four aging in bottle. An
impressive wine? Yes, but not as impressive as the concentrated
1995 Torremuga Reserve from Muga which spent about three years in
oak _ American first, then French _ and about a year in bottle
before it was released.
</P>
<P>
   The Rioja winemakers rate both 1994 and 1995 as excellent, their
highest praise, giving the edge to 1994, which some claim to be the
best Rioja vintage in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rioja wines were once among the world's best wine bargains. They
are still reasonable compared with the top Bordeaux and cult wines
from California, but the best of them will sell for $25 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the budget-minded can find some good buys in the $15 to
$20 range. Two examples are Remelluri's 1995 Rioja, which is a bit
oaky but has concentration and good fruit, and Rioja Alta's 1995
Alberdi, which is a little more restrained where oak is concerned
and offers good rich flavors in a lighter-boded wine.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most controversial Rioja winery is Bodegas Martinez
Bujanda, producer of the popular Conde de Valdemar wines, which
closely resemble _ in style, not taste _ Beaujolais made by the
carbonic maceration technique. Even when very young, they exhibit
deep purple color and almost overwhelming fresh fruit flavors.
These are Rioja wines that have little in common with the others
but are attractive on their own terms. There is a crianza and a
crianza reserva. The wood is a bit less obvious in the reserva.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists hate these wines. If you haven't decided whether
you are among them, there are older Riojas around to help you.
Though the astonishing number of old Riojas that used to be in
shops are all gone, it's still possible to find good ones from the
1980s, at about $80 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Do wines from Rioja age well? At a tasting there in April, we
began with 1995's and went back to a 1906 Federico Paternina.
Quality was all over the lot, but some very old wines, including a
Marques de Riscal 1920, a Montecillo 1934 and a couple of 1948's,
one from Montecillo and a Vina Real from CVNE, were in fine
condition. Of course, old wines are like old cars: fun to show off
but not much for everyday driving.

FESTIVAL CELEBRATES MULTICULTURALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ The Salzburg Festival has long adhered to
the historic idea of an arts festival as a place apart from the
workaday music world. Here artists collaborate in near-ideal
conditions, freed to an amazing degree from the scheduling and
budget constraints that during most regular seasons necessitate
cutting corners and adjusting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one of the conditions affecting this summer's
festival is the political and cultural upheaval caused by the
ascension of the right-wing, vociferously nationalistic Freedom
Party, now part of Austria's governing coalition. Gerard Mortier,
who in eight years as the festival's innovative artistic director
turned this former bastion of traditionalism into a hotbed of
experimentation, has been appalled by the developments. For next
summer, his last, he promises to make the festival a virtual
celebration of multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, true to form, this summer's offerings, especially the
opera productions, have been stirring debate. One is a fascinating
new staging of Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride,'' heard on Saturday
night at the Residenzhof, a setting like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the festival's wizards of theater technology turn
the enormous open courtyard of this grand palace, once the
residence of Salzburg's ruling archbishops, into a makeshift opera
house with seating for 780. The stage and seats are placed atop a
steel-framed structure, like some huge Erector set, with a canvas
roof. Only here would patrons dressed in evening finery climb into
what is essentially the world's most lavish metal bleachers to
attend cutting-edge opera productions. It was an inspired site for
the German director Claus Guth's daring production of Gluck's great
opera epitomizing the classical ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it's difficult for a production to convey the
essential prehistory of this mythological story. To assure success
in his war against Troy, Agamemnon, the Greek king, has sacrificed
his daughter, Iphigenie. But the goddess Diana has rescued her and
brought her to Tauris, where she lives under the rule of Thoas, the
Scythian king, and serves as a high priestess to Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Iphigenie's mother, Clytemnestra, has killed her husband in
grief over what she believes to be her daughter's death. And
Oreste, Iphigenie's younger brother, has killed his mother to
avenge his father.
</P>
<P>
   Guth conveys this horrific background story through enormous
masks that enclose the heads of a group of actors. Like eerie
oversize puppets, the actors appear at strategic moments as doubles
for the members of antiquity's most murderous dysfunctional family.
The puppet-actors trail the singers onstage like doppelgangers who
won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   It's an overtly dramatic and, no doubt for some, a heavy-handed
theatrical device. Masks of any kind can dominate a production. But
the three leading singers here, all Americans, hold their own: the
mezzo-soprano Susan Graham in a fearless performance of the title
role, the baritone Thomas Hampson in a riveting performance as
Oreste, and the tenor Paul Groves as Oreste's loving Greek friend
Pylade.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the production, with sets and costumes by Christian
Schmidt, is vaguely Victorian. The story takes place in a plush
salon with huge tilted walls covered in crimson velvet. Yet the
effect is timeless. The chorus of priestesses who serve Iphigenie
wear flesh-colored masks over their eyes and auburn wigs pulled
back in buns, so that they look eerily like their mistress. On
their dresses, they even have bloody stains above their hearts, as
she does, wounds of sisterly solidarity. Guth has devised highly
stylized but compelling and lifelike movements for the priestesses
and also for the male chorus of Thoas' soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The musical performance, with Ivor Bolton conducting the
Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, was inspired. The role of
Iphigenie is typically sung by a soprano, but Graham subtly altered
the rich mezzo-soprano colorings of her voice, bringing lightness
and clarity to her top range, yet singing with emotional abandon.
Hampson's singing was also viscerally intense, yet poignant and
elegant. Groves pushed his light tenor voice somewhat but still
delivered a vulnerable and impressive performance. The baritone
Philippe Rouillon was a menacing King Thoas.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the festival gave the creative team free rein. Of
course, having to work within limits can often compel artists to
clarify their ideas. In two current stagings of Mozart operas the
directors were allowed, it would seem, to indulge themselves.
Together these productions suggest that in Mozart's hometown,
directors are straining to keep his canonical works interesting,
even if gimmickry is the result.
</P>
<P>
   The director Luca Ronconi's production of ``Don Giovanni,''
heard on Sunday night at the Large Festival Hall, was generally
deemed a failure when introduced last year. It's a cumbersome
staging with a muddled conception vaguely suggesting 1930s Fascist
Italy, with the Don as a dissolute millionaire playboy who seems to
have a thing for leather outfits when he attempts rape. There is a
grimly serious side to ``Don Giovanni,'' but in this production,
with Margherita Palli's charcoal gray and monumentally ugly set,
the opera just seems depressing.
</P>
<P>
   This was sad, for the musical performance was marvelous. Valery
Gergiev conducted the Vienna Philharmonic with a keen ear for fresh
detail, a vivid sense of drama and some boldly magisterial tempos.
In the title role, the resonant bass Ferruccio Furlanetto led a
strong cast that included the powerful bass Rene Pape as,
surprisingly, a vocally agile Leporello; the exquisite soprano
Renee Fleming as a Donna Anna to cherish; and the luminous-voiced
soprano Marina Mescheriakova as Donna Elvira.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at the Small Festival Hall offered the
controversial new production of ``Cosi fan tutte'' by the director
Hans Neuenfels, with sets and costumes by Reinhard von der Thannen.
The staging is over the top and a mishmash of ideas, but at times
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The two pairs of confused and inconstant lovers at the center of
this cynical comedy wear matching white jumpsuits, a device that
makes the partner-swapping and games of deception all the more
unsettling. There are unforgettable images, as in the garden scene,
in which the deceiving lovers court one another amid wildly
overgrown exotic flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuenfels must not trust the opera, for he cannot leave the
music alone. Too many arias and ensembles are performed before
self-consciously symbolic and often pointless background action
from a roster of invented silent characters.
</P>
<P>
   The worst such intrusion involves a video projected on a large
screen during the scene in which the audience first meets the two
sisters of the story as they sing in blissful innocence about their
boyfriends. On screen a gorgeous young couple enact a modern-day
version of the Adam-and-Eve tale, complete with an apple riddled
with worms. Standing arm in arm before the screen, the radiant
soprano Karita Mattila as Fiordiligi and the dusky-toned
mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova sang the duet incomparably. But it
was hard not to fixate on this weird movie.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast was excellent: the lyric tenor Rainer Trost as
Ferrando, the robust baritone Simon Keenlyside as Guglielmo, the
stentorian bass Franz Hawlata as Don Alfonso, and the bright-voiced
soprano Maria Bayo as Despina. The conductor Lothar Zagrosek's
gesticulating baton technique did not elicit the most consistently
incisive playing from the Vienna Philharmonic, but the sound, shape
and character of the music-making were wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   The singers were not just vocally strong, but attractive,
charismatic and good sports. Would that Neuenfels had simplified
his conception and removed the extraneous clutter, which must have
been terribly expensive. What he needed was something not known at
the Salzburg Festival, a tough-guy boss, like Joseph Volpe at the
Metropolitan Opera, to tell him no once in a while.

BRAISE NOW, BROWN LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lamb with peaches sounds Middle Eastern, but I first came across
the combination in a contemporary German cookbook. It is a logical
pairing and tastes glorious, with the sweetness of the fruit
cutting through the richness of the lamb. But the challenge lay in
finding an efficient way to make it, since the original required
two separate cooking methods, with a resting period in between.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest technique was to grill lamb chops and peaches side
by side. Unfortunately, this yielded essentially lamb with peach
relish, and I wanted the peaches to contribute their juices to the
final product.
</P>
<P>
   So I developed a relatively fast and almost unattended braise.
Most braises begin with browning, but this one ends with it,
reducing both spattering and time: Since the lamb's liquid is
mostly cooked away at the end of the braising, it doesn't go flying
from the hot fat, and the meat browns faster. And the peaches
contribute some of their juices to the pan while browning lightly
and turning tender.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of cinnamon gives the dish a great aroma as it cooks and
a slightly mysterious flavor; I don't think you'd want more than
that. An even smaller amount of allspice, maybe an eighth of a
teaspoon, would also work. A pinch of cayenne or other red pepper
makes a nice addition, and an onion cooked along with the meat
provides just a little more complexity; you could live without it,
but it doesn't take much effort.
</P>
<P>
   One issue remains unresolved, and that is whether to tilt the
dish in a Middle Eastern or a European direction. The first calls
for finishing it with lime and cilantro, the second with lemon and
parsley. I loved both.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB WITH PEACHES
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 90 minutes, largely unattended
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds boned shoulder of lamb, trimmed of fat and gristle and
cut into 1- to 1{-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick or 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1 medium to large onion, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   { cup port, red wine or water
</P>
<P>
   4 medium to large ripe peaches, washed
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon or 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   1 cup roughly chopped parsley (for use with lemon) or cilantro
(to go with lime).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place lamb in a 12-inch skillet, and turn heat to
medium-high. Season with salt, and add cinnamon, cayenne, onion and
wine or water. Bring to a boil, cover and adjust heat so that the
mixture simmers steadily. Cook 1 to 1{ hours, checking and stirring
every 15 minutes or so, adding a little more liquid in the unlikely
event that the mixture cooks dry. (This probably means the heat is
too high; turn it down a bit.) 2. When the meat feels tender when
poked with a small, sharp knife, remove the onion and cinnamon

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: A Democratic bid for four more years
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, nominee Bill Clinton stood before a stomping, cheering,
crowd in New York City to promise delegates to the Democratic
National Convention that he could recapture the White House. For 12
years, Democrats had been locked out of the presidential residence,
and the delegates lusted at the prospect of occupying it again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton preached a sermon that night, one that mixed promise and
hope with verbal lashings of the George Bush administration on
which he laid the blame for a flat economy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Bill Clinton stood before a stomping,
cheering crowd in Los Angeles to once again deliver a sermon that
mixed promise, hope and verbal lashings aimed at George W. Bush,
whose promises he characterized as flat.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from Bill Clinton's last hurrah, but he tried
mightily _ but not punctually _ to relinquish the spotlight to his
vice president. Electing Al Gore will stretch the Democratic hold
on the White House to match the 12-year GOP tenure that began in
1981 with the inauguration of Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly 10 p.m. Central Time before Clinton took the
podium to tout the record of his administration and Al Gore's role
in it, but not before taking more than a few bows. Modesty is not
the first choice of any politician, particularly one who is by
virtue of office the country's top politico.
</P>
<P>
   Though a most controversial president, Clinton is a most
eloquent one. Monday's speech, which took 40 minutes to deliver,
was a masterful effort, and he began with a recitation of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago, when our party met in New York, it was a far
different time for America. Our economy was in trouble, our society
was divided, our political system was paralyzed. Ten million of our
fellow citizens were out of work. Interest rates were high. The
deficit was $290 billion and rising. After 12 years of Republican
rule, the federal debt had quadrupled, imposing a crushing burden
on our economy and our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare rolls, crime, teen pregnancy, income inequality _ all
had been skyrocketing. And our government was part of the problem,
not part of the solution,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming Ronald Reagan rhetoric dead at the Bush-Dick Cheney
ticket, Clinton asked: ``... are we better off today than we were
eight years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say the progress of these eight years was an
accident, that we just coasted along, let's be clear: America's
success

ALPINE RESIDENTS OPPOSED TO INCLUSION IN TRADE ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Del Norte and Glass mountains near Alpine don't rival the
Rockies, but in West Texas they look ruggedly handsome and offer a
relief from the scruffy nap of the Chihuahuan Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Alpine is sometimes called the ``Taos of Texas,'' mostly by the
local chamber of commerce. Still, it is a fresh-faced city that
belongs among the state's most valuable tourism treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away near the sag of the Big Bend, its remoteness has
always added to the city's charm, but now that remoteness is being
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   There are thoughts of Alpine's becoming part of a new trade
route that will shuffle goods from Mexico, through West Texas, and
on to Fort Worth-Dallas to the east, and Denver to the north.
</P>
<P>
   The trade corridor, called ``La Entrada al Pacifico,'' would
begin at the port of Topolobampo near Los Mochis on Mexico's Gulf
of California. It would travel northeasterly through the city and
state of Chihuahua, then to Presidio in West Texas and northward
through Alpine on its way to the Midland-Odessa area.
</P>
<P>
   Two trade routes are being proposed. The other, called the
Ports-to-Plains, is planned to come north out of Mexico City, to
Monterrey and Del Rio, then on to San Angelo and again
Midland-Odessa.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily see why the folks in Midland-Odessa are
absolutely giddy about the prospects. The people in Alpine are not.
</P>
<P>
   An organization of Midland-Odessa chambers of commerce and local
government leaders recently went to Alpine to explain support for
the Entrada al Pacifico program, only to be met by a resolute group
of Alpine residents who were steadfastly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Midland-Odessa organization is called MOTRAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people from MOTRAN get very high marks for coming down
here,'' said Brewster County Judge Val Beard, who set up the
meeting. ``They were very courageous to come here to a crowd that
was not very friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   While the proposed trade route is only a concept, and probably
can't become a reality for several years, the Alpine residents were
firm in their disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the meeting gave the MOTRAN folks a clearer message
about how strongly we oppose them,'' said Pam Gaddis, an Alpine
resident who belongs to a local opposition group called Tourists
Not Trucks. ``No one at the meeting spoke in favor of it. We want
them to stop pretending they don't understand us. We don't want
it.''
</P>
<P>
   MOTRAN officials say there are misconceptions about the trade
route, especially the thoughts of four-lane thoroughfares running
through the heart of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want the trucks,'' Gaddis said. ``We don't care what
form the road is in, it's the trucks we don't want and the governor
of Chihuahua has been quoted as saying there could be 4,000 trucks
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Midland and Odessa want the business, Alpine
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are very selective about what they want to
encourage to come here,'' said Beard. ``People who live here have
made a lifestyle choice, and that choice does entail making less
money. But they accept that so they can enjoy clean air, clean
water, and a safe small-town atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very protective of that lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Beard says she shares that sentiment and understands that Alpine
doesn't suffer some of the same economic hardships other West Texas
towns are struggling with.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpine economy is healthy, tourism is good, the population
is increasing at a manageable rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have something worth conserving,'' she said. ``We are very
fortunate. We are blessed and we know it.''

BURMESE SALADS, WITH THE THERMOSTAT ON COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: 470 words of recipes appear at bottom of story) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On my first day in most Southeast Asian countries I invariably
have the following conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Guide: I have arranged for you to have dinner tonight in your
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Do they serve local food?
</P>
<P>
   Guide: You won't like that. Maybe you can have Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   A polite argument ensues.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes I get lucky. Last year in Myanmar (formerly
Burma), the Strand Hotel in Yangon (formerly Rangoon) actually had
a small menu of Burmese dishes, mostly salads. They were superb,
with light, bright flavors and a wonderful mix of textures. As I
later learned from Burmese cooks living in the United States, those
dishes had been authentically seasoned and only slightly altered to
suit Western tastes.
</P>
<P>
   I think of those salads when it's really hot, as it is in
Myanmar where the average year-round temperature is over 80
degrees. Salads are always cooling, of course, and in countries
with tropical climates hot spices are frequently used because they
make people perspire, another technique for cooling off. The
Burmese, like the Thais and Laotians, love raw vegetables and
greens and eat them with a pungent dipping sauce that usually
contains chilies. Their daily outdoor markets are filled with
dazzling displays of small pale purple eggplants, tiny fiery green
chilies, tomatoes and green papayas and mangos that are treated
like vegetables. Markets also carry beetel nuts, which produce a
high as well as blackened teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar sits between India to the northwest and China to the
northeast, with Thailand to the south, and its cooking has been
shaped by its neighbors' ingredients: bamboo shoots and soy sauce;
curry leaves and tamarind; fish sauce and lemon grass. Yet the food
is distinctly Burmese. Despite the use of chilies, the food is
never as hot as it is in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Curries are a staple, but the Indian versions use a far more
complex blend of spices. The Burmese rely on fresh ingredients like
green chilies for additional seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is the mainstay of the diet, but the Burmese love noodles,
too, a notable legacy from China. The Burmese national dish, if
there is such a thing in a country with almost 70 indigenous
groups, is a noodle soup called mohinga. Fish-based and made with
rice noodles, it is served at breakfast and it was one of the most
appealing breakfasts I have ever eaten. Shan State in particular is
noted for its noodle dishes, and I had a wonderfully savory version
at a hotel on Inle Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But the specialty of Myanmar is lephet, or fermented tea leaf
salad. Its appeal lies in the slight bitterness and smokiness of
the leaves, which are mixed with a highly seasoned combination of
fried garlic, roasted sesame seeds, peanuts, fish sauce and lime
juice. In Burma it is served as a snack, a palate cleanser, a
welcome to guests and a stimulant to ward off sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When tomatoes and cabbage are added it is served as a salad.
(That is how it is adapted in the United States. Both Irene Khin
Wong, who owns Saffron59, a catering company in New York, and Pyu
Pyu Win, who owns Myanmar Burmese Restaurant in Falls Church, Va.,
serve it that way.)
</P>
<P>
   Ginger salad is made of peeled, julienned ginger with many of
the same ingredients as the tea leaf salad, but the slightly hot
ginger provides a completely different taste. The recipe is based
on one from Win and Claudia Saw Lwin Robert, who lives in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   The green papaya salad is similar, but once again, the papaya
enhances the other flavors while adding texture if not taste.
</P>
<P>
   All three salads are easy to put together once you have made a
trip to Indian and Asian markets for the staples, like fish sauce,
ground roasted peanuts and ground dried shrimp. The fermented tea
leaves are probably the most exotic ingredient, and they can be
found at a place on Canal Street in Chinatown, Myanmar Wholesale
and Retail (212) 566-1851. The business also sells packages of
mixed fried garlic, peanuts, beans and sesame seeds in oil to use
in the salad, for $6 plus shipping, but you can buy just the tea
leaves (also $6) and make the salad following the recipe here.

PORTUGUESE WINES UNCORKED 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Portugal is renowned for port and Madeira, and for fizzy roses
like Lancers and Mateus. It is also known for supplying many of the
world's wine corks. But this country also has a thriving table wine
industry, which is so little known it is a paradise for bargain
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal has long been a wine-loving nation, but only in the
last 15 years, since joining the European Union, has it begun to
join the rest of the wine-making world in modernizing its
agricultural and vinification techniques. Still, Portugal seems to
retain a stubborn sense of wanting to do things its own way, which
for wine lovers has its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many wine producers hoping for international success,
Portugal has not gravitated to grapes like merlot, cabernet
sauvignon and chardonnay, although you can find small amounts of
these wines. Its red wines are made from grapes like periquita,
trincadeira and even some port grapes like tinta roriz. (No, there
will not be a quiz at the end.)
</P>
<P>
   The best Portuguese reds combine a rich fruitiness with flavors
like coffee and chocolate. Typically, they are aged in oak barrels,
with mixed results. The better wines become well knit, with the oak
augmenting the natural flavors the way the deft use of salt aids in
cooking. In poorer versions, fruit and oak battle in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the excitement is in Portuguese red wines, it is
summer, so I can't ignore vinho verdes, or green wines, which earn
their name because of their youth, not their color.
</P>
<P>
   Vinho verdes can be white or red, but it is the whites that are
imported here and are so delightful in hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   These wines are cheap, low in alcohol and nothing fancy _ simply
a blend of grapes shot with carbon dioxide for a mild fizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Vinho verdes are not even vintage dated, since they're intended
to be drunk immediately. But on a sweaty day, a good vinho verde is
remarkably refreshing, like a great lemonade spritzer
</P>
<P>
   REDS &QL; 
QUINTA DO CARMO, ALENTEJO 1995 $20 &QL;

SEGA HEAVILY TOUTING `WORLD SERIES BASEBALL 2K1'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's be honest: There were only a couple of reasons to buy a
Sega Saturn machine _ you know, that ``other'' Sega home game
system you bought your kid before the ``new'' one came out last
year _ and ``World Series Baseball'' was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Sony, which loaded ``WSB'' with animated graphics
and all the extras you could imagine, Sega hit a home run with a
simple-to-learn, motion-capture-graphics title that looked as good
as it played. It still ranks as one of the best baseball vid-games.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   So you can imagine the anticipation for ``World Series Baseball
2K1'' (Sega Sports for Dreamcast), Sega's updated, upgraded version
of ``WSB'' for the Dreamcast. Sega has been heavily touting this
game, saying it's the baseball equivalent to its excellent football
and basketball Dreamcast games.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the graphics are incredibly detailed, from jersey numbers
to facial hair. The players really do look like their real-life
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And Sega went to a lot of trouble capturing nuances of all the
baseball stadiums, from the lighting to scoreboards to billboards.
The only thing missing from The Ballpark at Arlington is that
``Star-Telegram'' sign that greets you as you s-l-o-w-l-y make your
way through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and this is a serious flaw _ gamers cannot control the
outfielders, whereas in other baseball games, you can. The computer
does it for you. Oh, that's a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Response times are slow, too. When a player catches a ball or
swings at a pitch, for instance, it takes an unusual amount of time
for the game to react to it. Batting and pitching are difficult to
master, too, a dramatic change from the easy-to-learn techniques of
``WSB'' for the Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Hope they fix this stuff for ``2K2.''
</P>
<P>
   ``KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child'' (Third Law for PC):
Clown-makeup-wearing rock band Kiss enters the CD-ROM world with
this game that's based on Todd McFarlane's hot-selling ``KISS
Psycho Circus'' comic-book line.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part where we have to warn parents: Just like with
comic books, there's lots of violence and blood and
nightmare-inducing villainous creepoids here. I wouldn't let my
12-year-old play it.
</P>
<P>
   Teens, though, will recognize this as another
``Doom''-influenced, first-person shooter. Players take on one of
the four Kiss members as they walk around and lay waste to various
demonic creatures, a lot of whom resemble the band's fans.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't seem to be much of a plot or point, except blowing
away everything. The game's saving grace is the multiplayer
death-match mode in which up to 16 players can play target practice
against one another. Sixteen players _ yeah, that is pretty cool.

 By MARCY MEDINA, with contributions from ROSE APODACA JONES,
CASSANDRA NYE and LAUREN CRAIG  
 (Two color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ With Emmy-nominated TV hits such as ``Sex and the
City'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' making Jimmy Choo and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
practically household names, the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmys are
poised to compete in that ``Style Superbowl'' that until now has
been dominated by the Oscars.
 &HT;    ``I think TV will give the Oscars fashion race a run for its
money,'' predicted Randolph Duke, who has dressed several of the
networks' leading ladies.
 &HT;    The nominees _ listed here _ are no strangers to the fashion
hoopla. Joining them here are actresses whom the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences may have overlooked, but of whom
fashionistas can't get enough.
 &HT;    One thing is certain: If they don't look fabulous, it won't be
for lack of trying.
 &HT;    ``Given these women's status, they can afford the best,''
observed stylist Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig, who has worked with
Michelle Pfeiffer, Brooke Shields and Meg Ryan. ``They should all
take advantage of that access. If people don't want to deal with
the competition, have a dress custom made.''
 &HT;    So what should viewers expect on the big night? WWD surveyed the
experts _ the designers, stylists, magazine editors, hair stylists
and makeup artists _ about how the nominees and attendees should
look.
 &HT;    Many of those surveyed will also, inevitably, make their mark at
the broadcast Sept. 10.
 &HT;    
 SARAH JESSICA PARKER  
 &HT;    Everyone wants TV's ``It'' girl, as much for her willingness to
experiment with fashion on screen in her role as sex columnist
Carrie Bradshaw in ``Sex and the City'' _ which won her a
nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series _ as for
her experimentation with fashion offscreen.
 &HT;    Good thing she studied up on the collections as a front-row
guest at every key designer's show. She is the series co-producer,
you know.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Sarah in a hot skirt with fringe and beading paired with a brocade
bustier and Swarovski-crystal-embroidered sandals. Sarah is daring
and has a unique way of interpreting fashion. She is not afraid to
take chances and always looks great.''
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``She has a great, original
sense of style. She would look fab in a quirky, asymmetrical net
cocktail dress.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``My favorite. Please tangle me up
in that hair! I'd love to see her a redhead _ deep red _ very
steamy.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``You always run the risk of what I call the
`beauty pageant parade' of dresses with all these pretty things
coming down the carpet. You need those women who have great bodies
and sex appeal to pepper it up. Sarah Jessica Parker can do that.
She's one who could pull off a hot pant or bra under a sheer top.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID GARDNER, hairstylist, Profile agency (who will be
styling Parker's hair on Emmy night): ``Seeing as she wore her hair
straight for the MTV Movie Awards, I think she will go curly and
wild. I know it's what I would like to see.''
 &HT;    
 JENNIFER ANISTON  
 &HT;    This newlywed is certainly not going to throw a housecoat over
that sexy figure. Playing sweet Rachel may have scored her a nod
for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
``Friends,'' but she should take the high road to chic style.
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``With Brad Pitt in tow, it doesn't matter what
she wears. Jennifer will have everybody beat, hands down. The dress
I designed for her last year was a departure, which was nice
because you don't get that often. But since she tried it last year,
I think she will go more simple this year.''
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``Jennifer could be great in a dress that has a
touch of whimsy to it, not too serious, but still sophisticated.
She would be very beautiful in rich, strong turquoise or
aquamarine. Her body and skin are flawless, so she can wear
anything. I would like to keep her modern and very sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``On Emmy night, she's going to emanate what
she has for the past year, always classy and simply dressed. She
has a sex appeal that is uncoupled, and she and Brad are an
uncoupled couple. She won't change her look. It works for her.
She's with him, isn't she? Would you change your look?''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her curly, very natural
hair _ similar to Gisele Bundchen.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer (nominated along with Bob Mackie for
Outstanding Costumes for a Variety of Music Program for ``Cher:
Live in Concert''): ``Jennifer is fabulous. Ever since Brad,
whether he's the reason or not, she's had a six-pack stomach. I
love seeing her in hip-hugging skirts that accentuate her body. And
I don't think she is too skinny. I just think she's in great shape
for the first time in her life.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``Jennifer is beautiful in an approachable way. It would be odd to
see her completely painted. I'd like her tan and shimmering and
bronze. It's the look of somebody on holiday who threw on a gown.''
 &HT;    
 HEATHER LOCKLEAR  
 &HT;    This quintessential L.A. woman is now a New Yorker (``Spin
City'' tapes there) and a Seventh Avenue favorite. She has the
body, attitude and cult status that make her a dream for designers
such as Michael Kors and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Heather accentuate her great figure in a stretch chiffon dress with
a low neckline encrusted with floral beading and high-heel sandals.
Her hair and makeup (are) always perfect.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Urban sexy. Stay
with those above-the-knee hemlines.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``She should try some layers and a
shorter length ... to the chin. A not so `salon perfect' style
would be so refreshing. She would rock as a shiny brunette.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``The girl is up for anything. The
only thing that bothers me is she dresses a little too rock 'n'
roll sometimes. I'd probably glam her up a bit, maybe in Michael
Kors' gold matte top and skirt. There's also a great Vera Wang
short, one-shoulder dress that's gold on top and black on the
bottom. She can do metallics in an elegant way that shows off that
great figure.''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her a Farrah Fawcett
blow-dry.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``She's such a bombshell.
She's innately sexy. She could wear a housecoat and still be sexy.
With Heather, the key is reversing what we expect of her. Play down
the hair and makeup. No cleavage. She should just walk onto that
carpet and people should be saying she's stunning, not hot.''
 &HT;    
 HALLE BERRY  
 &HT;    OK, already, the world knows you've got the bod. Enough of the
cha-cha duds. She looked stunning in that white Valentino gown
peppered with red roses when she won a Golden Globe as Dorothy
Dandridge in the HBO production.
 &HT;    Primed to scoop a second trophy for the role as Outstanding Lead
Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, she would be wise to summon the
elegant heroine she portrayed.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, creative director of style, New York Times
Magazine: ``I would love to see Halle in something that's not a
bikini top, doesn't bare her midriff or have fringe. She'd look
great in a draped chiffon evening dress from Donna Karan's fall
2000 collection.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU, couturier and TV host: ``She's a dream. Lately,
some of her choices have been a little out-there. When you look
like she does, you don't need to display yourself like that. But
with a body like that, you can't go wrong. Good or bad, she's
taking those chances, and God bless her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, fashion director, InStyle: ``There's nothing
Halle Berry can't wear. The woman radiates great energy. There's a
very gamine quality about her, and yet she has a womanly figure.
Most fun for Halle would be Galliano's resort collection, wines and
mustards that are overtly sexy yet not cheap.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``She always picks something beautiful and
of-the-moment. She's a chameleon. She can pull off a Madonna or an
Ashley Judd, going very couture or very hot and sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Serve up all
your gorgeousness and lusciousness. If you've got it, naked is
best.''
 &HT;    
 SELA WARD  
 &HT;    As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein noted, here's more proof that some
things in Hollywood can get better with age. Nominated for
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for ``Once and Again''
(she already took home a statuette in that category in 1994 for
``Sisters''), Ward can pull off just about any look and designer.
Play up the drama, sister.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``Such a beauty. We would put
Sela in very classic, dramatic shapes, probably dark _ think John
Singer Sargent portraits.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Sela radiates beauty, even
when she's in shorts and a tank top. She's 40-something and proud
of it. I'd put her in something European. But I wouldn't rule
anything out because the Americans are now getting more edgy. She
absolutely should have something with a low back that trains behind
her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Sela Ward is just the most
smashing-looking lady, but she wears black an awful lot. If
anything, here is a woman who could wear those great jewel tones
for fall, like a carnelian gown by Richard Tyler, or the tremendous
gowns by Donna Karan. She would look spectacular in a diaphanous
dress with an uneven hem or a leather top with a full skirt.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``At
44, Sela looks fabulous! She should take advantage of what she's
got. Skintight Versace all the way. Clean and glamorous makeup and
her hair dressed down to say that she still has a casual attitude
about getting all glammed up.''
 &HT;    
 KIM CATTRALL  
 &HT;    Flaunt be thy middle name. The ``Sex and the City'' sexpot,
nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
her role as Samantha, can work it to the hilt. She reminds
hairstylist Laurent D of a modern-day Marilyn Monroe. But that
blond bombshell never made fans blush. Just a reminder, Kim, the
Emmys aren't on cable.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, New York Times Magazine: ``She has a slight
`cheese' factor and should just go with it. Wear an over-the-top
'80s look from Celine, Versace or Christian Dior.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU: ``Kim has made some bad choices and good. She
knows she's sexy, but sometimes you can be a little more subtle.
Still, I love her because she has a sense of style all her own.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Kim has had a phenomenal year. She just gets
better and better. She's more beautiful now than she ever has been,
and success has treated her well. I think she will go simple and
maybe a little more couture in feeling than she has in the past.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``We want her to
serve it up in the style of Samantha. We'd like her to go not as
Kim Cattrall, but fiercer _ more in character. She should arrive
like the 'A' star she's become. Joan Collins, move over.''
 &HT;    _ RICCI DE MARITNO, stylist, Cloutier agency: ``Kim is the
epitome of sexiness. No matter what you put her in, it takes on a
sexy energy. I would get really slinky and sexy and nod to retro
Hollywood. You glam up Kim, and she carries it off.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Her beauty slays me. I would
grow (the hair) length, shag the top and go less blond _ it's too
cliche. I would do a deeper base with golden honey highlights.''
 &HT;    
 DEBRA MESSING  
 &HT;    Fans can't get enough of her or her show, ``Will and Grace.''
Neither could the judges when they nominated her for Outstanding
Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. As Grace, she's incredibly
accessible. But with those emerald eyes and auburn hair, she should
opt for pared-down elegance, maybe something black, when she hits
the red carpet.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``With such classic features,
that gorgeous hair and perfect skin, we think Debra would look
beautiful in something dark _ even black _ in a revealing cut.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Debra. For her, I like
the look of curly locks coming down around that beautiful face.
It's a little bit undone, which is a very nice look.''
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ALT, senior makeup artist at MAC Cosmetics: ``We have
grown to love Deborah as a quirky, adorable Lucille Ball type, so
it would be fun to see her let go a bit and explore her sexy side.
Smoky, plum-colored eyes with a light, rich plum gloss on her lips
would look great.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``I adore her character, but she's
sometimes a little too elegant and could stand to be more funked
up. I could see what Galliano could do for her. She needs to be
more eclectic, not so gowny. It's high summer in L.A. so why not go
for something much more fun and interesting?''
 &HT;    
 LARA FLYNN BOYLE  
 &HT;    The Bedazzler studded Bob Seger T-shirt looked more MTV Music
Awards than Golden Globes, but leave it up to ``The Practice'' star
to shed her Armani district attorney duds for riskier statements by
rising designers. What will Jack Nicholson's cookie come up with
next? Note to her stylist: These are the Emmys.
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, celebrity stylist: ``She should wear
something that accentuates her, like a bias-cut dress. If thin
actors don't want to be on the cover of every magazine as the
``starved actors,'' then they need to go with something flowy.
Maybe Chanel or Ungaro or Alberta Ferretti. Something that isn't
going to show bones.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer: ``When I dress her, I tuck the fabric
right under the rear instead of dropping it off. That way, she
looks curvy and sexy. I'd like to see her in a strapless dress,
with a slightly fuller short skirt, very Audrey Hepburn. She wants
to portray the image of a true star, not someone who is trendy.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Lara's dark hair. It's
very chic. I would love to see her play with it more because she
has a beautiful face and great eyes. I'd like to see it shoulder
length with long layers on the top that angle to her cheekbones,
and long, wispy bangs.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``She's one of those girls who makes you think, 'What is she going
to do this time?' You can make her look like Liz Taylor _ all retro
movie star _ or very modern and cool.''
 &HT;    
 LUCY LIU  
 &HT;    She and her ``Ally McBeal'' officemates might have been slighted
by Emmy judges, but as one of the leading sleuths on the upcoming
``Charlie's Angels'' film, she continues to raise her style
profile. Teaming up with Donatella Versace for the Oscars and MTV
Movie Awards clinched her place among Tinseltown's most fabulously
dressed.
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``I love her character on ``Ally McBeal.'' I
would like to see her in a really sexy red (dress) that plays off
her hair _ like our resort 2001 couture fire silk, chiffon jersey
dress. (It) is fitted and very low cut and would look gorgeous on
her. I also have a deep red, boned leather dress that would be
great.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Her most memorable look this year was the red
Versace at the Oscars. I'd like to see her depart from that a bit.
I liked the dress, but I felt she might have been a little younger,
since her image is fun and hip.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``Lucy
needs to glam it up a bit without being over the top. I love her
long hair, but I would like to cut a half fringe on her to the
cheekbone and dress it off to the side and leave the back very
loose with slight waves to make is softer.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Lucy can pull off anything.
She shouldn't go safe in an `Emmy' dress ... maybe Gaultier or
Ungaro. I think Hollywood has a problem of gauging what's sexy and
sleazy. To me, sexy is drama, the low back or the way a train falls
to the bottom.''
 &HT;    _ VIVIENNE TAM: ``She has an amazing style and is not afraid to
be a little different. I would put her in something
glamorous...maybe my black-and-gold sunburst-beaded dress. It has
an unusual back treatment using gold chains. Lucy could carry it
off perfectly!''
 &HT;    
 KATIE HOLMES  
 &HT;    She's America's sweetheart as Joey Potter on ``Dawson's Creek.''
And designers, stylists _ just about everyone, really _ can't wait
to sex her up. At 5 feet 8 inches and sample size, the fashion
world is at her bidding. Katie, it's time to graduate to the big
leagues.
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ARLT, senior makeup artist, MAC Cosmetics: ``Katie's
Emmy look should be hot and glam, unlike her TV character. It would
be a nice change to see her in deep, shimmering eye shadows and a
soft, pinky lip gloss.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``Katie can definitely get away with
plunging necklines because she has a sweet look. It would be great
to see her in Yves Saint Laurent or Chloe. She would also look
great in Chanel. The juxtaposition of youth with such an
institution could really shake things up.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``It's time for her to dress
her age. She would be stunning in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. She'd be great
in Chloe, Alberta Ferretti and Michael Kors. She needs a designer
who can make her look more sophisticated. A bronzy brown with
shimmery gold makeup would be so beautiful.'' c.2000 Fairchild

 (One color slide is available.) 
 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS GOSSIP  
 &HT;    How do you say ``sweetie darling'' in French?
 &HT;    The world will know next year when ``Absolument Fabuleux,'' a
feature-length film based on the wacky British sitcom, is scheduled
to hit theatres in France.
 &HT;    The producer, Mosca Films, is still searching for its two
leading ladies _ the shrill, Lacroix-obsessed Edina and her blowsy,
drunken sidekick, Patsy _ but sources say Catherine Deneuve was
among the first to say ``non'' to the Patsy role.
 &HT;    Filming starts in January in Paris.
 &HT;    
 MOON WALK  
 &HT;    ``This movie isn't about cowboys, exactly,'' Clint Eastwood
explained on Aug. 1 at the Los Angeles premiere of his latest film,
``Space Cowboys.'' ``It's a tribute to the early guys, the pioneers
who sent rockets to the edge of outer space.''
 &HT;    ``We love cowboys for their boots and tight pants, and their
range-y, languorous, relaxed kind of air,'' said Barbara Babcock,
who plays Eastwood's wife. ``That's what Clint is like as a
director.''
 &HT;    ``He doesn't even say action,'' Marcia Gay Harden explained.
``Cowboys have that control and that stoicism. Women will always
find it attractive.''
 &HT;    The same seems true for men. All three of Eastwood's co-stars _
Tommy Lee Jones, James Garner and Donald Sutherland _ admitted that
it was admiration for Eastwood that drew them into the film.
 &HT;    ``I sent him a fan letter once,'' Sutherland said. Tommy Lee
Jones put it another way. ``I like the way he sees.''
 &HT;    On Aug. 2, Kevin Bacon corralled a big group to the Hollywood
premiere of ``Hollow Man.''
 &HT;    ``I've played a lot of men, but I've never played a monster,''
he said before the screening. ``That's an important part of being
an actor _ you can't be afraid of the monster in you.''
 &HT;    Bacon's wife, Kyra Sedgwick, described what it was like when the
monster came home.
 &HT;    ``I'd wake up every morning with black or green paint on me,''
she said.
 &HT;    For those on the set, however, the experience weighed more
heavily.
 &HT;    ``It's been such an ordeal, this movie,'' said director Paul
Verhoeven. ``It felt like a nightmare and I started to think I
would never get it.''
 &HT;    Josh Brolin assumed that that was the way Verhoeven wanted it.
 &HT;    ``Paul doesn't try to avoid a fuss,'' he said. ``He likes a fuss
_ for the best reasons.''
 &HT;    At the after-party, someone asked Elisabeth Shue if she believed
that there's a monster in everyone.
 &HT;    ``No,'' he replied, smiling. ``Just in men.''
 &HT;    
 THE VH1/VOGUE NOMINEES  
 &HT;    Get out your scorecards. The nominees have been chosen for the
2000 ``VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards,'' which will be presented live on
VH1 on Friday, Oct. 20, from the Theater at Madison Square Garden.
 &HT;    The nominees and winners are determined by a style council,
composed of fashion editors, journalists, curators, stylists,
designers, photographers and models.
 &HT;    Nominees include:
 &HT;    _ Celebrity Style, Female: Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Nicole
Kidman, Chlo&AMP;euml; Sevigny and Charlize Theron.
 &HT;    _ Celebrity Style, Male: George Clooney, Russell Crowe, Samuel
L. Jackson, Jude Law and Joaquin Phoenix.
 &HT;    _ Most Fashionable Artist, Female: Toni Braxton, Macy Gray,
Faith Hill, Janet Jackson and Jennifer Lopez.
 &HT;    _ Most Fashionable Artist, Male: Beck, Enrique Iglesias, Jon Bon
Jovi, Ricky Martin and Sting.
 &HT;    _ Most Stylish Band: Destiny's Child, No Doubt, Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Sugar Ray and TLC.
 &HT;    _ Avant-Garde Designer: Miguel Adrover, Hussein Chalayan,
Nicolas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga, Viktor &AMP; Rolf, and Junya
Watanabe.
 &HT;    _ Model of the Year: Gisele Bundchen, Carmen Kass, Angela
Lindvall, Frankie Rayder and Maggie Rizer.
 &HT;    The nominees for the categories ``Designer of the Year,'' ``Most

by visitors to vogue.com and vh1.com Web sites. Visitors will then
cast their online vote for the winners.
 &HT;    
 THE CONCORDE? I'LL PASS  
 &HT;    Karl Lagerfeld's taking the slow plane. In the wake of the
recent Concorde crash in Paris, the designer said his days of
supersonic travel are over.
 &HT;    ``They should give the remaining Concordes to space museums as a
perfect futuristic dream of the 20th century that could not make it
into the 21st century _ a century the Concorde was supposed to
represent,'' he said. ``If one of only 12 crashed, it's not that
safe.''
 &HT;    But the fashion world still has at least one loyalist: Anna
Wintour says she's sticking to her supersonic ways.

 By ERIC WILSON 
 (Three color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Quick, what's new in Bill Blass' showroom?
 &HT;    Answer: Lots _ if you take a close look.
 &HT;    There are the familiar, comforting sights of Blass' men's-wear
fabrics, the pinstripes, the double-face cashmere and the silk
satin dresses, but something is not quite the same there either.
The fabrics have been turned just slightly on the bias, and dresses
and jackets have been deconstructed, with bits cut out here and
there.
 &HT;    It's been over six months since Paris ready-to-wear designer
Steven Slowik was named design director of the Bill Blass
collection, following Blass' retirement last year, and his
influence is now being felt in the house.
 &HT;    ``This is just the beginning of what I wanted to show as a
visual vocabulary,'' said Slowik, who landed the Blass job over the
likes of Randolph Duke and Alber Elbaz in February and has since
set up residence in Greenwich Village to take on the job full time.
 &HT;    A Detroit-born and Parsons-trained designer, Slowik closed his
signature business in Paris, where he had also worked as rtw
designer for Ferragamo, before moving back to New York with the
mission to create a collection that retains Blass' stamp of
elegance while attracting the next generation of Park Avenue
clientele.
 &HT;    Earlier this summer, he hired Lars Nilsson, who was design
director of the women's collection at Ralph Lauren, as his senior
designer to help with design and construction.
 &HT;    ``There are various ways you can approach a situation like this
and I think this is the right one,'' Slowik said. ``I know you
can't please everyone. Some customers might walk in here and say,
'Ew. Ick.' Or they might say, 'Ooh. Fabulous.'''
 &HT;    Of the dozen or so pieces Slowik is showing for early spring
deliveries, which will appear in stores in late December, there are
daytime looks such as a gray pinstripe pantsuit, and silk satin
cocktail gowns that have detached, contrasting collars.
 &HT;    ``The first thing I looked at were the classic elements of Bill
Blass,'' he said. ``I literally interviewed Mr. Blass and discussed
what those elements are. Then I brought in what I felt is me, which
is the whole idea of lightening up the construction, bridging what
I call the tradition and the future, bringing in my color sense,
and moving further into spring with bold prints and interesting
combinations of fabrics.''
 &HT;    Slowik tore the classic pantsuit apart at the seams to come up
with an ultra-lightweight construction, so it wears like a sweater,
and he cut heathered cashmere pants with only an internal seam so
that it feels more like a skirt, which he paired with an oyster
walking coat, made in Blass' classic double-face wool crepe.
 &HT;    Little black dresses are cut in elliptical shapes with a sheer
T-shirt overlay, which Slowik described as creating a sense of
geometry combined with one of softness. The feeling is also
reflected in a black wool crepe halter dress with a broad silk
satin ribbon running straight down the front and back.
 &HT;    ``There's definitely an inspiration from nature in this
collection,'' Slowik said. ``This would come in all the red and
pink colors, which literally come from roses, and the way things
are unfolding at the collar and opening up to reveal another color.
 &HT;    ``In general, it was also very important, even in the garments
that were more masculine-looking, to have a more feminine
influence. The idea of the satin linings and the colors are very
feminine, which is a look I feel is going to be strong for this
season.''
 &HT;    Slowik's last signature collection had more technical fabrics
than his work for Blass, and was cut close to the body. Slowik's
new touches include side-button closures, the slight bias cut of
the satin dresses and surprise cutouts, in which ``things look like
they fell apart, but it's definitely very intentional,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``The clothes don't always shout,'' Slowik said. ``But I think
that's what this is about. There's a certain luxury and modernity
about clothes that look stylish in a more subtle way.''

 &HT;    Logoed looks have always been the bread and butter of streetwear
lines, and the recent mania for designer labels has certainly
boosted the appeal.
 &HT;    This time around, however, the signature designs are more
decorative than obvious, often showing up as a repeated all-over
print.

 By MARCY MEDINA, with contributions from ROSE APODACA JONES,
CASSANDRA NYE and LAUREN CRAIG  
 (Two color slides are available.) 
 From WWD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ With Emmy-nominated TV hits such as ``Sex and the
City'' and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' making Jimmy Choo and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
practically household names, the 52nd Annual Primetime Emmys are
poised to compete in that ``Style Superbowl'' that until now has
been dominated by the Oscars.
 &HT;    ``I think TV will give the Oscars fashion race a run for its
money,'' predicted Randolph Duke, who has dressed several of the
networks' leading ladies.
 &HT;    The nominees _ listed here _ are no strangers to the fashion
hoopla. Joining them here are actresses whom the Academy of
Television Arts and Sciences may have overlooked, but of whom
fashionistas can't get enough.
 &HT;    One thing is certain: If they don't look fabulous, it won't be
for lack of trying.
 &HT;    ``Given these women's status, they can afford the best,''
observed stylist Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig, who has worked with
Michelle Pfeiffer, Brooke Shields and Meg Ryan. ``They should all
take advantage of that access. If people don't want to deal with
the competition, have a dress custom made.''
 &HT;    So what should viewers expect on the big night? WWD surveyed the
experts _ the designers, stylists, magazine editors, hair stylists
and makeup artists _ about how the nominees and attendees should
look.
 &HT;    Many of those surveyed will also, inevitably, make their mark at
the broadcast Sept. 10.
 &HT;    
 SARAH JESSICA PARKER  
 &HT;    Everyone wants TV's ``It'' girl, as much for her willingness to
experiment with fashion on screen in her role as sex columnist
Carrie Bradshaw in ``Sex and the City'' _ which won her a
nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series _ as for
her experimentation with fashion offscreen.
 &HT;    Good thing she studied up on the collections as a front-row
guest at every key designer's show. She is the series co-producer,
you know.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Sarah in a hot skirt with fringe and beading paired with a brocade
bustier and Swarovski-crystal-embroidered sandals. Sarah is daring
and has a unique way of interpreting fashion. She is not afraid to
take chances and always looks great.''
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``She has a great, original
sense of style. She would look fab in a quirky, asymmetrical net
cocktail dress.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``My favorite. Please tangle me up
in that hair! I'd love to see her a redhead _ deep red _ very
steamy.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``You always run the risk of what I call the
`beauty pageant parade' of dresses with all these pretty things
coming down the carpet. You need those women who have great bodies
and sex appeal to pepper it up. Sarah Jessica Parker can do that.
She's one who could pull off a hot pant or bra under a sheer top.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID GARDNER, hairstylist, Profile agency (who will be
styling Parker's hair on Emmy night): ``Seeing as she wore her hair
straight for the MTV Movie Awards, I think she will go curly and
wild. I know it's what I would like to see.''
 &HT;    
 JENNIFER ANISTON  
 &HT;    This newlywed is certainly not going to throw a housecoat over
that sexy figure. Playing sweet Rachel may have scored her a nod
for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
``Friends,'' but she should take the high road to chic style.
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``With Brad Pitt in tow, it doesn't matter what
she wears. Jennifer will have everybody beat, hands down. The dress
I designed for her last year was a departure, which was nice
because you don't get that often. But since she tried it last year,
I think she will go more simple this year.''
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``Jennifer could be great in a dress that has a
touch of whimsy to it, not too serious, but still sophisticated.
She would be very beautiful in rich, strong turquoise or
aquamarine. Her body and skin are flawless, so she can wear
anything. I would like to keep her modern and very sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``On Emmy night, she's going to emanate what
she has for the past year, always classy and simply dressed. She
has a sex appeal that is uncoupled, and she and Brad are an
uncoupled couple. She won't change her look. It works for her.
She's with him, isn't she? Would you change your look?''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her curly, very natural
hair _ similar to Gisele Bundchen.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer (nominated along with Bob Mackie for
Outstanding Costumes for a Variety of Music Program for ``Cher:
Live in Concert''): ``Jennifer is fabulous. Ever since Brad,
whether he's the reason or not, she's had a six-pack stomach. I
love seeing her in hip-hugging skirts that accentuate her body. And
I don't think she is too skinny. I just think she's in great shape
for the first time in her life.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``Jennifer is beautiful in an approachable way. It would be odd to
see her completely painted. I'd like her tan and shimmering and
bronze. It's the look of somebody on holiday who threw on a gown.''
 &HT;    
 HEATHER LOCKLEAR  
 &HT;    This quintessential L.A. woman is now a New Yorker (``Spin
City'' tapes there) and a Seventh Avenue favorite. She has the
body, attitude and cult status that make her a dream for designers
such as Michael Kors and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
 &HT;    _ STEFANO DOLCE and DOMENICO GABBANA: ``We would like to see
Heather accentuate her great figure in a stretch chiffon dress with
a low neckline encrusted with floral beading and high-heel sandals.
Her hair and makeup (are) always perfect.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Urban sexy. Stay
with those above-the-knee hemlines.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``She should try some layers and a
shorter length ... to the chin. A not so `salon perfect' style
would be so refreshing. She would rock as a shiny brunette.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``The girl is up for anything. The
only thing that bothers me is she dresses a little too rock 'n'
roll sometimes. I'd probably glam her up a bit, maybe in Michael
Kors' gold matte top and skirt. There's also a great Vera Wang
short, one-shoulder dress that's gold on top and black on the
bottom. She can do metallics in an elegant way that shows off that
great figure.''
 &HT;    _ LAURENT D, hairstylist: ``I would give her a Farrah Fawcett
blow-dry.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``She's such a bombshell.
She's innately sexy. She could wear a housecoat and still be sexy.
With Heather, the key is reversing what we expect of her. Play down
the hair and makeup. No cleavage. She should just walk onto that
carpet and people should be saying she's stunning, not hot.''
 &HT;    
 HALLE BERRY  
 &HT;    OK, already, the world knows you've got the bod. Enough of the
cha-cha duds. She looked stunning in that white Valentino gown
peppered with red roses when she won a Golden Globe as Dorothy
Dandridge in the HBO production.
 &HT;    Primed to scoop a second trophy for the role as Outstanding Lead
Actress in a Miniseries or Movie, she would be wise to summon the
elegant heroine she portrayed.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, creative director of style, New York Times
Magazine: ``I would love to see Halle in something that's not a
bikini top, doesn't bare her midriff or have fringe. She'd look
great in a draped chiffon evening dress from Donna Karan's fall
2000 collection.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU, couturier and TV host: ``She's a dream. Lately,
some of her choices have been a little out-there. When you look
like she does, you don't need to display yourself like that. But
with a body like that, you can't go wrong. Good or bad, she's
taking those chances, and God bless her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, fashion director, InStyle: ``There's nothing
Halle Berry can't wear. The woman radiates great energy. There's a
very gamine quality about her, and yet she has a womanly figure.
Most fun for Halle would be Galliano's resort collection, wines and
mustards that are overtly sexy yet not cheap.''
 &HT;    _ PAMELA DENNIS: ``She always picks something beautiful and
of-the-moment. She's a chameleon. She can pull off a Madonna or an
Ashley Judd, going very couture or very hot and sexy.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``Serve up all
your gorgeousness and lusciousness. If you've got it, naked is
best.''
 &HT;    
 SELA WARD  
 &HT;    As InStyle's Hal Rubenstein noted, here's more proof that some
things in Hollywood can get better with age. Nominated for
Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for ``Once and Again''
(she already took home a statuette in that category in 1994 for
``Sisters''), Ward can pull off just about any look and designer.
Play up the drama, sister.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``Such a beauty. We would put
Sela in very classic, dramatic shapes, probably dark _ think John
Singer Sargent portraits.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Sela radiates beauty, even
when she's in shorts and a tank top. She's 40-something and proud
of it. I'd put her in something European. But I wouldn't rule
anything out because the Americans are now getting more edgy. She
absolutely should have something with a low back that trains behind
her.''
 &HT;    _ HAL RUBENSTEIN, InStyle: ``Sela Ward is just the most
smashing-looking lady, but she wears black an awful lot. If
anything, here is a woman who could wear those great jewel tones
for fall, like a carnelian gown by Richard Tyler, or the tremendous
gowns by Donna Karan. She would look spectacular in a diaphanous
dress with an uneven hem or a leather top with a full skirt.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``At
44, Sela looks fabulous! She should take advantage of what she's
got. Skintight Versace all the way. Clean and glamorous makeup and
her hair dressed down to say that she still has a casual attitude
about getting all glammed up.''
 &HT;    
 KIM CATTRALL  
 &HT;    Flaunt be thy middle name. The ``Sex and the City'' sexpot,
nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for
her role as Samantha, can work it to the hilt. She reminds
hairstylist Laurent D of a modern-day Marilyn Monroe. But that
blond bombshell never made fans blush. Just a reminder, Kim, the
Emmys aren't on cable.
 &HT;    _ ELIZABETH STEWART, New York Times Magazine: ``She has a slight
`cheese' factor and should just go with it. Wear an over-the-top
'80s look from Celine, Versace or Christian Dior.''
 &HT;    _ BRADLEY BAYOU: ``Kim has made some bad choices and good. She
knows she's sexy, but sometimes you can be a little more subtle.
Still, I love her because she has a sense of style all her own.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Kim has had a phenomenal year. She just gets
better and better. She's more beautiful now than she ever has been,
and success has treated her well. I think she will go simple and
maybe a little more couture in feeling than she has in the past.''
 &HT;    _ PATRICIA FIELD and REBECCA FIELD, stylists: ``We want her to
serve it up in the style of Samantha. We'd like her to go not as
Kim Cattrall, but fiercer _ more in character. She should arrive
like the 'A' star she's become. Joan Collins, move over.''
 &HT;    _ RICCI DE MARITNO, stylist, Cloutier agency: ``Kim is the
epitome of sexiness. No matter what you put her in, it takes on a
sexy energy. I would get really slinky and sexy and nod to retro
Hollywood. You glam up Kim, and she carries it off.''
 &HT;    _ MARK GARRISON, hairstylist: ``Her beauty slays me. I would
grow (the hair) length, shag the top and go less blond _ it's too
cliche. I would do a deeper base with golden honey highlights.''
 &HT;    
 DEBRA MESSING  
 &HT;    Fans can't get enough of her or her show, ``Will and Grace.''
Neither could the judges when they nominated her for Outstanding
Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. As Grace, she's incredibly
accessible. But with those emerald eyes and auburn hair, she should
opt for pared-down elegance, maybe something black, when she hits
the red carpet.
 &HT;    _ MARK BADGLEY and JAMES MISCHKA: ``With such classic features,
that gorgeous hair and perfect skin, we think Debra would look
beautiful in something dark _ even black _ in a revealing cut.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Debra. For her, I like
the look of curly locks coming down around that beautiful face.
It's a little bit undone, which is a very nice look.''
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ALT, senior makeup artist at MAC Cosmetics: ``We have
grown to love Deborah as a quirky, adorable Lucille Ball type, so
it would be fun to see her let go a bit and explore her sexy side.
Smoky, plum-colored eyes with a light, rich plum gloss on her lips
would look great.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``I adore her character, but she's
sometimes a little too elegant and could stand to be more funked
up. I could see what Galliano could do for her. She needs to be
more eclectic, not so gowny. It's high summer in L.A. so why not go
for something much more fun and interesting?''
 &HT;    
 LARA FLYNN BOYLE  
 &HT;    The Bedazzler studded Bob Seger T-shirt looked more MTV Music
Awards than Golden Globes, but leave it up to ``The Practice'' star
to shed her Armani district attorney duds for riskier statements by
rising designers. What will Jack Nicholson's cookie come up with
next? Note to her stylist: These are the Emmys.
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, celebrity stylist: ``She should wear
something that accentuates her, like a bias-cut dress. If thin
actors don't want to be on the cover of every magazine as the
``starved actors,'' then they need to go with something flowy.
Maybe Chanel or Ungaro or Alberta Ferretti. Something that isn't
going to show bones.''
 &HT;    _ DAVID CARDONA, designer: ``When I dress her, I tuck the fabric
right under the rear instead of dropping it off. That way, she
looks curvy and sexy. I'd like to see her in a strapless dress,
with a slightly fuller short skirt, very Audrey Hepburn. She wants
to portray the image of a true star, not someone who is trendy.''
 &HT;    _ FREDERIC FEKKAI, hairstylist: ``I love Lara's dark hair. It's
very chic. I would love to see her play with it more because she
has a beautiful face and great eyes. I'd like to see it shoulder
length with long layers on the top that angle to her cheekbones,
and long, wispy bangs.''
 &HT;    _ JEANINE LOBELL, Stila Cosmetics and veteran makeup artist:
``She's one of those girls who makes you think, 'What is she going
to do this time?' You can make her look like Liz Taylor _ all retro
movie star _ or very modern and cool.''
 &HT;    
 LUCY LIU  
 &HT;    She and her ``Ally McBeal'' officemates might have been slighted
by Emmy judges, but as one of the leading sleuths on the upcoming
``Charlie's Angels'' film, she continues to raise her style
profile. Teaming up with Donatella Versace for the Oscars and MTV
Movie Awards clinched her place among Tinseltown's most fabulously
dressed.
 &HT;    _ RICHARD TYLER: ``I love her character on ``Ally McBeal.'' I
would like to see her in a really sexy red (dress) that plays off
her hair _ like our resort 2001 couture fire silk, chiffon jersey
dress. (It) is fitted and very low cut and would look gorgeous on
her. I also have a deep red, boned leather dress that would be
great.''
 &HT;    _ RANDOLPH DUKE: ``Her most memorable look this year was the red
Versace at the Oscars. I'd like to see her depart from that a bit.
I liked the dress, but I felt she might have been a little younger,
since her image is fun and hip.''
 &HT;    _ ETIENNE TAENAKA, celebrity hairstylist, Vidal Sassoon: ``Lucy
needs to glam it up a bit without being over the top. I love her
long hair, but I would like to cut a half fringe on her to the
cheekbone and dress it off to the side and leave the back very
loose with slight waves to make is softer.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``Lucy can pull off anything.
She shouldn't go safe in an `Emmy' dress ... maybe Gaultier or
Ungaro. I think Hollywood has a problem of gauging what's sexy and
sleazy. To me, sexy is drama, the low back or the way a train falls
to the bottom.''
 &HT;    _ VIVIENNE TAM: ``She has an amazing style and is not afraid to
be a little different. I would put her in something
glamorous...maybe my black-and-gold sunburst-beaded dress. It has
an unusual back treatment using gold chains. Lucy could carry it
off perfectly!''
 &HT;    
 KATIE HOLMES  
 &HT;    She's America's sweetheart as Joey Potter on ``Dawson's Creek.''
And designers, stylists _ just about everyone, really _ can't wait
to sex her up. At 5 feet 8 inches and sample size, the fashion
world is at her bidding. Katie, it's time to graduate to the big
leagues.
 &HT;    _ GREGORY ARLT, senior makeup artist, MAC Cosmetics: ``Katie's
Emmy look should be hot and glam, unlike her TV character. It would
be a nice change to see her in deep, shimmering eye shadows and a
soft, pinky lip gloss.''
 &HT;    _ JEANNE YANG, stylist: ``Katie can definitely get away with
plunging necklines because she has a sweet look. It would be great
to see her in Yves Saint Laurent or Chloe. She would also look
great in Chanel. The juxtaposition of youth with such an
institution could really shake things up.''
 &HT;    _ RACHEL ZOE ROSENZWEIG, stylist: ``It's time for her to dress
her age. She would be stunning in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana. She'd be great
in Chloe, Alberta Ferretti and Michael Kors. She needs a designer
who can make her look more sophisticated. A bronzy brown with
shimmery gold makeup would be so beautiful.'' c.2000 Fairchild

STUPID THINGS THAT MOMMY DOES _ AND WHY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By CATHERINE NEWTON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many of the stupid things we do as parents, this one was
perhaps prompted by a bloody nose.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, it was the 6 a.m. kind that involves
one of the little loves of your life, screaming, sobbing and
scared, casting huge globs of red blood all about her new
butterfly-embroidered quilt, down the hardwood floors in the
hallway, across the new white rag rug sent by your sister _ (who
does not have kids but a dog) direct from Nantucket where she has
been spending three glorious comatose weeks worrying about nothing
except gourmet meals and how long it will take the sun to burn off
the morning fog _ and finally, to your own bed. Where small
droplets of blood soak into your white pillowcases.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it wasn't the bloody nose at all. Maybe you just did
this stupid thing because summer sluggery kept you from getting to
work before 10:30 a.m. for the past two weeks and you were starting
to get a little rattled. You cannot budge your sleepy son (though
secretly, not even admitting it to yourself, you may not have been
trying all that hard, thinking the guilty thought that if you
didn't have to work, the poor child could sleep late like all his
friends).
</P>
<P>
   You are stuck in slow motion, making sandwiches. It takes you 20
minutes to jog around the block and another 20 to water the lawn
and the shrubs and the plants you keep buying and that keep dying
on your sun-baked porch.
</P>
<P>
   That could do it. Being late can make you do stupid things.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was just that you were a little distracted. You just
realized that your summer sitter is leaving in three weeks for
college and you have done absolutely nothing to find an afterschool
caretaker for your sweet, sleepy, fluid-leaking babies. You hadn't
bought your daughter the white shoes she needs for the wedding
she'll be in in two weeks, and, come to think of it, you have yet
to get your shoes, too, and you were set on silver sandals, which
this season, seem hard to find, except of course for those Jimmy
Choo ones at Saks, which are still there, not in your closet,
because they cost $565.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the fact that you still had two presents to buy
_ one for a shower, one for the wedding _ and school clothes for
the new year, even though it seems like you just finished
outfitting everyone for camp with their Doc Martens, swimsuits and
Super Soakers. And, of course, toothbrushes, one of which your son
failed to find in his trunk for an entire week.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it was just distraction _ and stress.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of stress. After all, your kids got a new stepmom this
summer, the PTA president announced her imminent departure from the
public school you and a dwindling group of friends are being left
to defend in an increasingly Alamo-like situation and you've only
gotten one donation for the November fund-raiser, though you're in
charge of the live auction, and the only reason you found the time
to solicit that one contribution was because the donor was single
and fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   But really, all this was still no excuse. Just part of everyday
family life. It had more to do with karma.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it. For a month, you'd been sending bad energy into the
atmosphere with your dark thoughts about your friend's fiance, who
asked if he could store some stuff in your garage for a month and
then drove his truck right into the awning that hung over the side
door, effectively destroying it. For a month, you'd been wondering
to yourself, unkindly, how anyone could be so stupid to drive into
your house.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why you did it.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you backed your brand new car right into the side of
your house, causing $1,400 worth of damage to the car and knocking
out a chunk of Austin limestone in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not what you told the insurance adjuster the
next day at 8 a.m. when he asked you how this thing could have
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you said. It was a blind spot.

PUTTING GOOD TOMATOES TO GOOD USE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;    This is the first column by Eberhard Mueller, the executive chef
and an owner of Lutece, written with Jack Bishop. 
 By EBERHARD MUELLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most chefs wait for the morning produce delivery. I walk out the
back door of my farmhouse and pick my own. My wife and I own an
18-acre organic farm nestled amid the vineyards of the North Fork
of Long Island. We run a small business supplying organic produce
to restaurants, including mine.
</P>
<P>
   As a chef, my inspiration begins with these glorious, farm-fresh
fruits and vegetables. They are my passion. In the coming weeks,
I'll be creating dishes inspired by what is ripening and ready for
harvest. For instance, right now we are picking tomatoes _ vivid
red Costoluto Fiorentinos, Ruffled Yellows, Green Zebras and Purple
Cherokees. Their flavors are intense. In fact, these tomatoes are
so good that I don't eat tomatoes the rest of the year. The
rock-hard kind available in December just can't compare.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with such a bounty, so delicious on its own, most
cooks are content simply to slice ripe tomatoes and maybe dress
them with a little vinaigrette. While this is a fine use for summer
tomatoes, it's not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good reason to do a little more with this year's
tomatoes: Because of the lack of sunshine and the cool
temperatures, local tomatoes are definitely not so sweet as usual.
Summer heat translates into sugar development, and July simply
wasn't warm enough for tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But you can concentrate the flavor by cooking.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I like to slow-roast tomatoes in a 250-degree
oven: I peel, halve and seed the tomatoes, then season them with
garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper in a baking dish. After three or
four hours in the oven, the tomatoes ome tender, less watery and
incredibly sweet. I eat them as a snack or serve them with grilled
meats or fish.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use more heat and less time, make a tomato
gratin. But instead of masking that great tomato flavor with butter
and cheese, simply layer peeled and sliced tomatoes in a baking
dish with olive oil, garlic, thyme and sliced fresh bulb onions.
(These onions, recently dug, don't have papery skins and are
especially juicy and flavorful.) I like to spoon the juicy, almost
jellied tomatoes over bread for an easy appetizer or over a piece
of grilled fish for an instant sauce.
</P>
<P>
   You can pump up the tomato flavor without cooking, too. In my
tomato tartare, I peel, seed and dice a variety of tomatoes and put
them in a sieve to let the excess liquid drip away. I season the
drained tomatoes and serve them straight up in a martini glass. I
pour the liquid into small glasses and serve this sweet juice as a
sort of tomato chaser.
</P>
<P>
   The tartare may look like a salsa, but instead of the
in-your-face flavors of chilies and cilantro, I add celery and
chives. These subtle seasonings keep the focus squarely on the
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Most serious cooks overlook cherry tomatoes, which is a big
mistake. They, too, have a sweet, delicious flavor, and this year,
many of the ones I've grown are outshining their bigger neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse locally grown heirloom cherry tomatoes with the
tough specimens sold in supermarkets. The heirlooms have much
thinner skins and more acidity than bland commercial varieties.
</P>
<P>
   I also like cherry tomatoes because they hold their shape when
cooked. For instance, I make a quick sauce for sauteed striped bass
by deglazing the pan with sherry vinegar and then adding some
homemade basil oil. The tomatoes, which I halve or quarter for
easier eating, are then warmed in the sauce and spooned over the
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Although I like to use striped bass in this dish _ partly
because it's caught in the waters near our farm _ grouper or even
snapper could be handled in the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While the tomatoes are at their peak, be greedy. Have your fill
during the next month or two. Then wait, hard as it may be, until
tomato season rolls round again next year. It's worth it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAKING BASIL OIL WITH THE FLAVOR LEFT IN
</P>
<P>
   My method for making basil oil for tomato dishes is pretty
unconventional. Most chefs blanch the basil, rinse it under cold
water and then blend it with extra virgin olive oil. After letting
the basil and oil steep, they strain out the solids to obtain a
vibrant green oil.
</P>
<P>
   While the results on the plate are stunning, I find that this
method sacrifices flavor for color. Blanching and rinsing basil
washes away too much taste.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to warm olive oil and chopped basil in a saucepan,
heating the oil to just above body temperature, for just a few
minutes. Gentle heat speeds the transfer of flavor compounds from
the basil to the oil.
</P>
<P>
   I then take the pan off the heat, cover it and let the basil
steep for at least 20 minutes. When strained, the oil looks like
ordinary olive oil, but the flavor and aroma are almost
intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   When I have more time, I steep basil oil by the method used to
make sun tea. I place chopped basil and extra virgin olive oil in a
covered glass jar and let the mixture heat outside in the sun for a
few hours.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which method you try, the oil is best used the day it
is made.

PARIS' FAUCHON OPENS MARKET IN MANHATTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Fauchon, the legendary Parisian market, has made its
debut in New York. Its first American shop opened Monday at 442
Park Ave,, at 56th Street, in the Drake Swissotel.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the glass display cases, shelves and free-standing
consoles in the 3,600-square-foot store are stocked with pink and
gold packages of fancy jams, chocolates, crackers, mustards, oils,
vinegars, pickles, sauces and 109 kinds of tea. But there are no
cheeses for the biscuits, baguettes for the jam or fancy produce
for the oils and vinegars. These are not what Fauchon is planning
to sell here.
</P>
<P>
   The closest to substantial food in the New York store now are
three kinds of quiche: classic lorraine, Provencale, with tomatoes
and zucchini, and crab meat, all on excellent flaky pastry, priced
at $30 to $40 each, and also sold by the slice.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the shop will carry other Gallic specialties like
duck and goose foie gras, truffled, in terrines, glittering with
aspic or wrapped in pastry. Smoked salmon will be stocked, and so
will Iranian caviar, now that the United States government has
lifted the ban on it.
</P>
<P>
   Fauchon's chef de cuisine, Jean-Pierre Clement, is training the
American staff to make the prepared food. Another chef from France,
Xavier Mougica, will soon replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The candy counter is laden with chocolates, marrons glaces in
four flavors, pates de fruit and marzipan creations. The jewel-like
glace strawberries ($2 each) are not to be missed. Chocolate Eiffel
Towers are $5 each. The pastry department is limited to delicious
macaroons for the moment, and there are packaged cookies, and
gradually other pastries, ice creams and sorbets will be added.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Fauchon, which has 800 stores in 33 countries, this
long to open in the United States, because the company's emphasis
was placed on establishing franchises in Europe, Asia and the
Middle East. When Laurent Adamowicz bought the 114-year-old company
in 1998, he set his sights on the American market. The $3-million
New York store is company owned.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the tea salon at Fauchon will open, with a menu of
sandwiches and pastries. It will also serve a complete afternoon
tea for $28 and an all-chocolate menu for $30. It will be open like
the store, every day, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., except Thanksgiving,
Christmas and New Year's Day.

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS-$ADV20_ From the tropical coast to the Mayan
highlands, the fever for political change ?through ballots, not
bullets _ is sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20,
the state famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will
elect a new governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic
opposition victory in last month's presidential election, polls
show that change could be contagious: Even in Indian communities
once under tight control by the ruling party, posters for a Fox
ally are up on dirt-floor homes. An old man wearing a ruling party
shirt says he's not so sure he'll vote for that party now. Chiapans
appear to be slightly favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party
member who is now representing an alliance that includes Fox's
conservative National Action Party and the left-wing Democratic
Revolution Party. If Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the
Zapatistas rising in protest is eliminated. Mexico's ruling party
would be ousted from a state infamous for its ruling-party
corruption and grinding social inequality. A historic new
Fox-Salazar combination would be in place that could usher in new
negotiations with the rebels. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

`WAINEWRIGHT THE POISONER': GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER (PROBABLY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Griffiths Wainewright was a minor English painter of the
first half of the 19th century who was convicted of forgery and
transported to Australia, where he did hard labor for seven years.
He was an unusual criminal in that he knew people like Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, William Blake and Lord Byron, and when his term
of hard labor was finished, he gained recognition in Tasmania as a
portrait painter. He was called ``an insufferable fop'' by one
person who knew him, ``a daring and impudent braggart'' by another.
</P>
<P>
   Most important as background to Andrew Motion's unusual
biography of Wainewright, he probably murdered his uncle, his
mother-in-law and his sister-in-law, though he was never convicted
of those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Motion's ``Wainewright the Poisoner'' is an ambitious and
unusual undertaking, a scrupulously factual fiction that puts
Wainewright's story into an imagined confession. It is in this
sense an imagined biography that aims, by having Wainewright speak
for himself, at bringing us closer to the man than standard
biography would allow.
</P>
<P>
   Motion buttresses his approach with many pages of explanatory
notes providing the historical basis for every one of his
imaginative gestures. Helped along in this way by Motion, a
literary biographer who was named poet laureate of Britain in 1999,
Wainewright tell the ``truth'' of his life and his crimes even as
we understand that crucial elements in that ``truth'' are
self-serving falsehoods, or at least convenient omissions aimed at
restoring a tattered reputation.
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly an intriguing exercise, and it does succeed in
bringing the reader into the troubled mind of a figure who would
otherwise be known only through a few fragmentary historical
leftovers. We get a kind of insider's look into early-19th-century
dandyism, art criticism and Wordsworthian nature worship. Still,
one reads this book wondering why it isn't more gripping, more
narratively powerful, more redolent of the spice of human iniquity
or at least enlivened by more mordant wit. The explanation would
seem to be ``Wainewright's'' very stylistic and historical
plausibility and the scholarly care that Motion has taken undermine
the literary and psychodramatic potential of his story.
</P>
<P>
   The early chapters, in which Wainewright introduces us to his
tragedy and describes the world of writers and artists he inhabited
in the London of the first third of the century, have a kind of
pre-Victorian vaporousness that makes them slow going. (``But while
we are passing from moment to moment, we are tossed in the torrent
of a thousand accidents and chances.'') When he gets to the heart
of the story _ the strange deaths of his intimate relations _
Wainewright accounts for himself the way he might have had he
really written this probably dishonest confession.
</P>
<P>
   But if Wainewright was guilty of those poisonings, he isn't
going to let us into his malevolent heart; and if he isn't guilty,
his ``confession'' is false and not wittily false enough to give it
much more than an antiquarian interest.
</P>
<P>
   The critical episode in Wainewright's story has to do with the
death of Helen, the younger sister of his wife, Eliza. Eliza
herself _ first Wainewright's nurse, then his wife _ never comes
across in this confession as anything other than a stock character
described with an earnest sort of 19th-century boilerplate. (``The
nurse who had lifted me from the black waters of my unhappiness
with so sore a struggle had become the whole object of my wish to
please.'') Helen has even less of a profile here, and while this is
historically necessary, given the absence of information about her
very colorlessness, it undermines Motion's purpose in inventing
Wainewright's confession in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Helen bought several life insurance policies, making Eliza and
Wainewright (or Wainewright's creditors) her beneficiaries. The
idea, Wainewright says, was this: ``While Helen was still in
health, it had been my proposal that she, and I, and all of us,
would escape to the Continent, where eventually we would rescue our
fortunes by redeeming our policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen's death would be faked, and the insurance money collected.
But Helen dies a slow and painful death soon after the policies are
bought, a death medically similar to those of Wainewright's uncle
and mother-in-law not long before.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Helen, having witnessed these earlier deaths,
nonetheless agreed to give Wainewright a large financial stake in
her demise. But Motion's historical excavation prevents us from
delving speculatively into the relationship of Wainewright, Eliza
and Helen, even though that would seem to be at the savory crux of
the story.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wainewright moons with romantic-era heartfulness over
her death. (``Our one reality was the fair head of Helen upon the
pillow, her skin blanched to a deadly pallor, and her forehead
sprinkled with the beads of her distress.'') We are left to ponder
whether this mooning is fake or sincere. That is an interesting
question, but Motion's choice of approaches to Wainewright's life
doesn't shed much light on it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the second half of Wainewright's narrative recounts his
escape to France, his return to England, his trial for fraud (the
murder charges could not be proved) and his dispatch to Australia.
Again Motion provides an entirely plausible account, bolstered with
footnotes, and it becomes strangely more absorbing than the earlier
episodes. One senses that the Wainewright of these later pages,
having less to hide, becomes more open and straightforward. He
tells a story, about the killing of an albatross on board the ship
that took him to Australia, that strips away his usual veneer of
calculation and springs him into genuine passion, real feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Motion's notes on later opinions of Wainewright from the likes
of Edward Bulwar Lytton, a now forgotten writer, and Oscar Wilde,
provide an absorbing epilogue. We never know for sure whether
Wainewright was a poisoner, though the circumstantial evidence
strongly indicates he was. Certainly he was a colorfully dubious
figure, and we learn a great deal about him and his times from this
book, which reveals Wainewright and at the same time coats him with
a layer of prose thick enough to test the reader's patience.

   Words you don't want to hear upon your return home from the
Democratic National Convention here in L.A.: ``But, (insert title
here, i.e., Mom, Dad ...), you didn't bring anything back for me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, well, you could have my `Gore for President' button,''
you'll say. ``NO!'' will be the definitive answer. While you might
understand the possible value someday of such a collectible, your
kids will just see it as an ugly symbol of how you forgot about
them on your really long journey.
</P>
<P>
   To help you avoid this scenario, we gathered some L.A. souvenirs
that are cheap ($20 or less), packable and fun. And here's how to
find these gifts:
</P>
<P>
   1. Hollywood glitz and glamour: Go to CityWalk at Universal
Studios Hollywood. Stroll into the Studio store, a host of other
stores or check vendors carts for everything Hollywood. Try All
Star Collections for sports memorabilia. (Note: If your kid's a
professional football fan, L.A.'s not your town.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Funky and Fun: Hop in your car and head to Venice Beach or
the Santa Monica Pier for really offbeat stuff. Tie-dyed L.A.
T-shirts, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   3. We Love L.A.: No time to spare? Never fear. Los Angeles
International Airport is jammed with souvenir shops. Crews of
California stores offer a big selection, and they're located in
several terminals.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ Buffeted by storms, Russian rescuers
battled for a second day to reach 116 sailors trapped in a crippled
nuclear submarine on the sea floor, repeatedly trying to lower an
escape capsule to the stricken vessel. Efforts to rescue the Kursk,
lying motionless below the surface of the Barents Sea, were
hampered most of Tuesday by high winds and strong currents. There
had been no communication with the submarine since it went down,
and conditions inside were not known. It wasn't clear how much air
the crew had left and water appeared to be leaking in, officials
said. (Summary from wires) By Sabrina Tavernise and Christopher

   BRITAIN-CONCORDE (London) _ British Airways grounded its entire
fleet of Concorde supersonic airliners on Tuesday after French and
British investigators said they would urge the withdrawal of the
airplane's airworthiness certification following last month's fatal
Air France Concorde crash near Paris. It would be the first time in
more than 20 years that an airworthiness certificate for a
commercial airliner had been revoked by any country. The
investigators said they would not spell out their reasoning until
Wednesday, and so it was unclear what steps would have to be taken
to reverse the recommendation. By Alan Cowell.

   KOREA-REUNIONS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Under the watchful gaze of
North Korean minders here, 100 families separated for the last five
decades on Tuesday began the arduous process of rebuilding
relationships torn apart by war. Mothers embraced children long
given up for dead. Brothers and sisters struggled to identify
adults they knew until now only as children. Wives steeled
themselves to meet husbands long since wedded to other spouses, and
vice versa. And underlying all the carefully choreographed drama,
custom-made for tear-jerking footage and heartbreaking copy _
indeed, making it possible _ was the surprisingly sophisticated
political maneuvering of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. By

   MANCHEVSKI-FILM (Stavica, Macedonia) _ Hemmed in by Kosovo to
the north, Greece to the south, Albania to the west and Bulgaria to
the east, and lacking any outlet to the sea, Macedonia swelters in
the sun. It is late July, a few miles from the Greek border;
nothing moves; tobacco crops wilt in the fields. Behind a Byzantine
church, men, their shirts caked in blood, are draped on the bald
mountainside. Shots ring out. Milcho Manchevski, the Macedonian
director of the acclaimed, Oscar-nominated film, ``Before the
Rain,'' is at it again, putting the tortured history of his
homeland on the screen in his second film. By Joan Dupont.
</P>
<P>
   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-FILM (Undated) _ The whole world is watching!''
chanted during the Republican Convention this month. Many of them
had not yet been born in 1968, when that cry first sounded on the
streets of Chicago, as the police clubbed protesters in town for
the tumultuous Democratic convention. The scene was yet another
tribute to the enduring power of the '60s in the national
imagination. So is ``Steal This Movie,'' which opens Aug. 18,
Robert Greenwald's biographical movie about Abbie Hoffman,
charismatic exemplar of 60s cultural radicalism, a defendant in the
conspiracy trial of the Chicago Seven, the leaders of the Chicago
protest, and the author of ``Steal This Book,'' among other
provocations. By Ellen Willis.
</P>
<P>
   JANSSEN-FILM (Undated) _ Famke Janssen, like a rollercoaster,
tall and steeply curved, is having herself a thrill ride of a
summer. As Jean Grey, the telepathic, telekinetic protege of
Professor X, Ms. Janssen was part of the team that not only
arrested the vengeful Magneto's quest for world domination in
``X-Men'' but has also raked in a superheroic $144 million at the
box office in five weeks of release. Now, opening on August 25,
comes Valerie Breiman's romantic comedy ``Love and Sex,'' a crowd
pleaser at the last winter's Sundance Festival. By Jamie
Malanowski.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;

<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-BERKSHIRES (Lenox, Mass.) _ In ``Henry V,''
Shakespeare asked the patrons to use their imaginations and
``Suppose within the girdle of these walls/Are now confin'd two
mighty monarchies.'' Tina Packer, the ebullient director of
Shakespeare &AMP; Company, is making an equally audacious request of
her audiences here in Western Massachusetts: to envision an exact
replica of an Elizabethan playhouse nestled among the rolling
Berkshire hills at the company's new home. Soon, after its wrangles
over use of the nearby Edith Wharton estate _ Shakespeare &AMP; Company
will be ensconced on 63 acres in Lenox, near Tanglewood. Given
Packer's drive and the plans already in motion, a replica of the
Rose Theater, which once stood in London in Shakespeare's time, is
likely to be the core of what Packer hopes will be a major center
for Shakespearean performance, teaching and scholarship in this
country. By Iris Fanger.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OLDER-DANCERS (Undated) _ In recent years, Americans have become
more accepting of older dancers. Whether this attitude is a result
of aging baby-boomers or has been imposed by political correctness,
it is expanding the concept of dancing. The United States now has
several organizations that present performances by older dancers,
Dancers Over 40 _ the traditional retirement age _ and the 40Up
Project among them, or mingle the generations onstage, as does Liz
Lerman's Dance Exchange. By Harris Green.

   MUSEUMS-ON-WHEELS (Undated) _ Since it began 29 years ago,
Artrain USA, one of the oldest of an increasing number of museums
on wheels, has brought original artworks by Picasso and Warhol,
Calder and O'Keeffe, Norman Rockwell and Robert Rauschenberg, to
more than 600 towns and cities in 44 states. It has gone to big
cities like Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Washington, but more
often its destination isn't even a whistle stop anymore _ places
like Zeeland, Mich.; Plant City, Fla., and Parkers Prairie, Minn.
By Jonathan Mandell.
</P>
<P>
   OKAMOTO-ART-MUSEUM (Tokyo) _ On the Japanese art scene, the
baburu (economic bubble) burst long ago. Today, the friends and
contacts a Western visitor encounters here are sure to recollect,
with incredulity and undisguised embarrassment, the heady days of
the 1980s, when Japanese corporations spent tens of millions of
dollars on Impressionist paintings at overseas auctions, and when
new museums seemed to pop up every month. Nevertheless, against a
backdrop of lingering art-world doldrums, the Taro Okamoto Museum
opened late last year in Kawasaki, not far to the southwest of
central Tokyo. And with some 100,000 visitors already to its
credit, it has quickly become something of a hit. By Edward M.
Gomez.

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MORAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ What's an election year without a moral
panic? Popular music, and pop culture in general, are set up to be
prime targets this year, stuck in the crossfire of a battle for the
righteous high ground. Republicans and Democrats are both
positioning themselves as guardians of what George W. Bush, in his
speech accepting the Republican nomination, called ``essential
values.'' When the moral-panic soundbites start to fly, artistic
subtlety is the first casualty. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   MESSIAEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ This is very much Messiaen's year _
as most years now tend to be. Barely was there time to draw breath
after the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from
``St. Francois d'Assise'' than the Lincoln Center Festival offered
four big pieces in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly
spectacular recording of his greatest solo piano work, the ``Vingt
Regards sur l'Enfant-Jesus,'' played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard
(Teldec 26868-2). By Paul Griffiths.

   COFFER-PHOTOGRAPHY (Dundee, N.Y.) _ For the wet-plate and
tintype photographer John Coffer, it is as if the 19th century were
today and his contemporaries were not Cindy Sherman and Thomas
Struth but Mathew Brady, Timothy O'Sullivan and a host of itinerant
portrait makers who plied their trade until the dawn of the modern
era. Coffer has for more than 20 years been practicing one of the
earliest methods of photography and living the life that went with
it. He has crisscrossed the country by horse-drawn wagon in an
11,000-mile odyssey, making pictures. By Lyle Rexer.

CHUGGING JUICE CAN MEAN GUZZLING SUGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of being conditioned to choose fruit juice over
soda, most people may be surprised to hear that the majority of
fruit juice drinks are only marginally more nutritious than a soft
drink.
</P>
<P>
   Both provide calories from sugar and not much else. In fact,
even plain juices often have more calories than soft drinks. An
eight-ounce Coke has about 130; eight ounces of juice can range
from as few as 110 to as many as 210.
</P>
<P>
   At least when you choose a soft drink you are under no
illusions. You get calories (and caffeine) and that's all. But the
juice aisle in any store promises more. After all, juice is made
from fruit, which is inherently healthful. Some careful study of
the label is needed, though, to discover juices that are worth the
calories because they have some nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you have chosen wisely, fruit juices should not be
guzzled like bottled water. If you drink too much juice, there
isn't much room left in the calorie column for other foods that
will not only fill you up but also provide the nutrients you need.
Even though 16-ounce containers are supposed to contain two
servings, an awful lot of people drink the entire contents. So what
seems innocuous enough at 120 calories a serving becomes the
equivalent of a serving of a rich ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Juice was once for breakfast only, but now it has become an
anytime snack in myriad variations. Size creep is also rampant, and
15 ounces is considered a single serving of some products.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit at least contains some fiber, but it is usually lost when
the fruit is turned into juice. Fiber helps fill you up: Juice does
not, except momentarily. And juices always contain more calories
per ounce than fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue to how nutritious a juice may be is always the
name. If the words beverage, ``-ade,'' cocktail or drink are in the
name the product, is not 100-percent juice. But makers now sidestep
that reality by not calling their products anything. For example,
Mountain Sun has a drink called Cranberry Zip. One look at the
nutrition label and it's clear this drink makes no contribution to
the diet beyond the calories. No matter that the label touts the
absence of added sugar: ``The No-No's: No sugar, no corn syrup.''
Sugar is sugar whether it occurs naturally in the juice or is
added.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the government has required makers to list the
percentage of juice in the product on the label, but that's only
part of the story. The devil is in the details. It's not enough to
know how much of the product is juice; it's just as important to
know what kind of juice is it. All juices are not created equal. If
the first ingredient is apple, grape or pear juice, there is no
nutritional bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the label on Apple &AMP; Eve apple-grape juice says:
``100 percent juice. No sugar added.'' Perfect? Not quite. The
apple and grape juices have so little to recommend them
nutritionally that the company added enough ascorbic acid to
provide 100 percent of the daily requirements for vitamin C.
Otherwise what you have is 130 calories in an 8.45-ounce container
and 28 grams (or one ounce) of sugar from the juices themselves. No
other vitamins, no minerals.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago some companies began producing juices with more
nutrients and fiber, and Nantucket Nectars has added some of these
to its line. The company's Super Nectars Protein Smooth contains 80
percent juice. The first two ingredients are still water and grape
juice, but soy protein isolate has been added along with some fruit
purees and juice concentrates.
</P>
<P>
   One 15-ounce bottle is a single serving and provides 200 percent
of the daily needs for vitamin C, 6 percent of calcium, 12 percent
of iron, 4 grams of fiber, 13 grams of protein and a break-the-bank
410 calories. I guess you could call it a meal in a bottle. But
just a couple of these a day as a snack, and on a typical woman's
1,500-to-1,800-calorie diet, there won't be much room left for
food.
</P>
<P>
   The latest juices have been fortified with dietary supplements.
A handsomely shaped glass bottle of Fire, a product of Snapple,
contains ginseng, guarana and ginkgo biloba, suspended in 10
percent ``juice'' that is water, corn syrup, pear juice, citric
acid and dragon fruit (whatever that may be). Eight ounces has 120
calories. There's a zero beside all the other items on the
nutrition label. Assuming for the moment guarana, et al., are
useful, and that's an assumption that hasn't been proved
scientifically, there is still no indication of how much of these
supplements is provided.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the brand-new honey-flavored grapefruit juice by
Tropicana. Adding honey, which is just another form of sugar,
brings the calorie count of an eight-ounce serving up from 100
calories to 120 in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   It's a jungle out there. Maybe the best thing to do is cut
orange juice with seltzer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember spiked watermelon, that simple summer
cooler? You take a whole ripe watermelon, gouge a chunk out of the
rind and upend a bottle of ice-cold vodka into it until the melon
has absorbed all the liquor. Slice it and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Messy? Yes, and somewhat crude. But there's an immediate
invigorating power in the spiked watermelon's marriage of late
summer fruit and potent alcohol, not to mention a pleasant
conundrum: Is it a drink? Is it fresh fruit?
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least one Manhattan chef has taken the idea to another
level. Stephen Picker of Good, in Greenwich Village, is steeping
watermelon chunks in vodka, straining the infusion and serving it
chilled, neat, in a martini glass. It packs every last drop of a
spiked watermelon's unbuttoned essence into a sophisticated
cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   And watermelon vodka is just the beginning. All over New York,
chefs are bringing their expertise _ and some exotic ingredients _
to bear on the bar, funneling whole spices into bottles of rum,
tossing peaches into pitchers of sake, packing leafy sprigs of
summer herbs into tequila bottles, soaking sour cherries in
cachaca.
</P>
<P>
   What they are demonstrating is that infusing spirits is as easy
as punching a hole in a watermelon. Maybe even easier (uncap a
bottle, add flavorings, shake and steep). And it's almost as fast.
Most spirits will take on the flavor of anything added to the
bottle in as little as 24 hours. These infused spirits can be drunk
straight, or mixed into sprightly house cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Good's watermelon infusion takes on only the palest pink color
from the melon along with its cucumber-like flavor. It's mixed in a
house cocktail, with lemonade, bitters and Triple Sec, but the
easy-going flavor is most refreshing chilled on its own.
</P>
<P>
   On West 42nd Street, Kazuto Matsusaka, the chef of Above, steeps
fresh peaches, cantaloupe and raspberries in Kaori sake for two
days in the refrigerator. The sunny note of each fruit allows the
slightly grainy finish of the rice wine to show through. The
infused sake is served in a glass pots, with an ice well to keep it
cool. When decanted into tiny glass cups, the sakes look clear, but
each pot contains a small amount of fruit as a garnish. Above also
infuses vodka with ginger and hot peppers to serve alone or in
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   Roy's New York, in the financial district, makes infusions with
both vodka and cachaca, the South American sugar cane liquor.
Steeping cachaca for 24 hours with a pound and a half of pitted
sour cherries rounds out some of its rough edges. It is then used
with mint in a caipirinha, the sweet Brazilian cocktail. Vodka
infused with mild purple basil leaves lends a lilt to martinis
garnished with yellow heirloom tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Infusing spirits with herbs, fruit, nuts and grains is as old as
tea brewing. Scandinavians have been taming their fiery aquavit
with ingredients like caraway, lemon, aniseed and hyssop since at
least the 15th century. And throughout Europe, brandies have
traditionally been softened with infusions of fresh fruit to make
sweeter, softer drinks that evoke summer all winter long.
</P>
<P>
   The market for commercial flavored vodkas and spiced rums may be
partly responsible for the current interest in infusions. But
restaurateurs and bar managers are eager to put a personalized
stamp on their drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something different'' said Dan Perlman, the
beverage director at AZ, in the Flatiron district. In the
restaurant's first-floor lounge, three heavy glass kegs with
stainless-steel spigots loom above the bar. One is a tawny Chinese
five-spice rum, with cinnamon stick, cloves, Sichuan peppercorns,
star anise and fennel seeds floating in it. A dozen Meyer lemons
are curing in crystal clear vodka in another. And a third contains
a rusty-tinted Seville-orange tequila. They're dry, razor-sharp
infusions and will be served neat to anyone who asks. But the bar
prefers to mix each infusion into house drinks like the peppery
``dArk &AMP; Ztormy,'' a mix of the five-spice rum and ginger beer.
</P>
<P>
   At Dylan Prime in Tribeca, vodka is infused with with fresh
horseradish, celery seeds and whole black peppercorns. It is the
foundation of what the bar calls a bloodless Mary, served in a
martini glass garnished with a julienne of celery and rimmed with
celery salt. The first evocative whiff is followed by a rush of
sinus-clearing heat.
</P>
<P>
   A pint of boldly flavored fruit, like pineapple, raspberry,
strawberry or peach takes only a day to infuse a bottle of liquor
or sake. More subtle flavors, like celery seed, melon, basil or
blueberry, can take as long as two days. As a starting point,
figure on one tablespoon of a dried spice for a 750-milliliter
bottle of liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there are just a few guidelines. Don't sweeten an
infusion during the steeping; you can always add simple syrup to
the finished alcohol. And when making infusions with more than one
fruit or spice, you may want to steep the ingredients individually,
in smaller, separate bottles, and then blend them in varying
amounts to reach the perfect balance of flavors. It's your drink,
after all, so adjust it to suit your taste.

OPERA REVIEW: CLASSIC TALES REINTERPRETED IN SALZBURG 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALZBURG, Austria _ The Salzburg Festival has long adhered to
the historic idea of an arts festival as a place apart from the
workaday music world. Here artists collaborate in near-ideal
conditions, freed to an amazing degree from the scheduling and
budget constraints that during most regular seasons necessitate
cutting corners and adjusting expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one of the conditions affecting this summer's
festival is the political and cultural upheaval caused by the
ascension of the right-wing, vociferously nationalistic Freedom
Party, now part of Austria's governing coalition. Gerard Mortier,
who in eight years as the festival's innovative artistic director
turned this former bastion of traditionalism into a hotbed of
experimentation, has been appalled by the developments. For next
summer, his last, he promises to make the festival a virtual
celebration of multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, true to form, this summer's offerings, especially the
opera productions, have been stirring debate. One is a fascinating
new staging of Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride,'' heard on Saturday
night at the Residenzhof, a setting like no other.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer the festival's wizards of theater technology turn
the enormous open courtyard of this grand palace, once the
residence of Salzburg's ruling archbishops, into a makeshift opera
house with seating for 780. The stage and seats are placed atop a
steel-framed structure, like some huge Erector set, with a canvas
roof. Only here would patrons dressed in evening finery climb into
what is essentially the world's most lavish metal bleachers to
attend cutting-edge opera productions. It was an inspired site for
the German director Claus Guth's daring production of Gluck's great
opera epitomizing the classical ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, it's difficult for a production to convey the
essential prehistory of this mythological story. To assure success
in his war against Troy, Agamemnon, the Greek king, has sacrificed
his daughter, Iphigenie. But the goddess Diana has rescued her and
brought her to Tauris, where she lives under the rule of Thoas, the
Scythian king, and serves as a high priestess to Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Iphigenie's mother, Clytemnestra, has killed her husband in
grief over what she believes to be her daughter's death. And
Oreste, Iphigenie's younger brother, has killed his mother to
avenge his father.
</P>
<P>
   Guth conveys this horrific background story through enormous
masks that enclose the heads of a group of actors. Like eerie
oversize puppets, the actors appear at strategic moments as doubles
for the members of antiquity's most murderous dysfunctional family.
The puppet-actors trail the singers onstage like doppelgangers who
won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   It's an overtly dramatic and, no doubt for some, a heavy-handed
theatrical device. Masks of any kind can dominate a production. But
the three leading singers here, all Americans, hold their own: the
mezzo-soprano Susan Graham in a fearless performance of the title
role, the baritone Thomas Hampson in a riveting performance as
Oreste, and the tenor Paul Groves as Oreste's loving Greek friend
Pylade.
</P>
<P>
   The look of the production, with sets and costumes by Christian
Schmidt, is vaguely Victorian. The story takes place in a plush
salon with huge tilted walls covered in crimson velvet. Yet the
effect is timeless. The chorus of priestesses who serve Iphigenie
wear flesh-colored masks over their eyes and auburn wigs pulled
back in buns, so that they look eerily like their mistress. On
their dresses, they even have bloody stains above their hearts, as
she does, wounds of sisterly solidarity. Guth devised highly
stylized but compelling and lifelike movements for the priestesses
and for the male chorus of Thoas' soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The musical performance, with Ivor Bolton conducting the
Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, was inspired. The role of
Iphigenie is typically sung by a soprano, but Graham subtly altered
the rich mezzo-soprano colorings of her voice, bringing lightness
and clarity to her top range, yet singing with emotional abandon.
Hampson's singing was also viscerally intense, yet poignant and
elegant. Groves pushed his light tenor voice somewhat but still
delivered a vulnerable and impressive performance. The baritone
Philippe Rouillon was a menacing King Thoas.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the festival gave the creative team free rein. Of
course, having to work within limits can often compel artists to
clarify their ideas. In two current stagings of Mozart operas the
directors were allowed, it would seem, to indulge themselves.
Together these productions suggest that in Mozart's hometown,
directors are straining to keep his canonical works interesting,
even if gimmickry is the result.
</P>
<P>
   The director Luca Ronconi's production of ``Don Giovanni,''
heard on Sunday night at the Large Festival Hall, was generally
deemed a failure when introduced last year. It's a cumbersome
staging with a muddled conception vaguely suggesting 1930s Fascist
Italy, with the Don as a dissolute millionaire playboy who seems to
have a thing for leather outfits when he attempts rape. There is a
grimly serious side to ``Don Giovanni,'' but in this production,
with Margherita Palli's charcoal gray and monumentally ugly set,
the opera just seems depressing.
</P>
<P>
   This was sad, for the musical performance was marvelous. Valery
Gergiev conducted the Vienna Philharmonic with a keen ear for fresh
detail, a vivid sense of drama and some boldly magisterial tempos.
In the title role, the resonant bass Ferruccio Furlanetto led a
strong cast that included the powerful bass Rene Pape as,
surprisingly, a vocally agile Leporello; the exquisite soprano
Renee Fleming as a Donna Anna to cherish; and the luminous-voiced
soprano Marina Mescheriakova as Donna Elvira.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at the Small Festival Hall offered the
controversial new production of ``Cosi fan tutte'' by the director
Hans Neuenfels, with sets and costumes by Reinhard von der Thannen.
The staging is over the top and a mishmash of ideas, but at times
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   The two pairs of confused and inconstant lovers at the center of
this cynical comedy wear matching white jumpsuits, a device that
makes the partner-swapping and games of deception all the more
unsettling. There are unforgettable images, as in the garden scene,
in which the deceiving lovers court one another amid wildly
overgrown exotic flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But Neuenfels must not trust the opera, for he cannot leave the
music alone. Too many arias and ensembles are performed before
self-consciously symbolic and often pointless background action
from a roster of invented silent characters.
</P>
<P>
   The worst such intrusion involves a video projected on a large
screen during the scene in which the audience first meets the two
sisters of the story as they sing in blissful innocence about their
boyfriends. On screen a gorgeous young couple enact a modern-day
version of the Adam-and-Eve tale, complete with an apple riddled
with worms. Standing arm in arm before the screen, the radiant
soprano Karita Mattila as Fiordiligi and the dusky-toned
mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova sang the duet incomparably. But it
was hard not to fixate on this weird movie.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cast was excellent: the lyric tenor Rainer Trost as
Ferrando, the robust baritone Simon Keenlyside as Guglielmo, the
stentorian bass Franz Hawlata as Don Alfonso, and the bright-voiced
soprano Maria Bayo as Despina. The conductor Lothar Zagrosek's
gesticulating baton technique did not elicit the most consistently
incisive playing from the Vienna Philharmonic, but the sound, shape
and character of the music-making were wondrous.
</P>
<P>
   The singers were not just vocally strong, but attractive,
charismatic and good sports. Would that Neuenfels had simplified
his conception and removed the extraneous clutter, which must have
been terribly expensive. What he needed was something not known at
the Salzburg Festival, a tough-guy boss, like Joseph Volpe at the
Metropolitan Opera, to tell him no once in a while. &QL;

TECHNOLOGY PUTS TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK TO BUSINESS USE 
</HEADLINE>
   By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When he is planning his workweek, Jared L. Gurfein, a
Manhattan lawyer, arranges some of his most important conferences
not for an office or lunch appointment, but for bumper-to-bumper
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoons in the summer, the long, slow drive from
Manhattan to the Hamptons in his BMW 328i is reserved for business
calls ``that require real focus,'' said Gurfein, 30.
</P>
<P>
   While beach-bound traffic makes driving east on the Long Island
Expressway excruciatingly slow, negotiations via conference calls
with clients and other people zip right along. When it comes to
discussing a contract with the other side's lawyer, as long as the
task does not require extensive note-taking, there is no better
place than a good traffic jam for focusing the mind, or improving
conference-call performance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your quality of input is higher in the car, no question,'' he
said. ``If you're in the office or your apartment, there are at
least 15 things you could be doing, but in the car, there's nothing
else to do but focus on the call. Plus you're moving forward.
Mentally, it puts me in the zone, and I can really concentrate on
the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   With luxury cars offering increasing levels of comfort and
on-the-road activity options, like built-in computers with Internet
access, more drivers are adopting Gurfein's traffic-friendly
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Many say that they are not only less flustered by bad traffic,
but also learning how to benefit from it, taking care of business
on the road or occupying themselves with built-in CD players,
dashboard laptops, Palm Pilots and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is getting worse. There are more cars than ever on the
road, and traffic delays are growing. On Long Island, for example,
the state Department of Transportation estimates that more than
800,000 drivers travel to work by car during the morning rush, half
of them on the Long Island Expressway and the Southern State
Parkway. Also, the number of miles driven by Long Islanders has
doubled since the 1970s, according to the state.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers say that delays are still delays, no matter what
they are driving. But even many hard-core traffic-haters
acknowledge that jams are more tolerable in today's cars than in
those of yesteryear, in the era before cloth seats and automobile
air-conditioning were standard, when the only driving amenity was
AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic consultant in Manhattan, said that
drivers are becoming more impervious to traffic frustration
precisely because automobiles are equipped with more accessories
designed to distract passengers from the fact that they are, after
all, stuck in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are simply tolerating much more traffic than they used
to,'' he said. ``There's less road rage everywhere. In traffic that
would make me pull my hair out, I'm looking around and people are
placid.''
</P>
<P>
   Many transportation experts have long relied on an imprecise
traffic principle called the ``level of intolerability,'' which
essentially holds that when traffic gets too unbearable, a certain
number of frustrated drivers will give up and use mass transit,
preventing permanent gridlock. But this phenomenon has been
disrupted, Schwartz said, because people are tolerating traffic
better.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Pelinger has converted his sport utility vehicle into a
rolling office because ``when you're 12 miles from Manhattan and it
takes you an hour and a half to get there, you've got to find a way
to cope with that.'' He spends 10 minutes every morning in the
driveway of his home in Haworth, N.J., setting up a desk he
attaches to his dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   It holds his laptop, his Palm Pilot, his Global Positioning
System receiver and his three cell phones. To prepare for his
drive, he enters clients' numbers into the memory of one cell
phone, and prints out his business notes in large 16-point
typeface. Pelinger, whose company, Solar Systems, relocates
computer systems for businesses, spends several workdays a week on
the road visiting clients, and his monthly cell phone bills are
about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to hit traffic, so I've learned to take
advantage of it to make it work on my side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelinger is not alone, according to Richard Retting, a senior
transportation engineer for the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, in Arlington, Va. ``Commuter time is no longer just for
driving,'' he said. ``As the comforts of home and the efficiency of
the office creep into the automobile, it is becoming increasingly
attractive as a work space. People can use cell phones and e-mail
from their cars to take advantage of lost time in traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``As drivers are bombarded with distractions and
so many other things to do than just drive, you can expect more
crashes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the use of cell phones in cars has grown, so has
concern over its threat to driver safety. Many local governments,
like one in Marlboro, N.J., have passed laws banning phone use
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   But some drivers do not need the latest telecommuting
accessories to cope with traffic. Jerry Della Femina, the
advertising executive who owns the Della Femina restaurants in
Manhattan and East Hampton, calls traffic ``a state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina drives to the Hamptons from Manhattan on most
weekends, usually during peak traffic, he added proudly. ``It's an
occasion,'' he said. ``I actually look for traffic sometimes. I
make the most of those hours.''
</P>
<P>
   During the week, he records CDs of songs downloaded from the
Internet. He lights a cigar and hops into his Mercedes convertible
(or his Mercedes SUV if he is taking the family). Without traffic,
the 100-mile drive to East Hampton would take slightly more than
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to the point where traffic has become a forced leisure
time,'' he said. ``Of all the great things in life, to be in your
car with your family listening to music _ it's delicious. So what
if it takes four hours?''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it is not just the driver, but the car, that
makes a difference. Israel Joffe, 20, a student at Adelphi
University who lives in Lawrence on Long Island, said that when he
encountered traffic while driving his ``hunk of junk'' 1997 Saturn,
he became maniacal. But caught in the same traffic in his parents'
new Lexus, with its leather seats, dashboard computer and six-CD
changer, he was as docile as a lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between flying first class and coach,'' he
said. ``Would you rather be sitting in a nice SUV or some crummy
Joe Schmo car?''
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Larsen of Manhattan used to drive his rusty 1979 Ford
Maverick out to the Hamptons years ago, his leg cramped up from
operating the clutch. The car had sticky, cracked vinyl seats, a
squeaky eight-track tape player and no air-conditioning or power
steering. The engine overheated frequently.
</P>
<P>
   But for him, traffic lost much of its sting when SUVs came out.
At 4 p.m. on Fridays, he and his friends head out to East Hampton
in the roomy leather interior of his silver 1999 Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   He said he coped with the traffic by using his six-CD changer
and cell phone, and a laptop computer plugged into the dashboard.
Larsen, 28, a finance coordinator at an employment agency, said he
made dinner, movie and weekend reservations online from his Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   One feature he rarely uses on his Jeep is the four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really needs an SUV,'' he said. ``People get them for
the comfort zone. You're up higher, and it's a way to stay above it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those down below who do not have all the latest frills,
life on the road is not so rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hutton sat stuck in traffic last weekend on the Grand
Central Parkway in Queens. President Clinton was in town, and the
police had shut the Triborough Bridge, backing up traffic for
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the drivers around her were in late-model cars with the
windows shut and the air-conditioning blasting. Everyone, it
seemed, was chatting on a cell phone, unfazed by the afternoon heat
and the exhaust fumes. But with no working air-conditioner, she had
the windows of her 1986 Toyota Corolla rolled down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm a minute late, I lose a day's pay,'' yelled Hutton, who
drives a city bus in the Bronx and is sent home if she does not
arrive on time. She allows more than two hours for her drive from
Howard Beach to the bus depot, but even this is sometimes
insufficient in awful traffic. Then she looked around and said:
``No one cares. They're all on the phone.''

 &HT;    IT'S LIBERAL NIGHT IN L.A.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judging from their Tuesday convention lineup, Democrats are
taking a time out from the business of being, or looking, centrist.
Prime time at the Democratic National Convention is turned over to
some of the party's most liberal figures and constituencies:
Leaders of the Human Rights Campaign, which lobbies on gay and
lesbian issues, and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League speak, as do the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sen. Edward
Kennedy and two union chiefs. One of the distinctive features of
the Democratic convention is that a portion of the cherished
speaking slots is given to interest groups. Although no less
lobbied by ideological interest groups, Republicans kept them off
the stage at their Philadelphia convention.
</P>
<P>
   RIDING OFF INTO THE SUNSET
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday flew in to the blue-collar swing
district of Monroe, Mich., for a joint rally with Al Gore to pass a
metaphorical leadership baton before disappearing gracefully into
the background. It was billed as a symbolic moment: Clinton going
east, on his way to a vacation, and Gore going west, on his way to
the convention, where he will accept the party's presidential
nomination Thursday. Gore praised the president and appealed to
voters to elect him president to save the economic gains built up
while he and Clinton were in charge. ``Bill Clinton worked hard to
get the economy right. I'm not going to let the other side wreck
it,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   POINT WELL TAKEN
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Harold Ford Jr. was 4, he made his father's first
radio campaign ad. The ad: ``If you want better housing, better
jobs and lower cookie prices, go to the polls and vote for my daddy
for Congress.'' Ford, a 30-year-old second-generation congressman
from Tennessee and youngest member of Congress, will deliver a
keynote speech that will set the tone of the convention. Ford, the
first African-American to give a keynote at a convention since U.S.
Rep. Barbara Jordan in 1976, said he plans to talk about his
personal relationship with Al Gore and about the future. By
choosing Ford, Gore has named two leading critics of President
Clinton to play prominent roles in the convention. Like Gore
running mate Joe Lieberman, Ford denounced Clinton for his behavior
during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   THE MONEY MACHINE KEEPS MINTING
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush Bush-Dick Cheney ticket is matched against Gore
and Joe Lieberman, the margin was 49-43 percent. The poll of 1,227
registered voters has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   EASIER SAID THAN DONE
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast speech to Georgia's delegates, former President
Carter said Al Gore's ``biggest handicap'' will be President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and that Gore somehow
must distance himself from the ic Hall and include performances by
Jimmy Buffett, Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, Don Henley, Bette Midler, and
Jon Bon Jovi. The show

   ORLEANS -- Twenty years ago, J. Wayne Leonard's ambition was to
be nothing more than a number cruncher.
</P>
<P>
   When his boss at an Indiana utility asked about his career goal,
the young internal auditor said he dreamed, maybe, of becoming the
company's comptroller. But his boss told Leonard that he had the
brains and skills to be anything he wanted, even chief executive.
``Absolutely not'' was the response of a reluctant Leonard, who was
prone to low expectations for himself after growing up in a
working-class family in a small Indiana town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things where you didn't feel like you
were good enough,'' Leonard recalled in a recent interview. ``It
was probably from always having less than everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard seems to have everything now.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive officer of Entergy Corp., Louisiana's largest
company, Leonard in the past 20 months has orchestrated a dramatic
turnaround at the New Orleans power utility. He makes more than
$1.6 million a year. He has a posh office and lives in an exclusive
subdivision with his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes as planned, Leonard, 49, will become the head of
the nation's biggest electricity company in 15 months, when Entergy
expects to complete its merger with FPL Group Inc., the largest
power supplier in Florida, in a $13.9 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just the story of Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the latest chapter in Leonard's rapid rise to the top
ranks of his profession. Along the way, he seems to be rewriting
corporate America's values, relying on an extreme range of
personality traits to promote his vision of a better society and
business world.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches or interviews, he's a cheerleader one minute, a
comedian the next, then a motivational speaker, an economics
professor and a classical philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   At his annual employee meetings, which are famous in the
company, Leonard plays the casual master of ceremonies of a
multimedia presentation that draws on rock music, worker photos,
movie clips, classical literature and accounting sheets.
</P>
<P>
   On one such occasion, he delivered a detailed slide lecture on
the economics of merchant nuclear power plants, then reawakened the
audience with video footage from ``The Wizard of Oz'' to illustrate
an allegory about workplace stress.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has pursued a social agenda at Entergy that borders on
blasphemy in an industry that until recent years was characterized
by stodgy monopolies too preoccupied with the bottom line to care
about the living conditions of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   He has boosted corporate spending on programs to help many of
the poor communities that Entergy's four-state region includes. He
has called on the industry to accept higher standards for reducing
pollution from power plants. He has promised to fill senior
management positions with more women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Leonard ordered that a major hallway at the
Loyola Avenue headquarters be filled with photos of scenes of
poverty in the company's service area. Leonard wanted the pictures
as daily reminders to executives of the plight of many Entergy
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard often makes off-the-cuff comments that even surprise his
company speech writers and public relations specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after being named Entergy's chief executive officer in
November 1998, Leonard stunned observers when he used a
company-sponsored summit on the plight of low-income communities as
a bully pulpit to criticize past company policies and modern
American political culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we are demonizing the poor in the most shameless
way imaginable,'' he said. ``In many circles, poor people are being
made the scapegoats for societal problems they didn't cause and
cannot change. We have created a mean-spirited society where hate
crimes no longer seem outrageous, where talk-show hosts can achieve
fame and fortune by distorting the facts and fanning the flames of
hatred for the defenseless, the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this corporate maverick must execute the greatest utility
merger in U.S. history and set a course for the new superutility.
The decisions he makes over the coming months will lay the
foundation for the legacy he will leave when he reaches his target
retirement age in about eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard admits that the task of selling the merger to Wall
Street and a host of federal and state utility regulators will be
difficult. But the former college cross-country runner says he is
ready to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was meant to be a struggle,'' said Leonard during an
interview at Entergy headquarters. As usual, he was wearing a pair
of slacks and a V-neck gray pullover rather than the traditional
starched white shirt, tie and dark suit of corporate America. A
pair of gold-rimmed glasses framed his narrow face and
salt-and-pepper hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man was basically meant to be a warrior,'' he said. ``That's
the great thing about life. That's what makes it fun. Coming out on
the other side is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken, brainy Entergy chief executive seems a world
away from Greenfield, Ind., a town of 10,000 about 15 miles east of
Indianapolis. He and his four brothers and sisters were raised by
their father, a high-school English teacher, and mother, a
homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   His track career had innocent roots in junior high school. He
couldn't afford to eat lunch in the public school cafeteria like
most other pupils, so every day he would run a mile home, eat and
run a mile back to school all inside the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   The running paid off. Leonard went to college on a cross-country
track scholarship and earned extra money working as a janitor in a
girls' dormitory. He graduated at the top of his accounting class
at Ball State University in 1973 and later earned a master's degree
in business administration from Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined PSI Resources in Indianapolis even though the position
paid less than offers he received from Chicago accounting firms.
The job with the local public power monopoly gave him something
more important than a fatter pay check. It offered the stability
and security he craved, something that had eluded his father, who
moonlighted on menial jobs to provide a meager life for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was right. He spent 25 years at PSI, which became
Cinergy Corp. after a merger with Cincinnati Gas &AMP; Electric in the
early 1990s, rising from an entry-level accounting post to chief
financial officer before leaving the company in April 1998 to
become president of Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the local company's top spot a few months later
after longtime utility head Edwin Lupberger was forced to resign in
the wake of falling profits from troubled overseas investments,
growing power outages among the company's utilities and a sinking
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's upbringing is an integral part of his professional
life, providing the framework for the values that have shaped him
as an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me the value of hard work and that character is
not what you do but how you do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He learned another important lesson later from his boss Al
Barker, the former chief executive of PSI who told Leonard in the
early 1980s that he was destined to lead a power company, whether
he accepted that fate or not.
</P>
<P>
   At Barker's urging, Leonard accepted a special position in which
he spent two years learning the real business of power utilities by
working in the field with line crews, customer service agents,
engineers and power plant operators. Barker, who talked about
Leonard's career move last week during a phone interview, knew the
experience would one day make Leonard a utility chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   If the push had come from anyone else, Leonard probably would
have resisted. But Barker was Leonard's foremost mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had observed how Barker saved PSI from bankruptcy in the
1980s after the company abandoned construction of a financially
failed nuclear plant. Barker, who took much of the blame for the
boondoggle, was severely castigated by company critics and
eventually forced to step down. Throughout the turmoil, Leonard
said, Barker kept his integrity and never turned against those who
brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no regrets because he never made a decision that, as
far as I was aware of, was based on anything other than what he
thought was the right thing to do,'' Leonard said. ``He was a
person who was totally comfortable with his own life. He was
perfectly happy that he had done the right thing at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had little room for error when he took over the reins of
Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were angry over years of declining service and
increasing power outages. Investors were disappointed with sinking
profits. Regulators were punishing the company's utilities for poor
reliability. Management ranks were in chaos, and employee morale
was at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Entergy's other new leaders launched a strategy that
refocused the company on its core power generation and nuclear
power plant businesses while selling off billions of dollars in
less essential subsidiaries, such as a home-security business and
overseas utilities as far away as Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also reduced power outages by boosting maintenance
spending on the company's transmission system and improved customer
service by opening new neighborhood customer centers and upgrading
training for customer service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has won wide praise from Wall Street, regulators
and even some of the company's harshest consumer advocate critics.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard made the announcement of the Entergy-FPL merger, he
had his work cut out for him. Announcing a merger is only the first
of many steps to making the deal happen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by federal and local regulators, a
step that can't be taken for granted because utility commissions in
other regions have been known to scuttle utility mergers in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also faces adversity on the local level, where the news
stunned the New Orleans business and political community. Though
New Orleans would be the operational center for the new company's
utilities group, the city will lose the corporate headquarters,
which will go to FPL's home in Juno Beach, Fla. Leonard will move
with the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the city's only Fortune 500 headquarters would be
especially painful following thousands of white-collar job cuts in
the oil industry and the takeover of several other locally based
companies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are hoping to milk as much as $275 million a year
in savings from the merger, mainly by eliminating redundant jobs at
both companies. The cuts likely will cost New Orleans jobs, but it
is unclear how deep those cuts will be.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard defended the job impact and the headquarters move by
arguing that this deal leads to a much better outcome than if
Entergy ``sat on its hands'' and got taken over by a job-slashing
company less sympathetic to New Orleans. The merged company would
be less vulnerable, Leonard said, which would serve New Orleans in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get bigger or you get swallowed up. This prevents the
horror of that,'' Leonard said the day of the announcement.
``Employees had a hell of a lot more to worry about a week ago than
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Leonard campaigned last week in New York and Boston for his
deal, Wall Street analysts and utility regulators predicted the
merger will win approval from shareholders and federal and local
agencies. By Friday, Entergy's stock price had recouped its losses.
(SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   His mentor, Barker, now 74 and 12 years into retirement, said
Leonard's latest career turn is simply part of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all,'' Barker said. ``Not only is Wayne
extremely intelligent, but he has something else to go along with
it. I call it wisdom. I think he shares my philosophy that real
success is producing someone who is better than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Leonard pull off the Entergy-FPL merger?
</P>
<P>
   ``My bets would be unhedged on Wayne's ability to succeed,''
Barker said.

   ORLEANS -- Twenty years ago, J. Wayne Leonard's ambition was to
be nothing more than a number cruncher.
</P>
<P>
   When his boss at an Indiana utility asked about his career goal,
the young internal auditor said he dreamed, maybe, of becoming the
company's comptroller. But his boss told Leonard that he had the
brains and skills to be anything he wanted, even chief executive.
``Absolutely not'' was the response of a reluctant Leonard, who was
prone to low expectations for himself after growing up in a
working-class family in a small Indiana town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those things where you didn't feel like you
were good enough,'' Leonard recalled in a recent interview. ``It
was probably from always having less than everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard seems to have everything now.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive officer of Entergy Corp., Louisiana's largest
company, Leonard in the past 20 months has orchestrated a dramatic
turnaround at the New Orleans power utility. He makes more than
$1.6 million a year. He has a posh office and lives in an exclusive
subdivision with his wife and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   And if all goes as planned, Leonard, 49, will become the head of
the nation's biggest electricity company in 15 months, when Entergy
expects to complete its merger with FPL Group Inc., the largest
power supplier in Florida, in a $13.9 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just the story of Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the latest chapter in Leonard's rapid rise to the top
ranks of his profession. Along the way, he seems to be rewriting
corporate America's values, relying on an extreme range of
personality traits to promote his vision of a better society and
business world.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches or interviews, he's a cheerleader one minute, a
comedian the next, then a motivational speaker, an economics
professor and a classical philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   At his annual employee meetings, which are famous in the
company, Leonard plays the casual master of ceremonies of a
multimedia presentation that draws on rock music, worker photos,
movie clips, classical literature and accounting sheets.
</P>
<P>
   On one such occasion, he delivered a detailed slide lecture on
the economics of merchant nuclear power plants, then reawakened the
audience with video footage from ``The Wizard of Oz'' to illustrate
an allegory about workplace stress.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has pursued a social agenda at Entergy that borders on
blasphemy in an industry that until recent years was characterized
by stodgy monopolies too preoccupied with the bottom line to care
about the living conditions of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   He has boosted corporate spending on programs to help many of
the poor communities that Entergy's four-state region includes. He
has called on the industry to accept higher standards for reducing
pollution from power plants. He has promised to fill senior
management positions with more women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Leonard ordered that a major hallway at the
Loyola Avenue headquarters be filled with photos of scenes of
poverty in the company's service area. Leonard wanted the pictures
as daily reminders to executives of the plight of many Entergy
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard often makes off-the-cuff comments that even surprise his
company speech writers and public relations specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after being named Entergy's chief executive officer in
November 1998, Leonard stunned observers when he used a
company-sponsored summit on the plight of low-income communities as
a bully pulpit to criticize past company policies and modern
American political culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society, we are demonizing the poor in the most shameless
way imaginable,'' he said. ``In many circles, poor people are being
made the scapegoats for societal problems they didn't cause and
cannot change. We have created a mean-spirited society where hate
crimes no longer seem outrageous, where talk-show hosts can achieve
fame and fortune by distorting the facts and fanning the flames of
hatred for the defenseless, the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this corporate maverick must execute the greatest utility
merger in U.S. history and set a course for the new superutility.
The decisions he makes over the coming months will lay the
foundation for the legacy he will leave when he reaches his target
retirement age in about eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard admits that the task of selling the merger to Wall
Street and a host of federal and state utility regulators will be
difficult. But the former college cross-country runner says he is
ready to go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was meant to be a struggle,'' said Leonard during an
interview at Entergy headquarters. As usual, he was wearing a pair
of slacks and a V-neck gray pullover rather than the traditional
starched white shirt, tie and dark suit of corporate America. A
pair of gold-rimmed glasses framed his narrow face and
salt-and-pepper hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man was basically meant to be a warrior,'' he said. ``That's
the great thing about life. That's what makes it fun. Coming out on
the other side is what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken, brainy Entergy chief executive seems a world
away from Greenfield, Ind., a town of 10,000 about 15 miles east of
Indianapolis. He and his four brothers and sisters were raised by
their father, a high-school English teacher, and mother, a
homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   His track career had innocent roots in junior high school. He
couldn't afford to eat lunch in the public school cafeteria like
most other pupils, so every day he would run a mile home, eat and
run a mile back to school all inside the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   The running paid off. Leonard went to college on a cross-country
track scholarship and earned extra money working as a janitor in a
girls' dormitory. He graduated at the top of his accounting class
at Ball State University in 1973 and later earned a master's degree
in business administration from Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   He joined PSI Resources in Indianapolis even though the position
paid less than offers he received from Chicago accounting firms.
The job with the local public power monopoly gave him something
more important than a fatter pay check. It offered the stability
and security he craved, something that had eluded his father, who
moonlighted on menial jobs to provide a meager life for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was right. He spent 25 years at PSI, which became
Cinergy Corp. after a merger with Cincinnati Gas &AMP; Electric in the
early 1990s, rising from an entry-level accounting post to chief
financial officer before leaving the company in April 1998 to
become president of Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the local company's top spot a few months later
after longtime utility head Edwin Lupberger was forced to resign in
the wake of falling profits from troubled overseas investments,
growing power outages among the company's utilities and a sinking
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's upbringing is an integral part of his professional
life, providing the framework for the values that have shaped him
as an executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me the value of hard work and that character is
not what you do but how you do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He learned another important lesson later from his boss Al
Barker, the former chief executive of PSI who told Leonard in the
early 1980s that he was destined to lead a power company, whether
he accepted that fate or not.
</P>
<P>
   At Barker's urging, Leonard accepted a special position in which
he spent two years learning the real business of power utilities by
working in the field with line crews, customer service agents,
engineers and power plant operators. Barker, who talked about
Leonard's career move last week during a phone interview, knew the
experience would one day make Leonard a utility chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   If the push had come from anyone else, Leonard probably would
have resisted. But Barker was Leonard's foremost mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had observed how Barker saved PSI from bankruptcy in the
1980s after the company abandoned construction of a financially
failed nuclear plant. Barker, who took much of the blame for the
boondoggle, was severely castigated by company critics and
eventually forced to step down. Throughout the turmoil, Leonard
said, Barker kept his integrity and never turned against those who
brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no regrets because he never made a decision that, as
far as I was aware of, was based on anything other than what he
thought was the right thing to do,'' Leonard said. ``He was a
person who was totally comfortable with his own life. He was
perfectly happy that he had done the right thing at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard had little room for error when he took over the reins of
Entergy.
</P>
<P>
   Customers were angry over years of declining service and
increasing power outages. Investors were disappointed with sinking
profits. Regulators were punishing the company's utilities for poor
reliability. Management ranks were in chaos, and employee morale
was at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard and Entergy's other new leaders launched a strategy that
refocused the company on its core power generation and nuclear
power plant businesses while selling off billions of dollars in
less essential subsidiaries, such as a home-security business and
overseas utilities as far away as Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also reduced power outages by boosting maintenance
spending on the company's transmission system and improved customer
service by opening new neighborhood customer centers and upgrading
training for customer service personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has won wide praise from Wall Street, regulators
and even some of the company's harshest consumer advocate critics.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard made the announcement of the Entergy-FPL merger, he
had his work cut out for him. Announcing a merger is only the first
of many steps to making the deal happen.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be approved by federal and local regulators, a
step that can't be taken for granted because utility commissions in
other regions have been known to scuttle utility mergers in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also faces adversity on the local level, where the news
stunned the New Orleans business and political community. Though
New Orleans would be the operational center for the new company's
utilities group, the city will lose the corporate headquarters,
which will go to FPL's home in Juno Beach, Fla. Leonard will move
with the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the city's only Fortune 500 headquarters would be
especially painful following thousands of white-collar job cuts in
the oil industry and the takeover of several other locally based
companies in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are hoping to milk as much as $275 million a year
in savings from the merger, mainly by eliminating redundant jobs at
both companies. The cuts likely will cost New Orleans jobs, but it
is unclear how deep those cuts will be.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard defended the job impact and the headquarters move by
arguing that this deal leads to a much better outcome than if
Entergy ``sat on its hands'' and got taken over by a job-slashing
company less sympathetic to New Orleans. The merged company would
be less vulnerable, Leonard said, which would serve New Orleans in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get bigger or you get swallowed up. This prevents the
horror of that,'' Leonard said the day of the announcement.
``Employees had a hell of a lot more to worry about a week ago than
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Leonard campaigned last week in New York and Boston for his
deal, Wall Street analysts and utility regulators predicted the
merger will win approval from shareholders and federal and local
agencies. By Friday, Entergy's stock price had recouped its losses.
(SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   His mentor, Barker, now 74 and 12 years into retirement, said
Leonard's latest career turn is simply part of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all,'' Barker said. ``Not only is Wayne
extremely intelligent, but he has something else to go along with
it. I call it wisdom. I think he shares my philosophy that real
success is producing someone who is better than you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Leonard pull off the Entergy-FPL merger?
</P>
<P>
   ``My bets would be unhedged on Wayne's ability to succeed,''
Barker said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Under the watchful gaze of North Korean
minders here, 100 families separated for the last five decades
began on Tuesday the arduous process of rebuilding relationships
torn apart by war.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers embraced children long given up for dead. Brothers and
sisters struggled to identify adults they knew until now only as
children. Wives steeled themselves to meet husbands long since
wedded to other spouses, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   And underlying all the carefully choreographed drama,
custom-made for tear-jerking footage and heartbreaking copy _
indeed, making it possible _ was the surprisingly sophisticated
political maneuvering of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. Kim,
known as dear leader to his people, until recently was regarded by
the outside world as a reclusive, dictatorial oddity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much for being alive!'' 87-year-old Hong
Ghil-soon exclaimed as she embraced her daughter, Kim Ok Bae, who
arrived Tuesday morning on the first North Korean plane to land on
South Korean soil since 1950. ``Thank the dear leader for taking
such good care of you!''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a South Korean mother whose daughter was effectively
kidnapped by North Korean troops during the war heaping praise upon
the man whose father, Kim Il Sung, had led those troops and founded
the totalitarian state that split her family apart.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that brought the 100 people south carried another 100
people north on its return trip for similar reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in these reunions clearly did not care that
they have become political pawns. They are simply happy to be
families once again.
</P>
<P>
   The vast convention hall where the meetings took place Tuesday
reverberated with shouts of joy and peals of happy laughter _ not
to mention a fair amount of relieved sobbing, as families solved
long-standing mysteries and confirmed or discarded long-held
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades, Moon Kyung-ja has wondered what happened to
her mother, who was thrown in jail for aiding the North Korean army
during the war that divided the Korean peninsula _ and who was
never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday she got her answer from her eldest sister, Moon Yang
Ok, whom she had not seen since the war and had at times presumed
dead. Their mother had not died in jail, as Moon Kyung-ja had
feared, but instead had escaped and walked to safety in North Korea
with her two oldest daughters and baby son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother passed away without fulfilling her dream of seeing
you,'' Moon Yang Ok told her sister while stroking her face. ``But
your brother and sister are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, they are alive!'' Moon Kyung-ja shouted, throwing
her hands in the air. ``My family is alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister hugged her hard. ``Let me see you, let me see your
face,'' she said. ``I have learned how long a day is, waiting this
last week to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunions Tuesday are the first in what South Korean
officials hope will be a series of three family gatherings this
year. Kim Jong Il, who met with South Korean news media executives
last week, told them that he intends to arrange two more reunions,
in September and October. Southern officials say the planning for
those gatherings is already underway.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are part of a strategy, mapped out by Kim Jong Il
and the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, in their historic
meeting in June, to begin the process of reunifying the two
countries by breaking down the barriers that divide their people.
Already, North Korea has agreed to re-establish rail lines between
the two countries, and last week it signed an agreement with one of
South Korea's biggest conglomerates to develop a permanent meeting
place for separated families, at Kaesong.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has even said that he would like to find a way to
allow visiting relatives to stay in each other's homes, rather than
meeting in convention centers and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are high that these are the first steps toward a more
sweeping rapprochement, including greater economic cooperation and
decreased military tension between the two countries, which are
technically still at war.
</P>
<P>
   But how far the current thaw will go remains to be seen. North
Korea was careful to arrange an insurance policy against
defections, making sure that the South Koreans who have gone north
will not leave until all of the North Korean family members are
home.
</P>
<P>
   And a South Korean official said Tuesday that this country fully
expects to pay the impoverished North for these reunions. Already,
the South Korean government has given each family $500 to give to
its visiting relatives from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans who arrived here Tuesday all appear to be
members of the country's elite: professors, doctors, artists and
the like. During interviews, a few referred to the fact that they
were ``chosen by the dear leader'' to make the trip, suggesting
that they have ties to the North Korean political hierarchy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They were in high spirits, waving and clapping as they left the
plane, and seemed more affluent than their South Korean relatives
had expected. Many South Koreans had purchased watches to give
their northern relatives, but many of the visitors arrived wearing
nice watches. Two or three of the seven North Korean women wore
exquisite _ and expensive _ han dok, the traditional Korean dress.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of the delegation's spit-and-polish seemed a
bit contrived. Several of the men seemed to be wearing identical
suits and identical ties, and none of them carried any hand
luggage, in stark contrast to the South Koreans who went north
practically staggering under tote bags jammed with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about what the visitors from the North thought of
Seoul were ignored or brushed aside, and the visitors took every
opportunity to praise the dear leader and the great leader, as Kim
Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, was known.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Yang Ok proudly showed her sister a handsome watch with
``Kim Il Sung'' written in elegant red calligraphy across its light
silver face. ``I received this as an award for my academic
achievements from the great leader,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches medicine, as does their younger brother, who was 2
years old when they fled for the North. ``Thanks to our great
leader, we have become medical professionals, and my younger
brother is the leading academic at the Hamheung University School
of Medicine,'' she said. ``There aren't many people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother had invented a machine to treat arterial
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   But others were more unsettled by the attention they received
Tuesday. ``My sister seems really nervous,'' said Kim Suk-bae,
whose sister, Kim Ok Bae, arrived in Seoul Tuesday. ``Whenever the
men from the other side come by, the ones with badges, she keeps
praising the dear leader and tells us to do the same. We feel like
we have to play along because if we don't, something bad might
happen to her when she returns to her home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ok Bae turned her head away whenever she was asked a
question, so her sister answered for her. She said Kim Ok Bae left
their house in September 1950 on a school trip to perform for North
Korean troops. The performance was so good that the North Koreans
``recruited'' the performers to travel around and keep morale high.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kim Ok Bae became an anatomy professor, her
sister said. She is married to another anatomy professor and has
two children, a son who is a movie producer and a daughter who is a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister said that Kim Ok Bae told the family that every year
on her mother's birthday, she prepares a birthday feast, sets a
beautiful table and celebrates by herself. ``I have lived until now
with the guilt of having been a bad daughter,'' Kim Ok Bae said to
her mother, Hong Ghil-soon, who is 87, when they met Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've turned out wonderfully!'' her mother exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many cases the North Korean visitors seemed better
off than their southern relatives, which is probably precisely the
message Kim Jong Il wished to send. Kim Hyun-ki remembered his
older brother, Kim Hyun Suk, who disappeared from school shortly
after the war started, as a bright, handsome, engaging youngster.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kim Hyun Suk did indeed seem to be all of those
things _ and much younger than his two younger brothers. A tall man
with a thick head of salt-and-pepper hair, he spoke animatedly
during their meeting. ``I went into the army for three years, and
after that I went to college,'' he said. ``They sent me to college
to study engineering, and I studied really hard, father.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his three children also have college degrees. No one in
his South Korean family, which found it difficult to eke out a
living here once the authorities found out they had a family in the
North, can make a similar statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong-man was not about to let his brother Kim Dong Jin
forget the hard times his ideological beliefs had brought upon his
family. Kim Dong Jin joined the North Korean army after being
jailed several times for his communist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean army then threw his father into prison because
of his son's activities and confiscated all of the family's
possessions, Kim Dong-man said. ``My father died because of my
older brother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong Jin, a retired civil servant, sat silently as his
brother described the family's woes. ``He still hasn't told me what
he did for a living in the North,'' Kim Dong-man said. ``But he did
say he lives in a 100-square-yard house, and from that, I know he's
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong Jin then broke his silence. ``I feel like a rich man
today because I am able to see my family again,'' he said quietly.
``But if I would have stayed in the South, I would have died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 24 and the North Koreans took me in, all I had were
my two fists. But the great leader educated me and gave me a job.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kim Dong-man said he holds no grudges against his
brother. ``Older brother told me he is sorry,'' he said. ``These
tragedies happened because we lost our country to the Japanese and
then fought ourselves after that. My brother was part of that. I
want all of this suffering to end with my generation.''

`SURVIVOR' STAR: ONE MAN IS AN ISLAND FAVORITE
</HEADLINE>
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the subject of much outrage and derision on the Internet;
critics have called him a manipulative Machiavellian egomaniac; and
he seems to be especially irritating to David Letterman, who has
labeled him ``that naked fat guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But almost 30 million people are watching him on television
every week: Richard Hatch is a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Heather Locklear on `Melrose Place,''' said Lisa
Miller-Katz, a casting director for numerous television series, but
not this one. ``He's the villain that you love to hate. He's a
casting dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the producer of ``Survivor,'' Mark Burnett, and CBS'
casting executives had no way of knowing exactly what they were
getting when they selected Hatch as one of the 16 original
castaways on what was expected to be a kind of summer curiosity.
About all they knew was that he was a ``corporate trainer'' from
Newport, R.I., with a lot of self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   But now ``Survivor'' has become the most talked-about show in
America, a certifiable cultural phenomenon that has set ratings
records and recruited an entire new audience to CBS. And Richard
Hatch is unquestionably one of the biggest reasons the show has
worked so well.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first few weeks, Hatch set himself up as the center
of the drama on the deserted island where ``Survivor'' takes place.
He created an alliance _ and boasted about it on camera _ with
three others who have consistently voted together to eliminate
opponents as designated by Hatch, who seemed to pick his targets on
the basis of who had the most potential to keep him from winning
the $1 million prize that goes to the ultimate survivor.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has proved so effective that every member of the
original opposing tribe has been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very well cast, and he has played his part really
well,'' Miller-Katz said. ``If you can find a villain that makes
people hiss, that's incredibly valuable. Without someone like
Richard, I know I wouldn't be as rapt as I have been every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she especially likes him. ``I think he's incredibly
icky,'' Miller-Katz said, echoing the judgments of many other
viewers who have rooted for Hatch to get his comeuppance and be
eliminated by his fellow castaways. Certainly he made news by
parading around the island naked on several occasions, images that
were tastefully scrambled by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman has made him the target of almost nightly invective,
at one point declaring that if ``the fat naked guy'' wins the
contest, ``there's going to be rioting in the streets, there's
going to be looting.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't prevented Hatch from being the most sought-after
``Survivor'' participant. How hot is he? CBS executives say they
have received a flood of media requests for appearances by Hatch as
soon as he is either voted off the island or wins the game, all of
which will be determined on the show's final episodes, Wednesday
night and next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Until then Hatch is unavailable for comment. CBS's policy is to
forbid media appearances until a contestant's fate is sealed on the
show. Colleen Haskell, a perky student from Miami ousted last week
in Hatch's latest purge, was deluged with dozens of requests for
interviews and offers for appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Previous ``Survivor'' losers have already found outlets. Jenna
Lewis, a college student from New Hampshire, is mulling an offer to
pose nude for Playboy. Stacey Stillman, a lawyer from San
Francisco, and B.B. Andersen, a retired contractor from Kansas,
have already filmed commercials for Reebok. Ramona Gray, a
biochemist from Edison, N.J., is to be a judge at the Miss Teen USA
Pageant on CBS on Aug. 26. Dirk Been, a substitute teacher from
Wisconsin, was hired as a celebrity spokesman for a health-care
remedy. And Gervase Peterson, a youth basketball coach from a
Philadelphia suburb, has taped a guest appearance on the sitcom
``The Hugleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has already been sought for appearances at colleges and
state fairs. And this is before he has had the chance to go out and
market himself, something he seems to have a talent for.
</P>
<P>
   Just where his skills might be best used is open to question.
Miller-Katz said that the cast of CBS' other summer reality series,
``Big Brother,'' has turned out to be ``totally boring.'' So maybe
his best immediate use for CBS might be as an interloper at that
house.
</P>
<P>
   Now playing the part of George: Richard Hatch. If can make a hit
of that one, he'll be able to name his own price.
</P>
<P>
   Big Prize at Big House
</P>
<P>
   If you like to watch 16 people trying to survive on an island,
maybe you'll be up for 10 people trying to escape from a prison.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has bought the format rights to yet another British reality
series, ``Jailbreak.'' The network seems excited at the prospect of
this one, though it did not intend to announce that it owned the
rights until after the series goes on the air on Channel 5 in
Britain next month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though CBS has had the big success with reality shows this
summer, ABC has been the most aggressive network in lining up the
next generation of the genre, having already acquired ``The Mole''
(a group of people on a sort of scavenger hunt are sabotaged by one
in their midst) and ``The Runner,'' (viewers across the country
hunt for one contestant assigned to perform various tasks in
secret).
</P>
<P>
   The sale of rights to ``Jailbreak'' _ like those to
``Survivor,'' ``Big Brother'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
_ was negotiated by Ben Silverman of the William Morris Agency, who
became an advocate of the reality genre during a four-year stay in
England. ``I really love this one,'' he said. ```Jailbreak' has a
chance to be really huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The show was created by two young British producers, Sebastian
Scott and Henrietta Conrad, who own Princess Productions. Channel
5, which Silverman described as a ``Fox-like, young alternative
network,'' built a prison equipped with cameras and the latest in
electronic devices, like laser-beam alarms, which the contestants
will have to thwart if they are to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Prize money (no specific amount yet) awaits the escapees. The
group will be allowed to work in teams but then must share the
money. If an individual gets out first, he gets it all.
</P>
<P>
   All the prisoners will be given clues on how to escape,
Silverman said, and sometimes they can get a task accomplished only
by working together.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which will run every night for weeks in Britain, is
more likely to be a weekly series on ABC. It will also add some
devilish touches, like having two guards _ one good, one bad _ who
are identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives declined to discuss the show or the deal. One
reason: they want to get a look at how the format works in Britain
first. Given the need to build the prison, it is likely that the
show will take at least six months to get on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Another Dose of Reality
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Ramona Gray from ``Survivor'' to the judging
panel at the Miss Teen USA contest was the inspiration for that
pageant to change its rules.
</P>
<P>
   Now there will be a ``Survivor''-like vote to reduce the last
five contestants to three. All of the previously eliminated 46
contestants (from the 50 states plus and the District of Columbia)
will be asked to vote for the two contestants they want to
eliminate from the five semifinalists. Then the judges will pick
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick was added to take advantage of the ``Survivor''
phenomenon, but a friend of one contestant said that not all the
participants are thrilled. Some of the participants were troubled,
the friend said, by the prospect of voting to dismiss people to
whom they might become close during the course of the two-week
pageant.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for CBS said the contest would go on with the
rule-change intact.

 Secrets Of Success: Eggplant Cubes and Goat Cheese Team Up in 
 Anjou Salad  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Pierre Morin is a classic French chef who creates
simple, satisfying combinations at his cute restaurant, Anjou,
tucked away in an alley off Union Square.
<P>
   Few dishes are as exciting as his Warm Eggplant with Goat Cheese
Salad. Cubes of eggplant simmer in vegetable broth, infusing the
flesh with flavor and creating a velvet-like texture. Goat cheese
is then coated in nuts and quickly fried to give the contrast of
crunchy/creamy and cool/hot. A drizzle of tangy red wine
vinaigrette completes the dish with an explosion of flavor. You can
use any vinaigrette, but the best is made with 3 parts oil to 1
part vinegar with salt, pepper and Dijon mustard to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Morin hails from Anjou, a province of France known for its
cheeses and vegetables, so the man knows his goat cheese. His
cooking style evolved over many years of cooking all over the world
with the French Navy. He found his way to San Francisco working for
Kennedy's White House chef Rene Verdon at Le Trianon. He uses all
of that to create a casual full-flavored cuisine that bows to
California freshness.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant combines brick walls with gleaming brass on the
two-level interior. A partly open kitchen on the lower level adds a
warm inviting feel to this out-of-the-way place.

 Wine Potpourri: Lovers of the Grape Debate Rating Wine by the 
 Numbers  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Wine scoring is one of the most contentious issues
circulating in the wine community. At the heart of the controversy
is the question of whether numbers should be used to rate wines.
<P>
   Those who favor numbers, mainly wine publications, say it is the
most efficient way to tell the consumer about a wine's quality. The
more passionate opponents claim that numbers tell the buyer nothing
about a wine. ``You can't give works of art a score _ quick,
where's the Mona Lisa, I'm double-parked,'' quipped British wine
writer Tim Atkin of The Observer.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin opposes what he sees as the tyranny of wine scoring:
``Scores don't describe a wine, they play on people's insecurities.
You should trust your own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkin was a panelist in the spirited debate called ``Scoring,
Rating, Evaluating: Can You Quantify Quality?'' at the World
Vinifera Conference held last month in Seattle. Although nothing
was resolved, the panelists, at the urging of wine writer Matt
Kramer, gave the audience food for thought and a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Noted Australian wine writer James Halliday was more pointed
about insecurity. ``The United States is a culture that seems to
need reassurance. But I think it's hard to argue against using
points because it's easier to give points than words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Readers demand scores,'' said Steve Tanzer, publisher of
International Wine Cellar. ``Scores force a degree of discipline
and I don't think that writers can be blamed for a wine getting a
specific score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But how do you find out what people like from a score?'' asked
Ann C. Noble, a professor of enology at the University of
California at Davis. ``Instead of giving scores to wines, we need
to educate consumers to make choices they will like.''
</P>
<P>
   What has everybody so steamed is the so-called ``100-Point
Scale'' that is used by most major wine publications to rate a
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Noted wine writer Robert Parker Jr. is credited with first using
the 100-point system. As his popularity and power rose, many other
writers and wine publications, such as Wine Spectator, got on
board, claiming that to not use the 100-Point Scale would put them
at a disadvantage in a competitive business.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the bar keeps moving up. Not long ago, wines rarely
scored below 50 points, and a wine scoring above 80 was considered
very good. Now, a wine that gets less than 90 points is thought by
many, who rely slavishly on the scoring system, as not worth their
time or money. Nevertheless, many in the wine industry view scores
as the Holy Grail of wine sales. Get a high score from Parker or
Wine Spectator and your sales woes disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is true, said audience member David Lake, winemaker
for Columbia Winery in Washington. ``But it's really hard for
winemakers if the wine doesn't get a 90 or above. Scores are too
final, a snapshot from day and time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble nodded and added, ``The horrible thing about points is
they drive profits and power.'' Still, the practitioners feel
trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former winemaker, I found that a high rating from the
Wine Spectator helped sell the wine,'' added Jeff Morgan, wine
director for Dean&AMP;Deluca and a former staff member of Wine
Spectator. ``A word description didn't get as much attention as a
rating. Still, I wouldn't use scores if I had a choice, but it's
industry demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanzer agreed, stating that although he uses scores, ``I would
rather publish just notes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Chronicle Way &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Word descriptions matched to a rating of one to four stars is
the method used by The Chronicle Wine Tasting Panel. We believe it
is easier for the consumer to distinguish between a two-star wine
and a three-star wine, especially if a description supports the
rating. With the 100-point scale, statistics refute scores, and the
irony of the marketplace is that a wine scoring an 89 is not
thought to be as good as one with a 90 score.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Winery Changes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a month goes by in the California wine industry without a
change. The latest has Arrowood Vineyards &AMP; Winery, in Sonoma's
Valley of the Moon, joining the growing family of Napa's Robert
Mondavi Wines. Arrowood produces super-premium varietal wines from
grapes grown throughout Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and winemaker Richard Arrowood and his wife and partner,
Alis, will continue in their present roles at the winery, as will
all current Arrowood employees.
</P>

 Taster's Choice: Casa Fiesta Fries the Bean Competition  By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; If you're making Mexican specialties, refried
beans may be involved, either in the recipe or as a side dish.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted seven brands of refried pinto beans,
including some labeled organic or low-fat. Selections were limited
to those labeled vegetarian and excluded any with specific
seasonings such as chile or lime.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were surprised how much the brands differed in taste
and texture. They also agreed that different brands would be good
for different uses. Some tasted great on their own; others were
bland, but might work well in recipes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Casa Fiesta &LR;  (16 ounces, 99 cents at Bell Markets) got the top
ranking. Two panelists liked the bean flavor and smooth, creamy
texture. Another thought the beans tasted particularly
well-balanced. However, one dissenter did not like the seasonings.
Two would buy it, two might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Taco Bell Home Originals &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.29 at Safeway) came in
second. Most panelists liked spiciness and aggressive seasoning.
One described the texture as ``slightly mushy.'' Three would buy
it, one might buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest was  &UR; Bearitos &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.49 at Whole
Foods), in third place. Two panelists liked the smooth texture;
three liked the flavor. Two would buy it, one might buy it, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway &LR;  (16 ounces, 99 cents at Safeway) came in fourth, with
tasters disagreeing over appearance and flavor. Some thought the
mixture looked too dark and raw; others liked the flavor, but
thought it needed salt; still others described the flavor as raw
and muddled. Two might buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rosarita &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.19-$1.29 at many supermarkets) was
fifth. Two panelists were put off by the appearance. Three liked
the flavor, but others thought it had a sour aftertaste. One would
buy it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Albertsons and ShariAnn's, but they scored
too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Shelley
Handler, consultant and food writer; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe
For All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe
Kati, San Francisco. A perfect score for any prduct would be 100.
All products are tasted blind.

 At the Source: Galic Grower's Cloves for All Seasons   By Amber Thompson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 OCCIDENTAL, Calif. _  Chester Aaron eats bruschetta for breakfast
every day. His recipe is simple: toast, garlic, olive oil, salt and
pepper. The hard part is choosing the garlic _ he grows 87
varieties.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My former students used to hate it when I came into class in
the morning,'' laughs Aaron, a 77-year-old retired St. Mary's
College professor-turned-garlic-farmer. They wouldn't like it any
better later in the day, either _ in addition to his morning meal,
he eats another 10 cloves of raw garlic a day.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron has been an organic garlic farmer in Occidental for the
past 16 years. Last October, he planted 32,000 cloves. That
resulted in a 11/2-ton harvest last month.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron spends about 25 hours a week growing garlic and the
remaining time writing about it. He has already published two
books, ``Garlic is Life,'' and ``The Great Garlic Book'' (both
published by Ten Speed Press), and is currently working on a third.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron began his farming career by planting California Late, the
variety most widely available. But it was the Russian Red Toch that
really ignited his passion. While working on a sheep ranch near
Bodega Bay, Aaron encountered a Russian-speaking farmer who was
carrying a twisted, ugly head of garlic. He discovered that the
garlic was from his father's birth city, Tochliavri, in the
Republic of Georgia. Aaron immediately planted two bulbs _ and
became a full-fledged member of the garlic-growing community.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Aaron continued to meet growers across the world,
from Paris to Japan, and his collection grew rapidly. Today, he
plants Armenian, Creole Red, Siberian, Xian and 83 other garlics.
</P>
<P>
   Some varieties feature heads that are downright ugly, but
others, like the Siberian, are fit to be centerpieces. The Romanian
Red has large, distinct cloves covered by dull, brittle brown skin.
Leningrad is petite in comparison and has papery-thin purple skin.
The Beijing cloves are a challenge to peel, but the Duganskij are a
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The outer differences don't even hint at the garlic's inner
essence. To taste the difference, Aaron suggests pressing two
tablespoons of each type of garlic into one cup of hummus. The
hummus provides a neutral background that allows the garlic to
speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the heat of the Russian Red Streak strikes right up
front in your mouth. Others, like the Acropolis, hit the back of
the throat, and still others grab the sides of the tongue. The heat
from garlic also comes in different strengths. Whereas Monshanski
makes a bold first impression and dissipates within seconds, the
French Red seems to burn for minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron contends that garlic tastings are similar to wine
tastings. Comparing Creole Red to Russian Red Toch is like
comparing Merlot to Zinfandel. And when it comes to taste, vintage
and terroir both matter. ``Land is the major element in growing
garlic,'' he says. A head of Armenian garlic grown in Aaron's soil
will not have the same nuances as one grown even a few miles north.
</P>
<P>
   Just as wines pair differently with food, so does garlic.
Russian Red Toch's heavy richness and moderate heat is perfect in a
cheesy lasagna. Siberian, with its large, solid cloves, is great
roasted. Persian Star's ``mild, spicy zing'' goes with fish dishes,
and earthy Xian with wild mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And after you've indulged in any garlicky meal, Aaron
recommends, ``Chew parsley to get rid of the garlic on your breath
and in your sweat.'' He also advises rubbing your fingers with
lemon.
</P>
<P>
   These uncommon varieties can be difficult to find. Aaron's
garlic is available by subscription, and a good selection is
available online from  &LR; www.gourmetgarlicgardens.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.ashleycreek.com. &LR;

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh

 The Working Cook: Making a Meal out of an Appetizer  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Why is it that when you go to fine restaurants the
appetizers always sound the best? They're so delicately appealing,
so balanced in their juxtapositions of hot and cool, sweet and
tart, crunchy and soft _ like seared foie gras with rhubarb compote
or frisee with pancetta dressing. So often I wish I could order
just appetizers. I'd order them all and eat them one by one in
sweet little bites.
<P>
   At Globe restaurant a few months ago, I had a great ahi tuna
tartare. Though ahi usually is prepared with Asian sesame oil, or
Ponzu or pineapple jus, this time it was pared with bits of green
olive; it was an unusual but amazing combination.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that meal, I have wanted to use that same flavor
combination for a recipe for this column. But all I could come up
with were appetizer-type dishes, and what working cook has time to
make more than one course in this day and age? I decided that the
way around this problem was like going to a restaurant and ordering
only appetizers: Just turn the appetizer into dinner by making more
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 30-Minute recipe, Seared Ahi Tuna with Green Olive
Toasts &AMP; Heirloom Tomato Salad, is like all good appetizers in that
it looks beautiful, which is why the recipe is very specific about
presentation. Try to find heirloom tomatoes in tones of green and
yellow and purple; they will glisten next to the fat slices of ahi,
which reveal ruby-red bellies.
</P>
<P>
   The Cool Soba Noodles with Garlic Pork &AMP; Mushrooms is an easy
dish that you can make in many different guises. Try using chicken
instead of pork, or use no meat at all, just mushrooms, which work
particularly well with the earthy flavor of buckwheat noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Soba noodles are easy to overcook, which is one of the reasons
recipes often call for cooling them under running water after
cooking. But I prefer not to totally douse them under the faucet or
they end up too slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Red Beans &AMP; Rice is the perfect Now &AMP; Later dish because it just
keeps getting better, even if you freeze it. The spices, which in
this recipe were deftly put together by Food Section intern Scott
Clapp, continue to permeate the beans over time. Scott also
suggests serving the sausages on top of the beans instead of
chopping them and integrating them into the beans. This creates a
great contrast in texture. The texture and flavor will be even
better if you decide to throw the sausages on the grill.

   COOL SOBA NOODLES WITH GARLIC PORK &AMP; MUSHROOMS
</P>
<P>
   Soba are Japanese noodles that are gray-brown because they are
made partly of buckwheat flour. They can be found in Asian food
stores, specialty markets and some supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless center-cut pork loin chops
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 package (8.8 ounces) soba noodles
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon + 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   5 green onions
</P>
<P>
   1 package (6 ounces) sliced mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   about 4 ounces preshredded carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 tablespoons black sesame seeds, or white sesame seeds, if
black are unavailable
</P>
<P>
   Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice vinegar, or 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chile oil
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, cut the pork into julienne strips and place in a
small bowl with the soy sauce. Mince the garlic and stir it into
the pork. Set aside to marinate at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   When the water boils, add the noodles and cook for 3 to 5
minutes, or until just al dente. Drain and lightly rinse, tossing
the noodles as you rinse them. Drain well. Place the noodles in a
large bowl and toss with the 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to keep
them from sticking. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the green onions into segments about same length as the pork
strips, discarding rough ends, then slice lengthwise into julienne
strips.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Make the sauce:  &LR; Mix together the soy sauce, vinegar, chile oil
and sesame oil in a small bowl. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a medium
skillet over high heat. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for about 1
minute. Add the carrots and pork. Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes, or
until the pork is no longer pink. Add the pork mixture and sauce to
the noodles, quickly toss, then toss in most of the green onions,
reserving some for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Serve in large bowls, and garnish each with green onions and
sesame seeds.

way to cook many of our favorite foods. 
 
 Best Way: Grilling Chicken   By Scott Clapp 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Backyard grilling remains one of life's little
pleasures. Throw the meat on the grill and sit back and relax while
the aromas wafting from your grill make your neighbor's mouth
water. But what is the best way to guarantee that those wonderful
smells result in the perfect grilled chicken?
<P>
   To find out, we grilled lightly seasoned bone-in, skin-on
breasts on a small charcoal grill.
</P>
<P>
   We tried various methods, including searing the chicken over
medium heat and moving it to a warm part of the grill to finish
cooking, cooking it completely over medium coals, and cooking it
over hot coals. We also tried these covered and uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly unanimous winner among the Food Department staff was
the chicken that was cooked on a covered grill entirely over medium
coals. It produced the perfect balance of smoky flavor and moist
chicken, as well as golden, crisp skin.
</P>
<P>
   We then tested two commonly suggested time-saving techniques.
First, we microwaved the chicken for five minutes per pound prior
and finished it on the grill. Second, we seared the chicken on the
grill and then moved it to a 350 degrees oven to finish. Neither of
these techniques proved popular.
</P>
<P>
   The microwaved chicken was inconsistent _ moist and delicious in
one bite, dry and rubbery in the next. And the time saved was
minimal _ 18 minutes for the microwave/grill version versus 26
minutes for chicken cooked entirely on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the chicken in the oven frees the cook to work on
other parts of the meal, but the chicken, as might be expected,
lacked any characteristic smoky flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of our final test explored when to salt the
chicken. We added salt before, during and after grilling and also
tried adding half of the salt before and half after grilling. Most
agreed the differences were minimal, but the chicken with half the
salt added before grilling and the rest added after grilling was
the slight favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEST WAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lightly season the chicken with pepper and half of the desired
salt. Using medium heat, grill the chicken directly over the coals,
covering the grill and turning the chicken often until cooked
through, about 25-30 minutes. (Cooking times vary depending on the
size of the chicken and the heat of the grill.) After removing the
chicken from the grill, season with the remaining salt.

   The experience extremes are typified by Houston delegates Billie
Carr, who thinks she is at her last convention, and Catherine Read,
who is at her first.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, long a bulwark of the Texas Democratic Party, tells about
her first convention experience in a release entitled ``My First
Convention, or Can You Top This?''
</P>
<P>
   Carr's first was in her home town in the only year Houston
hosted the Democrats. It was 1928, and Al Smith was the nominee.
Her parents, active in Democratic politics, got two guest passes
from the local fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother planned for me to stay with my grandmother, but my
father said he wanted to take me, this was history,'' Carr
recalled. ``They dressed me up, wrapped me in a blanket and off we
went to the convention. I was 27 days old. I still have the passes
and buttons from this convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, she attended her next Democratic National
</P>
<P>
   Convention, the memorable 1968 event in Chicago. As a liberal
firebrand, Carr wound up involved with a dissident group shut out
of Texas Democratic mainstream activities, including that year's
state
</P>
<P>
   convention. She led a challenge group that eventually sparked
major changes in the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rented a bus and headed to Chicago. Since we were not an
official group, we could not get rooms. I called the YMCA and they
let us rent rooms,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They lost in a credentials fight, but Carr got to participate in
what made the convention infamous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get caught up in the police riot and some of us were
maced, hit and arrested, but that's another story,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carr has been a delegate at all Democratic conventions since
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I am retiring from the Democratic National Committee
and this will probably be my last national convention,'' said Carr,
ailing and participating from a wheelchair at the rear of the
delegation's section. ``I am 72 years old. Baby has come a long way
from 27 days old. I have loved every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the experience spectrum is Read, who was a
sergeant at arms at the Republican National Convention in Houston,
an event _ especially Pat Buchanan's speech _ that convinced her
she was hanging out with the wrong folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the GOP for good in 1994 when the right-wing takeover
of the Texas GOP was complete and my moderate GOP congressional
candidate lost the primary to a far-right opponent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Read now works for Continental Airlines and is using e-mail to
send daily convention updates to her friends back home. Her first
dispatch detailed the long days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone bring me coffee in the morning _ they don't have any
in-room coffee pots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Russell, 62, of San Antonio, is a retired Army lieutenant
colonel who credits the party for helping her to do something she
once thought impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent most of my years in the closet. The Democratic Party
has made it possible for me to be out, open and active in bringing
about change and greater acceptance in our society,'' she wrote.
``For gays and lesbians, it is critical to our future to elect Al
Gore and other
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates. If the Republicans win in November, I
believe that social issues will be set back at least 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Sidney Schwartz of San Benito, like many Texans,
started elsewhere. Born in New York in 1925, Schwartz helped
develop specialized clothing and equipment for the U.S. Navy. He
helped fit John Glenn for his first space suit and later, while
working for Grumman Aerospace, helped develop the first
zero-gravity toilet.
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, Schwartz and wife Elenore returned to South
Texas, where he had served in the military, 10 years ago and became
active in Democratic politics. They believe Texas Democrats could
begin to reverse the GOP trend by pushing ``winter Texans'' in the
Rio Grande Valley to register to vote in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is a rich area to mine for the long-term
Democratic renewed strength,'' he said. ``Senior citizens have a
great advantage over younger voters in that they have lived and
seen past American political history.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   First-time delegate Kelly Holmes, 22, of Austin is a student who
is using her musical talents to further the Democratic cause. She
contributes to an anti-George W. Bush Web site that uses parody
songs to make its points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know a lot of Americans are apathetic about the political
process, so our hope is to engage them with the humor in our songs
and to expose Bush as the idiot he is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Janet Caro Murphy of Dallas found her own way into
Democratic politics as a New York delegate to the 1972 and 1980
conventions. But it was love that got her into Texas Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1980 convention, while waiting in a long line, she began
chatting with Craig Murphy, a Dallas delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept talking for several months, and, as he tells is, when
the phone bills became excessive, we got married,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Richard Acker III of Houston also traces his party ties
to a profoundly personal event, though it happened in a crowd of
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first experience with the party was when I was 6 years old,
in the first grade, when I attended the parade in Dallas on Nov.
22, 1963 and witnessed the assassination of President Kennedy,'' he
wrote. ``From then until I was able to vote at the age of 18 I
believe I subconsciously sided with the party and its values.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory Rico't(cq), 68, of Odessa, also remembers Democratic
politics played out at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first job as an activist was in 1936 at age 5. My parents
were illegally posting `Vote for Lyndon Johnson' signs on telephone
poles,'' she wrote. ``My job was to honk the car horn when another
car came so they could hide. I have been a Democratic activist ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 68, and suffering from multiple sclerosis and failing
vision, she is ``thrilled'' to be a first &QC; time delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked in many campaigns and helped raise many dollars.
Unfortunately, I have slowed down,'' she said.

A MEETING OF THE MINDSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA BELKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the dizzying transformations of the workplace, the one
that pleases me most is how the nerds have taken charge. My parents
(bookworms themselves) always promised that this would happen, and
that promise kept me going during the years when I sat with the
debate squad in the high school cafeteria, pretending not to notice
the snubs from the cheerleaders and the football team.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, however, I am the wrong kind of nerd. It seems
there are subgroups, and I'm the type who kept her nose buried in a
social studies book, not a math text; who hung out in the yearbook
office, not the computer lab; who actually completed her college
education, rather than dropping out and creating a software giant.
Since the working world is really just high school with paychecks,
it still matters what group you are in, and it's still striking
that we don't know how to talk to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike high school, however, co-workers have to talk. And
because we now have those paychecks, there are specialists, like
Arline Goldman, who are there to coach us. Her company, Goldenwords
Management Communications, does what no guidance counselor ever
managed to do _ teach the cheerleaders how to deal with the
debaters and the class clowns how to chat with the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she phrases it exactly that way. There are four
personality types in any office, she explains. The ``expressive''
likes to be the center of attention and communicates through
emotion and feeling. Salesmen, for example, or actors and lawyers.
(She didn't mention journalists, but I plead guilty here.) The
``driver,'' in turn, needs to be in control, which is why business
executives often fall into this category. The ``amiable'' is most
interested in getting along with other people, so he is likely to
choose fields like human resources. And the ``analytic'' _ the
computer geek, the engineer, the medical researcher, the technical
nerd _ focuses on data and research.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you are expressive, Goldman said, and you want to bring
an idea to your boss, who is analytic. ``You can't go running in
saying, `Bill, Bill, I'm so excited about this,''' she wared,
``because that excitement will backfire. Presenting things in terms
of emotion will turn an analytic off. Use concrete examples. Back
up your data with more data. You can't have too much detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose you are an analytic, making a presentation to just
about anybody else. If you act from instinct, you will probably
assume that your company's sales team or your audience of potential
investors is actually interested in every tiny project detail. You
will be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently,'' Goldman said, ``technical people didn't have
to do a lot of interacting with anyone other than technical people,
and they were all quite happy about that.'' But now that technical
people are off founding dot-coms and testifying in antitrust
trials, that's no longer possible. So Goldman spends ``a lot of
time teaching them how to summarize.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Selinger, himself an engineering nerd, does, too. The
average member of the marketing department ``probably doesn't care
what the drag coefficient of the wing is,'' he said. But the
average engineer doesn't believe that, so Selinger has developed a
seminar called ``Stuff You Don't Learn in Engineering School,''
which aims to undo ingrained personality traits that have been
reinforced by years of technical training.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering schools require students to tinker endlessly, until
nut and bolt is perfect, Selinger said, resulting in graduates who
are ``often reluctant decision makers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They go berserk with too many options,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His first exercise, therefore, is to require the group to decide
quickly where to advise the university's president to take an
influential trustee for lunch. The task is theoretical, but the
students don't know that. The message? ``That being decisive is
often more important than the decision itself,'' Selinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, because engineering students have spent years penned
up in labs and study carrels ``they aren't as innately political as
liberal arts majors,'' he believes. He tells of one student in his
seminar who was confused by the ``Copy To'' line on an interoffice
memo, so she called every listed recipient of that memo and asked
why their name appeared. As a result, ``Stuff You Don't Learn in
Engineering School'' includes advice on when to ``CC'' an e-mail
memo and when to ``BC'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Selinger is constantly struck by the fact that his students, who
understand the most complicated things, still need to be taught the
simplest ones. He instructs them, for instance, to proofread all
e-mail messages before sending them, to say thank you to co-workers
for a job well done and to eat their lunch in the office cafeteria,
where they can see and be seen, rather than scurrying back to their
cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet they get the cool table. The one in the front of the
room. Closest to the cheerleaders and the stock options.

 FRUSTRATIONS AT THE GATE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. _ The line of thunderstorms that had blossomed in
the Midwest was meandering toward the East Coast. Rising up to
50,000 feet, the storms had severed major East-West air routes,
creating havoc in airports from St. Louis to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Aviation Administration's air-traffic control
system command center in this suburban Washington town, air-traffic
controllers, airline industry officials, and meteorologists were
trying to make the best of a bad situation. But one of the 11
enormous television screens at the center showed the carnage:
Hundreds of flights along the East Coast were being delayed because
the arrival rate at many airports had been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, which bore the brunt of the most vicious
thunderstorms on July 28, more than 170 flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how things were going, Jack Kies, the center's program
manager, said with a growl: ``Not very good if you are trying to
get somewhere by airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Such episodes have become common in this summer of 2000. No one
who flies with any regularity has been immune from the delays and
cancellations that are plaguing an air system that is bursting at
the seams with travelers. But the problems this summer have been
compounded by a spate of bad weather that has exacerabated flaws in
the system ranging from a lack of enough runways at many airports
to overscheduling by airlines to the reliance on a 50-year-old
national air navigation program.
</P>
<P>
   United, the world's largest airline, has been particularly hard
hit. Labor unrest with pilots has forced the airline to remove
thousands of flights from its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of the airline, the summer of 2000, indeed the
entire year, is shaping up to be the worst for delays and
cancellations, shattering records set last year. With traffic
expected to increase by about 4 percent a year, many specialists
say that the system is likely to get worse, with scheduling
problems that will leave passengers in the lurch, before there is
any marked improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the FAA has spent $3 billion upgrading
equipment at 20 centers that handle air traffic. That effort has
paid some dividends as equipment-related delays have declined by
more than 8 percent in 2000. Still, through July of this year, the
FAA said, more than 250,000 flights have been delayed, about 10
percent more than last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Delays are up from last year for every month except May and
July, which were down 7.5 and 1.7 percent respectively, according
to the data. Delays through July have surpassed the number for all
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What has many passengers seething is that planes are now so full
that when a flight is canceled airline employees will report that
it could be days before a seat becomes available on another flight
home.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the frequent business travelers, known as road
warriors, who have faced hours of delay, frustrating lines at
ticket counters or the chagrin of seeing their flights disappear
from departure boards. In New York, Leo Mullin, chairman and chief
executive of Delta Air Lines, was trying to get home to Atlanta on
July 28. He was one of tens of thousands of grounded passengers
that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in it up to my eyeballs,'' Mullin said. ``This has been
a particularly difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Aviation Administration chief, Jane Garvey, has
faced delayed flights and has given up trying to get home to New
England some summer weekends. Garvey's most recent flight, from
Dallas to Washington, was delayed an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a passenger and you're stuck, as I was, it's very
frustrating,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinpointing the exact number of delays and cancellations is
impossible because the FAA not does include cancellations in its
figures, and the Department of Transportation, which ranks airlines
by on-time performance, does not count a flight delayed if it
leaves the gate within 15 minutes of schedule _ even if it then
sits for an hour waiting to take off.
</P>
<P>
   That confusion was noted recently by Kenneth Mead, the inspector
general of the Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this . . . is resolved, the FAA and the air carriers
will continue to blame one another, and the decision-makers'
ability to address the underlying causes such as runway capacity,
air-traffic control equipment and procedures, weather, and airline
scheduling practices will be hindered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise causes for delays may not be known,
specialists say delays are worse in the summer because
thunderstorms make swaths of the sky impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the summer that was supposed to be better than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, President Clinton announced a collaborative effort
between the airlines and the FAA for weather forecasting and for
alternate route planning that was designed as a short-term solution
to last year's historic delays.
</P>
<P>
   Every two hours, starting at 7 a.m., airline dispatchers in
operations centers, FAA air-traffic facilities around the country,
and officials at Herndon hold a telephone conference call and
discuss a game plan for the following two hours. Frequently, Garvey
listens in to the conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ryan, vice president of air-traffic management for the Air
Transport Association, the industry's trade association, says
collaboration between the FAA and the airlines has never been
better. He and airline executives, like Delta's Mullin, say delays
would be worse this summer without the program, especially since
the weather has been more severe this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday, FAA officials defended the
system. They said that about 80 percent of the 14,000 flights each
day depart and arrive on time. But Peter Challan, deputy associate
administrator of the FAA, acknowledged: ``If you are delayed, these
numbers don't mean anything to you.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials from Garvey on down say their first consideration
is safety, and that trying to orchestrate collaboration among
fierce competitors is exceedingly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines don't give us too many ideas,'' said Kies, of the
FAA's command center. ``They'll say, `That is an awfully long
alternative route, can't you do something else?' They tend to do
more carping than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference calls have led to greater predictability for the
airlines, but the new collaborative program was also supposed to
maximize the use of available airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not put that into practice aggressively enough,''
Mullin said. ``I don't want to apportion blame, but the FAA is
responsible for managing the airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   The national airspace system is supported by radar and
ground-based radio beacon navigation aids that were designed in the
1940s to control and direct planes.
</P>
<P>
   While the sky may seem limitless, the system is a series of
well-defined corridors, or jetways, that extend from radio beacon
to radio beacon. When one jetway is closed, it is as if a lane on a
highway has been shut down _ all the traffic is forced into the
remaining lanes, slowing everything down.
</P>
<P>
   The new program was supposed to open additional airspace,
including some corridors flying over Canada and into the military
airspace along the East Coast. But that has proven difficult.
Canada's privatized air-traffic control system wants compensation
for handling huge numbers of American planes that are neither
taking off nor landing there.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the military's airspace is also challenging. ``In the
past, it has been real hard to get them to give it up even when
they are not using it. But, they are starting to move off that
some,'' said Randy Schwitz, vice president of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association.

 &HT;    BRITISH, FRENCH OFFICIALS TO GROUND REMAINING CONCORDES; BRITISH
AIRWAYS CANCELS FLIGHTS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Three weeks after an Air France Concorde crashed in
flames near Paris, French and British aviation authorities decided
Tuesday to ground the supersonic passenger plane until it can be
made safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   British and French air safety officials said they would revoke
the Concorde's airworthiness certificate Wednesday. After being
informed of the decision Tuesday morning, British Airways
immediately grounded its seven Concordes. Air France had not flown
its Concordes since the July 25 crash that killed 113.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials based their decision on preliminary findings
by French investigators that a burst tire, which sent debris
rifling through the fuel tanks in the left wing, caused the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said they would explain their unexpected action
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when the glamorous supersonic aircraft, which
debuted in 1976, will carry passengers again. Only 12 remain in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways Chief Executive Rod Eddington said the airline
acted within minutes of being told of the impending decision. ``In
those circumstances we must put our fleet on the ground
immediately,'' Eddington told reporters at London's Heathrow
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline cancelled its morning flight to New York after the
Concorde had begun to taxi down the runway at Heathrow. The 37
passengers were shifted to conventional subsonic aircraft
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its fleet of five Concordes immediately
after the crash and said the supersonic aircraft would remain on
the ground indefinitely. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the supersonic aircraft, resumed its Concorde operations the
day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, British Airways and aviation officials said there
was no evidence of risk to passengers despite the French disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The British Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday that it
expects to instruct the airline and manufacturers to take whatever
action needed to make the aircraft safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few days it has emerged that a single tire burst
was the cause of the accident, and as a result we are of a view
that the certificate should be suspended,'' the spokesman said.
``We expect a formal recommendation from investigators in France
tomorrow morning. We will look at the specific recommendations and
then we will make our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways modified its fleet of Concordes in the mid-1990s
to prevent a similar tire-burst from causing catastrophic damage
and, on the basis of that modification, the airplanes had been
permitted to continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   However, after looking over the evidence from the French
investigation, British investigators apparently believe the risk of
a crash similar to the one in France to be too high.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators have said that they believe the accident
occurred when a 16-inch metal strip punctured a tire, sending
chunks of rubber into the aircraft's left wing fuel tanks. The
gushing fuel ignited, sending flames trailing some 200 feet behind
the doomed aircraft, which crashed into a small hotel in Gonesse,
France less than two minutes after take-off from Charles de Gaulle
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the first fatal accident involving the elite
Concorde in its 25 years of commercial flying.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Eddington said he hoped the Concorde
would fly again. ``We will need to understand the reasons that sit
behind the investigators' concerns, and until we know those reasons
and can reflect on them, we can't talk about when Concorde will be
back in the air,'' Eddington told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on everything I know, it is a safe aircraft to fly. But
as I said, at the end of the day, we rest on the information
provided to us by the accident investigators and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilson, a former Concorde test pilot, told reporters that
the revocation of an airworthiness certificate suggests substantial
fundamental problems with the aircraft. ``It's very unusual for
authorities to remove the certificate so swiftly,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do find this very shocking,'' Paul Beaver of Jane's Defense
Weekly told BBC Television. ``Some in-depth research has been done
which says something is wrong with Concorde.''

   Most of the nation's commercial airline traffic is concentrated
east of the Mississippi, and the FAA and the airlines have
identified seven choke points in a triangle from Boston to Chicago
to Charlotte, N.C. Officials hope to have procedures in place later
this year to deal with some of the choke points. Other strategies
will take longer to implement.

   Some of these choke points are caused simply by the increased
air traffic. As a result, at airports such as Chicago's O'Hare,
planes are forced to wait until an opening in an air corridor is
available.
</P>
<P>
   When there are ground holds for congestion, or because of bad
weather, the arrival rate at airports is also reduced. The FAA sets
the reduced number of arrivals in Herndon, and allocates slots to
the airlines based on their share of the schedule. Airlines then
decide which planes will use the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the slots go to general aviation, which includes
business jets. That a plane with three people gets a slot while 250
people on a jumbo jet wait strikes some as inefficient _ and
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world, where the FAA would not have to provide
equal access to airports, we would be able to send them someplace
else,'' said the Massport aviation director, Thomas Kinton.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term solution would be to change the way the system works
so planes are no longer guided by older ground-based navigation
aids, but rather by satellites, which would allow pilots to fly
outside air corridors and in most cases take more direct routes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a program by Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass. to develop a
highly reliable system to augment the accuracy and reliability of
global position system signals is way behind schedule and over its
original budget.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project, known as the wide area
augmentation system, was supposed to be available next month. But a
test last December to determine if the system could detect errors
in the signal failed three times. While that is not a problem for a
motorist using the global positional system, for an airplane on
final approach with limited visibility, it could be catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when the wide-area system will be operational,
but FAA officials insist it will anchor the system of the future
and will help alleviate congestion once planes are at cruising
altitude. Yet it will not end delays. It is a big sky, but there
are only so many airports where planes can take off and land,''
said Schwitz of the controllers union. ``Satellite-based navigation
will reduce fuel burn and flight time en route, but it is not going
to help when those planes need to get on the ground. If you have 50
planes trying to land at the same airport at the same time, we'll
still have to line them all up and put them in a holding pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA estimates the nation's 25 busiest airports will handle
63 percent of the 670 million passengers who will fly this year and
experience 86 percent of all delays. Of those airports, 15,
including Boston's Logan International, are considering adding a
runway between now and 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``More pavement helps, but it will not be the silver bullet,''
said Paul Galis, the FAA's deputy associate administrator for
airports. ``Most of the plans are designed to accommodate more
traffic, and in that respect Boston is sort of unique.'' He said
that Boston would increase capacity by only about 5,000 operations
a year, while a new runway in St. Louis is expected to generate
more than 200,000 additional operations.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's schedule, like any aiport's, is built around ideal
operating conditions. And in good weather, the airport can handle
about 120 planes an hour by using three, or even four, runways. But
because planes must land and take off into the wind, when the wind
is from the northwest Logan drops to two, and sometimes just one,
runway.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed runway would be designed for smaller, slower planes
to land in northwest wind conditions, increasing the rate at which
larger, faster planes can land on Logan's existing northwest
runway. ``We have snow, ice, fog, and wind _ and the wind is the
one delay condition that we can do something about,'' said Kinton,
Massport's aviation director.
</P>
<P>
   But community opposition to Logan's proposed runway is strong,
as is oppostion to runway projects nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard choices will have to be made at all levels of government
with communities around the country to ensure that we have the
infrastrcture in place to accommodate anticipated demand,'' Garvey
said recently. Garvey has asked for a study of the Logan runway
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FAA, NASA, and the Volpe Center in Cambridge,
Mass. are working with Flight Safety Technologies, a company based
in New London, Conn., to increase efficiency by letting planes fly
closer together on final approach.
</P>
<P>
   A major concern on final approaches are so-called wake vortices,
small horizontal wind spirals that extend back from a plane's
wingtips. The larger the plane, the larger the wake vortex, which
are powerful enough to force small planes out of the air. The
system under design would draw on previously classified technology
used to locate submarines to detect when the vortices are present,
and when wind conditions re such that they would dissipate more
quickly. With no vortices present, the separation between planes on
final approach could shrink, allowing a few more aircraft to land.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, even if the wake vortex detection system works, it will
improve efficiency only marginally. Increasingly, air
transportation officials say the airlines must take responsibility
for simply placing too many demands on the system.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, congestion in the sky has reached
unprecedented levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some times of the day we have more demand than we can handle,
and the number of hours in the day when that is true is
expanding,'' said Steven Brown, FAA's associate administrator for
air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has started offering lower flying altitudes to avoid
delays. While aircraft may not operate as efficiently at 24,000
feet as they can at 32,000 feet, that program is being used more
frequently, Kies said.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new phenomenon in aviation is the use of regional
jets, and they are also causing some delay problems. The regional
jets, which are replacing slower and lower-flying turboprops, fly
at the same altitude as bigger jets but at a much slower speed.
``It is like coming up on a tractor on the interstate,'' Schwitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives and passengers, however, love the regional
jets because they have greater range than turboprops and provide
jet service to many new markets.
</P>
<P>
   And executives say it is unfair for the FAA to blame airline
scheduling for delays. ``That is such a red herring,'' said David
Fuscus, spokesman for the Air Transportation Association. ``Every
one of those people knows that if 20 planes are scheduled to depart
at 8 a.m., that is not a wheel's-up time. They can all push back at
8, then taxi out and get in line to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Fuscus said, ``the government has a responsibility
to meet the travel demands of the public _ that is a basic
underpinning of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, however, insists the airlines must do their share in
helping to solve a problem with no simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our great challenge is: Can we keep up with the growth we are
seeing?'' she said in a recent interview. ``Some of the discussion
is focusing only on air traffic control. This is a multifaceted
problem with lots of causes . . . and it has to have a multifaceted
solution.''

 &HT;    BRITISH, FRENCH OFFICIALS TO GROUND REMAINING CONCORDES; BRITISH
AIRWAYS CANCELS FLIGHTS
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Three weeks after an Air France Concorde crashed in
flames near Paris, French and British aviation authorities decided
Tuesday to ground the supersonic passenger plane until it can be
made safe to fly.
</P>
<P>
   British and French air safety officials said they would revoke
the Concorde's airworthiness certificate Wednesday. After being
informed of the decision Tuesday morning, British Airways
immediately grounded its seven Concordes. Air France had not flown
its Concordes since the July 25 crash that killed 113.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation officials based their decision on preliminary findings
by French investigators that a burst tire, which sent debris
rifling through the fuel tanks in the left wing, caused the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said they would explain their unexpected action
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear when the glamorous supersonic aircraft, which
debuted in 1976, will carry passengers again. Only 12 remain in
operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways Chief Executive Rod Eddington said the airline
acted within minutes of being told of the impending decision. ``In
those circumstances we must put our fleet on the ground
immediately,'' Eddington told reporters at London's Heathrow
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline cancelled its morning flight to New York after the
Concorde had begun to taxi down the runway at Heathrow. The 37
passengers were shifted to conventional subsonic aircraft
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its fleet of five Concordes immediately
after the crash and said the supersonic aircraft would remain on
the ground indefinitely. British Airways, the only other airline to
fly the supersonic aircraft, resumed its Concorde operations the
day after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, British Airways and aviation officials said there
was no evidence of risk to passengers despite the French disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The British Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday that it
expects to instruct the airline and manufacturers to take whatever
action needed to make the aircraft safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few days it has emerged that a single tire burst
was the cause of the accident, and as a result we are of a view
that the certificate should be suspended,'' the spokesman said.
``We expect a formal recommendation from investigators in France
tomorrow morning. We will look at the specific recommendations and
then we will make our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   British Airways modified its fleet of Concordes in the mid-1990s
to prevent a similar tire-burst from causing catastrophic damage
and, on the basis of that modification, the airplanes had been
permitted to continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   However, after looking over the evidence from the French
investigation, British investigators apparently believe the risk of
a crash similar to the one in France to be too high.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators have said that they believe the accident
occurred when a 16-inch metal strip punctured a tire, sending
chunks of rubber into the aircraft's left wing fuel tanks. The
gushing fuel ignited, sending flames trailing some 200 feet behind
the doomed aircraft, which crashed into a small hotel in Gonesse,
France less than two minutes after take-off from Charles de Gaulle
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the first fatal accident involving the elite
Concorde in its 25 years of commercial flying.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Eddington said he hoped the Concorde
would fly again. ``We will need to understand the reasons that sit
behind the investigators' concerns, and until we know those reasons
and can reflect on them, we can't talk about when Concorde will be
back in the air,'' Eddington told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on everything I know, it is a safe aircraft to fly. But
as I said, at the end of the day, we rest on the information
provided to us by the accident investigators and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilson, a former Concorde test pilot, told reporters that
the revocation of an airworthiness certificate suggests substantial
fundamental problems with the aircraft. ``It's very unusual for
authorities to remove the certificate so swiftly,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do find this very shocking,'' Paul Beaver of Jane's Defense
Weekly told BBC Television. ``Some in-depth research has been done
which says something is wrong with Concorde.''

A SPACIOUS, LEAFY NEW SETTING FOR AMBITIOUS SHAKESPEAREANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By IRIS FANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ In ``Henry V,'' Shakespeare asked the groundlings
standing in the Globe's pit and the patrons crammed onto the hard
benches to use their imaginations and ``Suppose within the girdle
of these walls/Are now confin'd two mighty monarchies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Packer, the ebullient artistic director of the performing
troupe Shakespeare &AMP; Co., is making an equally audacious request of
her audiences here in Western Massachusetts: to envision an exact
replica of an Elizabethan playhouse nestled among the rolling
Berkshire hills at the company's new home.
</P>
<P>
   Where Shakespeare relied on his verse to conjure up the
illusion, Packer has a real building in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, and perhaps none too soon _ after its wrangles over use of
the Mount, the nearby Edith Wharton estate _ Shakespeare &AMP; Company
will be ensconced on 63 acres in Lenox, near Tanglewood. The
troupe, which has presented a large repertory of Shakespeare plays
in the summer and fall at the Wharton estate since 1978 and which
also runs an extensive school education program, bought the new
property in April for $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are 22 buildings on the site in various conditions of
repair, including an estate house, Springlawn, built in 1904, the
same era as Edith Wharton's home a mile away. A boys' school and a
religious organization were among the owners of the property at 70
Kemble St., which was ultimately sold by the National Music
Foundation, a nonprofit organization for the promotion of American
music. The foundation's own plans for a performing arts complex,
which it had shelved before the sale, did not include a copy of a
16th-century English theater.
</P>
<P>
   Given Packer's drive and the plans already in motion, a replica
of the Rose Theater, which once stood in London in Shakespeare's
time, is likely to be the core of what Packer hopes will be a major
center for Shakespearean performance, teaching and scholarship in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent conversation at the new property, the director said
she had always wanted an Elizabethan theater. ``If you make
Shakespeare the backbone of what you do, it's a good idea to have
the physical space and condition that the scripts were written
for,'' she said. ``What we love about the Elizabethan playhouse is
the actor-audience relationship. The first half I wanted was the
aesthetic. The other half was that this would put us on the map.
It's a contribution to scholarship and a real contribution to
tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   If a casting director were to choose a Shakespearean role for
Packer, who is 61, it might be that of the vigorous Mistress
Quickly in ``Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2'' or the nurturing,
resourceful Nurse in ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Short and sturdy, with
strands of gray in her red hair, Packer has a wide smile, a laugh
that breaks out often and an English accent that is hard to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she seems undaunted by the task facing her nonprofit
organization, with its budget of $2.8 million this year and its
staff of 100 artists, teachers and directors. The company has
estimated that the cost of the move to the new property over the
next five years, along with the purchase price, will come to nearly
$17 million, not including the expense of the Rose. Construction of
that building could run anywhere from $10 million to $30 million,
according to Michael A. Miller, the chairman of the company's board
of trustees. ``We don't really know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are nothing new for Packer, whose energy and
determination tend to attract followers. Several of the company's
founders are still with her in the troupe's 23rd season, including
Dennis Krausnick, the director of training (and her husband); Kevin
G. Coleman, the director of education; John Hadden, a director, and
Mitchell Berenson, a trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Born near Birmingham, in northern England, Packer studied acting
at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, then joined the
Royal Shakespeare Company and performed often on BBC-TV. By the
time she was in her mid-30s, she had determined to start a
Shakespeare theater of her own, where she could train English and
American actors to understand and express the feelings behind
Shakespeare's language.The idea would combine the British approach
to the spoken word with the American freedom of physical action,
enlivened by Packer's probing of the language for emotional truth.
She based her studies in part on the acting techniques developed by
the well-known voice teacher Kristin Linklater, who would later
become one of the founders of Shakespeare &AMP; Company. After several
visits to the United States in the 1970s and the failure of her
first attempt to start a theater in England, Packer came upon the
boarded-up Wharton estate while on an exploratory trip through the
Berkshires in 1978. With her co-founders, she raised the money to
buy it and created two separate entities: the performing troupe
Shakespeare &AMP; Company and, eventually, Edith Wharton Restoration
Inc., which was set up to restore and maintain the historic house.
The chronicle of those early years is told in ``The Companies She
Keeps'' (1985), a book by Helen Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades of critical praise and increasing audiences followed
as Packer directed Shakespeare's plays on the outdoor mainstage
behind the Wharton house, developed an indoor stage at the former
stables and presented adaptations of Wharton's works in the Salon
Theater _ the author's parlor _ with tea and cookies served during
intermission. In the Shakespeare productions especially, readily
accessible language continued to be the goal.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 review of Shakespeare's ``Comedy of Errors'' by the
company at the estate, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times
that ``the spoken lines get more laughs than the sight gags.''
Brantley went on to say that ``the director, John Hadden, has also
provided the verbal and aural equivalents of funny costumes and
pratfalls: silly accents, divertingly varied rhythms of speech and
vocally highlighted phrases that force us to listen.'' The result,
Brantley wrote, was that ``you can understand every word'' because
language ``is the unyielding cornerstone for theatrical
interpretation here.''
</P>
<P>
   During its years at the Mount, the company also developed
year-round education and training programs about Shakespeare in
public and private schools mainly in New England. These involve
touring to schools, colleges and community centers; residencies at
schools; and training workshops for teachers and professional
actors. The faculty is drawn from the troupe's artists and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the success of its productions and programs, the
company _ and Packer _ became embroiled in a dispute over control
of the Wharton estate with the group that had been set up to
restore it. The bitter struggle mirrored the rivalries depicted in
many of Shakespeare's plays. After repeated clashes about the use
of the Mount, it had become obvious by 1998 that Shakespeare &AMP;
Company would have to find a new home. ``I never would have left
the Mount if I hadn't been pushed,'' Packer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always known,'' she continued, ``even if we had stayed
at the Mount, that we would have had to buy 50 acres next door to
connect our training and education programs and relate them to the
performances. But the fact that we now have this beautiful new
property means we can put all our energy into it _ and we have a
lot of energy. I think it's a great lesson. Out of adversity come
all sorts of good things.''

   The Kemble Street campus is a mixture of verdant meadow and lush
woodland, recalling Shakespeare's settings for ``As You Like It.''
The company began the move to the property in April, shifting its
administrative offices to a 1950s library building and its
rehearsals to Springlawn, and housing actors and students in
dormitories for the summer residential training programs.
</P>
<P>
   With the construction of two theaters _ the Salon Theater in
Springlawn and the larger Founders' Theater in a former gym _ the
company will have year-round producing capabilities for the first
time. Currently, the Lenox performances at the Mount are presented
from May to October.
</P>
<P>
   Among the productions now running in repertory at the Wharton
estate are ``Romeo and Juliet'' on the outdoor mainstage and
``Coriolanus,'' directed by Packer, alternating with ``Jack and
Jill,'' a contemporary play by Jane Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the new property has been supported in tangible ways
by private individuals as well as by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, which has recently distributed additional money to
support the arts in the western part of the state through a variety
of agencies. A tax-exempt revenue bond was issued by
Mass-Development, a state-chartered finance agency, which allowed
Shakespeare &AMP; Company to secure a low-interest mortgage; the state
Department of Environmental Management gave $500,000 to the company
in exchange for a preservation restriction on Springlawn and 15
surrounding acres; and $4.4 million has been received from private
donations, out of the $5.5 million needed. ``We'll have the rest in
hand by the end of the summer,'' Miller predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Packer has also found an ally in the British theater consultant
Iain Mackintosh, who will design the Founders' Theater (with the
American architect George E. Marsh Jr.) and plan the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh, whose optimism seems to match Packer's, designed the
Cottesloe space at the Royal National Theater in London and the
Glyndebourne Opera House, also helping save the remains of the Rose
when they were discovered in 1989 during excavations for a London
office building.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders' Theater will be modeled after Mackintosh's design
for the Tricycle Theater in Kilburn in northwest London, described
by Packer as ``a tough theater, made out of scaffolds and canvas, a
courtyard theater that can be used in two or three ways.'' In
addition, an open-air theater behind Springlawn is planned to
replace the outdoor mainstage space at the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tina said, `I want to build the Globe,''' Mackintosh
recalled, ``I said, `No, you want to build the Rose. We already
have a Globe.'' He was referring to the American actor Sam
Wanamaker's replica of the Elizabethan Globe theater that opened in
London in 1997 and that is larger than the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to build the Rose because we know more about it,''
Mackintosh said. ``Finding the foundations gave us the footprint of
the building, its size, dimensions and the way it was sited. The
Lenox Rose will hold 800 people, a good size for Shakespeare &AMP;
Company. But also good for the actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The original Rose was built by Philip Henslowe in 1587 and
flourished as the home of the first productions of plays by
Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd and Shakespeare, whose ``Henry VI,
Part 1'' and ``Titus Andronicus'' were staged there.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mackintosh will lead a team of British theater
scholars and builders to Lenox for a five-day seminar to advise
Shakespeare &AMP; Company about the Rose. Among the participants will
be Julian Bowsher, the archaeologist who headed the team that
excavated the Rose; Patrick Spottiswoode, director of the Globe
education programs; Peter McCurdy, master carpenter for the Globe,
and Andrew Gurr, a scholar who advised Wanamaker on the Globe's
design.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Epstein, one of Shakespeare &AMP; Company's veteran actors,
sees some changes ahead. ``Right now,'' he said, ``we have two ways
of acting: working on one of the largest stages in the world,
outdoors at the Mount, where we need a kind of ballistic style, and
working on one of the smallest, in the Salon, where you need a
style where delicacy is significant. These things won't be the same
in the new theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade, Packer envisions the Rose and the other
theaters operating at Kemble Street, along with a performance space
in the woods for dance, a media center containing a sound stage for
film, a library for scholarly conferences, and year-round
residential education and training programs on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope of the place feeds my imagination,'' the director
said with a broad grin. ``We'll have enough room to do all our
programming. You know, we're a very ambitious theater company.''

 &HT;    CLINTON 'MISTAKES' A DANGER FOR GORE, CARTER SAYS
 &HT;    By KATHEY PRUITT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In uncharacteristically blunt terms, former
President Jimmy Carter on Tuesday said President Clinton's
``mistakes'' in the White House are among the biggest liabilities
for Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, in a speech to Georgia's Democratic delegation,
described Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky in some of the
harshest terms heard this week. He said Gore has to distance
himself from the president's behavior while taking appropriate
credit for the administration's policy successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who believes (Gore) is responsible for what Bill
Clinton did in secret, at night, with a young intern, is absolutely
stupid and ridiculous,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't stand up as frankly as I did and explain to you, but
somehow in the American people's minds, he has to convince them of
that absolute truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Carter took swipes at Republicans, who he said
put on a ``false face'' by saying they care about education and
health care for the poor, elderly and minorities, but offer tax
breaks to benefit businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are successful,'' Carter said, ``because their propaganda
efforts are so professional and they put on a nice demeanor and
people believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ex-president turned down an opportunity to address the
Democratic National Convention, accepting instead a five-minute
film tribute Monday evening. But in nearly four dozen interviews in
recent days and a 15-minute address to his colleagues from Georgia,
Carter is weighing into the presidential contest to bolster Gore's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks Tuesday reminded those who may have forgotten that
the global problem-solver and humanitarian still has a partisan
streak hidden behind the friendly grin.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's relationship with the Clinton White House has been a
strained one through the years, with indications that the
administration didn't welcome Carter's intervention to resolve
tensions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter lavished praise on Gore, who made his first bid for
Congress the same year the Georgia peanut-farmer-turned-governor
made his initial bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, said Carter, ``is a man of absolute integrity'' who is
``just as loyal to his wife Tipper as I am to Rosalynn.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech punctuated by applause and three standing ovations,
Carter said Gore has to come out from under Clinton's shadow and
take credit for his role in pushing the country to economic
prosperity and better opportunities for minorities and the working
class. Carter called the convention a ``beautiful liberation of Al
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates lauded Carter's willingness to address what many said
will be a dilemma for the ticket, especially in conservative,
Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a former president gives him more license,'' said
Georgia state Rep. Doug Teper of Atlanta, a convention delegate.
``He doesn't have to sugar-coat it.''
</P>
<P>
   In carefully chosen words, Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor said Carter's
opinion ``reflects the opinion of a majority of Georgians and a
majority of Americans. We're disappointed in Clinton's personal
behavior, but also proud of his political accomplishments.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A surge of cooler, less humid air will reach the eastern Great
Lakes as a cold front pushes off the New England coast early
Wednesday. Showers and a few gusty thunderstorms will mark the
front's passage in the Northeast, but skies will become sunny from
Michigan to western Pennsylvania as drier air arrives on fresh
breezes from the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over Alabama will promote sultry conditions across
the South. A few thundershowers will form in Florida and near the
southern Appalachians. The remnants of Topical Storm Beryl will
produce heavy showers from the Rio Grande Valley into northern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms will drench the Dakotas and Minnesota
as hot, humid air moves north. Showers will reach into the Middle
West later on. Afternoon storms will develop over the Rockies, but
the Northwest will be bright, pleasant and a bit cooler.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE BERYL PERIL
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Beryl made landfall before daybreak Tuesday along
a desolate part of the northeast Mexico coast. The storm quickly
lost its wind circulation, but torrential rains persisted along the
coast. Even though Beryl is nothing more than a weak low pressure
system, its rich supply of tropical moisture continues to pose a
threat to the steep terrain of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Flash
flooding from dying tropical storms is an infamous hazard. On July
25-26, 1979, the remnants of Tropical Storm Claudette dropped 43
inches of rain on Alvin, Texas.

IN KASHMIR'S CAPITAL, INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY GETS LITTLE

<P>
   SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ Independence Day, as observed here Tuesday
in the unhappy summer capital of India's unhappiest state, was an
eerie kind of national holiday, with almost everyone staying
indoors, partly out of fear for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Their apprehensiveness had two sources: first, the militant
groups who are prone to protest Indian rule with explosive devices,
and second, the Indian security forces who are prone to treat the
masses as if they were the militants.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a third reason as well for ignoring the nationwide
festivities: Most people here don't consider themselves part of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Kashmiri, not an Indian,'' said Ghulam Mohammad, 64,
one of the few who emerged from his house to enjoy a balmy summer
day. ``We want our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a moment, allowing his emotions to be moderated by
his pessimism. ``But this will never happen,'' he said. ``India
will never let us go.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the prevailing sentiment in the Kashmir Valley, a place
of legendary beauty, and, for the past decade, unremitting
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir has been one
of the most violent places in the world with more than 25,000
people killed: by separatists who want their own homeland; by
Islamic holy warriors who believe India's only Muslim majority
state should be part of neighboring Pakistan; by Indian forces who
have tried to crush rebellion with the might of an occupying army.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, with all the paradoxes of an Independence Day among a
citizenry that thinks itself so oppressed, Srinagar was, more than
usually, a place of militarized vigilance, of rifle-toting soldiers
on every street, bunkers surrounded by sand bags, road blocks, drop
gates, speed bumps and car searches.
</P>
<P>
   The day's only official event was a morning ceremony in huge
Bakshi Stadium. In a rare bit of agreement, both the militants and
the military agreed that people should not attend. The militants
had called for a strike; the military cordoned off the area and
allowed no one near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to attend anyway?'' said K. Rajendra Kumar, the
deputy inspector general of the state police. His men were in
battle gear, his snipers peered down from windows. ``People are
afraid to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the stadium, Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah _ often
criticized in Srinagar as too close to New Delhi _ gave an
impassioned speech, his amplified words floating out across the
empty seats. His audience was mainly a brass band and army
regiments. The spectators in uniform overwhelmingly exceeded those
in plain clothes _ and those in plain clothes were mostly state
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian flag, a rare sight in Indian Kashmir, was
successfully hoisted. ``I hope to God that the kind of security
arrangements we have done today, we will not need to do again in
the future,'' Abdullah said later.
</P>
<P>
   There was a second ceremonial flag-raising, this time by the
Indian border security force. They raised the nation's tricolor
banner above the clock tower in Lal Chowk, ordinarily a teeming
bazaar in the center of the city but nearly deserted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   K. Vijay Kumar, who heads the border force in Srinagar, made a
good attempt at normalcy. He smiled broadly, ``Come, have a cup of
tea,'' he said to a bevy of photographers there to capture the
feeble pageantry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the soldiers on patrol, including the border force, are
not Kashmiris. Their presence is resented, sometimes even by the
local police.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been brutally massacred for the past 10
years-economically, militarily, spiritually,'' said a deputy
superintendent of police. ``All that people are interested in now
is peace, whichever way it can come. But no one is making a sincere
effort at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, just three weeks ago, rare optimism surged through
Kashmir. One of the main militant groups, the Hizbul Mujahadeen,
had declared a three-month cease fire. The Indian government agreed
to open preliminary peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden turn seemed to surprise many of those involved, most
notably Pakistan, one of the Hizbul's patrons; other militant
groups, who declared the Hizbul traitorous; and even some of the
Hizbul leadership itself, who began to complicate the unconditional
cease-fire with difficult conditions. They finally issued an
ultimatum, and, by August 8 deemed peace to have had enough of a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Killing has since resumed its rigorous pace. And indeed,
Independence Day was expected to be marked in blood. Little
violence was reported, however, something the security forces
attributed to their own wariness and circumspection.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the bombing of a train did claim at least 10
lives, but that was in the state of Uttar Pradesh and was most
likely the work of anti-national elements with concerns entirely
different from those in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute actually has its roots in independence. In
1947, when Pakistan and India were carved from the British Empire,
both of the infant countries felt a rightful claim to the princely
state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Among their first acts of nationhood was to fight a war, which
left India with about two-thirds of the most populous part of the
territory and Pakistan with the rest _ a situation that has proven
unsatisfactory to all involved.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, orating in Bakshi Stadium, pointed out that the
conflict was now all the more perilous, with India and Pakistan
possessing nuclear weapons. He beseeched Pakistan to stop
supporting militants in ``cross-border terrorism.'' And, as his
voice disappeared into the emptiness, he insisted that ``friendship
must be better than threatening each other with atomic bombs.''

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
at submarine rescue, and, unlike the Russians, they have
professional crews and professional people who are trained for
submarine rescues.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that
can conduct rescue operations in depths of up to 2,000 feet and
evacuate up to 24 crewmembers at a time. Britain has put a similar
deep search and rescue submarine on standby.
</P>
<P>
   If a request is officially made Wednesday, Weaver estimated that
rescue crews from NATO nations could be at the site by early
Thursday, providing teams enough time to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have been careful not to raise hopes too far.
The undersea evacuation is a complex maneuver made far more
difficult by the violent weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue teams Tuesday night launched a second attempt
to reach the submarine with a capsule capable of bringing men to
the surface in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the
capsule from the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineer,'' Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said there might have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the submarine's nose, sending it crashing to the sea
bottom. An explosion inside the torpedo chamber, which contains
warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties, analysts
said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed off
in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate the submarine
if several compartments, including the control center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. ``It is difficult for the ships to hold their course. All the
ships and the capsule should be ds are still high. But the current
is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Theand also listing sharply to one side. As a result, the
capsules and other devices are sliding off the vessel's hull, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailors'
lives. ``Our lack of knowledge about the fate of the crew has
marked all our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late
Saturday or early Sunday.

   MEXICO-CHIAPAS-$ADV20_ From the tropical coast to the Mayan
highlands, the fever for political change _ through ballots, not
bullets _ is sweeping Mexico's Chiapas state. On Sunday, Aug. 20,
the state famous for its armed Zapatista Mayan Indian rebels will
elect a new governor. In the wake of Vicente Fox's historic
opposition victory in last month's presidential election, polls
show that change could be contagious: Even in Indian communities
once under tight control by the ruling party, posters for a Fox
ally are up on dirt-floor homes. An old man wearing a ruling party
shirt says he's not so sure he'll vote for that party now. Chiapans
appear to be slightly favoring Pablo Salazar, a former ruling party
member who is now representing an alliance that includes Fox's
conservative National Action Party and the left-wing Democratic
Revolution Party. If Salazar wins, one of the main reasons for the
Zapatistas rising in protest is eliminated. Mexico's ruling party
would be ousted from a state infamous for its ruling-party
corruption and grinding social inequality. A historic new
Fox-Salazar combination would be in place that could usher in new
negotiations with the rebels. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

   TWINS _WHITE PLAINS, N.C. _ To the world and to this day, they
are mostly objects of curiosity _ Chang and Eng, the conjoined
brothers whose May 1811 birth in Siam also spawned the phrase
``Siamese twins.'' But in the northwestern corner of North Carolina
where they settled some 30 years later, they have always been the
Bunker brothers _ hard-working tobacco farmers who married sisters,
fathered 21 children between them and lived utterly ordinary,
small-town lives. Officials recently renamed a bridge after the
twins on the White Plains farm where they lived and are buried.
Still, locals don't quite understand the outside world's
fascination with the twins, which has only grown with the
publication this summer of New Yorker Darin Strauss' acclaimed
novel ``Chang and Eng.'' To the folks who showed up at Strauss'
booksignings last week in nearby Mount Airy and Wilkesboro, and to
the1,000-plus descendants who gathered for one of their
semi-regular reunions in White Plains Saturday, it's actually a
pretty familiar story around these parts: The one about strong
family bonds. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ABORIGINE-ART _ Thirty years ago, an art professor encouraged a

popular form of folk art that has become synonymous with Australia
and will figure prominently in the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival. We
look at the field, which has interesting parallels with the artwork
that won praise at the last Olympics: Southern folk art.

RETRO OR NOSTALGIC, THE ARTWORK NEVER STOPS MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British art scene is so heady with hype, gimmickry
and self-promotion these days that it comes as something of a
relief to discover the long-lost world of kinetic art at the
Hayward Gallery on the south bank of the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   True, not very long ago, from the 1920s to the early 1980s,
moving art was also trendy. Yet today it seems dated, rooted in
another age. In presenting ``Force Fields: Phases of the Kinetic,''
the Hayward has dared to be uncool.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the exhibition, which was seen last spring at the Museum
of Contemporary Art in Barcelona and will run here through Sept.
17, is more than just educational for the young and nostalgic for
the less young. It offers a journey through a world in which time
and space are redefined by the simple (and at times complex)
addition of movement. It is funny, clever, bizarre, hallucinatory
and strangely uplifting. But it is not quiet: Movement in art also
produces bangs and bongs galore.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting some 100 works by 40 artists, the show's curator,
Guy Brett, has interpreted the term ``kinetic art'' to suit his
purposes. Although he does not include video or electronic art,
which does move, he includes paintings, drawings and sculptures
that do not move or, rather, do so only metaphorically. The heart
of the show is nonetheless dedicated to wonderful contraptions that
turn, stretch, tremble, swing and float.
</P>
<P>
   Brett sees the exhibition as an opportunity to reawaken public
interest in the ``language of movement'' and, above all, to lift
kinetic art from what he considers undeserved obscurity. Museums
display little kinetic art, he laments, while, by definition, still
photographs of moving objects published in books and magazines
cannot capture the most distinctive feature of this work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this impoverished visibility,'' he wrote in a catalog
essay, ``must be added the tendency to treat the historical
phenomenon known as Kinetic Art as a kind of sideshow, or
entertainment, in 20th-century art, not to be treated with the same
high seriousness as, say, Minimal Art, Conceptual Art, or for that
matter Pop Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, much of the work produced was pedestrian and boring, but
that is true of any movement, and the result has been that the
radical implications of the best work for the evolution of art have
been ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the rare occasion to present kinetic art in two large
galleries in two major cities, then, Brett has gone for the best.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with ``Rotary Glass Plates,'' a precursor of Op
Art made by Marcel Duchamp with Man Ray in 1925, in which four
blades spin on a shaft to create the illusion of a solid circle
decorated with circular lines. Also from the 1920s is Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy's magical ``Light-Space Modulator,'' a ``spatial
kaleidoscope,'' in his words, in which two arc lights create
silhouettes of a rotating mechanical object that is itself alive
with moving parts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby are three of Alexander Calder's earliest mobiles, ``A
White Ball, a Black Ball'' and two ``Untitled,'' delicate as ever,
gently stirred by the movement of visitors, defining space but also
representing space.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of my abstract work,'' Calder wrote, ``even
when it might not have seemed so, I felt there was no better model
to choose than the universe. Spheres of different sizes, densities,
colors and volumes, floating in space, traversing clouds, sprays of
water, currents of air, viscosities and odors of the greatest
variety and disparity.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as Brett proposes, artists as well as scientists create
``models of the universe,'' two of the artists in the show built
theirs with outside assistance. The inspiration for Henri Michaux's
``Mescaline Drawings'' is self-evident, while Wols (the name
adopted by Alfred Wolfgang Schulze) etched under the influence of
old-fashioned liquor. James Whitney's hand-drawn animated films
``Yanta'' and ``Lapis,'' made in the 1950s and '60s, take their cue
from yoga and Eastern philosophy to create what resembles an
LSD-induced cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Op Art resurfaces in Francois Morellet's so-called ``mesh''
paintings, with tiny designs endlessly repeated to the point that
they move with the eye. Jesus Rafael Soto and Pol Bury both capture
movement in their paintings, but also, more realistically, in their
installations. Soto's ``Penetrable'' is a dense forest of dangling
plastic filaments through which visitors can walk; Bury's kinetic
works include ``Punctuation (White Dots)'' in which a clutch of
painted nylon threads sprouting from a wooden board slowly rotate.
</P>
<P>
   Two artists in particular, though, show why the 1950s and 1960s
were the heyday of kinetic art. Jean Tinguely's approach was to
satirize the consumer society by building immense sculptures of
industrial detritus, all set into comical and noisy motion by a
series of electric motors. Indeed, these are works that only make
sense when they come to life. Of the five Tinguelys in this show,
``Baluba XII,'' made in 1961-62, captures on a small scale what he
later tried to achieve in his later monumental sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Takis, now 75, has long tapped
electromagnetic energy, using this force to create a cosmos of
metal objects in suspended animation, as with his ``Telemagnetic
Sculptures'' and ``Ballet Magnetique,'' which are among 23 of his
pieces on display here. One charming work is ``Musical'' (1974), in
which three foot-long metal ``needles'' hang from a board and are
drawn by magnetic impulses to strike horizontal metal wires. The
resulting bongs echo through the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   These compete with the whacks emanating from Len Lye's
``Blade,'' in which a trembling vertical steel blade is repeatedly
hit by a wooden hammer. An almost otherworldly sound is created by
his ``Universe,'' a large band of polished steel resting on a
magnetized base that bends and lurches in response to interrupted
magnetic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the cosmos becomes even more real for visitors
entering Gianni Colombo's ``Elastic Space,'' a large dark cube
crossed by vertical and horizontal strings that are pulled in
different directions to disrupt all sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes nonmoving works by artists like Yves
Klein, Sol LeWitt, Georges Vantongerloo, Sergio Camargo and Lygia
Clark as well as more orthodox kinetic pieces by Gerhard von
Graevenitz, Dieter Roth, Grazia Varisco and Liliane Lijn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if ``Force Fields'' inevitably looks backward, the youngest
living artist in the show, 58-year-old David Medalla of the
Philippines, is clearly immune to what is considered fashionable.
Among his works on display is ``Cloud Gates,'' a large installation
that stands on an outside terrace. This work creates large bubble
clouds that catch the wind and float away over London. It is proof
enough that something is moving in the Hayward.

 CHRON  
 A Great City Forced To Skip Lunch: Computer Age takes a bit out  of
tranditional midday meal.   By Kim Severson  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Lunch in the Bay Area is dead _ or at least on
life support.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No need to tell that to vending machine mechanic Luis De La O.
All day, on a route that includes offices from Petaluma to Palo
Alto, he stands witness to what remains of the traditional lunch
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going anywhere except down the hall to the
machines,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   De La O often doesn't have time to break at noon, either. On a
recent Tuesday, he grabbed a slice at Blondie's Pizza on Powell
Street, where 15 minutes is considered a long lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Across Market Street, in the halls of Bay Area dot-com
businesses, stopping to eat is considered a time suck, a ritual for
losers who simply don't have enough to do. Although people may go
to restaurants on special occasions, the lunch business is fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the dot-com environment here in SOMA, lunch is
irrelevant,'' says Jennifer Griffin, a 23-year-old Internet media
planner with Bravo Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   When she and her colleagues get hungry, they don't go to a
restaurant; they order in or go to the kitchen and feed on an
endless stream of company-supplied snacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything from cookies to java to Rice Krispies
treats to every cereal imaginable. We've got M&AMP;Ms . . . you name
it,'' Griffin says. ``Things get hectic and you can't just go eat
lunch _ it's critical to be in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bye Bye Business Lunch &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For those of you eating at your desks right now, it will come as
no surprise that the lunch hour has been shrinking for much of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The time people spend on a lunch break is down to 38 minutes _ a
number that's expected to continue to drop, according to a study of
eating habits published recently in Food Technology magazine. About
half of the people who responded to a 1999 National Restaurant
Association survey said they had less time for lunch than they used
to. And 40 percent said they don't usually take a real lunch break.
Only a quarter bring lunch from home.
</P>
<P>
   Even that most hallowed institution, the expense-account lunch,
is fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power lunch went out with Gordon Gecko and slicked-back
hair,'' says Jennifer Johnson, a Utah-based authority on virtual
offices and telecommuting. ``More and more, people see lunch as one
of those trappings of the traditional bricks-and-mortar
environment. It's so restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   At Stars, where the 1980s power lunch was perhaps not invented
but certainly perfected, the lunch of the new millennium is a more
sober _ and shorter _ affair. On average, people spend about 50
minutes at lunch, says managing partner Stanley Morris. The menu is
simpler _ ``things they don't need to put a lot of thought into.''
By 1:30 p.m., tables are often empty.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Theoharis, president of the San Francisco Planning
Commission and longtime Stars diner, notes the tone and purpose of
lunch has changed. ``The power lunch here used to be to schmooze
people, but now people are so busy you use lunch to get some work
done. After a hearing or a meeting with the mayor, you still come
here. But it's much faster and much more about business. And nobody
drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of changing habits, several Bay Area restaurants
have simply given up. Pintxos, a Basque restaurant in the Mission,
opened for lunch just before Christmas 1999, but stopped serving a
couple months later. It was a big stretch for the kitchen and
wasn't worth the money, says co-owner Pablo Zubicaray.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a common one as restaurants grapple with high labor
costs, shorter lunch hours and fewer midday customers.
</P>
<P>
   Says Stars' Morris: ``More and more restaurants are realizing
lunch is a losing proposition. Once they accept it has no value to
them, it takes a lot of stress off a restaurant. It's like you can
hear a lot of sighs of relief from chefs when they decide to stop
lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, restaurants that are national darlings simply can't
make a go of it. For example, Spruce, one of the city's best
restaurants located only a couple of blocks from busy Michigan
Avenue, dropped midday service shortly after starting it.
</P>
<P>
   And if more upscale restaurants haven't dropped lunch, they're
certainly trying everything to appeal to people who simply don't
have much time to eat anymore. At Seattle's tony Painted Table,
where dinner can take two or three hours, the owners are pushing
``express lunches'' which allow people to be out in 45 minutes or
less.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Bennigan's chain touts its popular ``Time Crunch
Lunch.'' If lunch doesn't arrive within 15 minutes of being
ordered, it's free, well-done steaks excepted. The whole thing is
timed with a tabletop stopwatch.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, places like Le Bernardin, a top-drawer French
seafood restaurant, promotes a lunch guaranteed to be served in 30
minutes for $32.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What Killed Lunch? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the traditional lunch hour is tied to the
technological revolution. A set lunch hour mattered when much of
America was working on assembly lines or in buttoned-down offices.
But because technology has changed the rhythm of the work day and
the new online economy is changing corporate culture, workers do
not march to the schedule of the factory or corporate norms.
</P>
<P>
   And workdays will only continue to get more flexible. The U.S.
Department of Labor estimates that by 2020, 40 percent of the
workforce will be telecommuting. As people have more control over
their workday and have the technological flexibility to do their
jobs outside of the 9-to-5 framework, they can eat when they want
to.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, assuming everyone takes a lunch break at noon can hurt
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to stop at noon,'' says Bravo Marketing's
Griffin. When it's noon here, she explains, it's 3 p.m. on the East
Coast. By the time you get back to the office, they're closing up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Business is still conducted over food, but is more likely to be
a quick meeting for coffee in the morning. If a deal is to be
clinched or celebrated, it's over dinner. If business needs to be
done over lunch, food is often brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Catering and delivery services are thriving. Fernando Hidalgo,
marketing vice president for Waiters on Wheels, says his company's
lunch delivery business has jumped 30 percent over the last two
years. The story is the same for Randy Negi, who owns the casual
Cafe Venue on Market Street. His lunch business has taken a
dramatic upswing in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These dot-commers on the other side of Market, we're
delivering every day down there. They're ordering lunch for their
whole staff. Sixty sandwiches, 30 salads _ big orders. That's where
a lot of my business is coming from now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The New Lunch &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But don't cancel that lunch reservation just yet. As the
traditional working person's lunch hour crashes and burns, a new
trend is rising from the ashes. People are saving up time and money
to arrange occasional meals out with friends or quiet midday
getaways for themselves. The notion of lunch as a pleasurable
pursuit _ call it the restorative lunch _ is slowly starting to
catch on.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Reichl, Gourmet magazine editor and former food critic for
the New York Times, confesses that lunch is often a quick snack at
her desk in Manhattan. But like an increasing number of people, she
will skip lunch a few days a week and instead take one long,
relaxing food-focused meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is basically have lunch or don't have lunch,'' she
says. ``I would rather have a pint of yogurt at my desk and save up
all the time for one great leisurely meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Caraher, president of the San Francisco online firm Red
Whistle Communications, has abandoned power lunches. Instead, she
uses lunch to celebrate, to relax or to reward employees. Aqua or
Rubicon are favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the Tadich Grill, for decades a classic San Francisco
destination for business, people are eating for pleasure. Anna
Lingley, an insurance company worker who used to go to Tadich only
for business, now uses it as treat. Once a month or so, she and
friend will go to Tadich or another restaurant and have a proper
luncheon. ``Lunch for me is a break away from the world. That's
what I value now. I'm not into rushing through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new approach allows people to discover favorite neighborhood
restaurants, call a friend for a picnic or simply get outside and
take time for themselves in the middle of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Luis De La O is usually too busy fixing vending
machines to break away, he sometimes finds time to grab an hour to
sit in a park and relax.
</P>
<P>
   When he does, he's likely to find people like Sophia Genetti, a
26-year-old temporary worker, who often spends her lunch break
reading at Yerba Buena Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people I know are taking time out for themselves to
meditate or have a really nice lunch some place,'' she says. ``It's
much nicer this way, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Lunch Isn't Like It Once Was &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How lunch came to be has to do more with class, gender and
nationality than with the biological need to eat.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle Ages, most people ate four or five meals a day to
keep up their strength, but the upper classes ate only two meals a
day. Regardless of class, the big meal of the day came at midday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th and 17th centuries, the word ``luncheon'' literally
meant a hunk of cheese or bread, or perhaps a small bit of leftover
meat. These sort of snacks were often eaten in the middle of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch as we know it today has its roots in the behavior of the
Western European elite of the 1700s and 1800s. They began pushing
back the time for both supper and dinner, until in some circles
supper was eaten at 4 or 5 p.m. and dinner late at night after the
theater. A light midday meal became fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1800s in Great Britain and certain parts of
America, only ladies of leisure ate an elaborate, formal luncheon.
Businessmen and professionals ate a big breakfast and big dinner
and little in between. The poorer classes and children still ate
their main meal in the middle of the day and called it supper.
</P>
<P>
   Because breakfasts tended to be large in Britain, luncheon was
light. And one never called it lunch _ that would be considered
vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the midday meal, called  &LR; dejeuner &LR; , took a different
form. The word comes from the Latin phrase for breaking a fast, or
breakfast. At first, when the French were in the habit of eating a
larger, elaborate dinner around noon, it referred to the first meal
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But around the time of the French Revolution, when government
meetings began at midday and ended around 6 p.m., lawmakers started
eating a substantial, late breakfast to get them through the day.
Cafes in the early 1800s started to set food out around 11 a.m. to
accommodate the government schedule, and the French business lunch
was born.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., lunch has taken many forms. From the early 20th
century's hustling, packed lunch counters and cafeterias and
regimented lunch breaks of factory workers, the American midday
meal has been a harried affair for many.
</P>
<P>
   For others, particularly those of the middle and upper classes,
lunch was a more formal affair. Women in the 1940s and '50s who
were generally not part of the work force fostered a
post-Depression, post-war luncheon boom, and American business
during the period was built on the three-martini lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s and early '90s were the era of the power lunch _
business lunches where the restaurants and dining companions were
of utmost importance.

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
at submarine rescue, and, unlike the Russians, they have
professional crews and professional people who are trained for
submarine rescues.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that
can conduct rescue operations in depths of up to 2,000 feet and
evacuate up to 24 crewmembers at a time. Britain has put a similar
deep search and rescue submarine on standby.
</P>
<P>
   If a request is officially made Wednesday, Weaver estimated that
rescue crews from NATO nations could be at the site by early
Thursday, providing teams enough time to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have been careful not to raise hopes too far.
The undersea evacuation is a complex maneuver made far more
difficult by the violent weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue teams Tuesday night launched a second attempt
to reach the submarine with a capsule capable of bringing men to
the surface in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the
capsule from the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineer,'' Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said there might have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the submarine's nose, sending it crashing to the sea
bottom. An explosion inside the torpedo chamber, which contains
warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties, analysts
said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed off
in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate the submarine
if several compartments, including the control center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. ``It is difficult for the ships to hold their course. All the
ships and the capsule should be directed at a certain angle to
ensure less resistance to the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storms have calmed down somewhat, although waves are still
high. But the current is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine is tilted on the seabed, with its bow pointing
down, is absolutely stupid and ridiculous,'' Carter said. (Pruitt,

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ Buffeted by storms, Russian rescuers
battled for a second day to reach 116 sailors trapped in a crippled
nuclear submarine on the sea floor, repeatedly trying to lower an
escape capsule to the stricken vessel. Efforts to rescue the Kursk,
lying motionless below the surface of the Barents Sea, were
hampered most of Tuesday by high winds and strong currents. There
had been no communication with the submarine since it went down,
and conditions inside were not known. It wasn't clear how much air
the crew had left and water appeared to be leaking in, officials
said. (Summary from wires) By Sabrina Tavernise and Christopher

   BRITAIN-CONCORDE (London) _ British Airways grounded its entire
fleet of Concorde supersonic airliners on Tuesday after French and
British investigators said they would urge the withdrawal of the
airplane's airworthiness certification following last month's fatal
Air France Concorde crash near Paris. It would be the first time in
more than 20 years that an airworthiness certificate for a
commercial airliner had been revoked by any country. The
investigators said they would not spell out their reasoning until
Wednesday, and so it was unclear what steps would have to be taken
to reverse the recommendation. By Alan Cowell.

adults they knew until now only as children. Wives steeled
themselves to meet husbands long since wedded to other spouses, and
vice versa. And underlying all the carefully choreographed drama,
custom-made for tear-jerking footage and heartbreaking copy _
indeed, making it possible _ was the surprisingly sophisticated
political maneuvering of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. By

federal investigation into Russian and Italian organized crime in
the ports of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., turned up the expected mix
of mundane mob staples: extortion, cigarette smuggling, money
laundering. But federal agents said they also came across a bit of
criminal enterprise that, for pure creative corruption, struck them
as remarkable: a loose-knit web of companies was smuggling tens of
millions of gallons of American-made grain alcohol _ including
millions of gallons from one of the country's oldest distilleries _
to Eastern Europe to slake a seemingly boundless thirst for that
most Russian of spirits, vodka. By William K. Rashbaum.

WOMEN OF EXPERIENCE AND ELECTRICITY GRAB THE SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ ``Look at me!''
</P>
<P>
   The words, echoing what every performer on a stage asks on one
level or another, are sung with particularly sweet
self-satisfaction by the three title characters of ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' the splashy, hard-working new West End musical, in the
show's concluding anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Since these are creatures who have already hovered perilously
over the audience in midair _ rather like the falling chandelier in
that earlier gothic musical ``The Phantom of the Opera'' _ it seems
unwise to ignore their request for attention. If ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' which has few substantial thoughts in its head, has a
moral, it is that you should never underestimate the power of being
female, 40-ish and sexually ripe.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be the lesson of London theater in general
this summer, with midlife resurrections translating into big box
office and widely varied degrees of artistic success. On the stage,
at least, women rule, and not the fantastical, mannered Mames and
Dollys who have traditionally governed musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mackintosh, the spectacle-loving producer of
``Witches,'' wasn't out of his mind when he chose a trio of
questing middle-aged heroines as a humanizing addition to his
signature series of identifiable flying objects, heirs to the
chandelier in ``Phantom'' and the helicopter in ``Miss Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the holdover musical smash from last season, the
endearingly clunky ``Mamma Mia!,'' features an amateur trio of
female singers who reunite 20 years after their salad days to
perform the disco-era hits of Abba, the Swedish pop group. The
stoutest of them now has difficulty falling to her knees in rock
'n' roll fervor as she once did. But that doesn't mean she can't
court a fellow with all-out sexual aggressiveness in the
showstopping ``Take a Chance on Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The robust British veteran Barbara Dickson (``Blood Brothers'')
copped the 1999 Olivier Award for best actress as the life-scarred
but enduringly lusty heroine of ``Spend Spend Spend,'' a purely
British slice of tough sentimentality based on the
good-luck/hard-luck story of the lottery winner Vivian Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   And the most coveted ticket in London still belongs to ``The
Graduate.'' The popularity of this cardboard adaptation of Mike
Nichols' 1967 film would seem to rest almost entirely on a
20-second display of full frontal nudity by the play's jaded
seductress, Mrs. Robinson, after dropping a bath towel. Replicas of
the towel, please note, can be purchased for about $40 in the
theater lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The role, first essayed by Kathleen Turner with a commanding
deadpan languor that edged into camp, was recently taken over by
the ex-model (and ex-wife of Mick Jagger) Jerry Hall, with the
attendant press coverage threatening to eclipse that of that
 &UR; really  &LR; older woman, the Queen Mother, on her centennial.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime the glorious Helen Mirren, a stage and screen
siren in her 50s who somehow looked well seasoned even in first
youth, has turned a more somber analysis of an older woman involved
with a younger man, Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending,''
into a must-see production at the Donmar Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Theater, unlike film, has traditionally been hospitable to women
well past their ingenue years. And musicals in particular remain a
sort of Never Never Land where actresses are as unlikely to grow
old as Peter Pan, the eternal boy portrayed by Mary Martin when she
was in her 40s.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening in London, however, is a firm departure from
Martin's doing Peter or the aging Katherine Cornell as Juliet. John
Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe, the lyricist and composer, respectively,
for ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' dwell at length in their program
notes on their attempts to make their heroines ``women in the
truest sense'' in ways they ``generally aren't in musicals these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Hall's hairdresser confided to The Evening Standard,
``Nowadays it's not about looking younger; it's about looking as
good as possible for yourself.'' It seems apt that the most
glamorous photographic image to be found in London subway cars
these days is the honey blonde who gazes confidently from an
advertisement for a menopausal vitamin supplement. And in one of
several editorial essays occasioned by Hall's appearance in ``The
Graduate,'' the novelist Fay Weldon, writing in The Daily Mail,
suggested that harsh criticism of the actress might stem from
today's young people ``feeling threatened by the new `older
women''' and their ``general refusal to lie down and grow old
gracefully.''
</P>
<P>
   That the stuff of theater is also the stuff of newspaper debates
and subway ads testifies to the abidingly vital dialogue here
between the stage and the broader national culture. It is an
exchange that New Yorkers _ whose Broadway theater tends to have
the immediate relevance of the medieval rooms of the Metropolitan
Museum _ can only envy.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even as the West End, at the height of both the
silly season and the tourist-courting season, takes on an American
accent to match that of much of its audience, with no fewer than
four major shows _ ``Witches,'' ``The Graduate,'' Tennessee
Williams' ``Baby Doll'' and the recently departed ``Singin' in the
Rain'' _ adapted from Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly the London theater is not unswayed by vulgar commercial
calculation. (Think of those Mrs. Robinson towels.) The current
apotheosis of the older woman surely has something to do with that
favorite science of marketers, demographics, and an awareness that
baby boom audience members, with their children growing up and
their expendable income expanding, are worth catering to. This is
also the summer in which BBC television is devoting 10 weeks to
celebrating the 1970s.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Such systematic nostalgia was anticipated by the hugely
successful ``Mamma Mia!,'' which opened last year under the
astutely naive-seeming direction of Phyllida Lloyd. The show taps
into affection for the disco era with a blithe ingenuity that
thoroughly shames the leaden stage version of ``Saturday Night
Fever.'' ``Mamma Mia!,'' the story of a single mother and the
grown-up, soon-to-be-married daughter who wants to discover just
who her father is, breezily mines this generation gap in sexual
attitudes while cramming in 22 songs first performed by Abba.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect is of a group of jolly tourists in a karaoke
bar, a feeling compounded by the show's setting, a taverna on a
Greek island. The audience inevitably loosens up in this holiday
atmosphere, and when its three middle-aged leading ladies show up
in full Abba regalia to perform ``Dancin' Queen,'' it seems as if
everyone, on stage and off, is happily drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Another trio of harmonizing female friends of roughly the same
age is at the center of ``Witches,'' Mackintosh's bid to secure his
slipping crown as the world's pre-eminent producer of musicals.
Here he de-emphasizes the technological spectacle of his glory
years, presenting instead a character-driven show that deliberately
recalls American musicals of the late 1950s and early '60s, like
``Damn Yankees'' and ``Bye Bye Birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   As staged by Eric Schaeffer, the show still hasn't settled on a
convincing, consistent tone. Both the moody comic darkness of John
Updike's novel and the opulent silliness of the movie it inspired
have been more or less jettisoned. The approach instead veers
between straightforward, sometimes sour satire of small-town
small-mindedness (accented by the set designer Bob Crowley's acidic
evocations of a Norman Rockwell world) and stirring hymns to
feminist self-empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   The satire is old hat and not terribly funny, trying to trade on
affection for a vanished American idyll even as it sends it up. Nor
is Ian McShane, making his musical debut, the ideal choice for the
devil who brings out the woman in each of the witches, a part
played on screen by Jack Nicholson with his trademark mixture of
loutishness and sly, suave charm. McShane, best known here as
television's antiques-savvy detective, Lovejoy, expertly conveys
the loutishness but not the charm, making the women who fall for
him look desperate indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The show's true magic is generated by the witches themselves,
played by Lucie Arnaz, Maria Friedman and Joanna Riding, and
Dempsey and Rowe find their original voice when they are writing
for them. Friedman's Sukie, who has a delightful, self-defining
tongue twister of a number about being tongue-tied, emerges as the
evening's most complete creation.
</P>
<P>
   The other two are undeniably appealing, though, with Arnaz's
easy, earthy sensuality, and Riding giving appetizing bite to the
cliche of the prim woman who takes off her glasses and becomes a
sexpot. They are all at their strongest in their numbers together,
deftly proving the show's rather labored point that sisterhood can
indeed be powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon vision of Americans as shrill bigots and grubby
materialists, so dear to the hearts of the English, is on pointed
display in ``The Graduate,'' ``The Witches of Eastwick'' and to a
lesser extent in the popular import from the Birmingham Repertory
Theater, ``Baby Doll.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Bailey's stage adaption of the 1956 movie turns Williams'
tale of a slow-witted child bride of the South (Charlotte Emmerson,
with a crawling drawl) and the vengeful Italian immigrant (Jonathan
Cake) who seduces her into a steam-heated sermon in intolerance.
Willliams' Southerners have never seemed so grossly feebleminded,
while Cake's crafty Sicilian is a gleaming paragon of wit and
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand there is the occasional London production of
an American play that gets everything so right that you feel
slightly embarrassed by memories of recent versions of the same
work back home. Most conspicuously there is Howard Davies'
lacerating production of ``All My Sons'' at the Royal National
Theater, which brings an emotional tension to Arthur Miller's
postwar morality tale that reduces many of those watching it to
sobs. Julie Walters and James Hazeldine lead a high-powered cast
that conveys every painful ounce of the toll exacted by a
life-warping deception.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Nicholas Hytner's refreshingly restrained take on
``Orpheus Descending,'' a work memorably rediscovered just over a
decade ago here in Peter Hall's production with Vanessa Redgrave.
As Lady Torrance, the love-mangled Italian shopkeeper in a
Mississippi town, Mirren doesn't attempt to top Redgrave's all-out
operatic grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she creates a meticulously layered portrait in which a
wary bitterness conceals a wellspring of hopeful sensuality, just
as the character's Italian inflections keeps slipping through the
imposed Southern accent. The delicacy of this lady's gradual
blossoming sets the tone for an exceptionally intimate ``Orpheus''
that emphasizes existential loneliness rather than erotic tragedy
as the work's central theme, the sense of people sentenced to
``solitary confinement inside our own skins for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words come from the problematic hero of ``Orpheus,'' that
virile guitar-strumming poet of the flesh, Val Xavier. Williams
originally wanted Marlon Brando to play Val (he finally did in the
movie version), and every actor who has tried the role has been
measured against that unmatchable image. In this version the part
belongs to Stuart Townsend, a lissome, faintly androgynous young
man and not an obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   But when you watch this Val responding to the women, you're
aware of how intensely he focuses on them, as though no one else
existed, and how sexy that can be. Few things make a person
flourish more than the undivided attention of others. It is perhaps
simply being in the spotlight for a change that makes those witches
of Eastwick fly.

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said. edo chamber, which contains warheads, would probably have
caused extensive casualties, analysts said. Navy officials said
casualties could not be ``ruled out,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were floodeds that can
be sealed off in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate
the submarine if several compartments, including the control
center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a teland also listing sharply to one
side. As a result, the capsules and other devices are sliding off
the vessel's hull, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailorsarked
all our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late
Saturday or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the
Russian fleet, was commissioned only five years ago and
representssia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to
the environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the
reactor that powers its engines had been shut down. Officials in
Norway said there was no sign of a radiation leak.

 &HT;    Soft colors, pleasing music and stimulating scents help kids
learn, teachers say
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rose is not just a rose these days. In some schools, it's also
a scent that goes straight through the schnozz and keeps kids from
snoozing and schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's sonatas help kids learn, too, and rap makes their
neurons snap. Peppermints also stimulate young brains; so does
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brain-based learning'' is all the New Age rage as the 2000-01
school year gets under way. The idea: Scents, sweets, sounds,
colors, lighting, water and other inputs produce various responses
in young brains, and can be orchestrated to make them more
receptive to learning.
</P>
<P>
   The research behind the theory is not all rock-solid, and the
state Department of Education doesn't take a position on it. Yet
hundreds of metro teachers are convinced, and some schools and
school systems offer seminars to instruct educators in the methods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stimuli being used in classrooms: peppermint candy
(sugar and mint to invigorate); water bottles (to hydrate);
aromatherapy (to rouse or calm, depending on the scent); dim
lighting (to calm and focus); music (ditto) and walls painted in
subdued colors (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   Tomi Hall, a fifth-grade teacher at Winnona Park Elementary in
Decatur, Ga., plugs in vanilla-scent-producing gadgets, which she
says have a calming effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what I like most is classical music,'' she says. ``It's
wonderful, especially when they're doing math. It helps them relax,
focus and reduces stress. It works.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bacnik, a Putnam County, Ga., elementary school teacher,
starts every year by making sure his walls are painted in subdued
colors (he favors dusty rose for its calming influence) and that
lighting is dim (he'll even hang light-filtering curtains). When
school starts, he arrives early to switch on music, usually Mozart
or Handel, with ``tempos at the pace of a relaxed heartbeat.'' He
avoids music with melodies and lyrics, which can be distracting.
</P>
<P>
   He also hands out peppermints and makes sure lights are placed
on individual desks, eschewing traditional flourescent bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Kyunghae Shin, a third-grade teacher at Avondale Elementary in
DeKalb, Ga., makes sure each child has a bottle of water. Before
standardized tests, she hands out small cups filled with raisins,
plus peppermints. She also uses physical exercises in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use my hands to clap some rhythm and have them follow
me,'' she says. ``They have to listen. It stimulates their brains,
keeps them alert, and it's fun, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Much of the enthusiasm for brain-based learning comes through
word-of-mouth. But there is scientific evidence, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scientists Fran Rauscher and Gordon Shaw at the University of
California-Irvine found that 17 of 19 schoolkids who received music
lessons for eight months increased their IQs by an average of 46
percent. A group that didn't get music lessons improved only 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Shaw found that college students scored higher on IQ tests
taken after listening to Mozart sonatas for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The journal Nature reported that schooling in the arts and
music leads to major improvements in reading skills and math.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  University of Virginia research Paul Gold found evidence that
glucose, a sugar, improves alertness and memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The research is plentiful,'' declares Bacnik, an early convert
to brain-based learning.
</P>
<P>
   He points to practices outside the classroom. Fast-food joints
use colors like orange and red to make people eat quickly, he says.
Conversely, jewelry and department stores employ classical music,
dimmer lighting and subdued colors to encourage shoppers to linger
and buy.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and Japan, aromatherapy is widely accepted. Some
Japanese employers, for example, scent work sites with peppermint,
believing it helps reduce stress from repetitive chores.
</P>
<P>
   And as governor, Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.) led an effort to have
classical albums handed out to families of newborns. He dismisses
critics who say the so-called Mozart Effect, based on Shaw's
research, is unfounded. In a column for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution last year, he wrote that he didn't want ``our
early learning advocates to be misled or discouraged by some
academics debunking other academics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Yet many scientists are dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Caulfield, head of the Center for the Advancement of Reform
in Education at Rockhurst University in Minnesota, says that some
of the brain-based learning ideas are, well, no-brainers. But the
rest ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The brain needs water,'' she says. ``I don't know about the
other ideas. There's a lot to the power of suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Kinsley, a University of Richmond neuroscientist who has
studied the effects of outside influences on the brain, says some
claims ``border on pseudoscience.'' He cites soft lighting. A
likely consequence of that practice, he says, will be ``more kids
needing glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The candies and mints,'' he acknowledges, ``may have a better
set of data supporting their effects.'' A ready store of glucose,
he says, has been shown to make the brain work more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Jensen, a long-time teacher and author of 1998's ``Teaching
With the Brain in Mind'' (Association for Supervision and
Curriculum Development, $21.95), one of the bibles of brain-based
learning, agrees that more study is needed, and that some teachers
have seized on unfounded notions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many well-meaning educators have gone way beyond the
research,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some teachers have made a formula of the technique,
he complains. ``There's not going to be one method or strategy that
works for all people at all times. Good teachers have a palette of
strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hanson, of Harmony Leland Elementary in Mableton, isn't
swayed by skeptics. She teaches teachers how to implement
brain-based learning techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Orange slices and rose petals calm pupils, she says, and
peppermint given before tests helps kids concentrate. At her
school, all 450 pupils are issued violins, taking lessons every
week. And music is a daily presence as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use everything from jazz to popular music to country and
hip-hop, which you play when you want to pump up a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobbye Jager, a teacher at Kedron Elementary in Peachtree City,
is equally sold on brain-based learning. ``When I taught
kindergarten and a child became overexcited, I'd place the child at
the listening center with a CD of Strauss waltzes with ocean
sounds,'' she says. ``Within five minutes, the child was calm, with
no further discipline required.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it help? Kedron has consistently high scores in math.
Maybe Mozart has a part in this.''
</P>

 &HT;    TEXAS DELEGATES RAP BUSH EDUCATION RECORD
 &HT;    Attn: Texas points.
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Democrats at their national convention are
doing their utmost to undermine Gov. George W. Bush's effort to
portray himself, as his father had done, as the ``education
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lesson from the Republican convention in Philadelphia _
if one was needed _ the Texas Democrats here focus on a message of
the day, and for Tuesday it was education.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators, congress members and teacher
organization members at the Texas delegation's breakfast slammed
Bush for everything from taking credit for education gains launched
by predecessors to trying to trim new kindergarten spending to
enlarge a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chair Molly Beth Malcolm said Republicans
bragged at their convention about Texas education improvements,
citing a recently released Rand study.
</P>
<P>
   But they failed to note, she said, that the study only went
through 1996 _ the second year of Bush's administration _ and the
report credited reforms instituted a decade earlier by Democratic
Gov. Mark White and Dallas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited two key factors for the gains: mandated
smaller class sizes and more money for early childhood education.
Bush tried to undercut both, Malcolm and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez of Texas said as a state House member in
1995 he voted for an amendment ``to make sure we kept the classroom
size at a level where our teachers could be able to teach. And it
won by two votes. Bush and the Republicans were on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said that in the 1999 legislative session,``when
Governor Bush was looking for one more place to get a little more
tax cut so he could run for president, he tried to cut $300 million
out of the budget (for kindergarten funding). And guess what? The
Democrats did not let him. ... So be sure you share those facts
when you talk to people out here.'formance is up across the board,
and Texas education is recognized as a national model.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Donna Haschke, an Austin teacher who is vice president
of the Texas State Teachers Association, said it's true that
student test scores are up and dropouts are down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor takes credit,'' Haschke sai ever came to office.
He was still working on the Texas Rangers (baseball team) and
trading off (slugger) Sammy Sosa.''

AN AMERICAN ORIGINAL GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., N.Y., Fla., Tenn.)   (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By LYLE REXER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDEE, N.Y. _ Some 140 years ago, the job might have gone
something like this: Word had come that the Union Army was moving
north for a fight, up in Pennsylvania somewhere. You would have
loaded up the small wagon with glass or iron plates, chemicals,
food _ and your best samples, of course, in case the soldiers
wanted to see the quality of your work. You would have set up at
the bivouac, near the enlisted men, like all the peddlers, coffin
makers, provisioners and hangers-on who move with an army, but you
might just have been lucky enough to find space near the officers'
tents. You wouldn't have been alone. There might have been a dozen
other photographers in camp. But there was work enough for all,
taking portraits from dawn till dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wanted a likeness to send home.
</P>
<P>
   For the wet-plate and tintype photographer John Coffer, it is as
if the 19th century were today and his contemporaries were not
Cindy Sherman and Thomas Struth but Mathew Brady, Timothy
O'Sullivan and a host of itinerant portrait makers who plied their
trade until the dawn of the modern era. Coffer, 48, has for more
than 20 years been practicing one of the earliest methods of
photography and living the life that went with it. He has
crisscrossed the country by horse- and ox-drawn wagon in an
11,000-mile odyssey, making pictures.
</P>
<P>
   He is now ensconced alone on a farm he bought in 1985 in the
Finger Lakes region of New York state, where he lives with his
horses and oxen, without heat, light, electricity, telephone or
running water. His cabin is his darkroom, and his wagon is parked
right out front. Spending time with Coffer, it's hard to sort out
which came first, the lifestyle or the photography. The two seem to
go together, inevitably, as methods of simplification in a complex
world, or as he calls it, ``purity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Coffer is an American original,'' said Mark Osterman, a
photographic process historian at the George Eastman House and an
accomplished wet-plate photographer himself. ``He was among the
first to revive the wet plate process, and no one has been doing it
continuously longer or better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wet plate is the name of the process that displaced the
daguerreotype in the 1850s and, for a time, paper photography. It
involves coating a glass plate with an ether-based emulsion called
collodion, sensitizing it with silver, and exposing it in the
camera while the emulsion is still wet. The outcome is a negative
image on glass. By one of those paradoxes of light, if it is
underexposed and backed by a dark surface, the image reads as a
positive _ an ambrotype. Collodion can also be poured onto a
japanned iron plate, producing a similar one-of-kind positive. This
is the so-called tintype, although it contains no tin.
</P>
<P>
   Coffer never considered himself an artist and, like his
predecessors, has rarely made a picture he didn't intend to sell on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   But he came to his hand-made life and hand-made photography out
of a single desire for a way of living without gimmicks.
``Photography and food are a lot alike,'' he said. ``You can't
really appreciate the flavor of a tomato unless you grow your own.
Commercial living and commercial photography have leached out all
the diversity, variety and intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   But commercial recognition, at least, appears to have caught up
with him. Coffer's first exhibition of ambrotypes and tintypes is
on view at Margaret Bodell's Wall Street Viewing Room through Sept.
21, and he has been invited by the South Street Seaport Museum to
photograph the ``old hotel'' memorialized by Joseph Mitchell's
stories before its renovation by the museum. ``Call me an artist if
you want to,'' says Coffer, ``but in the last century, the artist
was usually the amateur and the tintypist was the professional.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rugged 6-foot-3, Coffer seems fitted for the rigors of life
and photography without digital gadgets, but he had to make a long
journey toward both. In 1976, the Bicentennial year, he was living
in Florida, working for a local photo studio shooting everything
from fashion models to graduation portraits and spending his spare
time surfing. Something of a history buff, he heard about a Civil
War re-enactment taking place in Tennessee and on a whim decided to
see what it was like and try out an old camera he had bought.
</P>
<P>
   What Coffer found was, in his words, a collection of ``amateur
historians and cycle gang members.'' They were also resourceful
people who made their own costumes and regarded the past as alive
and important. They studied old photographs as attentively as
scholars do the Talmud. One re-enactor made the casual comment that
``no Civil War encampment was complete without a horse-drawn
photographer,'' and on his way back home, Coffer found himself
looking at roads differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to try a
different way of living,'' he said. ``We're constantly pushed
forward at a faster and faster pace. I wanted to know what we were
giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he had sold his condominium and was in
Pennsylvania, learning from the Amish how to drive a horse-drawn
wagon. He left there with $125, a horse named Brownie, a covered
wagon, his antique camera, chemicals and a bedroll. He has been
traveling the same way ever since. ``I don't consider myself an
eccentric,'' he said. ``I just find a team of oxen more beautiful
than a John Deere tractor.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the film ``The Straight Story,'' about an
elderly man who makes a spiritually profound Midwestern journey on
a lawnmower, can begin to understand the sense of freedom and
expansiveness Coffer found on the American road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day was an adventure,'' he said. Traveling by back roads
and pasturing Brownie in farmers' fields, he discovered a still
mostly rural America, by turns generous, amused and suspicious. He
has been arrested, shot at, deliberately run off the road, chased
out of town under suspicion of being a gypsy and hit by a car. He
has also been wined and dined, regaled with innumerable stories
around wood stoves, shown children's moth collections and
photographed as a celebrity. (His travels were covered by network
television, the wire services and People magazine.) He learned how
to do his own smithing and shoeing and raised a pair of oxen during
a stay in Iowa. He even got married during a stopover in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Coffer found people fascinated by his
photography. ``I faced the same challenge as a 19th-century
photographer attracting customers,'' he said. ``Wanted!'' Coffer's
handbill says, ``a hundred thousand men, women and children to go
to the new gallery and get their pictures made in the same day.''
He set up shop where he could at fairs, in people's yards, next to
motels, in back of firehouses, even on main streets in towns with
names like Intercourse and Java. He has also documented Civil War
re-enactments and taught other photographers how to do it. His
images of the 1997 Antietam re-enactment are so meticulous that
only an occasional participant's paunch gives away the contemporary
setting.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   When Coffer started out, most ``antique'' commercial photography
was actually Polaroid, tinted or covered with brown cellophane to
look old. Since collodion is developed on the spot, he, too, could
offer near-instant gratification but with more substantial results.
He learned to make beautiful cases and lockets, turning his photos
into keepsakes, as they would have been presented originally.
Coffer worked initially with commercially coated ``dry'' plates and
tintypes because there was no way to learn the wet-plate formulas
and techniques. He visited the Smithsonian, only to be told, ``Let
us know when you find out how it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   He began to find out in 1980 while wintering in Jacksonville,
Ore. He discovered a cache of old photography manuals and equipment
in the local museum. He also saw a copy of William Crawford's
``Keepers of the Light,'' the first modern book to document
historic photographic processes. ``I realized it was possible to be
truly faithful to past practices,'' Coffer said. Looking at
wet-plate images, one can see why the process is so compelling. The
collodion emulsion produces images of startling precision. There is
complex interplay between background and foreground, detail and
blurring.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, Coffer for the first time began to photograph ``as
an artist,'' not as a portraitist. The images _ all taken near the
cabin he built himself _ combine simplicity and clarity. The bough
of an ice-covered pine, for example, is transformed into a
still-life of Japanese delicacy. One has the simultaneous sense of
things seen and things glimpsed at the edge of visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Collodion's uncanny quality of presence and absence has
attracted a growing number of artists, including Sally Mann, Luis
Gonzalez Palma, Mark and France Scully Osterman, who publish ``The
Collodion Journal,'' and the filmmaker Stephen Berkman, who took a
tutorial with Coffer and has made what is probably the first modern
collodion moving picture. In describing her own photographs, Mann
captured the paradoxical beauty of the process: ``They embrace time
and memory, and become the still point at which the two
intersect.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coffer seems to have achieved his own still point where
past and present intersect. But his newfound identity as an artist
may alter that.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of the farm, which he bought at his wife's urging
(they are now divorced), increasingly conflict with the demands of
art. He has written a manual of collodion technique and regularly
gives workshops. ``With the growing interest in my work,'' he said,
``I'm free to think about what I want to shoot. But the farm is
hard work. The animals have to be tended and I don't make back what
it costs to raise them.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes him think again about hitching up the photographic
wagon parked in the front yard. ``Life on the road taught me how
little I need in order to live,'' he said. ``I'm beginning to feel
cluttered here. What's the adage, either the trip serves the thing
or the thing serves the trip? Out there in my wagon, I'm not on a
trip. I'm home.''

 &HT;    Titanic salvors say ship's hull is deteriorating quickly
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - An undersea salvage expedition to the Titanic has
found touching new traces of the personal tragedies amid the
wreckage of the doomed luxury liner _ and growing evidence that,
after 88 years at the bottom of the North Atlantic, the hull of the
``unsinkable'' ship is crumbling at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condition of hull is dramatically different than it was
just two years ago,'' Arnie Geller, president of RMS Titanic Inc.,
the Atlanta company that has exclusive salvage rights to the wreck,
said Tuesday. ``We were surprised by the rate of corrosion. The
wall of Capt. Smith's cabin has split apart and the deck where the
15-ton ship's anchor rests is visibly sagging.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, two Russian-built mini-submarines used by the
company have recovered more than 350 artifacts from the debris
surrounding the ship, which struck an iceberg April 14, 1912 and
sank with a loss of 1,500 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a new debris field this year and some of the things
we have recovered are very touching and very personal,'' Geller
said. ``We found a leather-covered case of 40 perfume vials
belonging to Adolphe Saalfeld, a merchant from Manchester, England,
who was actually one of the survivors. When we opened one of the
vials in our shipboard laboratory, even after all the years it had
been down there, it filled the room with the scent of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Geller said other items plucked from the half-mile trail of
debris scattered across the floor of the Atlantic, 12,000 feet
below the surface, include a handbag belonging to an Englishwoman,
a third-class passenger, who went down with the ship; a suitcase of
books and postcards; some ``magnificent'' pieces of unbroken china;
and fragments of the ship's hull stamped with the official ``401''
number given to it by the White Star Line.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's salvage operation, the sixth since the company won
exclusive rights to the wreck in 1987, has restricted its recovery
of artifacts to areas outside the wreck. But Geller said the
condition of the hull, and pressure from company stockholders
demanding a return on their investment, makes it likely that the
firm will begin retrieving objects from the interior as early as
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, salvage operators will explore the
holds and passageways of the Titanic with a deep-diving robot and
television camera in hopes of locating valuable, high profile
objects for future recovery, including a $300 million shipment of
diamonds that was reportedly aboard the ship when it sank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock is ticking,'' said Geller. ``If we don't enter the
ship for salvage purposes soon, ocean microbes will devour the
ship's steel for all eternity. There is incredible value down there
and we are determined to recover as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of continuing salvage efforts puts the company
sharply at odds with some prominent scientists and with an
international agreement being considered by the United States,
Canada, France and England, the four countries that played major
roles in the Titanic tragedy. The proposed treaty, yet to be
ratified by any nation, would give each country the last word in
any future salvage operations on the wreck. Fearful that oversight
by a federal agency would undercut its salvage rights, Geller's
company has sued the federal government to block such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   But oceanographer Robert Ballard, who co-discovered the wreck in
1985, said he is saddened by the continued series of intrusions in
what he feels should be considered a marine graveyard. ``Extensive
salvage operations in the debris field surrounding the Titanic have
scarred that site for many years to come,'' he said. ``It is as if
a fleet of tractors had plowed the battlefield of Gettysburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But Geller said the continued recovery of artifacts benefits
more than the company stockholders. To date, the company has
recovered more than 5,000 artifacts. Exhibits, which currently
provide the company's principal source of income, have been seen by
six million people in more than a dozen cities. For a select few,
first-hand views of the Titanic are available _ at a price. The
Russian Academy of Sciences, which operates the Mir 1 and Mir 2
submarines now engaged in salvage work, charges $30,000 a person
for brief dives to the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   But given the remote location of the wreck, Geller said
recovered artifacts are the only way that large numbers of people
will ever see real pieces of the Titanic. He has pledged that, in
compliance with a federal court order, the company will keep all
historically important artifacts together and, if they are sold, to
sell them as an intact collection to a museum that will assure
continued public access to them.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company intends to sell any go

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: OF CONVENTION BUTTONS AND BOTTLE CAPS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A hot-selling button on the streets around the
downtown Staples Center where Democrats are holding their
convention: ``Read My Lips: No New Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concession stands inside the Staples Center remove the tops
from bottled water they sell to delegates and members of the press.
Why? Vendors say those are the rules. Seems there was a problem in
the past with rowdy basketball fans throwing the bottle tops at
players _ a practice that surely must have ended when the Los
Angeles Lakers, who play at Staples Center, won the NBA
championship. Reminded that conventioneers are not grumpy
basketball fans, vendors were unmoved. Rules are rules, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish shuttle buses threw Georgia Democrats' carefully
crafted convention schedules out the window early this week. As
much as a two-hour ride to cover the roughly 12 miles from the
convention site to their hotel kept many delegates from attending a
salute to Gov. Roy Barnes at a fashionable LA restaurant late
Monday. And some delegates waited as long as three hours for a
shuttle to get to the opening day
</P>
<P>
   ceremonies at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped on a stationary bus teeming with impatient but
good-humored delegates Monday night, Georgia Labor Commissioner
Michael Thurmond resorted to a bit of trickery to try to get the
shuttle underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pregnant woman on the bus,'' Thurmond joked,
gesturing randomly at any female seated. ``She needs to get to the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus finally moved, but not always in the right direction.
Delegates eventually disembarked and walked several blocks to get
to their lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between Democrats and Republicans?
Georgia's Gov. Barnes told the Florida delegation that Democrats
are constantly re-examining long-held beliefs and changing them
when
</P>
<P>
   necessary. On the other side, Barnes said, ``Republicans are
nothing but lemon-sucking sour folks who won't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Staples Center _ through the slanted
view of the opposition _ Republican leaders are ready with their
early reviews of the Democratic National Convention. So far, they
don't like it. And they are very, very concerned about the
negative, destructive tone they perceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just 11 minutes into the convention a speaker by the name of
Miller of Maryland was already launching into a tirade against
Republicans and against Governor Bush,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla of
San Antonio, a co-chair of the recent GOP convention. ``And that's
the kind of thing America is tired of listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tirade'' Bonilla referred to was offered by Maryland state
Sen. Mike Miller, head of the Democratic Legislative Campaign
Committee and one of the first speakers on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The tirade: ``Will we have Democratic policies that save our
water, our air, our health and our children _ or laissez-faire,
let-industry-set-their-own pollution standards, like those down in
Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a co-chairman of the GOP's Victory
2000 operation, made fun of Tuesday's convention theme, which was
``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about right,'' said Gilmore. ``We couldn't have said it
any better than that. We ain't seen nothing yet over the last eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's morning-after response is part of an effort that
includes nationwide efforts to get their side heard during a week
when the Democrats will have the nation's ear. The effort includes
daily news conferences from five Texas Democrats who back George W.
Bush's bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
gave Ohio Democrats a kind of working definition of the new
direction the Democratic Party has taken since President Clinton
took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to call us the 'tax and spend Democrats,' `` Cuomo
told the Ohioans at their breakfast meeting Monday. ``Now they have
to call us the budget-balancing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Ohio Sen. Howard Metzenbaum had his state's Democrats
howling for more when he spoke at the delegates' breakfast Tuesday
morning. After a warm-up behind the podium, Metzenbaum, 83,
strolled Oprah-like through the audience, exhorting the Democrats
to get out the vote this November for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get off your butts and go out and vote,''
Metzenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator urged them to tell their friends to avoid the
temptation of voting for consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who's
running for president with the backing of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ralph Nader has done a good job. He doesn't have a
snowball's chance in hell of getting elected,'' said Metzenbaum,
who served three Senate terms before retiring in 1994. Every vote
Nader gets, said Metzenbaum, would be a vote taken away from Gore.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T: No long-distance for BellSouth
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As BellSouth edges closer to a request to enter
long-distance, the company's biggest critic is also its largest
customer.
</P>
<P>
   In this sometimes confused new world, where telecommunications
companies daily compete and do business with each other, BellSouth
each day sells connections to its network _ still the Southeast's
dominant phone system. Buyers are competitors for local service as
well as long-distance companies that need calls carried to homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest company in this category is both local rival and
long-distance customer: AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of declining market share, AT&AMP;T still does nearly
half the long-distance business. Many of those calls start or end
with BellSouth customers, so AT&AMP;T pays BellSouth more than $2
billion a year in fees. But AT&AMP;T also plans to offer local service,
where it needs BellSouth's cooperation in switching retail
customers back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, AT&AMP;T charges that BellSouth isn't ready for real
competition in local service. BellSouth says that isn't so, and the
company accuses AT&AMP;T of canceling meetings with the Georgia Public
Service Commission aimed at solving the problems. AT&AMP;T retorts that
it asked for delay only because BellSouth is so woefully
unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in some ways, a family feud.
</P>
<P>
   After all, BellSouth was created along with six other Bells in
the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, then often known as Ma Bell. The Bells
were banned from long-distance, which was, in any event, nearly all
in the hands of AT&AMP;T. The Bells won the right to enter the market
from the Telecom Act of 1996 _ but only if they opened their local
markets to competition. That approval has been won by SBC in Texas
and Verizon _ the former Bell Atlantic _ in New York.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says it fears that once the carrot of long-distance is
gone, BellSouth's cooperation will evaporate. It cites New York,
where Bell Atlantic's long-distance approval was followed by
raucous criticism _ and millions of dollars in fines _ when company
systems were unable to handle an average of 15,000 orders per day.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth's systems are about as ready for competition as Bell
Atlantic's were in January, said Ray Crafton, AT&AMP;T vice president,
who has been involved in both states.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth has been saying for a long time that its entry was
imminent and its systems were ship-shape. To prove it, BellSouth
more than a year ago agreed to a test of its system under the eye
of the PSC. The KPMG tests have logged 100 ``exceptions,'' glitches
_ or worse _ in the system. BellSouth says it has fixed half of
those problems and is working on the rest. But AT&AMP;T says that in
ongoing tests of BellSouth systems run by the two companies, nearly
30 percent of mock customer orders at any one time get stuck _ for
more than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth is not losing orders,'' Crafton said. ``But they
don't seem to know how to process them.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth rejects those numbers. Spokesman Joe Chandler said
BellSouth has handled 90 percent of the orders by the date
specified, averaging 2.57 days per order. BellSouth says it already
treats competitors as well as its own retail unit is treated _ an
assertion that draws scorn from AT&AMP;T and smaller contenders. But
Chandler said complaints are meant to delay BellSouth's
long-distance entry a bit longer, not only to prevent competition
but also to squeeze the most possible cooperation on local service
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting to us that AT&AMP;T is trying to air this in
public, with the press, rather than talk about this with us and the
commission.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth stands by its June prediction that a filing for
long-distance will come in August, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with positive results, BellSouth will ask the Federal
Communications Commission for the right to offer long-distance in
Georgia. BellSouth technically does not need PSC endorsement. In
fact, BellSouth's applications in Louisiana and South Carolina were
embraced by regulators, then rejected by the FCC. But the FCC
typically starts its investigations by asking for the judgment of
local regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the PSC will not stamp its imprimatur on a proposal
unless it is confident of approval, said PSC Commissioner David
Burgess. ``We are not going to put ourselves in the position of
South Carolina and Louisiana. When it's right, it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen by the end of August?
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what I am seeing, I think it's extremely optimistic
to say that,'' Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   And all this comes with long-distance itself of increasingly
dubious value. AT&AMP;T has only been the most conspicuously damaged
carrier as profit margins are squeezed by ``nickel nights,''
dial-around offerings and technology changes that drive prices
earthward.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of BellSouth argue that long-distance's diminishing
allure undercuts BellSouth's urgency about opening up its lucrative
near-monopoly in local service. BellSouth just isn't trying very
hard to improve its systems, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth argues that long-distance is still viable and
besides, it must have long-distance as part of its ``bundle'' in
order to be a full-service telecom provider. Moreover, even
low-margin services can feed the bottom line if packaged with
other, more profitable services like high-speed access.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, representatives of several competitors told PSC
commissioners that BellSouth had not given them smooth and rapid
access to its network.
</P>
<P>
   ``BellSouth is required by federal law to open its local phone
service to competitors,'' said William Perry, co-chair of Georgians
Calling for Competition, which describes itself as a non-profit
coalition of consumers, businesses and organization. ``Now it is up
to the Georgia PSC to make sure the right standards are in place to
ensure BellSouth does so in a manner that doesn't handicap the
companies trying to offer competitive services.''

STEAL THIS MYTH: WHY WE STILL TRY TO RE-CREATE THE RUSH OF THE
'60S 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20) 
 By ELLEN WILLIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching!'' chanted demonstrators outside
the First Union Center in Philadelphia during the Republican
National Convention this month. Many had not yet been born when
that cry first sounded on the streets of Chicago, in 1968, as the
police clubbed protesters during the tumultuous Democratic
convention. This time the words were unwittingly ironic: Most of
the world passed up the opportunity to watch on television, whether
because the convention itself was designed to be noncontroversial
or because today's dissidents have not yet gained the fearsome
reputation of their elders. The police had evidently declined the
role of on-camera head-bashers. But the scene was yet another
tribute to the enduring power of the '60s in the national
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So is ``Steal This Movie,'' Robert Greenwald's biographical
movie about Abbie Hoffman, that charismatic exemplar of '60s
cultural radicalism, a defendant in the conspiracy trial of the
Chicago Seven _ the leaders of the Chicago protest _ and the author
of ``Steal This Book,'' among other provocations. According to
publicity for the film, which opened on Friday, Greenwald (who had
met Hoffman years ago) was inspired to undertake the project by a
conversation with his teen-age daughters, who were attracted to the
decade's aura of rebellion, as well as its music and fashions, but
knew little about it.
</P>
<P>
   The slogans, sounds and iconic images of the '60s are constantly
evoked. They are romanticized, reviled, embraced by fledgling
movements as their legacy or appropriated for television
commercials (steal this era).
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all their familiarity, the experience that produced the
artifacts eludes replication, in ways that go beyond the usual
problems associated with transmuting lived events into the
historical and cultural record.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s produced such a rush of events that the distinction
between news and daily life seemed to blur. Besides the Chicago
protest, 1968 saw the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Robert Kennedy (the latter knocking the shooting of Andy Warhol off
the front page), the Columbia University student strike, the
student-worker uprising in Paris, ``Prague Spring'' and the ensuing
Soviet invasion, and the launching of women's liberation with a
demonstration against the Miss America pageant. There is also the
difficulty of conveying the spirit of the '60s revolt at a time
when many of its attitudes _ sexual permissiveness, hostility to
politicians, a preference for rawly expressive music _ have been
assimilated into mainstream culture, while the utopian passion that
once pervaded them has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest obstacle to representing the '60s in more than
cartoonish fashion is that it was thoroughly mythologized even as
it was happening. Mass-mediated images of rock stars, hippies and
new leftists spread the counterculture and anti-war movement from
the East and West coasts to every provincial town in the country.
These images inspired events, like Woodstock or the Chicago
demonstrations, that were not only recorded and mythified but often
designed _ whether by spontaneous improvisation or by deliberate
playing to the press _ to act the images out.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock, perhaps the most famous '60s event-cum-myth of all,
began as a commercial effort to capitalize on the publicity
generated by Monterey Pop, the euphoric free festival that had
introduced Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, flower children and San
Francisco psychedelic lovespeak to a national audience in 1967.
Clearly, the promoters didn't count on the image of Monterey being
so potent that, two years later, it would attract nearly half a
million kids with no intention of buying tickets. But they came,
determined to live out the countercultural fantasy despite
uncooperative weather and crisis-level shortages of food, water and
toilets. ``Woodstock,'' the movie, documented a real experience,
but one that was in crucial respects a performance _ even before
the filmmakers added their own layer of editing.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, on the other hand, was always conceived by its
organizers _ especially Abbie Hoffman and his partner in mischief
Jerry Rubin _ as an opportunity to show new left political theater
on national television. Everything Hoffman and Rubin did, from
nominating a live pig for president to representing their small
contingent of ``cultural revolutionaries'' as typical of a crowd
that was mostly far less militant (and less colorful), was aimed at
drawing the media's attention. Of course, the collaboration of a
paranoid Mayor Richard Daley was essential; but perhaps he, too,
took rhetoric for reality.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective renderings of the '60s have been works of
``new journalism,'' like Tom Wolfe's ``Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test'' and Norman Mailer's ``Armies of the Night,'' that explore,
with aesthetic and philosophical sophistication, dissolving
boundaries between experience and performance, reality and image,
reporting and mythmaking. The only novel I can think of that comes
close to capturing the '60s imagination is Marge Piercy's ``Dance
the Eagle to Sleep,'' the 1970 tale of a band of underground
revolutionaries. It works because the characters come across as
more mythic, or allegorical, than ``real''; still, I have the
feeling that Greenwald's daughters would find it puzzling. As for
film, whether documentary or fictional, it would seem that endless
replays of demonstrators versus cops, hippies frolicking naked in
the mud, joints passing around a circle, freaked out Vietnam vets
and so on, have had such a numbing effect as to suggest that a
fresh image of the '60s is an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I heard about Greenwald's film, it occurred to me that
a movie about one of the decade's chief image-makers might find a
way out of this bind. Abbie Hoffman self-consciously sought to
bring together the largely separate and sometimes antagonistic
cohorts of bohemia and the organized new left. In his own person he
merged the two central _ if not always compatible _ myths of the
'60s rebels: the myth of cultural liberation through libidinal
ecstasy and fabulous excess, and the myth of a morally righteous
generation rising up against war, racism and materialism
perpetrated by its elders. He was, in short, a primary author of
the '60s narrative that, in its various bowdlerized and canned
forms, is now ubiquitous in our popular culture. And he pulled this
off precisely by his keen understanding of the power of media not
merely to record reality but to create it.
</P>
<P>
   Stunts like scattering dollar bills on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, where startled minions of capital scrambled to pick
them up, not only condensed a world view into one arresting image,
but brilliantly satirized the opposition. Hoffman used this
technique to even greater effect during the Chicago Seven trial, in
which he wore a judicial robe to court, insisted he lived in
Woodstock Nation _ in the state of mind of his brothers and sisters
_ and otherwise turned the proceedings into an epic baiting of the
judge unlucky enough to share his surname.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   There are rich possibilities here for avoiding the standard '60s
banalities _ or restoring the power of now-tired images _ by
focusing on the process of their creation. ``Steal This Movie''
adopts a promising strategy for highlighting that process: Vincent
D'Onofrio as Hoffman, having gone underground after his 1973 arrest
for selling cocaine, calls from his hiding place to hector a young
reporter, David Glenn (Alan Van Sprang), into writing his story;
the reporter's interviews with Abbie's wife Anita (played by
Janeane Garofalo), his lawyer Gerry Lefcourt (Kevin Pollak) and
others become, as in ``Citizen Kane,'' the framework for the
unfolding of his life.
</P>
<P>
   That life is portrayed as a creative self-invention in which the
gap between public and private disappears, only to reopen with a
vengeance when Hoffman becomes a fugitive in 1974. While hiding
one's identity is inherently stressful, for Hoffman it signifies
total obliteration. Even in absentia, he can't resist trying to
commandeer the press; but then he hates Glenn's story. He emerges
from a near breakdown only by taking the risk of adopting a new
public persona as an environmental activist, Barry Freed, in
upstate New York, and even that doesn't quite work. In the '80s,
after turning himself in and being paroled, he is portrayed as
reintegrating his past with his present, inspiring a new generation
of activists. But his 1989 suicide, which is only mentioned in the
epilogue, seems to tell another story. While the movie duly records
Hoffman's diagnosis of bipolar disorder and his treatment with
lithium, the thrust of its narrative suggests that mental illness
is never purely organic.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes in ``Steal This Movie'' focus on Abbie as media
artist. His hilarious demolition of Judge Julius Hoffman's court,
which made his testimony a showcase for the triumph of an
echt-American freedom-loving bad boy over a humorless authoritarian
state, loses none of its resonance in the retelling. His wedding to
Anita _ featuring an ``intimate'' gathering of hundreds of people
and the press, photographs of the happy couple naked with bags over
their heads, and wedding announcements with joints enclosed mailed
to random strangers _ is a lighter but equally witty sendup of
another established institution.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, though, the movie fails to make the '60s live. For
one thing, its basically conventional dramatic form undercuts the
irreverent content. Except for its title and the obligatory
television footage, both real and fake, ``Steal This Movie'' does
not reflect on its own status as a mass-mediated object; perhaps
the reporter who frames the story should have been made a
television producer, allowing an offstage ``Abbie'' or a real-life
Anita to comment on the action and the actors. D'Onofrio plays his
role straight, aiming to be a realistic Abbie Hoffman with the
right accent and mannerisms, with the result that he often conveys
an un-Abbie-like air of trying too hard. He might have done better
to concentrate on getting across his character's antic spirit, as
Jim Carrey did in playing Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the center of the drama becomes the
unmasking of Cointelpro, the FBI program that subjected the new
left in general, and Abbie Hoffman in particular, to illegal
surveillance and harassment. For most of the movie, Glenn dismisses
as paranoid Hoffman's insistence that such a project exists; but in
the end he comes around and helps Gerry Lefcourt nail down the
evidence. In making this theme so important, Greenwald _ no doubt
taking his cue from his lengthy interviews with Anita Hoffman (who
died last year of breast cancer) _ allows his film to imply that
FBI machinations were responsible for the collapse of '60s
radicalism, as well as for Abbie's travails. As a result, the movie
is ultimately recast in the well-worn mold of a muckraking flick:
'60s myth meets post-Watergate cliche. In fact, the '60s revolt
succumbed as much to its activists' hubris on the one hand, and
their fatigue and confusion on the other, as to anything the
government did. For that matter, the government's most effective
weapon against the movement turned out to be the abolition of the
draft. Cointelpro, however vicious, was a sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Hoffman himself simply a victim of the state. Police
entrapment or no _ the truth remains unclear _ Abbie sold cocaine,
an outrageous risk for someone in his position. ``Steal This
Movie'' glosses over this discomfiting fact. Marty Jezer's
sympathetic 1992 biography ``Abbie Hoffman: American Rebel,'' on
which the movie is largely based, is more forthcoming about Abbie's
dark side: the egomania, foolhardy machismo and increasing
attraction to the violent sectarian left.
</P>
<P>
   Two kinds of voices dominate the present conversation about the
'60s: those who condemn the utopianism of the time as a
totalitarian delusion, and those who sentimentally endow it with a
moral purity unknown to today's era of rampant materialism and
cynicism about politics. What's missing from both accounts is the
'60s as emotional experience: the desire to live intensely, the
hope that people could have more than Freud's ordinary unhappiness.
For my generation, the pursuit of happiness was not a slogan; it
turned our guts inside out and left us with a bone-deep sense of
loss. ``Steal This Movie'' makes a stab at expressing this
dimension, but in the end it sentimentalizes.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, the movie that gets closest to the heart of the
matter isn't about the '60s at all: It's ``Thelma and Louise.'' Two
female outlaws are transformed by unspeakable hopes for freedom,
for a wholly different way of being. They can't go back no matter
what. As they leap to their deaths, for one last defiant (and
mythic) moment, they are complete. I imagine Abbie would have loved
it.

 &HT;    Back from down under, eTour COO ready to rock
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - ETour Chief Operating Officer Donna LaChance says she
was lured back to Atlanta from Sydney, Australia, for the
opportunity to help take the downtown-based dot-com company to the
next level. Well, that and Smoothie King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week I was back, I went right to Smoothie King,''
she says laughing. ``They don't have those in Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the former BellSouth.net executive and 15-year resident
of Atlanta left not just the country but the hemisphere to accept
the job with Australia's Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus as its multimedia
director. She says she's excited to be back home in Atlanta, and
that the chief operating office post that she was offered at eTour
was exactly what she was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined eTour because I see the value in the management team
that Roger (Barnette, eTour co-founder and chief executive officer)
has already assembled, and the unlimited potential for eTour to
change the way people use the Internet,'' she says. ``I believe we
can make eTour one of the major brands of the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChance brings years of management experience and an ability to
articulate just exactly what eTour does, which has been a stumbling
block for the company in the past _ primarily because the business
model and technology have virtually no competition.
</P>
<P>
   As COO, she will have all of eTour's 160 employees, with the
exception of Barnette, report to her. ``It's Roger's and my job to
move us through our next growth phase and that means a clear focus
on common goals and objectives,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has what she calls the ``rock theory of
management'' to motivate her staff. ``You set rocks out there for
people to aim toward. If people are hiding behind the rocks, move
the rocks. If there are rocks in the way, move the rocks. If people
are throwing rocks at each other, you stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChance believes in the possibilities for eTour, which Barnette
founded in 1998. It delivers Web pages to users based on the
interests they indicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be part of something that was serious, a real part
of the new economy,'' LaChance said, sitting in a conference room
of eTour's new Peachtree Center offices. ``Etour is the engine that
puts advertisers and consumers together. It's a technique for
navigating the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond connecting consumers with Web sites pegged to their
interests, LaChance says the eTour model can be extended to other
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more corporations will be doing business online,''
she says. ``Retail stores and supermarkets have definite ways they
want you to move through their stores. Web sites don't. We could be
a wonderful merchandizing vehicle for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   While eTour contemplates possible business applications,
LaChance wants to make consumers aware of the value eTour offers.
Most of the sites selected by eTour are chosen by a group of
editors, who decide if a sports site is interesting or useful
enough to be delivered to users who like sports. LaChance says that
kind of selection gives the venture more value than having
intelligent agent software trolling the Web for related sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``An agent can tell you what's there, but a person can tell you
if it's any good,'' she says, adding that if eTour does its job
correctly, the site will be useful not just to overwhelmed Web
newbies but to jaded Web junkies who think they've seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of our business is wowing customers, the other part
is delivering a superior advertising opportunity,'' she said. ``We
are a good way for advertisers to reach people who are interested
in them.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChance says she is determined to take eTour to the next level
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to manage this company so we'll be here
tomorrow,'' she says. ``This is too good an opportunity to
squander.''

&HT;     COURT PUTS LIMITS ON CELL PHONE TRACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for privacy advocates, a federal
appeals court on Tuesday restricted the FBI's ability to track the
whereabouts of cell phone users while opening the door for
first-ever limits on a controversial e-mail surveillance system
known as Carnivore.
</P>
<P>
   The government sought the power to be able to track the location
of suspected criminals via their cellular phones. Privacy groups
and the cellular industry took the government to court, asserting
that the proposed investigative tool _ along with others the
Justice Department had sought to keep up with increasingly
sophisticated criminals in the digital age _ was rife for potential
abuse against law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals here said that the need for
investigators to obtain the location of suspects using their cell
phones was ``both reasoned and reasonable.'' But the three-judge
panel erected barriers, ruling that the government could only gain
such information with the approval and oversight of a court that
sanctions surveillance and wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 million Americans use cell phones and an
ever-increasing amount of communications and commerce _ including
Internet activity _ are conducted over cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy organizations had been concerned that the FBI could
acquire the location of cell phone users through what is known as a
pen register, an easy-to-obtain court order that does not require
investigators to present a judge with probable cause as a wiretap
warrant does. The organizations envisioned that investigators would
be able to track the whereabouts of people who are not suspects in
an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision makes it clear: location of cell phone users
cannot be provided under a pen register order,'' said Jim Dempsey,
senior counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT),
one of several organizations that sued the government.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Olson, who represented the CDT and the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association before the appeals court,
said the ruling ``protects the privacy and integrity of the
telephone system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a cell phone could be converted into a tracking device,
then that would have been a serious intrusion into privacy
rights,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 16-page decision does not say that law enforcement
officials must now seek a wiretap warrant before tracking a cell
phone user. It says that law enforcement must now seek ``something
more than a pen register order.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also shot down efforts by the government to gain
access to private data that may be punched on a cell phone keypad,
such as calling card numbers or credit card accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that is expected to have ramifications for the
FBI's controversial Carnivore system, the judges ruled that the
government must obtain a court-ordered wiretap to access the
digital ``packets'' of information that travel over the cellular
phone network. These packets are the standard unit of digital
communication and are increasingly used over cellular networks.
</P>
<P>
   The government cannot require cellular carriers to provide
investigators with information that is ``not authorized to be
intercepted,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling appears to call into question the legality of
Carnivore, which scans the Internet and captures these ``packets.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore, which would be installed at Internet service
providers like America Online, searches for the on-line activities
of a target of an investigation. The FBI would obtain a wiretap to
access a suspect's e-mail. But the Carnivore system also would give
the FBI access to the entirety of the Internet provider's
electronic traffic, allowing the agency to sift through the
information in search of a suspect's email.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said the ruling ``raises concerns about this approach
where the FBI says, let us have access to everything and we'll sort
it out ourselves.'' Olson added that the ruling could have ``a very
significant impact'' on the use of Carnivore, which is now under
review by Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   CTIA went further. In a statement, the group, which represents
major cellular phone manufacturers, said the ruling ``may make
illegal the FBI's newest data searching tool, Carnivore.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Colgate, an assistant U.S. attorney general who is
spearheading the Carnivore review for Reno, said the Justice
Department would take the ruling into consideration. ``We'll use as
part of this review the findings of this decision,'' he said.

NORTEL NETWORKS BUYING SONOMA SYSTEMS FOR ABOUT $540 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sonoma Systems Inc., a builder of systems offering one-wire
Internet, voice, and video connections, is being acquired by Nortel
Networks in a stock deal worth up to $540 million. Sonoma is based
in California but has a significant presence in Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced Tuesday, is Nortel's 12th in as many months
as it moves further into markets offering local ``on-ramps'' to
high-speed nationwide optical networks that have become a major
focus of the Canadian telecom giant.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nortel's locally based competitors in long-distance
optical networking, Sycamore Networks of Chelmsford, Mass., has
made a similar push into local access by purchasing Sirocco Systems
of Connecticut for $2.8 billion earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies and cable broadband system operators use Sonoma
gear to provide business customers with a unified connection
offering telephone service over the Net as well as high-speed Net
access and video services.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 of Sonoma's 125 employees are based in Marlborough.
Nortel counts more than 3,000 employees in Massachusetts already,
through earlier acquisitions of Bay Networks, the successor to
Billerica, Mass.-based Wellfleet Communications Inc., and other
companies including Epicon of Chelmsford, Mass. and Coretek of
Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel had earlier made a comarketing arrangement to incorporate
Sonoma gear in its networking products. Sonoma gear serves a
``carrier-managed services'' market estimated to be worth $18
billion annually by 2002, according to The Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schilling, Nortel president of access networks, said:
``This acquisition represents another building block in our local
Internet capabilities that will enable service providers to offer
new profitable services directly to businesses and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Christin Armacost, an analyst at S.G. Cowen, told Reuters news
service the Sonoma acquisition is ``a good product portfolio fit''
for Nortel. But the comparatively modest purchase price suggests it
is only a ``technology extension'' rather than a major new
corporate emphasis, Armacost said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma had filed for an initial public offering in February, but
it is still a public company. It reported then that it had $7.1
million in revenues last year, about 20 percent derived from sales
to Nortel, and net losses of $14 million. The company said sales
this year could exceed $20 million but gave no indication of when
the company, based in Marina Del Rey, Calif., could be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of Sonoma, which was spun off from Vertel Corp. two
years ago, include FiberNet Telecom Group Inc., Madison River
Communications, Savvis Communications Corp., and Electric Lightwave
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel said it will issue $480 million of stock when the deal
closes and $60 million more if Sonoma reaches sales targets in the
first year under Nortel ownership.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is scheduled to close this autumn subject to antitrust
and Sonoma shareholder approvals. Nortel said the deal will have no
impact on earnings this year and will slightly increase its
earnings per share from operations in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma has also had reseller arrangements for its gear with
Siemens AG, Cabletron Systems Inc., and Alcatel SA. It was not
immediately clear how the Nortel acquisition would affect those
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel shares closed Tuesday at $80.3125, up $1.0625.

 &HT;    TEXAS DELEGATES RAP BUSH EDUCATION RECORD
 &HT;    Repeating to clear garble.
 &HT;    Attn: Texas points.
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas Democrats at their national convention are
doing their utmost to undermine Gov. George W. Bush's effort to
portray himself, as his father had done, as the ``education
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a lesson from the Republican convention in Philadelphia _
if one was needed _ the Texas Democrats here focus on a message of
the day, and for Tuesday it was education.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators, congress members and teacher
organization members at the Texas delegation's breakfast slammed
Bush for everything from taking credit for education gains launched
by predecessors to trying to trim new kindergarten spending to
enlarge a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chair Molly Beth Malcolm said Republicans
bragged at their convention about Texas education improvements,
citing a recently released Rand study.
</P>
<P>
   But they failed to note, she said, that the study only went
through 1996 _ the second year of Bush's administration _ and the
report credited reforms instituted a decade earlier by Democratic
Gov. Mark White and Dallas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited two key factors for the gains: mandated
smaller class sizes and more money for early childhood education.
Bush tried to undercut both, Malcolm and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez of Texas said as a state House member in
1995 he voted for an amendment ``to make sure we kept the classroom
size at a level where our teachers could be able to teach. And it
won by two votes. Bush and the Republicans were on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said that in the 1999 legislative session,``when
Governor Bush was looking for one more place to get a little more
tax cut so he could run for president, he tried to cut $300 million
out of the budget (for kindergarten funding). And guess what? The
Democrats did not let him. ... So be sure you share those facts
when you talk to people out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said Democrats in Los Angeles ``can
carp and complain, but the truth is that under Governor Bush, with
the support of Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature, public
school funding has increased by $8.13 billion, teacher salaries
have increased an average of $8,200, student performance is up
across the board, and Texas education is recognized as a national
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Donna Haschke, an Austin teacher who is vice president
of the Texas State Teachers Association, said it's true that
student test scores are up and dropouts are down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor takes credit,'' Haschke said, but instead it
should go to teachers working in partnership with parents.
``Believe me, we were working on that long before he ever came to
office. He was still working on the Texas Rangers (baseball team)
and trading off (slugger) Sammy Sosa.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Famke Janssen _ like a roller coaster, tall and
steeply curved _ is having herself a thrill ride of a summer. As
Jean Grey, the telepathic, telekinetic protegee of Professor X,
Janssen was part of the team that not only arrested the vengeful
Magneto's quest for world domination in ``X-Men'' but had also
raked in a superheroic $144 million at the box office in five weeks
of release. Now, opening on Friday, comes Valerie Breiman's
romantic comedy ``Love and Sex,'' a crowd pleaser at last winter's
Sundance Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Dutch-born, 5-foot-11-inch Janssen has been a
specialist in scene-stealing supporting roles. Attentive viewers
will remember that in a pair of movies in 1998 she played Petra, a
louche gambler who throws herself against a bouldery Matt Damon in
``Rounders,'' and Bonnie, the book editor who serves as muse to the
ungrateful Kenneth Branagh in Woody Allen's ``Celebrity.'' In her
first memorable secondary role, she was Xenia Onatopp, the Bond bad
girl who gleefully crushed her adversaries with her nutcracker
thighs in ``Goldeneye'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so easy to keep ex-models who can actually act
perpetually in supporting roles, and in ``Love and Sex,'' playing a
character even more wildly imagined than a telekinetic mutant _ a
sexually robust magazine writer named Kate with a messy personal
life _ Janssen, 34, gets to break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you just giggle or something when you read a script,''
Janssen said one afternoon last month in a SoHo restaurant, ``but
this time I laughed out loud. I thought, I really want to be her.
Besides, I had never been the female protagonist in a film, and I
had never really done a romantic comedy. It all felt too good to be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   It almost wasn't. Breiman, who makes her debut here as a
feature-film writer and director, says her semi-autobiographical
screenplay had been languishing for five years, with casting as one
of the big hang-ups. On the verge of giving up hope, she went with
friends to see ``Celebrity.'' ``I was so impressed how she managed
to make something out of nothing,'' Breiman says of Janssen. ``And
for a woman like that to be dumped by Kenneth Branagh! I
immediately thought that this could be Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen is the type of woman who once might have been promoted
as ``a thinking man's sex symbol.'' Certainly nothing about Janssen
in person dispels the impression of cool intelligence. ``I don't
watch TV,'' she confesses, adding tartly, ``There's certain things
I try to avoid, as an actress, just to keep my world from being as
narrow as it could be.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Breiman's first impressions of Janssen was that she was
extremely well read (she favors the classics). But what drew
Janssen to the part was that Kate didn't have all the answers,
something with which she identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the fact that Kate really is a mess, that she is
confused and insecure and has issues with her life and men and her
relationships. But it seemed new to me that she is very
unapologetic about who she is, what she chooses to do, which men
she decides to sleep with. She says: `Well, this is who I am. You
can like it or not, but I'm not apologizing.' And all my friends
and family know me more as Kate than the other characters I've
played. They all say, `Oh, my God, we've finally seen a lot of you
on the screen.'''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be only a temporary coincidence that at the moment
Janssen's life is as unruly as her character's: she is unattached
(she separated last year from her husband), homeless (she's
apartment-hunting in lower Manhattan) and out of work (one film in
the can, nothing else planned.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the more charming elements of ``Love and Sex'' is the
relationship between Janssen and her co-star, the actor and
comedian Jon Favreau. Their rapport is noticeable from their
characters' initial attraction, through their head-over-heels
period and on into tepidity, break-up, unsatisfactory
best-friendship and back again.
</P>
<P>
   The two actors have a very realistic chemistry: She's sweet but
a bit susceptible to overreaction; he's funny and laid back but
acerbic. She, as she points out, has big feet; he, as he admits,
has a big head. Given the short, 21-day shooting schedule, the
chemistry is not something that could have been nurtured or, for
that matter, faked. ``I knew she was beautiful and that she could
act,'' Favreau says, ``but what I wasn't sure about was whether she
could be funny. But as soon as I got to work with her and saw how
real she was, I was sold. It's very rare to see someone who's both
beautiful and funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Breiman says, ``Jon made Famke laugh in their scenes in a way
that really made her laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   One scene that amused both actors comes at a point when their
romance was starting to become commonplace. ``Originally it was
just going to be the two of them in bed reading,'' Janssen
explains. ``Then we thought, `Why not make it funny?''' They came
up with the idea of one of them breaking wind. Originally, Favreau
was to be the perpetrator and Janssen the one to respond. ``He
said, `I'll let you know when.' Which he never did, but instead
made like I did it! And then I had to react. And of course Valerie
kept it in. Which I love _ when the filmmaker is confident with
moments that are spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen (her first name, Famke, pronounced fam-KEY, means
``little girl'' in a provincial Dutch dialect) is one of three
sisters in show business: her older sister, Antoinette, is a
director, and her younger sister, Margolein, is an actress; both
studied theater throughout their youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I got into it feels sort of like cheating compared to
them,'' says Janssen, whose more circuitous path took her first to
the University of Amsterdam to study economics. ``The Dutch are a
very practical people,'' she says by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Her year at the university proved to be, as she puts it, ``the
stupidest idea I ever had.'' Soon she succumbed to those who had
encouraged her to take up modeling, which eventually took her to
America. Appearing on the covers of Elle, Mirabella and other
fashion magazines, she made a lot of money and retired at the peak
of her career, in the early '90s. She then enrolled at Columbia
University to study literature and take up acting, but it was
several years before she even began auditioning for parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to become good before I started,'' she says. ``I
didn't want to fall on my face. I had seen what happened to other
models.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   She continues to bring the same cautious focus to choosing
roles. ``I've learned not to take a part based on whether it could
potentially be a big career move,'' she says. ``When the movie
doesn't do well financially, you're left with an empty feeling,
like you've wasted six months. I try to make decisions based on
whether the director or the other actors are people I want to work
with, or the character someone I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus she has ended up working with Woody Allen (``Celebrity'')
and Robert Altman (``The Gingerbread Man''), John Irvin (``City of
Industry'') and John Dahl (``Rounders''). She agreed to do
``X-Men'' because she wanted to work with the director Bryan
Singer, whose work on ``The Usual Suspects'' she admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comic book adaptations in the past have tended to get a little
glossy and silly, and I knew he would never do it that way,'' she
says. ``I thought his dark approach would be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so surprising to hear from a thinking man's thinking person,
``dark'' is an adjective that pops up with some frequency in Ms.
Janssen's aesthetic lexicon. The word might best describe a role
she plays in Mr. Favreau's recently finished movie, ``Made,'' which
he wrote and directed. It's a comedy about two aspiring boxers who
become involved with low-level gangsters in a money-laundering
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd write a part for me,'' she says, ``and he asked
me what I wanted to be. I said I want to do something edgy,
something dark, something different. So from that he wrote me a
part as a stripper who's a single mother and who's had a drug
problem in the past _ a dark, interesting character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued by the dark,'' Janssen says. ``Out of darkness
comes creation.''

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubirected at a certain angle to ensure
less resistance to the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storms have calmed down somewhat, although waves are still
high. But the current is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine is tilted on the seabed, with its bow pointing
down, The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the
Rronment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the reactor
taid there was no sign of a radiation leak.

TV DOCUMENTARY CLAIMS TO REVEAL IDENTITY OF `THE HEADLESS MAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was a scandal that riveted Swinging Sixties London
and left behind a tantalizing question that has gone unanswered for
nearly 40 years. At its center was Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, a
rich and seductive society beauty who inspired Cole Porter's
``You're the Top.''
</P>
<P>
   In what was then the longest and costliest divorce proceeding in
British history, she was accused by her husband, the duke, of
leaving him behind in his dark baronial castles in Scotland and
going on a high-kicking romp through the salons of London during
which she took, by his count, 88 lovers, including Cabinet members,
Hollywood actors and members of the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   The duke knew this, he said, because he had stolen her diaries
from her desk drawer and also found compromising pictures.
Submitted to the Edinburgh court but kept from public view, the
photographs reportedly pictured her, dressed in nothing but three
strands of pearls, performing a sex act on a naked man in the
mirrored gilt and silver bathroom of her Mayfair apartment. In
another photograph, a naked man is shown gratifying himself.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures, taken with a Polaroid camera, showed the man only
from the neck down. It led the judge in the case, Lord Wheatley, to
identify him as ``the man without a head'' and prompted British
gossips ever since to ask, ``Who was the headless man?''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the two most prominent suspects have been Winston
Churchill's son-in-law, Duncan Sandys, who was defense secretary in
the government of Harold Macmillan, and the American actor and
society figure Douglas Fairbanks Jr. A television documentary shown
on Britain's Channel 4 this week came up with what it called the
``definitive answer'' _ it was both of them.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year divorce proceeding had magnified significance for
the British public because it revealed fresh evidence of
upper-class decadence during the same months in 1963 that the
scandal involving the war minister, John Profumo, was unfolding.
Profumo had to resign in disgrace when it emerged he lied to
Parliament about his relationship with the call girl Christine
Keeler.
</P>
<P>
   The duchess was found to have committed adultery with four men
by the judge, Lord Wheatley, who, in a 50,000-word report that took
more than three hours to read, pilloried her as a high-class
harlot. ``She is a highly sexed woman who has ceased to be
satisfied with normal sexual activities and has started to indulge
in disgusting sexual activities to gratify a debased sexual
appetite that can only be satisfied by a number of men,'' he said.
He added, ``Her attitude to the sanctity of marriage was what
moderns would call enlightened but which in plain language was
wholly immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been books, biographies, articles and a full-length
opera devoted to her since, but she died in 1993 without ever
revealing her secret. Both Fairbanks, who died in May, and Sandys,
who died in 1987, always denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The television documentary, titled ``Secret History: The Duchess
and the Headless Man,'' said the man shown in the pictures was in
fact two men.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jay, later to be British ambassador to Washington but then
a Treasury official assisting in the official investigation, told
how the senior judge leading the inquiry, Lord Denning, proved that
Fairbanks was one of them. He deliberately invited the five
principal suspects to his office to discuss the matter, obliging
them to sign in on an official guest book. Each signature was
examined by a graphologist to find the match with the ``thinking of
you'' caption found on the snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   Denning, who died last year at the age of 100, concluded that it
was Fairbanks but did not say so in the report, which had been
commissioned to find out only whether there was a security lapse.
He reported back simply that there was none and left it at that,
Jay said.
</P>
<P>
   A friend and confidant of the duchess, Paul Vaughan, suggested
to the program that Sandys was the headless figure in a separate
Polaroid shot in the bathroom. ``She did say to me quite clearly
that `of course sweetie,' the only Polaroid camera in the country
at this time had been lent to the Ministry of Defense. If that
wasn't running a flag up the pole, I don't know what was. She
wanted someone to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Deedes, then a minister in the Macmillan government and
later the editor of The Daily Telegraph, recalled that Sandys
protested his innocence at the time but threatened to resign from
the Cabinet on principle. He was persuaded out of it when he
realized that, coming at the time of the Profumo scandal, that
could have brought down the government.
</P>
<P>
   The only child of a self-made Scottish textile millionaire, the
young Margaret Whigham, with green eyes and magnolia-pale skin,
took London by storm in 1931, becoming debutante of the year and
companion to a series of eligible men. In 1933 she married an
American stockbroker and amateur golfer named Charles Sweeny in a
London wedding that drew 2,000 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   During the '30s she reached the heights of society, becoming a
lively participant at parties, balls, charity matinees and royal
receptions and London's most photographed and publicized
upper-class beauty. An enraptured Cole Porter wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire.
</P>
<P>
   You're Mussolini,
</P>
<P>
   You're Mrs. Sweeny,
</P>
<P>
   You're Camembert.''
</P>
<P>
   She was divorced from Sweeny in 1947, and in 1951 became the
wife of the 11th Duke of Argyll, chief of the Clan Campbell and
hereditary master of the royal household in Scotland. The marriage
ended with the spectacular divorce in 1963, and he died in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Even as her life went into decline, Argyll remained a favorite
subject of gossip columnists who tracked her growing feuds with her
family, landlords, servants, bankers and biographers. In the 1970s
she was forced to open up her Mayfair house to paying visitors
until in 1978 she was obliged to sell it and move into an apartment
in the Grosvenor House hotel. She was evicted from there in 1990
for unpaid rent and placed in the nursing home where three years
later, penniless and alone, she suffered a fall in her bathroom
that broke her neck, killing her.

GETTING WORKED UP AGAIN OVER POP CULTURE'S GROSS-OUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By JON PARELES   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's an election year without a moral panic? Popular music,
and pop culture in general, are set up to be prime targets this
year, stuck in the crossfire of a battle for the righteous high
ground. Republicans and Democrats are both positioning themselves
as guardians of what George W. Bush, in his speech accepting the
Republican nomination, called ``essential values.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, as everyone remembers, is married to Tipper Gore, a
founder of the Parents' Music Resource Center, which pressured
recording companies to place quasi-voluntary warning labels on
potentially offensive albums. His vice-presidential choice, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, sponsored legislation to require labeling for
recordings, movies and video games, with penalties for selling
taboo material to children. (The bill was defeated.) Both major
parties seem poised to offer cultural clean-up plans.
</P>
<P>
   When the moral-panic soundbites start to fly, artistic subtlety
is the first casualty. Eminem, pop's current chief miscreant, has
already drawn considerable flak for his second album, ``The
Marshall Mathers LP.'' He deserves some of it; when he gets lazy,
he defaults to homophobic slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Marshall Mathers LP'' is also an extended, twisted,
hyperbolic diatribe about the gap between fantasy and reality,
persona and personality, word and action. Eminem spends long
stretches telling listeners not to like him, not to act like him
and not to expect him to act like the wild man in his songs. ``Drug
Ballad'' has an infamous line: ``You are now allowed to officially
slap bitches.'' But it follows a description of ``you'' getting
falling-down drunk; four lines later, still drunk, ``you'' drive
your car to ``cause a 42-car pileup.'' It's pretty clear that the
song describes idiotic behavior, but even simple irony is too
complicated for a soundbite.
</P>
<P>
   The million-selling rap-metal band Slipknot, which dresses its
members like clowns and ghouls and draws rabidly slam-dancing
crowds, is just reaching the radar of the censorious with potential
soundbites like ``How many times have you wanted to kill/
Everything and everyone.'' But the songs are blurted confessions of
characters about to crack up or commit suicide; fans use them as an
energy boost and hear them as much-needed company in adolescent
misery. There's context beyond the mayhem, more than the
parental-advisory label suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the busy pop marketplace has no lack of crass,
pandering products. The moral panic is a fitting response to a
grotesque cultural moment. Pop culture's governing intelligence
seems to belong to a hormone-addled 15-year-old boy who can't tell
whether he's horny or furious.
</P>
<P>
   In an article for The New York Times Magazine, RJ Smith
described a confluence of rap-metal, wrestling and pornography in
which rage and sexual confusion reinforce each other and women and
gay men have become fair game. Add in morning-radio shock jocks,
gladiatorial talk shows, ever cruder comedy acts, blood-spattered
action movies and brutal video games, and the spectacle of heavy
breathing backed by hair-trigger force is everywhere. Millions of
people now happily entertain themselves with visions of gross-outs,
punch-outs and shoot-outs. They're ready to rumble, even if they
tell pollsters they're worried about other people's bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   Where did the testosterone frenzy come from? If pop culture is a
barometer of unexpressed desires, then the angry white male, seen
by pollsters as a major factor in 1990s elections, is still gaining
ground. He misses his unquestioned power; he resents the gains of
feminism and gay rights. In a rebellion against liberal tolerance,
he's reasserting longtime rule over all the underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   But since tolerance has become the norm, he also insists that he
has become an underdog himself. He wants to be as cool as any
oppressed minority, even if his main source of oppression is girls
who spurn his coarse advances. Slipknot, or the wrestler called the
Rock (who spoke at the Republican convention), lets him share in a
roar of defiance, or a headlock, applied to enemies real or
imaginary.
</P>
<P>
   But pop culture is a cantankerous, polymorphous critter. It's
just as likely, and perhaps more likely, to be a counterweight,
providing feelings that people are missing in their daily lives.
For the overwhelming majority of people who can distinguish between
fact and fiction, culture can be an escape and a compensation, like
psychological antimatter. Consider that some of the poorest nations
_ Haiti, Congo _ produce some of the world's happiest-sounding
music.
</P>
<P>
   Censorious types envision a monkey-see, monkey-do relationship
between culture and its fans. Imitation and seepage can occur; on
anecdotal evidence, it seems people are more likely to voice
misogynistic or homophobic slurs now than they were a decade ago.
Yet there's also a monkey-don't response: the video game satiates
the mass-murder impulse. A piece of popular culture that touts its
realism _ like recent gangsta rap _ may well be assuming an
audience that's too far from the original scene to check
authenticity, much less participate.
</P>
<P>
   So pop provides both chronicles of the moment and anthems of
wishful thinking. During the late 1960s, when the United States was
conducting the Vietnam War and bitter tensions divided the country,
pop songs called for peace, unity and love. The great mid-1970s
letdown _ Watergate, oil crisis, recession _ sent perky, hedonistic
disco to the top of the charts. In 2000, the United States has
peace, a humming economy and widespread quiescence; there's no
visible enemy, just bland corporate power. And as a balance, pop
culture is a thrashing, belligerent mess, where everyday
frustration and aggression discharge in a jubilant symbolic rage.
It's a strange equilibrium, and applying real-world values might
have unintended consequences.

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW

<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
at submarine rescue, and, unlike the Russians, they have
professional crews and professional people who are trained for
submarine rescues.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that
can conduct rescue operations in depths of up to 2,000 feet and
evacuate up to 24 crewmembers at a time. Britain has put a similar
deep search and rescue submarine on standby.
</P>
<P>
   If a request is officially made Wednesday, Weaver estimated that
rescue crews from NATO nations could be at the site by early
Thursday, providing teams enough time to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have been careful not to raise hopes too far.
The undersea evacuation is a complex maneuver made far more
difficult by the violent weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue teams Tuesday night launched a second attempt
to reach the submarine with a capsule capable of bringing men to
the surface in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the
capsule from the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineer,'' Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said there might have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the submarine's nose, sending it crashing to the sea
bottom. An explosion inside the torpedo chamber, which contains
warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties, analysts
said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed off
in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate the submarine
if several compartments, including the control center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. ``It is difficult for the shirrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storms have calmed down somewhat, although waves are still
high. But the current is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   T
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailo marked

Saturday or early Sunday.

BRITISH AIRWAYS GROUNDS ITS CONCORDES AFTER REPORT BY INVESTIGATORS
 
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for writethru to add new information on recommended
withdrawal of airworthiness certificate and to add details and
restructure throughout.) 
(Eds: This story is now on Page 1.) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC grounded its fleet of Concorde
supersonic airliners Tuesday after French and British investigators
said they would urge the withdrawal of the airplane's airworthiness
certification following the fatal crash of an Air France Concorde
near Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first time in more than 20 years that an
airworthiness certificate for a commercial airliner had been
revoked by any country. The investigators said they would not spell
out their reasoning until Wednesday, and so it was unclear why they
were recommending certification be withdrawn, what steps would have
to be taken to reverse the recommendation or how long that might
take.
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways spokeswoman said the suspension of flights was
``indefinite.'' But it remained unclear whether the move
effectively meant the end of supersonic trans-Atlantic flights,
largely the elite preserve of executives and celebrities over the
airplane's 25 years of commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France are the only airlines to fly the
Concorde. Aviation analysts and officials say the investigators'
action suggests that they believe that British Airways' fleet of
seven Concordes faces the same risk of catastrophe as the doomed
Air France Flight 4590.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on everything I know, it is a safe aircraft to fly,''
said the British Airways chief executive, Rod Eddington. ``But at
the end of the day, we rest on the information provided to us by
the accident investigators and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash was the only fatal Concorde accident in the
plane's history. When it happened, Air France immediately suspended
flights by its remaining five Concordes. British Airways, after an
initial one-day suspension, continued to fly the needle-nosed
airliner, which crosses the Atlantic in three and one-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators concluded five days ago that a 16-inch
piece of metal on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport probably
slashed a tire as the Air France plane hurtled down the runway on
take-off at about 195 mph, scattering debris that ruptured fuel
tanks. The plane took off with a plume of flame spewing from its
wing and crashed less than two minutes later
</P>
<P>
   British officials declined to say whether Tuesday's suspension
of flights meant that British Airways' seven Concordes had also
been at risk since the Paris crash. But Chris Mason, a spokesman
for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, said that after French
investigators focused on the role of the tire blowout in the
accident, ``We have taken the position that we think it right to
suspend the certificate of airworthiness for Concorde'' in Britain
as well as France.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Bastianelli, a spokeswoman for the French accident
investigation bureau, said a ruptured tire ``should not have such
consequences as the piercing of the tank and the destruction of the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing there is something that is not safe there, and
until the safety of the aircraft can be guaranteed, we recommend
that the Concorde stops flying,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Press Association news agency reported Tuesday night
that British Airways Concordes had been fitted with reinforced
flaps above the under-carriage because of the risk of debris from
damaged tires hitting the wings. An alarm system had also been
positioned on the flight-decks to warn crew members of blowouts. It
was not clear if Air France had made similar modifications, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   David Learmount, operations and safety officer of Flight
International magazine, called the recommendation for suspension of
the Concorde's certification ``very, very rare and very, very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said that British Airways had modified its fleet of Concordes
in the mid-1990s to prevent similar tire accidents from causing
catastrophic damage and, on the basis of that modification, the
airplanes had been permitted to continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   After assessing evidence from the French investigation, however,
British investigators ``must have come to the conclusion that
despite the British Airways modification, the risk is unacceptably
high'' of a crash similar to the one in France, Learmount said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A suspension of certification, he said, means ``the aircraft is
grounded, and it has to be modified so that the risk is eliminated
or reduced'' to the satisfaction of aviation regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The last such suspension of certification, he said, involved
DC-10 aircraft. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded
the planes for five weeks in 1979 after the crash of an American
Airlines plane in Chicago killed 275 people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mason at Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it was ``almost
impossible'' to say how long the suspension would remain in force,
but aviation industry experts said that, whatever the outcome, the
combination of last month's accident and the planned withdrawal of
flying certification could seriously damage confidence in Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde flights account for only a fraction of the earnings of
both Air France and British Airways, although British Airways is
thought to earn slightly more because it usually schedules two
flights a day each way between London and New York, whereas Air
France had one. The service is reduced to one return journey each
day in August, when demand among its usual high-end customers is
low, British Airways said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high maintenance and fuel costs, the aircraft also act
as prestige emblems, drawing in the well-heeled corporate
passengers that British Airways, in particular, sees as its
principal source of income. Aviation industry experts have
suggested that, if Concorde loses its appeal, then corporate
travelers could move to other airlines or corporate jets,
particularly since a supersonic model for a corporate jet is
reportedly under development in France.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it had been told early Tuesday by Britain's
Air Accidents Investigation Branch that both it and its French
counterpart, the Bureau of Accident Investigations, would recommend
on Wednesday that Concorde's certificate of airworthiness be
suspended. When the word came, said Eddington, the British Airways
chief executive, a British Airways Concorde flight, BA 001, was
about to depart for New York on schedule, at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-seat, pencil-thin airliner had begun to taxi after
pushing off from the stand at London's Heathrow Airport with just
37 people on board, a British Airways spokeswoman said. The plane
was ordered back to the terminal and the flight canceled, along
with the return flight scheduled for Tuesday night from New York.
The passengers were transferred to subsonic flights.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Eddington said that British Airways decided
immediately to suspend its Concorde flights. ``We immediately
withdrew our supersonic fleet from service this morning, canceling
the Concorde service BA001,'' he said. In a television interview
later, he said he did not know what was behind the decision by the
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Eddington insisted that after the Air France accident, British
Airways carried out ``an extensive series of checks on the
aircraft's air frame, engines, tires and wheels, hydraulics and
other sustem.'' And, he said, Britain's Civil Aviation authority _
the industry regulator _ had been ``in complete agreement with our
decision to resume Concorde's services shortly after the Air France
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Aviation Authority said French and British
investigators would give a full explanation of their action on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's official silence about the cause of the suspension
infuriated some people living near the Concorde's flight-path at
London's Heathrow Airport. ``The Civil Aviation authority must tell
us, particularly those living near the airport, what has happened
to bring about this reversal of policy,'' said David Wilshire, an
opposition legislator representing the area around Heathrow. ``They
cannot hide behind this simple statement that they have new
information.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators' attention has centered on the tire blow-out
in the Air France crash, the Concorde's safety record has come
under close scrutiny in the past few weeks. New Scientist magazine
said recently that it had details of a study of Concorde's engines,
commissioned by British Airways two years ago, identifying 55
``significant risks.'' British Airways said, however, that the
Civil Aviation Authority had seen no need for improvement in the
airplane's safety precautions because of the study.

ADVERTISING: SYSTEM OFFERS MORE ACCURATE DATA ON RESPONSES TO
COMMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are everywhere, cluttering the radio dial and the broadcast
and cable television channels as never before: commercials, lots of
them, jammed by eager advertisers into what seems to be every
available second of programming time.
</P>
<P>
   So is anyone actually paying attention?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, broadcasters say. But what proof do they have?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are the ratings, which are provided by services like
Nielsen for television and Arbitron for radio and which are
supposed to track just how many people are watching or listening to
given programs at given times. But the relatively small audience
samples and traditional audience-measuring techniques used by these
rating services _ hand-written diaries, for example, or manually
operated ``people meters,'' where participants push buttons when
they watch television _ are said by their detractors to be inexact
and quaintly old-fashioned, unfairly favoring traditional networks
to the detriment of less-established media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Advertisers are clamoring for more precise data, and
for the technology that can provide it, says Lee Weinblatt. And
Weinblatt thinks he can oblige.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Pretesting Co., based in Tenafly, N.J.,
Weinblatt is no stranger to audience response measurement. For more
than a decade, his firm has been testing commercials for clients
like Anheuser-Busch, Burger King and Johnson &AMP; Johnson before they
are broadcast, determining whether viewers are likely to watch them
or, instead, to switch them off on sight. And now he says that he
has developed something that goes even further: a passive system
that measures exactly who is in a room or automobile at the precise
moment a television or radio commercial is broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The new system is called Whispercode, and unlike the firm's
commercial pretesting, which is conducted in specially outfitted
locations, it operates entirely within the home or automobile of
its participants. The system involves the encoding of commercials
with inaudible, identifying signals; test participants need do
nothing to activate it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, once transmitted, the encoded signals are automatically
detected by a small device worn by participants _ a bracelet, for
example, or a keychain _ that will function provided they are in
the room or car where the television set or radio emitting the
signal is located. The devices are motion sensitive, so a
participant could not put one on the table and leave the house. The
device then sends a signal to a nearby recording box ``the size of
a paperback book,'' according to Weinblatt, and the box records the
fact that the wearer was in the room when the commercial was
broadcast. It even records whether a viewer leaves the room in the
middle of a commercial. The device later downloads its data via
modem to a central computer, which makes it available to
advertisers the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Weinblatt says the system will be in place in a ``few thousand''
homes by year-end, and in thousands more by the end of 2001.
Participants will be chosen at random, but in a manner that is
demographically accurate and representative of a cross-section of
American households, he said. And they will be compensated for
their involvement by various premiums or coupons _ no cash _
relating to products or services like dry cleaning, which are
probably not among those that will be advertised and measured via
Whispercode..
</P>
<P>
   ``With Whispercode, we will finally be providing our clients
with a true accounting of where their advertising money is going,''
Weinblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Still, despite expressions of interest from various
advertisers and a satellite broadcaster, no one has signed up for
Whispercode, Weinblatt acknowledged. And even Whispercode has its
limitations; while the system may provide an accurate gauge of a
person's physical presence at the time of a broadcast, any couch
potato can tell you that that does not necessarily mean that he or
she is actually listening or watching. Or, for that matter, whether
he or she is even awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a flaw inherent in any passive monitoring system,''
commented Anne Elliot, a spokeswoman for Nielsen Media Research,
the television rating company. Active survey devices like Nielsen's
people meter are therefore better in many ways, she said, because
they require participants to actually do something to indicate when
they start or stop viewing a show.
</P>
<P>
   But people meters also have problems, because they are dependent
on the honesty of participants and their willingness to keep
pushing buttons, among other things. And so, despite their
drawbacks, passive systems still ``have enough interest for people
like us for us to investigate them, too,'' Elliot said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research has in fact signed an agreement with
Arbitron, the radio survey company, to participate in a test of
just such a system, the Arbitron Portable People Meter. Similar to
Weinblatt's Whispercode (Pretesting Co. actually sued Arbitron back
in the mid-1990s for patent infringement with regard to the
Portable People Meter, but lost the case in 1996), the Arbitron
system differs, however, in one significant respect: it encodes
entire programs, not commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitron began shipping encoding devices to Philadelphia-area
radio stations this week. It expects to begin testing in a few
months and, if testing is successful, to use the meters eventually
to replace the manual paper and pencil diaries now maintained by
its radio ratings participants, said an Arbitron spokesman, Thom
Mocarsky, who added that ``everyone who has seen the system is very
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except Weinblatt, who contends that its
failure to measure commercials makes the Portable People Meter an
inferior device, and that Arbitron and Nielsen are more concerned
with preserving an obsolete status quo than with truly measuring
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Mocarsky says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our system can encode anything,'' he said. ``But we've decided
to base it on programming and not commercials because that is the
standard today. It's simply a different technique.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS STAGE PLUGGED-IN CONVENTION
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An Internet-linked computer for each delegation, a
video chat room on the podium, a digital still photo gallery, and a
battery of swiveling video cameras remotely controlled by online
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say these and other touches make this the most
cyberspace-friendly political convention ever held.
</P>
<P>
   When the delegates voted Tuesday to adopt the party platform,
they dispensed with the traditional phone call between the podium
and the state chairpersons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each delegation site comes equipped with a kiosk that
holds a password-protected Apple iMac unit. The computers run a
$500,000 software package donated by Election.com.
</P>
<P>
   The voting results _ no surprises here _ appeared in real time
on both the Election.com and dems2000.com Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully committed to this system,'' said convention
spokesman Peter Ragone, predicting that online voting will
``revolutionize'' U.S. elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also sought to one-up the Republicans by offering
online chats with convention speakers as they came off the podium.
These interviews evoked the era when wire service reporters worked
directly on the podium _ except that these online reporters are
Democratic Party employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first gig was with Karenna Schiff Gore,'' said Travis
Berry, who sits toward the back of the dais in a black canvas
director's chair, tapping away with one hand on a laptop while
holding a microphone in the other. ``The only time we halt these
interactive sessions is when he have a really major speaker, like
President Clinton or the first lady,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's laptop indicated hat dozens of questions and comments
had been ``cleared'' by the time the Clintons spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his live streaming video event failed to pass
muster with the ``Energizing the Electronic Electorate'' project of
the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats didn't deliver,'' said Chris Hunter, an analyst
for the project's NetElection.org Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter claimed that podium chat users who posted questions were
greeted with automated responses. ``This is yet another example,''
he added, ``of the failure of both parties to successfully and

 &HT;    CLINTON MEETS GORE AND SYMBOLICALLY PASSES THE TORCH
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Mich. _ There was no torch, or even a baton _ just a
handshake and a wave goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   With that, President Clinton walked off a stage erected in the
historic town square here, leaving Vice President Gore and his
wife, Tipper, standing alone and waving to the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic parting Tuesday, complete with confetti and
streamers, was intended to convey an important message as Gore
heads to Los Angeles to accept the Democratic presidential
nomination: Clinton's political moment was past and Gore's was set
to begin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton delivered his farewell address to Democrats
at their convention, rousing delegates with the achievements of his
administration and heaping praise on Gore, his loyal vice president
of eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it helped him,'' Clinton said Tuesday en route to
Monroe to stand on stage with Gore. ``We'll see. Maybe it did. I
don't know. But the main thing was I just wanted to thank the
people and say what I believed....I'll never forget this as long as
I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, John Podesta, Clinton's chief of staff, said the
president was anxious ``to lay back a little bit and watch Al lay
out his plans for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said Clinton would continue to raise money for the
Democrats and speak to various constituencies of the Democratic
Party. ``He will do whatever the Gore-Lieberman team thinks will be
helpful, but it's their call,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the two Democrats was short on rhetorical
flourish and long on political symbolism. Michigan was a decisive
state for the Clinton-Gore ticket when they defeated President Bush
in 1992 during an economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   The two men campaigned frequently in Michigan on the theme of
the economy, successfully portraying Bush as out of touch with the
economic hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore is campaigning hard on the economy's rebound, trying
to persuade voters that he is best able to lead continued economic
expansion in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief remarks Tuesday, Clinton noted that unemployment in
Monroe County dropped from 8.8 percent in 1993 to 2.2 percent this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the record is clear,'' Clinton declared. ``This
country is better off than it was eight years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to associate Gore with the nation's prosperity,
telling the crowd that ``every good thing that has happened, that
came out of our administration in the last eight years, Al Gore was
at the heart of.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his own remarks immediately following Clinton's, Gore
appeared reluctant to accept the credit. He referred several times
to the economic policies of the administration as the ``Clinton
program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy
right,'' Gore said. ``And I'm pledging to you here today, I am not
going to let the other side wreck it and take it away from us.
We're going to keep the prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, accused Clinton and Gore of
doing little for education and reforming Social Security, calling
their record a ``squandered opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the passing of the baton will work to close the
leadership problem for Al Gore,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of speaking to mostly smaller crowds, Tuesday's
event attracted about 6,000 people to Monroe's town square.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Heidtman, a fifth grade school teacher, drove 140 miles
from her home in Bay Side, Mich., just to catch a glimpse of
Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for Clinton to fade away, go with Hillary to New
York and let Gore be presidential,'' said Heidtman, who waited
three hours for the men to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the crowd was on hand to cheer Gore. Glenn
Haddix said he was moved by the historical moment and wanted his
two boys to see the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Haddix, a member of the National Rifle Association, said he
does not intend to vote for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel Mr. Bush is going to be a little more friendly to us
law abiding gun owners,'' Haddix said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging Michigan's improved economy, several people
in Tuesday's crowd said the economy alone was not enough for them
to automatically swear allegiance to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of other issues,'' said Dawn Van Slamgrouck
(cq), a special education teacher. ``I'm still listening. I just
want to hear what we has to say and I don't want any lies.''

WITH TOURISTS AT THE GATE, AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN PANNONIA STILL
MAGICAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Details on transportation, accommodations, meals and seasonal
attractions at end) 
 By MICHAEL RATCLIFFE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty miles southeast of Vienna, vineyards sweep down from a
line of low, wooded hills to a shallow lake, and Eastern Europe
begins. Austria's present-day frontiers with Hungary and Slovakia
may be a few miles farther on, but the shift from central, Alpine
Europe is sudden, dramatic and unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   This magical landscape is undersung. The reed beds and wetlands
of the Neusiedler See stretch to a skyline that vanishes in the
haze. Cherries, walnuts and almonds flourish; storks nest on the
rooftops; spoonbills and great white egrets gather to breed. The
wines are delicious. You sleep well under wide skies.
</P>
<P>
   The tranquillity is deceptive. The dangers and ironies of
history abound. Until a referendum in 1921, this was not part of
Austria at all, but western Hungary. Citizens of Sopron, handsome
capital of the region, voted to remain in Hungary, but the village
of Raiding, birthplace of Franz Liszt, Hungary's most famous
composer, became Austrian. The Austrians called their new province
Burgenland: to the Romans it was part of Pannonia. It has always
been border country, and until 1700 was regularly raided and
occupied by Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years ago, when the Hungarians cut the barbed wire near
Moerbisch to let East Germans into the West, they did so on a site
sacred to Mithras, the Roman god of light who battled against
darkness. Where the Romans have been, their spirit never quite goes
away, and this is where the end of Communist Europe began.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, I wanted to see if Pannonia retained any common
identity, a quest that went out of the window as soon as I
discovered how enormous the region had been. Instead, my friend
Howard and I devised a more local, ragged oblong route of our own _
out of, and back to, the Vienna airport. Four nights near the
Neusiedler See in Austria were followed by four in Hungary, and a
final one back in Austria. We took our time, and drove less than
500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious Neusiedler See _ Lake Ferto to Hungarians _ is
roughly 18 miles long and 4 miles wide. It is the only steppe lake
in Western Europe, rarely more than 7 feet deep, and fed by
underground streams. It has been known to evaporate completely. On
the western shore, we stayed at Kloster am Spitz in Purbach,
halfway between the village and the hills. This is like a French
vineyard-restaurant with rooms _ but properly Austrian, and
seasonal in its cooking. No fewer than six dishes on one menu
honored the high summer rites of the Eierschwammerl, the delicious
wild mushroom of Central Europe, a cross between porcini and
chanterelles. The Eierschwammerl came terrined, roasted, souped,
sauced for pork medallions, sauced for beef, and as a vegetarian
goulash with tiny marjoram dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   With the scents of thyme and sage on the air, and crimson
oleanders in tubs, Purbach begins to feel Mediterranean. Each
evening we walked down the hill after dinner, with planes winking
in to land far above and fireflies round our feet. Ahead, a great
silence settled over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   We were also traveling in the steps of two Pannonian prodigies
who changed the course of Western music: Josef Haydn, last and
greatest of composers to write most of his music as the contracted
servant of one patron; and Franz Liszt, first modern superstar,
forever on the road. There are two delightful small Haydn houses in
Austria, at Rohrau and Eisenstadt, while fabled Eszterhaza, Prince
Nicholas Esterhazy's ``little Versailles,'' where Haydn transformed
the classical symphony and invented the string quartet, still
stands, on the Hungarian side. For 40 years, the Iron Curtain
severed the roads of duty taken by Haydn between the palaces of his
master, and the link between Raiding and Sopron, where Adam Liszt
presented his son in public for the first time. The phenomenal boy
was 9, the acclaim tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to lose the Esterhazys for long in this corner of
Europe; they were its little kings. Managing to be both Hungarian
patriots and loyal to the Hapsburgs, they were twice offered the
crown of Hungary by enemies of Austria, and twice turned it down.
Eisenstadt, miniature capital of the kingdom and a 30 minutes drive
from Purbach, sits sweetly among vineyards in a bowl of wooded
hills. The main street of this small town has been anesthetized by
prosperity _ the retail shops could be anywhere _ but just beyond
it are a prince's palace, a composer's home, a merchant's
synagogue, two Jewish cemeteries and the plump little Baroque
church, which shook joyfully through the 1790s with the faith and
passion of new Haydn Masses.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three centuries, the Esterhazys protected ``their''
Jews in seven specific ghetto communities, of which this was one,
safely within view of their own sumptuous palace, inspired by the
Villa Farnese in Rome. Hidden from the street on the first floor of
the merchant Samson Wertheimer's house, an early 18th-century
synagogue survived both Kristallnacht and the community's
destruction, becoming an intimate and tender Jewish museum _
Austria's first _ in 1978. After visiting the synagogue, we went up
the road to its Christian contemporary, the delectably compact
Bergkirche, where Haydn is buried. Attached to the church is the
Baroque Kalvarienberg, whose architect built a staircase past
life-size Stations of the Cross inside a kind of honeycombed
teapot. When you emerge on the lid, or roof, you are met by white
limestone angels and look over folds of russet tiling to glorious
countryside beyond. Despite the grim tableaus within, this is one
of my favorite buildings anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The eastern and southern shores of the Neusiedler See are
largely now part of an Austro-Hungarian national park, and most of
the lakeshore is inaccessible by car. You can walk, bike or ride on
causeways through the reeds to the water's edge. We stayed at the
faintly preposterous Villa Vita and Holiday Resort Pannonia near
Pamhagen, where every building in the compound was a weirdly
perfect imitation of some Pannonian archetype outside.
</P>
<P>
   Villa Vita is only a 15-minute bike ride from a spectacular bird
reserve. Surrounded by wind-swept, silvery grassland, with old
water pumps and observation shelters dotted round the rim, the
Lange Lacke is a large pond, where I saw one of the most beautiful
birds I have ever seen. Over 3 feet tall, dazzling white, with a
lemon yellow beak and long, slim neck, the great egret posed
against a stand of reeds like a figure on a folding screen.
</P>
<P>
   Nearer the Hungarian border is a modest Hapsburg palace by the
great architect of the Belvedere in Vienna, Lucas von Hildebrandt.
Schloss Halbturn stands poised between two worlds: at the top of
the vineyard by the gates you look west and see the faint blue line
of the Alps; in the park below the house is a delightful
neo-Classical church that would be at home in Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The morning we were there, swallows and martins were diving low
over the vines, and cherries had stained the road to the border a
disturbingly dark red.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hungarian side, we could see a flag, an abandoned shed, a
pole-barrier collapsed on the ground; in Austria, a wheat field
grown to the line was surveyed by a saint on a stone pillar and
three soldiers, armed. This pattern was repeated everywhere: the
Austrians were still watching, the Hungarians were not. It would
have been easy to walk out of the European Union, harder to get
back in.
</P>
<P>
   The transition between the two countries is a real one. For all
its beautiful brochures, Hungarian tourism is only reluctantly
geared to its principal client, the German-speaking market.
Hungarians do not enjoy speaking German, and are often unwilling to
hazard their English. So it is not as easy to move around as it is
in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   That said, I retain great affection for Sopron (pronounced
SHOP-ron), a walkable and remarkably well-preserved city of 60,000
people where the sidewalks gleam in the rain like Venice, and the
shop with the little elephant statue on the corner still sells
bottled peas. On the second evening, after a long storm, it became
dry enough to explore the layered, ancient structures behind
Sopron's little courts and doorways. These include the intact
shells of two medieval synagogues, one of them identified only in
the 1950s. One of Europe's sleeping beauties, Sopron is also the
best base for visiting Eszterhaza, the apricot-colored palace that
brought cutting-edge music to a marsh at the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   This was my fourth visit to Eszterhaza in 17 years. It exerts a
deep spell, yet its neglect by Hungarian governments before and
after 1989 is a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   True, they have fixed the wiring, the water supply and the roof;
there are concerts in Haydn's frescoed music room, and a festival
every July. But the air of a management that does not know what it
is dealing with, and would rather not deal with it at all, remains
overwhelming. The gardens are shabby, the park overgrown. There is
no imagination and no love.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Rococo palace still take the guided trudge round
two dozen or so underfurnished rooms in felt slippers that are
falling apart. Minimal information (``On the Baroque table are a
clock and two candlesticks from France'') is still delivered with
an indifference bordering on revulsion. No one is encouraged to
enjoy the Haydn exhibition, which, new in 1982, has now faded to
lifeless sepia; as you go around, you don't even hear any music.
And yet, I return because I love the music of Haydn, who made a
revolution here, and because, even with mass tourism now virtually
at the gates, the elegiac spell survives.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of love and imagination a few miles down
the road in the whitewashed manor house of Nagycenk.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference!
</P>
<P>
   This was the home of Count Szechenyi, Hungarian radical patriot
and conservative rival of Kossuth, who built the Chain Bridge
between Buda and Pest, transformed the waterways of Hungary, and
went mad after the failed revolution of 1848. The rooms are full of
interest, and the story is movingly told on English-language
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Driving deeper into Hungary, we reached Sarvar, halfway between
Sopron and Lake Balaton, where we stayed in a spa hotel _ the best
for miles around _ almost entirely occupied by gentle seniors of
Austria, Germany and Switzerland who consumed fiercely
prescriptive, calorie-counted meals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearer Balaton, at the ruined fortress of Sumeg around which
battles between Christianity and Islam swirled for half a
millennium, history is now privatized, replayed as kitsch, and
served by a new village of tawdry shops and holiday homes.
</P>
<P>
   The real village of Sumeg is half a mile round the corner, and
miraculously intact. The bishop's palace and garden, combining
Turkish wooden balconies and a Chekhovian terrace with the sassy
ease of Hungarian baroque, is being brought back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Austria, Schlaining was the first of four massive former
Hungarian fortresses that we saw in a fizzy last 24 hours.
Bernstein, home of the aviator and Arabist Count Almasy (the hero
of ``The English Patient'') and now partly a hotel, was the most
patrician of the four, overgrown but cherished, with the family
still around. We stayed in a third, Lockenhaus, a few miles away,
where we slept in a Gothic bedroom with the wind literally moaning
under the door.
</P>
<P>
   A glorious new road, the S31, sped us north 20 miles across the
hills of central Burgenland on our last morning. The fourth and
last fortress was Forchtenstein, where the Esterhazys display
priceless family treasures and memorabilia that ring with the
Hapsburg, Hungarian and Ottoman histories of this borderland: a
Turkish officer's tent, paper-thin ivory vessels, a heron's feather
from a magnate's hat. Plus walls full of male Esterhazys portrayed
with massive gun dogs swooning loyally at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   Before this, we had stopped in Raiding at the cottage,
embellished by scarlet geraniums, roses and vines, where Liszt was
born. White chairs were grouped round a little stage in the garden,
for a recital that evening. We longed to stay. The house was given
to Austria by the Esterhazys on Liszt's birthday in 1971. It has
only two rooms, but they were filled _ to bursting _with great
recorded performances of his music.

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the American vessels Mystic and
Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport aircraft and
arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
at submarine rescue, and, unlike the Russians, they have
professional crews and professional people who are trained for
submarine rescues.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that
can conduct rescue operations in depths of up to 2,000 feet and
evacuate up to 24 crewmembers at a time. Britain has put a similar
deep search and rescue submarine on standby.
</P>
<P>
   If a request is officially made Wednesday, Weaver estimated that
rescue crews from NATO nations could be at the site by early
Thursday, providing teams enough time to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have been careful not to raise hopes tore
difficult by the violent weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue teams Tuesday night launched a second attempt
to reacrface in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the
capsule from the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineaid there might have been an explosion in
the torpedo compartment in the submarine's nose, sending it
crashing to the sea bottom. An explosion inside the torpedo
chamber, which contains warheads, would probably have caused
extensive casualties, analysts said. Navy officials said casualties
could not be ``ruled out,'' thide the submarine were flooded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed off
in case oeral compartments, including the control center, are
flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine is tilted on the seabed, with its bow pointing
down, and also listing sharply to one side. As a result, the
capsules and other devices are sliding off driven by fear for the
sailors' lives. ``Our lack of knowledge about the fate of the crew
has marked all our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late
Saturday or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the
Russian fleet, was commissioned onlubmarine technology.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to the
environment, as it was carrying no nucut down. Officials in Norway
said there was no sign of a radiation leak.

   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   We rented an Opel Astra automatic from Avis at the Vienna
airport, total cost $763 for 10 days. There are several taxes
included, among them an airport surcharge of $61, and it probably
would be cheaper to arrange a rental in the United States. Prices
are calculated with a dollar valued at 15.45 Austrian schillings or
293 Hungarian forints.
ACCOMMODATIONS
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA: On the Neusiedler See, we stayed at the family-run
Kloster am Spitz in Purbach, telephone (43-2683) 5519, fax
(43-2683) 5519 20, for the excellent food; our room was simple,
spacious and quiet with private bathroom and shower. Doubles:
$27.75 a person, with full breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   At the Vila Vita near Pamhagen, (43-2175) 21800, fax (43-2175)
2180 444, www.vilavitahotels.com, a basic, modern double room is
$64 a person with breakfast, and a range of sports and leisure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   A comfortable Gothic bedroom with genuine moaning wind at
Lockenhaus Castle, Gunserstrasse 5, Lockenhaus, cost $70 for two,
breakfast included. The rooms have private bath, phone and cable
TV; (43-2616) 23 94, fax (43-2616) 27 66.
</P>
<P>
   HUNGARY: In Sopron, we were disappointed by the Palatinus. Best
Western's Pannonia Med on Varkerulet 75 looked like a good bet,
although we didn't stay there. A double with private bath is
$55.40; (36-99) 312180 or 312181, fax (36-99) 340 766.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles out of town, I liked the Hotel Kastely, Nagycenk,
where we had lunch. In this comfortable wing of the Szechenyi
family mansion, a double room with bath is $44.60 a person;
telephone and fax (36 99) 360-061.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarvar, the Danubius Thermal Hotel, (36-95) 323 999, fax
(36-95) 320 406, on the Web
www.danubiusgroup.com/danubius/sarvar.html, is '80s-modern, with
rooms in back overlooking an arboretum. Service is fairly efficient
but impersonal. Our double room was $102 including breakfast for
two, thermal baths and spa facilities. Treatments are extra.
RESTAURANTS
</P>
<P>
   Food is still seasonal and celebratory in Austria. May and June
is Spargelzeit (asparagus time), June the season for
Eierschwammerl.
</P>
<P>
   In Purbach we also dined at the posh Nicholauszeche, Bodenzeile
3, in the village, part of the Romantik chain. It was good, and
cost only about $44 a person; (43-2683) 5514.
</P>
<P>
   Our last _ and excellent _ lunch was at Johann Reisner in
Forchtenstein, Hauptstrasse 141, (43-2626) 63 139, where I took the
$15.85 menu, and had Eierschwammerl soup, rabbit and a fantastic
coffee-flavored pot de creme with sour cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Our best meals in Hungary were at the Hotel Kastely, Nagycenk,
and the HBH restaurant in Sarvar. At the hotel, I went Hungarian
with bean soup and veal paprika, followed by cherry, cottage
cheese, raisin and poppy-seed strudel ($4.90). The HBH is the
restaurant of a revived private brewery with historic Bavarian
links, and, as the singer swung into ``Blueberry Hill'' while we
tucked into inexpensive, tasty platefuls of tender, lean meat and
vegetables, we might never have left Munich.
</P>
<P>
   MAPS
</P>
<P>
   Map aficionados like me will be tempted by the Austrian
government's meticulous 1:50,000 series, which covers the
Neusiedler See in four sheets, virtually recording every path,
reedbed and ditch. You need No. 78 for Rust and Neusiedl, 108 for
Deutschkreutz (including Sopron) and 109 for Pamhagen. They cost $2
to $5 each in bookstores.

   RUSSIA-SUBMARINE (Moscow) _ Buffeted by storms, Russian rescuers
battled for a second day to reach 116 sailors trapped in a crippled
nuclear submarine on the sea floor, repeatedly trying to lower an
escape capsule to the stricken vessel. Efforts to rescue the Kursk,
lying motionless below the surface of the Barents Sea, were
hampered most of Tuesday by high winds and strong currents. There
had been no communication with the submarine since it went down,
and conditions inside were not known. It wasn't clear how much air
the crew had left and water appeared to be leaking in, officials
said. (Summary from wires) By Sabrina Tavernise and Christopher

   KOREA-REUNIONS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Under the watchful gaze of
North Korean minders here, 100 families separated for the last five
decades on Tuesday began the arduous process of rebuilding
relationships torn apart by war. Mothers embraced children long
given up for dead. Brothers and sisters struggled to identify
adults they knew until now only as children. Wives steeled
themselves to meet husbands long since wedded to other spouses, and
vice versa. And underlying all the carefully choreographed drama,
custom-made for tear-jerking footage and heartbreaking copy _
indeed, making it possible _ was the surprisingly sophisticated
political maneuvering of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. By

   BRITAIN-CONCORDE (London) _ British Airways grounded its entire

British investigators said they would urge the withdrawal of the

Air France Concorde crash near Paris. It would be the first time in
more than 20 years that an airworthiness certificate for a
commercial airliner had been revoked by any country. The

Wednesday, and so it was unclear what steps would have to be taken
to reverse the recommendation. By Alan Cowell.

BREATHING LIFE, POSTHUMOUSLY, INTO JAPAN'S ART SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For Release Sunday, August 20)  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ On the Japanese art scene, as in real estate, finance
and employment, the baburu (economic bubble) burst long ago. Today,
the friends and contacts a Western visitor encounters here are sure
to recollect, with incredulity and undisguised embarrassment, the
heady days of the 1980s, when Japanese corporations spent tens of
millions of dollars on Impressionist paintings at overseas
auctions, and when new museums, public and private, seemed to pop
up every month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the '90s, Japan's overheated real estate market
collapsed, which in turn affected other sectors of the economy. Art
sales slumped. Some commercial galleries closed. Companies that had
bought artworks primarily as investments but had rarely, or never,
displayed them saw their values plummet. (It did not help that many
of those works were lesser Marie Laurencins or Maurice Utrillos of
the old School of Paris calendar-art variety.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, against a backdrop of lingering art-world
doldrums, the new, city-financed Taro Okamoto Museum opened late
last year in Kawasaki, not far to the southwest of central Tokyo.
Housed in a typically monumental new building in a wooded public
park, it honors one of Japan's most influential modern artists. And
with some 100,000 visitors already, it has quickly become a hit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto, who died just shy of his 85th birthday in 1996, was
also a photographer, an ethnographer and a prolific author. In his
later years, he became known as an eccentric television personality
who turned up in commercials declaring, ``Art is explosion!'' In
Japan, he was also one of the few household names in art of his
generation. Okamoto was born in Kawasaki in 1911. His father,
Ippei, was a well-known cartoonist for Asahi Shimbun, a leading
national newspaper. His mother, Kanoko, was a poet and novelist
known for artistic and personal style. Taro was the Okamotos' only
child; in 1929, the family traveled to Europe, where Ippei had been
sent on an assignment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before they left Japan, Taro had begun studying at the Tokyo
School of Fine Arts. He resumed his studies in Paris, where he
learned to speak French and came of age as a serious young artist.
Okamoto lived there for 12 years, during which he befriended
Alberto Giacometti and Jean Arp, took part in the
Abstraction-Creation group and later showed his work with the
surrealists. In Abstraction-Creation's 1934 almanac, Okamoto held
his own in a climate of passionate polemics and manifestoes about
art, offering bons mots like: ``We must create form that is not
form and color that is not color.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Okamoto was moved by the folk and tribal arts on view
at the Trocadero Museum of Ethnography (which later became the
Museum of Man). He absorbed the ideas of the sociologist and
anthropologist Marcel Mauss (1872-1950), who examined the role of
gift giving and magic in society and propounded a theory of
``totality''; that is, of examining the actions of a total human
existence rather than a fragmented one. Okamoto also became
associated with Georges Bataille's College of Sociology.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During Okamoto's long Paris sojourn, his paintings featured
abstract, biomorphic forms set against empty backgrounds with a
surrealist air. Forced to head back to Japan in 1940 as the war in
Europe spread, Okamoto was stationed in China with the Japanese
army for five years. Returning home, to the politically charged
atmosphere of American-occupied Japan, Okamoto created some of his
most memorable images.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These included the large oil paintings ``Heavy Industry'' (1949)
and ``Law of the Jungle'' (1950). Produced at a time of social
unrest, when Japanese railway workers were being laid off, ``Heavy
Industry'' was an indictment of reckless capitalism. In ``Law of
the Jungle,'' a huge, mysterious animal with a zipper mouth lunges
forward menacingly as smaller creatures scurry out of its way, and
a trio of hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil monkeys huddles
in a corner. Okamoto called the picture's central monster a symbol
of fascism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what he had learned in Europe and experienced back in
Japan, Okamoto developed the idea of `polarism' that he tried to
express in his art,'' said Keinosuke Murata, the director of the
Taro Okamoto Museum. Murato spoke recently in his office, which is
situated at the tapered end of a wing of an oddly laid-out building
that he refers to with amusement as ``a fortress.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He explained that polarism allowed Okamoto to address both
abstract and surrealist values at the same time within a single
work. It offered him a way to grapple simultaneously with
avant-garde art values and the complicated social reality he saw
emerging amid the physical destruction and spiritual void of
postwar Japan. Okamoto, who once asserted that ``content has
priority over form,'' recalled in 1959 that he had been interested
in how his art ``would have an effect on society, not only as
something aesthetic, but also as a cry or movement in everyday
life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese art critic Ichiro Hariu has described Okamoto's
polarism as ``a philosophy that called for venturing into the
depths of contradictions without trying to bring them together with
easy solutions or compromises.'' It lay at the heart of Okamoto's
art-making and his outlook on life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For younger Japanese artists like Ushio Shinohara, who was born
in 1932, Okamoto's attitude was especially inspiring. Shinohara
helped found the Neo Dada Organizers, a short-lived
anti-establishment group, in 1960 and has been based in New York
since 1969. Hiswork has evolved from found-object, junk-assemblage
pieces to exuberant, crosscultural paintings in a rollicking
pop-art mode. ``Okamoto's energy was like Picasso's,'' Shinohara
said. ``It was big and infectious, and it liberated us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinohara recently showed a mural-size painting in an ``Homage
to Taro Okamoto'' exhibition at the Kawasaki museum. A riot of
writhing, cartoonish figures, it was entitled ``Taro Okamoto
Working Outdoors, From Arizona Sunrise to Bermuda Sunset.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto published books on traditional and modern art. He did
extensive research on the pottery of the Jomon era, dating back
more than two millenniums; experts regard the era as one of the
most important sources of Japan's indigenous culture. Okamoto
admired hand-shaped Jomon pots for the crude beauty of their
ropelike designs, seeing in them the confrontation of aesthetic
values that so intrigued him. He also traveled south to Okinawa,
photographing folk festivals, ceramics and local costumes along the
way. Carp-shaped banners fluttering above working-class
neighborhoods, a baby asleep in a handmade basket, a shaman
absorbed in her candlelit incantations: his pictures make a record
of Japanese folk life as vivid as any of Japan's black-and-white
movie classics of the postwar period. The Okamoto museum now holds
thousands of these photographs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Okamoto began making sculpture, and it is in
his vast outpouring of three-dimensional works that his main themes
and interests probably assumed their most engaging forms. Evoking
the flicker of a sorcerer's ceremonial flame, tribal totem poles
and the streamlining principles of classic modernism, he created
the imposing ``Tower of the Sun'' for the Expo '70 world's fair in
Osaka. He also made bronze temple bells, lighting fixtures,
molded-plastic sofas and cocktail glasses etched with masklike face
designs. (Okamoto served as artistic director of Expo '70. An
exhibition focusing on his ``Tower of the Sun'' and related designs
for the fair will be on view at the Kawasaki museum from Oct. 28
through Jan. 28, 2001.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life-affirming bright red, a symbol of good fortune in much of
East Asia, was Okamoto's favorite color. The entrance to the
permanent collection of his work in Kawasaki is a futuristic
tunnel-corridor painted hot red and bathed in red light. Multilevel
galleries display paintings, drawings and objects of various sizes
and materials; each room is part stage set, part design showroom,
where spindly tentacles and bulbous growths sprout from Okamoto's
nature-inspired sculptures. Visitors are even encouraged to sit on
some of the artist's flower- or hand-shaped chairs. Murata, a
former senior administrator at the National Museum of Art in Osaka,
said: ``Until recently, most Japanese museums have not tried to be
aesthetic experiences in themselves. But this one definitely
has.'' &QL;

 &HT;    LIEBERMAN ACTS TO REASSURE BLACK DEMOCRATS
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman told black Democratic
activists Tuesday in Los Angeles that he supports affirmative
action, trying to erase perceptions that he is too conservative for
a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me talk about affirmative action because questions have
been raised,'' the Democratic vice presidential candidate told
several hundred black delegates to the Democratic National
Convention. ``I want to talk very specifically about it. I have
supported affirmative action. I do support affirmative action. And
I will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Grumbling among Democrats had increased in recent days as
Lieberman's past statements questioning the preference program for
minorities and his support for using public money to pay for
private schooling got a fuller public airing.
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to say whether his remarks succeeded in generally
reassuring concerned African-Americans. But Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., who had pointedly raised questions about Lieberman's
selection, said she was satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman ``has said enough, he has done enough and he has
demonstrated his willingness to deal with issues of concern to the
black community,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   The level of enthusiasm among African-Americans is of more than
passing importance to Vice President Al Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   There is little worry that black voters will turn to the
Republicans, but substantial concern that more African-Americans
may decide to sit this one out.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters are very supportive of Democrats, and a decrease in
black support for Gore and Lieberman could prove decisive in states
such as Georgia, where Democratic candidates traditionally count on
overwhelming support from blacks to overcome a Republican edge
among white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of Lieberman has reinforced a view of the vice
president among some Democrats that he is not liberal enough or
committed enough to social justice issues.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours after Lieberman was chosen as the Democratic vice
presidential nominee last week, an NAACP official in Dallas
referred to him as a ``Jew person'' whose selection should raise
suspicions among African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and a host of African-Americans were quick to pounce
on the words of Lee Alcorn, the president of the organization's
Dallas chapter, as inappropriate and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject had been broached nonetheless, and black and
Jewish leaders worried about a new eruption of tension between
their groups.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been no other ethnically tinged comments, but
neither has there been universal acclaim among African-Americans
for Gore's decision to make Lieberman his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Lieberman's Orthodox Judaism so much as his politics
that could cause trouble for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any angst about Lieberman, it will be because he
represents the right wing of the Democratic party,'' said Ronald
Walters, a political science professor at the University of
Maryland. ``This is the second ticket of DLC origin, and it
confirms the rightward movement of Democratic party.''
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of the situation is that the first ticket to come
out of the DLC, the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, was the
pairing of Clinton and Gore. Clinton has been immensely popular
among black Americans, perhaps never more so than during his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That point was not lost on Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and the
leaders of the NAACP, who praised the Connecticut senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman made meeting with black delegates his first order of
business after arriving in Los Angeles Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He had voiced support California's Proposition 209, a 1998
ballot initiative to ban state-funded affirmative action programs.
He has spoken out against affirmative action, although his staff
has recently sought to clarify his position as merely opposed to
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said Tuesday he never campaigned for the ballot
measure, although he had been asked to do so. He added that he made
crucial votes in favor of affirmative action in 1995 and 1998 in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator's stands on a number of social issues
was threatening to disrupt the Democrats' celebration of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Waters, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., also has
raised questions and his father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who warmly
praised Lieberman's selection last week, offered a more measured
assessment of the Gore-Lieberman team Monday when he said, ``If it
means we have to hold our noses and take castor oil, do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most black voters will side with the Democrats,
predicted Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP. Bond made the point
that elections are choices, and ``the choice isn't between the
perfect and the terrible, but between really good and awful. That's
an easy choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was striking that President Clinton reminded his
convention audience Monday night that Lieberman, then a college
student, had journeyed south in 1964 to register blacks to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman went to Mississippi, where that same year members of
the Ku Klux Klan brutally murdered Andrew Goodman, Michael
Schwerner and James Cheney, two northern Jews and a southern
African-American, for their work on behalf of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bond noted that Lieberman received a 100 percent rating from the
NAACP last year. And Lewis said he went at Lieberman's invitation
to the Connecticut Democratic convention last month at which
Lieberman was nominated for a third time as the Democratic Senate
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the issues of values, hard work, dignity of work, he tends
to touch a responsive chord within the African-American
community,'' Lewis said. ``He's not a perfect man, but it's a good
match and the African-American community is going to go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, who studies voting trends among African-Americans
for a Washington, DC think tank, said Lieberman's past statements
will not be damaging because as vice president, he will be forced
to follow the president's wishes. ``What Joe Lieberman's position
is, is pretty irrelevant,'' Bositis said.

WHERE AGE 40 DOESN'T MEAN THE END OF EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada, the Netherlands)   (For release Sunday, August 20)   By HARRIS GREEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, Americans have become more accepting of older
dancers. Whether this attitude is a result of aging baby-boomers or
has been imposed by political correctness, it is expanding the
concept of dancing. The United States now has several organizations
that present performances by older dancers, Dancers Over 40 _ the
traditional retirement age _ and the 40Up Project among them, or
mingle the generations onstage, as does Liz Lerman's Dance
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Canadian documentary ``Can't Stop Now,'' which Channel
13 will broadcast on ``Great Performances'' on Wednesday night at
8:30, reports on how the Netherlands Dance Theater has extended the
careers of dancers by creating NDT3, a company that commissions
works specifically for those over 40. No other troupe offers such
opportunities. Of course, classical dancers gifted in mime have
continued onstage for decades as Drosselmeyer or Dr. Coppelius or
Giselle's mother, but most companies have not sought new roles for
them to perform.
</P>
<P>
   NDT3 was spun off in 1991 by the main company's artistic
director, Jiri Kylian (now its principal choreographer), at the
urging of his wife, the dancer Sabine Kupferberg, and the veteran
NDT member Gerard Lemaitre, the oldest of the troupe at 62. (NDT2
is an experimental company for dancers from 17 to 22.) Despite its
size _ it has never consisted of more than a handful of dancers _
and considerable turnover, NDT3 has drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   The writer and director Eileen Thalenberg has built ``Can't Stop
Now'' around the arrival in The Hague of Karen Kain, a former
principal of the National Ballet of Canada, to replace Martine van
Hamel, a ballerina from American Ballet Theater who had moved on to
NDT3. The sequence in which Kain learns Kylian's snaky pas de deux
``No Sleep Till Dawn of Day,'' set to a Solomon Islands lullaby, is
a triumph for all concerned, including the film editor, Michele
Hozer. (The cameraman, Neville Ottey, however, sometimes cuts off
feet later in the film.)
</P>
<P>
   Although she dwells on Kain's unease about this transition,
Thalenberg avoids any chauvinistic, local-girl-makes-good approach
by giving equal time to van Hamel's thoughts about turning 50.
``Dancing with NDT3 has given me lightness in a way,'' van Hamel
says. ``I can't, still can't, imagine really having a life without
dancing.'' Such expressions of loss by NDT3 members are a constant
throughout this moving film.
</P>
<P>
   What also comes across is how often the choreographers fall back
on gimmickry, hyperactivity and calculated cuteness, and how they
talk better dances than they deliver. Patrick Delcroix, for
example, deplores the practice of giving older dancers something
``dramatic'' just so they can move slowly; he wants ``to do
something happy and have some fun.'' Delcroix may have had a ball
creating ``Grain de Folie,'' but for anyone familiar with the heady
high jinks of Jerome Robbins (``The Concert,'' say, or the
percussion section of ``Fanfare'') or the balletic romps of Charlie
Chaplin, the mugging, flailing and shimmying he foists on his
dancers seem rather desperate.
</P>
<P>
   In this film, Kylian is particularly articulate, but his works
for NDT3 can be disconcerting. Last summer, when all three
Netherlands Dance Theater companies appeared in the Lincoln Center
Festival, his eclectic recent works suggested that his artistic
goal had changed; instead of matching movement to rarely used
composers like Janacek and Haydn, he was trying to match his fellow
European choreographers in the exploitation of oversize props,
disco-style seizures, cacophonous amplification or intermittent
chaos. It was not surprising that in ``A Way a Lone,'' one of the
first works he made for NDT3, he fell back on the familiar
distraction of having dancers compete with projected images, in
this case of themselves viewed from above. He had no idea, he tells
Thalenberg, how different a dancer would look from that angle.
Given that sensibility, it shouldn't come as a surprise when we see
the men as well as the women in one section of Kylian's
``Arcimboldo'' don misshapen black tutus that look like wind-sprung
umbrellas and slip in and out of these encumbrances to selections
from Bach's noble suites for unaccompanied cello, waggling their
tongues on the trills. NDT3 costumes are generally striking _ watch
for the dancing jellyfish _ but some viewers may sense that using
such outre garb indicates an attempt to bolster a performance the
dancers can't quite give.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian puts Bach to better use when the ``Goldberg Variations''
accompany Kupferberg, Lemaitre and the ever-striking Gary Chryst as
they employ sign language to ``speak'' their own haikulike eulogies
of departed friends _ effective and touching, but also reminiscent
of the way in which some choreographers, notably Bill T. Jones,
rely on something beyond mere movement (like, say, death) for extra
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to use sign language was Kylian's, but he can't claim
the result, for neither the words nor the gestures are his
creation. What this documentary reports most forcefully is that
gifted older dancers with presence and command of gesture can have
extended careers once choreographers meet them on an equally high
level of dedication. &QL;

CAMBRIDGE TECHNOLOGY, RIVAL START-UP SETTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. has settled a lawsuit over a
former executive's launch of a rival start-up in Florida, company
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Semtor Inc. has promised not to hire
any more employees from Cambridge Technology, which has struggled
with recent losses, a slumping stock price, and a flood of
departures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to focus on our business, which is not in the legal
field,'' said Semtor chief executive Harold Gubnitsky, a former
Cambridge Technology vice president who left the company in late
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gubnitsky and Cambridge Technology officials declined to provide
further details of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in January, Semtor has a staff of 85 that includes about
10 employees who once worked for Cambridge Technology. The Fort
Lauderdale firm, also a technology consultant, recently opened
offices in Burlington, Mass., where it plans to employ 30 people by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Cambridge Technology began to strike back at
Gubnitsky and several other former executives. It accused them of
violating nonsolicitation agreements by hiring away valuable
technology employees to feed their own start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   In a testier battle, Cambridge Technology filed suit in April
against its former chief executive, James K. Sims. The suit also
named his new Boston company, Gen3 Partners Inc., and Arthur M.
Toscanini, a former Cambridge Technology chief financial officer
who now works for Sims.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Sims and Toscanini countersued.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side has shown signs of backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cambridge Technology asked a judge to bar Gen3
Partners from ``raiding on Cambridge employees,'' said Hal Thayer,
a Cambridge Technology spokesman. The judge held a hearing on Aug.
8 but has not ruled on the motion.

IN HIS HOMELAND, FILMING WAR IS A BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill.)  (For release Sunday, August 20)  
 By JOAN DUPONT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAVICA, Macedonia _ Hemmed in by Kosovo to the north, Greece to
the south, Albania to the west and Bulgaria to the east, and
lacking any outlet to the sea, Macedonia swelters in the sun, a
dust basin. It is late July, a few miles from the Greek border;
nothing moves; tobacco crops wilt in the fields. Behind a Byzantine
church, men, their shirts caked in blood, are strewn on the bald
mountainside. Shots ring out. Orders are shouted in English,
Italian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian. Milcho Manchevski, the
Macedonian director of the acclaimed, Oscar-nominated 1994 film
``Before the Rain,'' is at it again, putting the tortured history
of his homeland on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A country of two million, Macedonia is notorious for its bloody
war of liberation from the Ottoman Turks in 1912 and remembered for
a devastating earthquake in 1963. It is not known for filmmaking.
But prowling the set wearing red running shorts and headgear fit
for a desert field commander, Manchevski is marshaling his
multinational cast and crew of 200 for the final push on his second
film, ``Dust,'' which he hopes to have ready in time for next
spring's Cannes International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing the western film genre and Balkan history, ``Dust'' tells
the story of two brothers at war over gold and a woman in
turn-of-the-century Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But like ``Before the Rain,'' which traveled between London and
Macedonia in an elegantly circular plot, ``Dust'' plays subtle
games with time and geography. The brothers, portrayed by Joseph
Fiennes (the Shakespeare of ``Shakespeare in Love'') and the
Australian actor David Wenham, find echoes of their personal war in
the Balkan violence of 1912-13. ``I call it an Ottoman eastern,''
Manchevski says.
</P>
<P>
   The story opens in contemporary New York with an encounter
between an elderly woman (Rosemary Murphy) and a robber (Adrien
Lester), whose stories merge with the saga of the brothers: In the
West at the start of the century, Elijah (Fiennes) and Luke
(Wenham) fall in love with Lilith, a woman from the brothels played
by the French actress Anne Brochet (``Tous les Matins du Monde'').
The three resurface in war-torn Macedonia, where, as one character
says, ``centuries don't follow each other; they coexist;'' and
Elijah and Luke must fight it out with the Turks, interfering
neighbors and assorted bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Before the Rain,'' ``Dust'' has a dense script, mapped
with conflict and carnage. But, says Manchevski, ``We're not
showing the worst of what went on during the Balkan wars _ violence
that continues even now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wenham, whose Luke wins and loses everything _ the girl, the
gold _ was struck by Manchevski's pursuit of historic truth. ``One
night, I was home in Sydney and about 3 a.m. this fax came in,'' he
says. ``He was sending me a reading list of books on the Balkans _
97 books.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the short list,'' Manchevski says with a laugh. ``Here
in Macedonia we have an obsession with history. My obsession was to
make this movie; now I'm less obsessed because I'm making it.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-production among Britain, Italy and Germany, with some
financing from Macedonia, ``Dust'' started out more than five years
ago as a project of Robert Redford's Southfork Pictures. But a
distribution deal never materialized, and Manchevski called his
travails with ``Dust'' ``crime and punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We built the film,'' he recalls, ``piece by piece, got people
interested, and then it collapsed. At the heart of the issue,
Americans were scared of the script. I don't see this script as
challenging _ maybe a little more adventurous than most. But it's
not `Last Year at Marienbad.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Manchevski's narrative style is not quite as oblique as that
famously mysterious movie by Alain Resnais, he does admit to a
certain desire to surprise the audience. ``I want the viewer to
feel as people felt when they first saw a Cubist painting,'' he
says. ``I want them to put the puzzle together. Filmmaking is
story-telling, but compared to the novel, movies are still stuck in
the early 19th century. We haven't made it to James Joyce yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While Manchevski's unorthodox storytelling style may have scared
potential investors, it had the opposite effect on Fiennes. ``I
committed to `Dust' early,'' he says, ``because of the quality of
the director _ Milcho breaks formats _ and the incredible script. I
love the theme of dust; we all end up as dust.''
</P>
<P>
   With a schedule that took cast and crew from funky Manhattan to
dusty Macedonia, it's been a tough 70-day shoot. Now, with the heat
wave, there have been frayed nerves and collapse from sunstroke.
The crew works 13-hour days, 6 days a week; in 100-degree heat,
they down water and munch watermelon _ and suffer stings from bees
attracted by the fruit. This particular day's shoot, of a battle
scene, ``is one of our easy locations,'' Manchevski says with a
grin. On some days, he points out, ``We've had to helicopter people
onto mountain tops.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiry and intense, Manchevski comes by his toughness naturally.
He was born in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, 40 years ago. ``I
was a real urban kid with a Mohawk haircut,'' he says. ``My mother
died when I was 7, my father when I was almost 14. Things happen in
my life every seven years. By 18, I wanted to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised on comics and American movies _ ``the best period,
Coppola, Scorsese, Milos Forman'' _ he recalls having seen
Kurosawa's ``Rashomon'' on television. ``My father said: `Check out
this film. You'll appreciate it when you're older. It's art.'
There's a tracking shot of a woodcutter's axe, and I thought, `This
is boring.' I still feel the same thing with art films. They're a
little boring, but you take home much more. It's interesting that
we bring up `Rashomon' here, because `Dust' is made to reflect the
way each character tells his story, his truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Manchevski won a scholarship to the University of
Southern Illinois Film School in Carbondale. ``The move was
devastating,'' he says. ``The sky was so big in Illinois; I
couldn't understand people; they couldn't understand me. I was
homesick.''
</P>
<P>
   Once back home, he had trouble reintegrating: ``There was lots
of back stabbing. I moved to America, and if I make films that move
between different locations, it may be because in a nice way I have
a split personality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States he took jobs as a house painter and a court
interpreter, worked on industrial videos and made a name as a still
photographer. He got his break in music videos. ``Arrested
Development,'' which he made with the rap group of the same name,
was a hit. ``The climax included a photo of a lynching in the
South,'' he says. ``For me, violence is like a particular note of
music. I deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has spent half his life in America, and he speaks and
writes an original, hyper-real New Yorkese. ``They kicked me out,''
he says, alluding to his early attempts at directing here in his
homeland. But these days he is a local hero who splits his time
between Skopje and New York.
</P>
<P>
   With the striking success of ``Before the Rain,'' which won the
Gold Lion for best film at the Venice Film Festival in 1994, he had
every reason to believe making a second film would be a breeze. But
with the problems getting it off the ground, and its multiple
locations (in addition to the exteriors in New York and Macedonia,
interiors were to be shot in Germany), ``Dust'' has proved to be a
hard slog. Even today, as he fiddles with the dials on his video
assist monitor, which has stuttered to a stop, he chants, ``Shake
it up, baby.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the scene he has been shooting comes into focus. ``This
is high-precision work,'' he says. ``You have to coordinate what
goes on at every level, otherwise the complexity doesn't
register.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexity registers. Above the bloodied ``corpses'' and
crimson Ottoman flags, backed against a cliff, a woman is giving
birth; between the rocks, a mercenary shoots his way out.
</P>
<P>
   The woman is the Macedonian actress Nikolina Kujaca (``Welcome
to Sarajevo''); the mercenary is Wenham, whose Colt pistol has just
come unhinged in his hand. The filming comes to an abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   Manchevski yells out to the producer, Chris Auty: ``Houston, we
have a problem. This gun has to be repaired!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Milcho wanted antique guns and they're fragile,'' Auty says.
``He's decided I'm the one to solve these problems. It's his way of
saying we don't have enough money. A $12 million budget may seem
small by U.S. standards, but it's the biggest in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Auty started preproduction on ``Dust'' in the spring of last
year. ``Then, the Kosovo crisis broke out across the border, and no
insurance company would cover us, so we came to a standstill.
Milcho said, `You've betrayed me,' which is something he says
often,'' Auty says, sighing. ``Everybody knows Milcho is difficult.
He's sophisticated, literate; he has a fantastic eye and a gift for
communicating his vision, but he believes in fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchevski's collaborators seem willing to make allowances,
however. ``Milcho is under pressure to finish, and people are
working slower due to exhaustion,'' the production designer, David
Munns, says. ``He does have a reputation for being difficult, and I
don't think he is; but why shouldn't he be? You have to go a little
bit further to make something special happen, and that's Milcho: he
takes things a little bit further.''
</P>
<P>
   To Brochet, he is the embodiment of his two main characters,
Elijah and Luke. ``He is a man at war,'' she says. ``That's what
gives him his vitality.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Manchevski, he concedes that making ``Dust'' had had some
of the elements of a war. ``But,'' he adds, ``actually, being on
this set is much quieter than living in New York.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The giant sucking sound is Democrats using their
convention week to vacuum every possible dollar out of every
available soft-touch movie star and entertainment executive. If
you're down from Silicon Valley and still believe that Al Gore
invented the Internet, well, you're welcome to give, too. Trial
lawyers, lobbyists, special pleaders of all stripes, dig deep.
Leave your check and business card at the door (so they can try to
remember you later). Grab a drink and a sliver of pizza from Spago
and fall into the warm embrace of a party desperate to keep the
White House and recover their lost homestead on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   One big L.A. activist complained that the party fund-raising
committees and individual campaigns were flogging her pocketbook so
hard that her fax machine kept running out of paper from the glut
of ``invitations.''
</P>
<P>
   And none of the gigs, she said, was under $1,000. No chump
change this week. Some soirees anticipate total personal donations
of five and six figures. A handful of individuals, unions and
corporations are headed toward a million in this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Republicans did the same thing with the rest of
corporate America in Philadelphia two weeks ago (as well as with
some of the crowd that's being hit up by the Democrats). The
Republicans just weren't giant hypocrites about it. The Democrats
are serving it up with an Olympian level of sanctimony.
</P>
<P>
   While rifling your pockets they earnestly preach
campaign-finance reform and, misty eyed, say they can't
unilaterally disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, what goes on here is &QL; 
obscene,'' Democratic National Committee Chairman Ed Rendell
conceded. ``What went on in Philadelphia is obscene. The process is
broken. One party wants to end it. The other one doesn't. You have
an obligation to make that absolutely clear to the people of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you reaching for your airsick bag? What also needs to be
made clear is that this is the same crowd who, with Gore in the
lead, scammed a Buddhist temple four years ago and then lied about
it. And remember there's ``no controlling legal authority'' that
says otherwise. I guess not, when your attorney general plays
deaf-mute.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's only happenstance, but hardly any of the Democratic
shindigs seem to be scheduled for east of Interstate 5, which might
be a little too close for comfort to the Hsi Lai Temple in suburban
Hacienda Heights. One senior California Democratic wag said the
state party had tried to get the center quarantined as
``radioactive.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats can claim to be so hot for campaign finance reform
because they know that Republicans, always more up front about
money being the mother's milk of politics, will openly block it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unbridled shakedowns this week, the Democrats want
to show they're still a concerned lot. They insisted on vetting the
venues. And the party hierarchy about had a cow when Rep. Loretta
Sanchez, D-Calif., scheduled a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.
Only when she relented, and moved the event to the
ever-more-tasteful B.B. King's Blues Club, did they offer to
restore her speaking spot in the convention line-up. She declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' penchant for prudery seems a bit sudden (not to
mention phony) when viewed through the prism of short-term history.
Over the last decade, the Los Angeles Times found on examining
campaign-finance records, the Democratic National Committee and the
party's principal congressional campaign committees have accepted
$50,000 from Playboy founder Hugh Hefner and his daughter Christie.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, Hef's contributions to Clinton-Gore
campaigns totaled $9,500, with $1,500 going to Gore's campaign just
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest complainers about Sanchez's proposed Playboy
party was Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But, according to the
L.A. Times, Kennedy had not been so offended earlier this year when
he went to Christie Hefner's house in Chicago and spoke at a
fund-raising reception for a Democratic House candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And little or nothing was made of a late-night party Tuesday for
Democratic high-rollers in the hipper-than-thou Sky Bar of the
Mondrian Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. This is the establishment that
last week agreed to pay $1.08 million to minority bellmen who were
fired for looking ``too ethnic'' so they could be replaced with
``cool-looking'' white boys.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the plaintiffs would like to donate some of the settlement
to the oh-so-caring Democrats. Leave your fax number.

A PIANIST WHO MEETS, AND REFINES, MESSIAEN'S CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release on Sunday, Aug. 20)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is very much Messiaen's year _ as most years now tend to
be. First, there was the Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of
three scenes from ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' followed quickly by
the Lincoln Center Festival's offering of four big Messiaen pieces
in quick succession. And now comes a thoroughly spectacular
recording of his greatest solo piano work, the ``Vingt Regards sur
l'Enfant-Jesus,'' played by Pierre-Laurent Aimard (Teldec).
</P>
<P>
   As Aimard points out in an interesting note _ more interesting
than the proper program note _ ``this vast fresco brings together
everything that made up the composer's world at that time: his
spiritual, cultural, musical and technical world.'' These ``Twenty
Gazes on the Child Jesus'' are religious illustrations, but made by
an artist for whom religious subjects did not imply a limitation.
Messiaen saw no reason why everything he could musically imagine
could not be brought into his scenes of veneration and praise:
crashing dissonances as well as the sweetest harmony, hectic dances
as well as gentle meditations, and a huge range of sounds, some of
them weird, some bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is magnificently present in Aimard's playing.
Indeed, there is more of it than he knows. Aimard, like the
composer, declares that the one thing omitted from the ``Vingt
Regards'' is human love _ despite the fact that his own
performance, time and again, reveals that the work is an immense
love song. It is the ``Turangalila Symphony'' of the piano, with
joyous movements of love music, bounding or still, punctuated by
sequences that are more abstract or bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   With Messiaen's music it is not possible to separate sacred and
secular love. Composed in 1944, ``Vingt Regards'' was one of the
first works he wrote after meeting the pianist Yvonne Loriod _
later his wife, who performed and recorded the work _ and the music
is as much a personal as a professional paean. It is furiously
virtuosic, conceived for a musician whose hands could skid and slam
and tremble to produce an enormous variety of colors. But it is
also, on the composer's part, like the mating display of a colossal
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Aimard meets the full measure of its vigor and its brilliance _
though it is not easy to know what is most impressive here: the
vividness of so many different piano sounds or the exemplary
directness with which they are executed.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen wrote large. The new piano vocabulary he was building
up in this work was also an old one, drawn from the most
exhibitionist music of Liszt and his successors, such as Ravel and
Albeniz. But the self-projecting rhetoric of the virtuoso is
eliminated. This is not the music of a pianist addressing an
audience, but that of a composer addressing God _ and addressing,
too, as a fellow child of God, the woman he imagined at the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   An odd kind of self-effacement is therefore required from the
performer _ and splendidly supplied by Aimard. In the most
demanding pieces, such as ``Par Lui Tout a Ete Fait'' (``By Him Was
Everything Made''), he brings on a formidable repertory of big
effects. He greets the arrival of the ``theme of God'' at the main
climax with thunder and lightning, tearing down into the bass with
force, then throwing off quick, luminous festoons in the upper
treble, then doing both at once.
</P>
<P>
   This is superb, even awe-inspiring, and all the more so because
Aimard puts us in the presence of the music, not of himself. It is
not that he performs objectively. Where a lot of French Messiaen
playing is thin and mechanical, however glittering, Aimard is
strong and imbues the music with strength. There is a person here.
But that person is not asking for applause.
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm and accentuation are crucial. Aimard does not curve and
shape the music so that it fits his hands to show off his skill.
Rather, he fits his hands to the music, even if this means going a
little against what comes naturally. There are points in ``Par
Lui'' that sound awkward and alien. But they sound as if they have
to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   Also impressive in this movement is the way Aimard subtly alters
color, balance and phrasing as he rotates through a figure again
and again, so that there is nothing automatic in the repetition.
These small but telling changes seem like signs of a motive force
driving the repetition.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the two-hour cycle there is no relaxation of musical
thinking and acting. Where there is mercurial birdsong figuration,
Aimard treats it not just as decorative but finds in it real
musical sense. Where the music is slow and long, it is still
active, as if in demonstration of the line from the Song of Songs
that Messiaen took as the title for one of these pieces: ``I Sleep
but my Heart Waketh.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimard's wakefulness in another of the big slow movements, ``Le
Baiser de l'Enfant-Jesus'' (``Child Jesus' Kiss''), has
extraordinary results. Messiaen's daring recipe for intimacy here
was to withdraw into the world of the lounge pianist, with song
phrases, soupy harmonies and arpeggios at every opportunity. Often
the movement sounds just vulgar, and one has to accept its
vulgarity as part of Messiaen's sublime frankness.
</P>
<P>
   Not on this recording, though. Aimard shows that the music
transcends its sources. It is calm. It is graceful. It breathes
freely. Again, the effect comes partly from not jumping to
immediate conclusions about style and treatment but, instead,
finding what is particular in the detail. Aimard's approach also
brings him the means to build toward a fearsome culmination in this
movement, where the music becomes hard as nails. Jesus' kiss is not
soppy: it stings.
</P>
<P>
   Aimard is a musician who takes his time. His solo recordings are
few; this is his first since his wonderful contributions to Sony's
Ligeti series. And in this case he has been working on the music
for more than three decades, since he learned it as a pupil of
Loriod. The wait was worthwhile.

GENOME PURSUER TURNS ATTENTION TO HUMAN PROTEINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After your company has decoded the human genome, what
do you do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   J. Craig Venter, founder and chief scientific officer for Celera
Genomics Group, said Tuesday he's turning his attention to
identifying proteins in human cells. But he expressed concern that
current computer technology may simply be too slow.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the Drug Discovery Technology 2000 conference at
Boston's World Trade Center Tuesday, Venter said proteomics _
identifying networks of cell protein _ will require faster
commercially available computers that simply don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to sequence 1 million proteins a day,'' said
Venter, whose Celera Genomics, a unit of PE Corp., is based in
Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But achieving that result soon won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers today are way too slow,'' Venter said. He said
Celera's requirements have ``moved past what is available'' to
process its analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Venter joined Francis Collins, head of the
government-funded Human Genome Project, to jointly announce the
first assembly of the human genome _ the location and order of the
3.12 billion letters of genetic code. With about 85 percent of the
``map'' completed and expectations for a more complete publication
by year's end, the biggest challenge is determining how many genes
there are and discovering what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's concern for computer hardware speed stems from an
improvement in Celera's ability to identify genetic code. The
company recently identified 1.15 billion letters of code of mouse
DNA in less than two months. By contrast, Celera's first draft of
the human genome, begun last September, took almost 10 months to
reveal 3.12 billion letters of code.
</P>
<P>
   Venter wants faster computational results. Over the next 10 to
50 years, researchers at biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies
will seek to turn the scientific treasures of the human genome into
medical advances and commercial profits. Those efforts require
looking beyond genes to identifying and understanding networks of
proteins and how they can be turned into drugs or become targets
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But identifying all of the proteins emanating from a cell is a
far more complex task than mapping the genome. Proteins within a
single person can change from moment to moment. Some are produced
in high concentrations while others are rarer and found in only
small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said this complexity requires computer and robotics
technology far more sophisticated than the banks of supercomputers
Celera has used to parse the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, academic researchers can identify hundreds of
proteins a week; Celera wants to dramatically speed up the
sequencing of proteins to gain a better understanding of the
interrelated cellular pathways that can lead to disease.

DEMOCRATIC CONFAB MORE LIKE AN MTV VIDEO SHOOT THAN POLITICAL
CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Republicans didn't throw a convention. They
threw a four-day crash course in diversity training.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats aren't throwing a convention either.
</P>
<P>
   They're throwing an MTV video shoot.
</P>
<P>
   We're only the extras. The stars of this show aren't Al Gore and
Hillary Clinton. They're Barbra Streisand and Cher and Melissa
Etheridge.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed like part of the script Monday night when the
street outside the convention compound erupted into a mob shoving
match _ not long after a concert by the political rock band Rage
Against the Machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built this city, and we can tear it down!'' shouted lead
singer Zack de la Rocha. Rage's current hit album is ``The Battle
of Los Angeles.'' On the antiestablishment band's corporate World
Wide Web site, the concert was called an event ``for all the people
who feel left out'' of an election between ``two weak candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the band works for the very establishment corporate
machine at Sony Music Entertainment Inc.
</P>
<P>
   About the time rubber bullets and tear-gas cartridges were
flying outside, President Clinton was making his entrance inside. A
camera followed him as he strode dramatically down a long hallway
to the arena, cheers building with every step.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee co-chair Patricia Harrison rolled
her eyes. ``It reminded me of World Championship Wrestling,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no use trying to separate politics from showbiz here. In
LA, its all showbiz.
</P>
<P>
   Karenna Schiff Gore and Kristen Gore, the oldest daughters of
presidential nominee Al Gore, campaigned in Burbank as guests on
``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.'' They wound up as comedy foils,
swapping wisecracks with fellow guest Jon Stewart of Comedy
Central's ``The Daily Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The longest line in Hollywood might be the line to see
``Politically Incorrect.'' On Monday, host Bill Maher joked that
Clinton's speech was like the president himself _ ``very
touching.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher was in the crowd for a press party Saturday night at the
six-acre mansion of ``Playboy'' magazine publisher Hugh Hefner.
CBS' Bryant Gumbel and Fox's Bill O'Reilly also lurked among the
Bunnies, all beneath red-white-and-blue bunting labeling the party
``A ``Playboy'' Salute to America 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the political newspaper ``National Journal'' devoted
Page 3 of its special daily convention edition to ``The Hunt for
Hollywood Celebrities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody goes out hunting for Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   They're out to see Madonna. Or Jennifer and Brad. And where's
Shaq?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of shallow, did anyone catch ``CNN Larry King Live''
Monday night? After former candidate Bill Bradley, King interviewed
that sage political commentator, Cher.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire, she called the Democrats ``the party of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a woman, a minority, a working person, gay,
anything that doesn't fit in with the Republican white, rich-guy
stereotype, then you cannot do anything but vote Democrat this
year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Texas of Republican nominee George W. Bush, she said,
``more women are starving'' than in any other state. ``More
children are going to bed hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   King nodded and smiled. ``Thank you, Cher,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back with more of our interview with Hillary Clinton. Don't go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll be back in a moment with more real politics.
</P>
<P>
   After this message from the Democratic convention.

CLINTON PASSES THE TORCH &HT;    By MARIANNE MEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the Democrats opened their convention,
President Clinton demonstrated he is no mere crippled water fowl as
he galvanized the delegates into repeated rafter-rattling roars
that told the world he still owns the hearts of the party faithful,
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded convention in the Staples Center here launched the
president Monday on the road to retirement on a wave of such
partisan pride and affection that it seemed certain the delegates
would have gladly renominated him if he hadn't been barred by the
Constitution from seeking a third term. Take that, narrow-minded
House impeachment goons!
</P>
<P>
   All that advice to Clinton about not stealing the show from his
protege and successor, Vice President Al Gore, was wasted. The
president did it simply by opening his mouth and uttering the
joyous words of partisan battle. He does love a good scrap, this
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said all the right things about Gore, but the delegates
were interested only in thanking the leader they already knew. Gore
they will take, but this was not Gore's night. The cheers rose and
the placards waved for Bill and for Hillary too. The decibel level
of the noise prompted by punch lines on behalf of Gore registered
decidedly lower.
</P>
<P>
   The president clearly reveled in the affectionate outpouring
that marked his dignified transfer of power to Gore. With a long
recitation of legislative and executive achievements, he demolished
the silly Republican charge that he had been ``coasting'' for two
terms and had nothing to do with today's economic prosperity. He
milked his audience for every dramatic moment, and there were many.
It was one of his best performances.
</P>
<P>
   He is like the little girl with a curl in the middle of her
forehead in the nursery rhyme: ``When she was good, she was very,
very good. When she was bad, she was horrid.'' And this time he was
very, very good.
</P>
<P>
   He was also unstinting in his praise for Gore and his desire
that Gore replace him in the White House. But will the Democrats
transfer their love and loyalty to the cerebral Gore once the
Personality Kid has left the podium? That will be mostly up to
Gore, although not entirely. His own speech on Thursday will be a
key test, bound to be compared with Clinton's masterful
performance.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible for Gore to elbow past the overpowering
presence of Bill Clinton before the nomination formally transfers
the mantle of party leadership Thursday. And it won't be easy even
now, as the excited eruptions from fans during Clinton's farewell
speech demonstrated. Many Democrats here are plenty nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be around making speeches and policy in Washington,
supplemented by high-visibility trips abroad, for the rest of the
campaign. He is itching to finish his political wrestling match
with the Republican-controlled Congress. He is going out slowly on
a high, with his party's enthusiastic gratitude ringing in his
ears. Leaving center stage is difficult for a man whose whole adult
life has been one long campaign to gain office or hold onto one.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Republican efforts to make the memory of Monica Lewinsky
the only thing about his administration voters will remember in
November, Clinton, at this convention, is much admired for his
endurance and good will in the face of adversity. And while his
morals are deplored, his job approval ratings remain remarkably
high for a president in the waning days of power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got another Monica mea culpa out of the way a few days
before the convention, when it attracted attention but did not
distract from the upbeat message he delivered to his party on
Monday. He said he was ``trying to totally rebuild my life from a
terrible mistake I made ... You just have to hope you're getting
better every day.'' He has previously apologized for his affair
several times, but never acknowledged that his statements under
oath in the Paula Jones lawsuit were deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   And he did what he could to spare Gore the fallout from his
behavior, although some polls indicate it may be impossible to
successfully immunize his protege no matter what he does. Clinton
urged voters not to fault Gore for failings that were his alone. At
least here in Los Angeles that is all that will be said on the
subject. The convention is scripted to stick to serious policy
issues and not detour into the vague moralizing of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton once again sent the message that she has
forgiven her husband, introducing his speech by talking about what
``we'' have done over the last eight years to produce ``the most
peaceful, prosperous, promising time in our nation's history'' She
dutifully promoted the virtues of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joseph Lieberman. But she also made a pitch for her own race for a
New York Senate seat, which prompted great whoops from the audience
and the frantic waving of masses of blue placards crying
``Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   The president too gave her a campaign plug, calling her ``a
great first lady'' who had an abiding passion to help children and
who would always be there for families in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given her prominence here, no wonder poor Rep. Rick Lazio, her
GOP opponent, refused to take the brief, obscure speaking slot he
was offered at the Republican National Convention. The dramatic
contrast between her stature and his in their respective parties is
telling.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Clintons have been a formidable team. They were
mocked when they announced in 1992 that if Bill were elected, the
country would get two workers instead of one. But it has actually
turned out that way. If New Yorkers agree, Bill Clinton will be
history, but she will go on to bug conservatives some more in a new
role. Hooray.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It has been obvious from the beginning. And it's
obvious at the end.
</P>
<P>
   From the first moment he entered politics, right up to when he
made his last Democratic National Convention speech Monday night,
there has been no doubt:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton never _ not ever _ knows when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was appropriate, but also ironic the president's
nearly last words to the convention here were: ``Don't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stop,'' he cried to roars of applause, as he harked back
to the campaign theme he and running mate Al Gore used in their
1992 campaign and beseeched all the delegates, alternates,
volunteer staffers and guests jammed into the convention hall:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt about it, that was a swell _ if fairly subtle _
way to end his evening's plea for America to continue his
administration by electing his vice president to succeed him in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, it was a long, long time in coming.
</P>
<P>
   For a fellow who never knows when to stop, Bill Clinton can _
and quite often does _ do a hell of a beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the opening to his speech at what is supposed to be
Al Gore's convention was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it was his wife, the Democratic Senate candidate in
New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who introduced him to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense. Except for some awfully nice words about her husband _
and to her credit, Gore and his choice of a running mate, Joe
Lieberman _ Hillary Clinton didn't introduce Bill Clinton to the
convention. Harry Thomason, a television producer and maker of
whiz-bang movies about his friend Bill, introduced him.
</P>
<P>
   This year's film, something of a sequel to the terrific 1992
filmed convention-introduction to the Man from Hope, was boffo.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was it splendid theater, Clinton's broadcast walk down
a long, incredibly long, bare corridor was dynamite theater _
theater so dynamite the crowd grew increasingly wild and, fairly,
can be said to have been emotionally amok by the time the prez
emerged onto the platform.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he started to talk.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked and he talked and, then, he talked some more.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, his beginning was great. He had the crowd _ most of
whom had been issued signs saying ``Thank you, Mr. President'' _ in
the proverbial palm of his presidential hand.
</P>
<P>
   Although his whole speech was only 41 minutes _ an awfully short
time for Clinton, actually _ it seemed as though he talked for
hours about what he views as his accomplishments of the last nearly
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of (BEGIN ITALIC) his (END ITALIC) ideas and values and
plans for the future when he and Gore assumed office.
</P>
<P>
   Bless Al Gore's heart, the emphasis on almost the entire Clinton
speech was on what Clinton has accomplished, including, not
incidentally, his selection of Gore to be his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gave me the chance to turn those ideas and values into
action after I made one of the best decisions of my entire life,
asking Al Gore to be my partner,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Even the convention crowd, which was totally enthralled with
Clinton, began to flag in their shouted approval of him and his
accomplishments as the prez droned on and on about them.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he gave a signal _ false as it turned out _ that he
might be going to wind down, did his audience revive, for a moment,
its fervor.
</P>
<P>
   But, when he hit his true praise of Gore and his choice of a
running mate, Lieberman, Clinton roused the audience once again and
they stuck on fever pitch to the end.
</P>
<P>
   And, so, Bill Clinton left the convention that is supposed to be
Al Gore's, urging the American people to ``choose wisely'' when
thinking of their future, but, also, telling them to ``remember,
whenever you think about me, keep putting people first. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this convention was to be a passing of the torch _ the
political torch _ from Clinton to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If it happened _ and it isn't, by any means, certain it did _
Clinton certainly didn't stop soon enough to clearly, unequivocally
pass the torch to the man he wants elected to preserve his own
political legacy. &QL;

 &HT;    CONVENTION NOTEBOOK: OF CONVENTION BUTTONS AND BOTTLE CAPS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A hot-selling button on the streets around the
downtown Staples Center where Democrats are holding their
convention: ``Read My Lips: No New Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The concession stands inside the Staples Center remove the tops
from bottled water they sell to delegates and members of the press.
Why? Vendors say those are the rules. Seems there was a problem in
the past with rowdy basketball fans throwing the bottle tops at
players _ a practice that surely must have ended when the Los
Angeles Lakers, who play at Staples Center, won the NBA
championship. Reminded that conventioneers are not grumpy
basketball fans, vendors were unmoved. Rules are rules, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish shuttle buses threw Georgia Democrats' carefully
crafted convention schedules out the window early this week. As
much as a two-hour ride to cover the roughly 12 miles from the
convention site to their hotel kept many delegates from attending a
salute to Gov. Roy Barnes at a fashionable LA restaurant late
Monday. And some delegates waited as long as three hours for a
shuttle to get to the opening day
</P>
<P>
   ceremonies at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped on a stationary bus teeming with impatient but
good-humored delegates Monday night, Georgia Labor Commissioner
Michael Thurmond resorted to a bit of trickery to try to get the
shuttle underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pregnant woman on the bus,'' Thurmond joked,
gesturing randomly at any female seated. ``She needs to get to the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus finally moved, but not always in the right direction.
Delegates eventually disembarked and walked several blocks to get
to their lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between Democrats and Republicans?
Georgia's Gov. Barnes told the Florida delegation that Democrats
are constantly re-examining long-held beliefs and changing them
when
</P>
<P>
   necessary. On the other side, Barnes said, ``Republicans are
nothing but lemon-sucking sour folks who won't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the Staples Center _ through the slanted
view of the opposition _ Republican leaders are ready with their
early reviews of the Democratic National Convention. So far, they
don't like it. And they are very, very concerned about the
negative, destructive tone they perceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just 11 minutes into the convention a speaker by the name of
Miller of Maryland was already launching into a tirade against
Republicans and against Governor Bush,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla of
San Antonio, a co-chair of the recent GOP convention. ``And that's
the kind of thing America is tired of listening to.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``tirade'' Bonilla referred to was offered by Maryland state
Sen. Mike Miller, head of the Democratic Legislative Campaign
Committee and one of the first speakers on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The tirade: ``Will we have Democratic policies that save our
water, our air, our health and our children _ or laissez-faire,
let-industry-set-their-own pollution standards, like those down in
Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, a co-chairman of the GOP's Victory
2000 operation, made fun of Tuesday's convention theme, which was
``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about right,'' said Gilmore. ``We couldn't have said it
any better than that. We ain't seen nothing yet over the last eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's morning-after response is part of an effort that
includes nationwide efforts to get their side heard during a week
when the Democrats will have the nation's ear. The effort includes
daily news conferences from five Texas Democrats who back George W.
Bush's bid for the White House.

<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
gave Ohio Democrats a kind of working definition of the new
direction the Democratic Party has taken since President Clinton
took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to call us the 'tax and spend Democrats,' `` Cuomo
told the Ohioans at their breakfast meeting Monday. ``Now they have
to call us the budget-balancing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Ohio Sen. Howard Metzenbaum had his state's Democrats
howling for more when he spoke at the delegates' breakfast Tuesday
morning. After a warm-up behind the podium, Metzenbaum, 83,
strolled Oprah-like through the audience, exhorting the Democrats
to get out the vote this November for Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get off your butts and go out and vote,''
Metzenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator urged them to tell their friends to avoid the
temptation of voting for consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who's
running for president with the backing of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ralph Nader has done a good job. He doesn't have a
snowball's chance in hell of getting elected,'' said Metzenbaum,
who served three Senate terms before retiring in 1994. Every vote
Nader gets, said Metzenbaum, would be a vote taken away from Gore.

SAYING SO LONG TO THE CLINTON CHARM, FOR BETTER OR WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOMBARD, Ill. _ Just as Robin Wilson settled into her sofa to
watch President Clinton's speech to Democrats on Monday, her
telephone rang.
</P>
<P>
   It was Howard Ellis, an old co-worker, calling so he and Wilson,
a 67-year-old retired postal employee, could talk about the speech
as they watched it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That charisma just shines,'' Wilson told her friend as the
president spoke about his humble roots and how grateful he was for
his time in office. ``It's a shame that he can't run again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is,'' Ellis responded.
</P>
<P>
   The dedicated Democrats in the convention hall in Los Angeles
were not the only people who might have grown a bit wistful as they
listened to President Clinton on Monday night. In the living rooms
of Chicago's western suburbs, even independent voters said the
speech made them a bit nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was witty, funny, to the point,'' Wilson said, moments
after the speech, which she had taped for her grandchildren. ``I
like what he said about building one America. And I think he really
means that. I feel kind of sad, really.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the half-dozen viewers who were interviewed seemed to
share the warmth of Clinton's vision of the last eight years, they
were more subdued about their hopes for the Democrat vying to be
his successor, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I suppose I'll vote for Gore,'' Wilson said with a labored
sigh that spoke more ambivalence than enthusiasm. ``But my heart's
not in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a Republican like David King, though, a 35-year-old
computer software worker, sounded like a fan of Clinton's after the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I was really impressed,'' King said. ``The way he
rebutted every single point at the Republican convention _ saying
the good economy was a choice, not a chance _ that was awfully
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   In King's view, the Democrats can scarcely take credit for all
the nation's prosperity in recent years. The ascension of the
Internet, he said, probably had more to do with soaring stock
prices and dwindling unemployment than any policies directed by the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's closing argument, as he called it, could make
even a skeptical juror think twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just very persuasive,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Not every convention viewer was so inspired. Dr. Ann Gose, a
62-year-old cardiovascular surgeon, said she was mostly struck by
what she considered the president's profound self-centeredness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes on and on about his wife and Gore, but it eventually
comes back to himself, like it always does with this guy,'' Gose
said. ``You watch him, and it's like he couldn't let go. He needs
all this. I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Grimm, an engineering salesman in his 60s, was
throwing no bouquets at his television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at him makes me ill,'' said Grimm, an ex-marine who
said he detested Clinton from the start of his presidency, and grew
to loathe him even more since. ``He gives a good speech, no doubt
about it,'' Grimm said. ``But it's all sound-bites. And I just
can't believe anything he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the
United States Senate in New York, did not seem to provoke such
visceral reactions, positive or negative, among the Chicago
suburbanites. But several said they were a bit surprised to find
her likable as a person, especially in light of the portrait her
detractors paint as a conniving, bloodless power-monger.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Turek, a 36-year-old insurance clerk, said she was struck
by Mrs. Clinton's sense of compassion. ``I didn't really like her
before,'' said Turek, a political independent. ``But when she
talked, she seemed so totally for family, for children. And she was
sincere. She looked you in the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Turek added, ``And you've got to respect her for being such a
go-getter, considering everything that he's put her through.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Grimm, the Republican who cannot stomach the president, had
nice things to say about Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came across a little better than I thought she would,
strong and sincere,'' Grimm said. In particular, he gave Mrs.
Clinton high marks for praising Sen. Joseph Leiberman of
Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, who had
been critical of the president's sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On one point, each viewer agreed: It was a relief that neither
the president nor Clinton talked about the scandal that nearly
drove him from office. None of them wanted any displays of
contrition or public appeals, as one put it, ``for some kind of
closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Addison, 44, who owns a convenience-store franchise,
groaned at the mention of Clinton's moral lapses. ``We've had
enough about that,'' Addison said. ``It's over and done with.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether these voters considered Clinton to be a star or a
villain, it was clear that they saw him as the headline attraction,
drawing attention from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As Grimm saw it, ``Clinton is going to completely overshadow
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the president's repeated mention of Gore as his full
partner in the White House, these voters expressed skepticism that
White House policies were much influenced by the second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that were put through, that was President
Clinton,'' Wilson said. ``And you get the feeling that's all over
now.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola turning marketing strategy on its ear
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - After 114 years, Coca-Cola is turning its marketing
strategy on its head.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based beverage giant, known as one of the world's
premier marketers, believes its old formula is out of date in a new
world order in which consumers and technology are the driving
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our old model, Coke was at the center of everything we
did,'' Steve Jones, the company's chief marketing officer, said
Tuesday. ``We created lots of reasons to draw people into the world
of Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't work anymore, Jones said, especially since
consumers feel empowered to change their buying habits as they see
new products and experience new things.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our new model, consumers are at the center of the wheel,''
Jones said. ``We're developing relationships with consumers, and
getting Coke and other beverages into their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships, Jones said, need to be established and
re-established every day of the year _ year after year.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons Coca-Cola announced Tuesday that it is
entering into a unique partnership that could help consumers cover
college costs.
</P>
<P>
   The company signed a letter of intent to team up with UPromise,
a Massachusetts firm organizing a college savings network. When
it's up and running in the fall or winter, kids, their parents and
grandparents will be able to establish a tax-deferred college
savings account financed by purchasing certain Coke beverages, as
well as other products to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of each purchase will be rebated into such loyalty
accounts, which will grow through continued purchases, as well as
through investments made by professional money managers. Down the
road, that money can be used to help pay for college.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one example of how the company intends to connect
with consumers in the future if it is to grow as rapidly as it
wants to, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Coke veteran, who was promoted in January to the
company's top marketing job, is a practitioner of Chairman Doug
Daft's ``think local, act local'' strategy. Each of the company's
26 operating divisions around the globe are free to take risks,
come up with new ideas and implement them in a much streamlined
approval process.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big change, Jones said, from the centralized marketing
strategies and bureaucratic approval process that existed before
Daft took the helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke has a big challenge,'' said John Sicher, editor and
publisher of Beverage Digest. ``As a huge beverage company, it must
continue its powerful core brands, such as Coke and Sprite. But at
the same time, it must also become a small, entrepreneurial local
beverage company. Given Jones' record in Japan, where he helped the
company with rapid-fire innovation, he is well- equipped to help
make that happen on a global basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, Jones insists, is to know what consumers want in a
timely fashion in each market and then give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about knowledge,'' Jones said. ``The more you've got, the
more you'll do. We've opened up the windows and doors to ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Coca-Cola, like some of its rivals, has es said. The
trick is to tap into them, market by market.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, for example, the company recently found out that it
was not sufficiently targeting young people fraternizing at clubs
at night. As a result, it designed specific ``enjoy the chill'' ads
and marketing programs to better capitalize on thirsty,
out-of-breath dancers at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, the company recently found out that kids like the
tanginess of juice and the texture of milk. So it introduced
Sonfil, a juice-milk combination that Jones said is doing well so
far, althou

   ATLANTA - His title says it all.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bishop was named Tuesday to be vice president of ``consumer
connections'' for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, by contrast, was just called director of
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   While Bishop, 38, will be responsible for creating Coca-Cola's
overall advertising strategy, his job will be more in keeping with
the company's new emphasis on building relationships with
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from advertising, those relationships will be cultivated
through the Internet, interactive television, and wireless and game
technology.
</P>
<P>
   After an overall strategy is developed for the company's main
brands, each local market will be free to execute it in ways that
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much to do to improve the quality of our
communications,'' said Bishop, who will report to Steve Jones,
chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, an Australian, will take over Oct. 1. Currently, he is
managing director of the McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L ad agency in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   For 14 of his 15 years at McCann-Erickson, Bishop worked on
Coca-Cola business in Sydney, New York, London, Amsterdam and
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick Bishop comes to the table with an impressive array of
communications experience and demonstrated ability to bring about
positive change, ... invent new solutions and just plain make
things happen,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop replaces Ian Rowden, who left the company in May.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Quinn replaced Rowden on an interim basis. Quinn will now
become director of global brand communications, reporting to
Bishop.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways PLC grounded its fleet of Concorde
supersonic airliners Tuesday after French and British investigators
said they would urge the withdrawal of the airplane's airworthiness
certification following the fatal crash of an Air France Concorde
near Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first time in more than 20 years that an
airworthiness certificate for a commercial airliner had been
revoked by any country. The investigators said they would not spell
out their reasoning until Wednesday, and so it was unclear why they
were recommending certification be withdrawn, what steps would have
to be taken to reverse the recommendation or how long that might
take.
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways spokeswoman said the suspension of flights was
``indefinite.'' But it remained unclear whether the move
effectively meant the end of supersonic trans-Atlantic flights,
largely the elite preserve of executives and celebrities over the
airplane's 25 years of commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways and Air France are the only airlines to fly the
Concorde. Aviation analysts and officials say the investigators'
action suggests that they believe that British Airways' fleet of
seven Concordes faces the same risk of catastrophe as the doomed
Air France Flight 4590.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on everything I know, it is a safe aircraft to fly,''
said the British Airways chief executive, Rod Eddington. ``But at
the end of the day, we rest on the information provided to us by
the accident investigators and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash was the only fatal Concorde accident in the
plane's history. When it happened, Air France immediately suspended
flights by its remaining five Concordes. British Airways, after an
initial one-day suspension, continued to fly the needle-nosed
airliner, which crosses the Atlantic in three and one-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   French investigators concluded five days ago that a 16-inch
piece of metal on the runway at Charles de Gaulle airport probably
slashed a tire as the Air France plane hurtled down the runway on
take-off at about 195 mph, scattering debris that ruptured fuel
tanks. The plane took off with a plume of flame spewing from its
wing and crashed less than two minutes later
</P>
<P>
   British officials declined to say whether Tuesday's suspension
of flights meant that British Airways' seven Concordes had also
been at risk since the Paris crash. But Chris Mason, a spokesman
for Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, said that after French
investigators focused on the role of the tire blowout in the
accident, ``We have taken the position that we think it right to
suspend the certificate of airworthiness for Concorde'' in Britain
as well as France.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Bastianelli, a spokeswoman for the French accident
investigation bureau, said a ruptured tire ``should not have such
consequences as the piercing of the tank and the destruction of the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing there is something that is not safe there, and
until the safety of the aircraft can be guaranteed, we recommend
that the Concorde stops flying,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Press Association news agency reported Tuesday night
that British Airways Concordes had been fitted with reinforced
flaps above the under-carriage because of the risk of debris from
damaged tires hitting the wings. An alarm system had also been
positioned on the flight-decks to warn crew members of blowouts. It
was not clear if Air France had made similar modifications, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   David Learmount, operations and safety officer of Flight
International magazine, called the recommendation for suspension of
the Concorde's certification ``very, very rare and very, very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said that British Airways had modified its fleet of Concordes
in the mid-1990s to prevent similar tire accidents from causing
catastrophic damage and, on the basis of that modification, the
airplanes had been permitted to continue flying.
</P>
<P>
   After assessing evidence from the French investigation, however,
British investigators ``must have come to the conclusion that
despite the British Airways modification, the risk is unacceptably
high'' of a crash similar to the one in France, Learmount said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A suspension of certification, he said, means ``the aircraft is
grounded, and it has to be modified so that the risk is eliminated
or reduced'' to the satisfaction of aviation regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The last such suspension of certification, he said, involved
DC-10 aircraft. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration grounded
the planes for five weeks in 1979 after the crash of an American
Airlines plane in Chicago killed 275 people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mason at Britain's Civil Aviation Authority said it was ``almost
impossible'' to say how long the suspension would remain in force,
but aviation industry experts said that, whatever the outcome, the
combination of last month's accident and the planned withdrawal of
flying certification could seriously damage confidence in Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Concorde flights account for only a fraction of the earnings of
both Air France and British Airways, although British Airways is
thought to earn slightly more because it usually schedules two
flights a day each way between London and New York, whereas Air
France had one. The service is reduced to one return journey each
day in August, when demand among its usual high-end customers is
low, British Airways said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high maintenance and fuel costs, the aircraft also act
as prestige emblems, drawing in the well-heeled corporate
passengers that British Airways, in particular, sees as its
principal source of income. Aviation industry experts have
suggested that, if Concorde loses its appeal, then corporate
travelers could move to other airlines or corporate jets,
particularly since a supersonic model for a corporate jet is
reportedly under development in France.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said it had been told early Tuesday by Britain's
Air Accidents Investigation Branch that both it and its French
counterpart, the Bureau of Accident Investigations, would recommend
on Wednesday that Concorde's certificate of airworthiness be
suspended. When the word came, said Eddington, the British Airways
chief executive, a British Airways Concorde flight, BA 001, was
about to depart for New York on schedule, at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-seat, pencil-thin airliner had begun to taxi after
pushing off from the stand at London's Heathrow Airport with just
37 people on board, a British Airways spokeswoman said. The plane
was ordered back to the terminal and the flight canceled, along
with the return flight scheduled for Tuesday night from New York.
The passengers were transferred to subsonic flights.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Eddington said that British Airways decided
immediately to suspend its Concorde flights. ``We immediately
withdrew our supersonic fleet from service this morning, canceling
the Concorde service BA001,'' he said. In a television interview
later, he said he did not know what was behind the decision by the
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Eddington insisted that after the Air France accident, British
Airways carried out ``an extensive series of checks on the
aircraft's air frame, engines, tires and wheels, hydraulics and
other sustem.'' And, he said, Britain's Civil Aviation authority _
the industry regulator _ had been ``in complete agreement with our
decision to resume Concorde's services shortly after the Air France
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Aviation Authority said French and British
investigators would give a full explanation of their action on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's official silence about the cause of the suspension
infuriated some people living near the Concorde's flight-path at
London's Heathrow Airport. ``The Civil Aviation authority must tell
us, particularly those living near the airport, what has happened
to bring about this reversal of policy,'' said David Wilshire, an
opposition legislator representing the area around Heathrow. ``They
cannot hide behind this simple statement that they have new
information.''
</P>
<P>
   While investigators' attention has centered on the tire blow-out
in the Air France crash, the Concorde's safety record has come
under close scrutiny in the past few weeks. New Scientist magazine
said recently that it had details of a study of Concorde's engines,
commissioned by British Airways two years ago, identifying 55
``significant risks.'' British Airways said, however, that the
Civil Aviation Authority had seen no need for improvement in the
airplane's safety precautions because of the study.

   LOS ANGELES _ Uneasy American Muslim leaders say Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., must move quickly after his nomination
Wednesday as the Democratic vice presidential candidate to reassure
them that he will be fair on the Mideast or risk losing millions of
votes in crucial states to Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalence toward Lieberman is evident even among strong
Democrats of the Muslim faith, and among Arab-American delegates of
other faiths, who are attending the Democratic National Convention
in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders are urging Lieberman, the first Jewish candidate
named to a major party's national ticket, to meet with them to
discuss a wide range of issues, but said they have received no
response yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to engage with the Muslim community in a public
setting,'' said Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the signal is he has no interest in such engagement, then,
yes, I expect Muslims to shift their attention to the Bush-Cheney
ticket,'' Al-Marayati said. ``If there is no definitive response
within a week of the convention, then I'm afraid time will be
running out and people will be making up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said Al Gore's choice of Lieberman to be his running
mate has stirred deep apprehensions among Muslims, who believe the
United States has always tilted in favor of Israel and that a
Jewish vice president would make changes in that policy unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But some Muslims are wondering if an administration with
Lieberman as vice president might feel politically safer about
making foreign policy adjustments that might otherwise rile Jewish
voters. They cite President Richard Nixon's opening to China as an
example because only a Republican could have taken that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's selection also stirs hope that if Jews are able to
crash important cultural barriers and run for high office, Muslims
eventually can follow.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy issues aside, other Muslims fear Lieberman may be
too conservative on domestic and social issues of concern to
Muslims, such as due process under anti-terrorist laws they feel
victimize them, as well as federal spending on housing and health
care for immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we ask of Lieberman and Gore is that they reach out
to the Muslim community to discuss these issues,'' Hooper said.
``It's really up to him. The initiative is in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see an opening. GOP National Chairman James
Nicholson, in Los Angeles as a critical observer, said his party is
already ``reaching out to Muslim voters and meeting with their
leaders.'' If they are 8 million strong, Nicholson said, they are
at least as numerous as Jewish voters. ``The Bush ticket has a good
chance to carry that vote'' in the swing states of Michigan, Ohio,
Illinois and California where there are significant numbers of
Muslims, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews at the Democratic convention, many
Muslim delegates said they will vote to nominate Lieberman for vice
president Wednesday -- some grudgingly -- but they acknowledge that
he has ``work to do'' to win the votes of the Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will vote for Mr. Lieberman, not with all my heart, but I
will vote for him, yes,'' said Jumana Judeh of Detroit, who was
born ``in the holy city of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   One of 55 Arab-American delegates here, not all of them Muslim,
Judeh said she is troubled because Lieberman has been a firm
advocate of moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem, a step that would demonstrate U.S. support for Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem when the Palestinians also claim rights
to the city. ``I'm not in love with Mr. Lieberman because of his
past voting record,'' she said. ``I'm a Palestinian and the embassy
issue is very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Chafic Hatoum, 66, a retired insurance executive and
Lebanese-born Muslim from Sylvania, Ohio, said a Jewish vice
president could be good for Muslims. ``I've heard that because he
is a Jewish American means there is potential for some doors to be
opened that wouldn't have been opened otherwise. That's certainly
possible,'' said Hatoum. ``The other is also possible, that this
could set us back a bit,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   While Muslims claim as many votes as Jews, Hatoum said, ``we
certainly don't have the financial resources that they have -- but
in the end the votes count. The unity of Muslims will affect
national policy and the administration will act in a responsive
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Maya Mohamad Berry, 31, of Dearborn, Mich., born in
Beirut, Lebanon, said, ``For me, the problem with Lieberman is not
that he's Jewish and that he would support Israel, but that he is a
Democratic Leadership Council man and I wish he was more liberal on
education and the plight of the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he is a fair man with a balanced view who, once he
no longer represents just the voters of Connecticut, will have a
somewhat different position on foreign policy questions in the
Mideast,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Terry Ahwal, an executive assistant in Wayne County,
Mich., said she had just returned from a visit to Palestine where
the peace process has reached a new low of ``hopelessness.''
Lieberman might change that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying that because of his Jewish background we
need to be wary,'' Ahwal said. ``I say because of his Jewish
background we need to be hopeful. If nothing else, you need peace
not because of Palestine but for the security of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Morshed Alam, 43, an environmental chemist from Queens,
New York, and a Muslim born in Bangladesh, said he wants to see
Jerusalem be a neutral city but that ``religion is not the
important issue -- to me the important issue is bread and butter
and who tries to address equality and inclusion of minorities, and
public education and affirmative action. I have concerns but don't
look at Lieberman as Jewish, I look at him as a human being and a
senator. Foreign policy will be up to Gore. He knows what he'll do
and Lieberman will comply with the position Gore has.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Ismael Ahmed, 52, director of an Arab community center
in Dearborn, Mich., said he was caught by surprise when Gore chose
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a mixed record on the Mideast,'' Ahmed said, ``but he's
done things like co-chairing Builders for Peace, a group of Arabs
and Jews who worked to build businesses on the West Bank so the
level of existence there would be one that would make for peace. I
think that's a positive thing. And he co-sponsored the Egyptian
foreign aid bill. I will vote for Lieberman because I'm a Democrat.
He is not where I would like to see him on Jerusalem, but he's not
been an enemy to the peace process either.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Ahmad Nawab, 63, of St. Petersburg, Fla., an
Indian-born Muslim, said he will back Lieberman despite misgivings
within his community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very strong supporter of Israel and I would like
to see him moderate somewhat,'' Nawab said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Lieberman's most outspoken admirers among the
Arab-American delegates is James Zogby, president of the
Washington-based Arab American Institute, who said, ``He helped us
when we needed somebody to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American Democrats initially were not welcomed into the
Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, Zogby said; ``They were rebuffed.''
He said a prominent member of the pro-Israel lobby, whom he
declined to name, who was active in the Clinton campaign bluntly
told him: `We're not going to let you in. Go join the Republicans.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Joe Lieberman,'' Zogby said. ``I told him they were
trying to keep us out, that they were saying they don't want Arabs
in this campaign. Lieberman said, `That's outrageous.' He picked up
a telephone and called George Stephanopoulos (then a senior Clinton
aide) and said, `I want the Arab-Americans in the campaign.' The
next day we were invited to the campaign headquarters in Little
Rock and we were greeted there with open arms. It was Lieberman who
made it happen. He said what was happening to us was wrong and it
was not the kind of politics he would support.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby is spreading that story about Lieberman over and over
here, but he said it is not an easy sell among Arab-Americans and
Muslims. ``They are nervous and uneasy about Lieberman,'' he said.

ROBERT B. WATSON, 86, WORKED AS DEAN OF STUDENTS AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Robert B. Watson, dean of students at Harvard
University during tumultuous anti-war demonstrations in the 1960s
and later the university's athletic director who oversaw the start
of a multimillion-dollar building campaign, died Saturday in his
home in Cataumet. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Watson grew up in Wellesley and attended St. Mark's School.
At Harvard, Mr. Watson lettered in football and crew and was
graduated in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Mr. Watson served in the Navy and was the
executive officer on board the destroyer USS Leary. On Christmas
Eve 1943, the Leary was patrolling in the North Atlantic Ocean
about 700 miles from France when a German U-boat sank the ship. Mr.
Watson clung to a two-by-four for five hours in the frigid waters
before being rescued. ``It was just beginning to get light when we
were picked up by another warship,'' he said after returning to the
United States. ``I never was so glad to see another vessel in my
life.'' Of the 277 men on board, 57 survived.
</P>
<P>
   After the war Mr. Watson became a dean at Harvard and was made
dean of students in 1958. His style was to treat people with
courtesy and respect, while maintaining a sense of order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kindest man I ever met,'' said Jay Stack, a former
Harvard student who became a family friend. ``He was always
gracious and made you feel like you were the only person on his
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   As anti-war protests increased on campuses throughout the
country in the 1960s, Mr. Watson was caught up in the events at
Harvard. In 1969, students took over University Hall and forcibly
ejected Mr. Watson from his office on four occasions. Trying to
maintain order, Mr. Watson made more than two dozen court
appearances, as the administration's only representative, as
assault cases were brought against students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 Mr. Watson became athletic director at Harvard, a
position he held until his retirement in 1977. During his tenure,
he was instrumental in helping to start the renovation of the
university's athletic facilities, which at the time were the worst
in the Ivy League. It was under Mr. Watson's tenure that
construction began on Blodgett Pool and the Gordon Track. ``It is
important to give him credit for that; he was instrumental,'' said
Jack Reardon, Harvard's director of alumni affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement, each of the Ivy League schools presented Mr.
Watson with a varsity letter.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, he enjoyed spending his summers at the family
house in Cataumet. ``He used to joke that he never wanted to get in
a boat smaller than a destroyer,'' said his daughter Joanne Watson
Spievack. Mr. Watson would spend several hours each day in his
vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past president of the board of Belmont Day School and
served on the board of the Beaver Country Day School. He was a
member of the Brookline country club.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Polly (Blodgett) of Boston and Florida;
three daughters, Gail Barber of Bedford, Jeannie of Weston, and
Joanne of Cambridge; two sons, Peter T. of Bainbridge Island, Wa.,
and Robert Jr., of Richmond, Va.; a brother, Edward of New
Hampshire; and nine grandchildren.

SOME DEMS SAY GORE SHOULD RUN WITH CLINTON RATHER THAN AWAY FROM
HIM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore, after officially taking
the baton from President Bill Clinton in Michigan yesterday, comes
here today to begin the last leg of the presidential relay.
</P>
<P>
   As he heads toward the finish line, clearly behind Republican
nominee George W. Bush, political pundits keep suggesting that Gore
must continue to distance himself from the man he has served (and
worked closely with) for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe what Bill Clinton said in his farewell speech
Monday night, when he listed a plethora of this administration's
accomplishments, then it is reasonable to ask: How can Gore run
away from that when he was a partner in making it all happen?
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, ``Why'' would he run away from the man to
whom the American people still give high marks for his performance
in office?
</P>
<P>
   There are many delegates here who say Gore should run ``with''
Clinton, not away from him.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Al Edwards of Houston said that, with the record the
Clinton administration has amassed, there is no reason for Gore to
sever his relations with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be his own man,'' Edwards said, ``and that's what
he's been doing. But he doesn't have to separate himself from his
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   One person with a unique perspective on the campaign, partly
because of his friendship with Clinton and Gore and partly because
he has run his own race against Republican Bush, is Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, ignoring the counsel of some advisers, proudly proclaimed
his friendship with the president when he ran against incumbent
Bush for governor in 1998. He even asked Clinton to come to Texas
and campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't hurt Mauro during that campaign, but he couldn't
help him either. No one could have beaten Bush that year.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Gore is exactly where Bush's father was in 1988, when
the elder Bush came out of the Republican convention with hopes of
succeeding Ronald Reagan in office.
</P>
<P>
   In that campaign, Mauro recalls, then-Vice President Bush was
behind in the polls. He was being called a ``wimp'' without a clear
message and people wondered if he could ever get out of Reagan's
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush won in 1988, Mauro said, because ``ultimately
the American people wanted to keep Reagan in office because of his
record _ his perceived record.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks that kind of sentiment will come into play when
Americans go to the polls in November. But while he believes that
Gore and Joseph Lieberman have a good chance of overtaking the
Republican ticket and seizing victory in November, Mauro was
cautious not to be over confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any Democrat who underestimates George W. Bush would
be making a huge mistake,'' he said. ``I won't make that mistake
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Clinton is ``Gore's 800-pound gorilla'' just
as Reagan was Bush's oversized primate, Mauro said the Bush
campaign was making a big mistake by harping on the
Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have forgiven Bill Clinton for his past
indiscretions,'' Mauro said. ``They're still made at him _ I'm
still mad at him _ but they have forgiven him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the ``single most reason Bush ought to be defeated''
is because he, instead of spending $1 billion to provide universal
kindergarten for Texas children, ``would rather give a crummy
$12-a-year tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who got married again last spring and is expecting twins,
said he's enjoying private life for a change, but you can expect
him to back in politics. He wouldn't predict when.

   LOS ANGELES _ Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman have
something in common beyond the fact that both hope to become vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cheney, Lieberman received a deferment from the military
draft during the Vietnam War because he was a father. And like
Cheney, Lieberman, under rules in effect at the time, received the
deferment before the child was born.
</P>
<P>
   According to Selective Service records, Lieberman held a student
deferment from 1961, when he was a freshman at Yale, until May 24,
1967, as he was preparing to graduate from Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   On that date, Lieberman was granted a coveted 3-A deferment,
meaning he could not be drafted because he was the father of a
child. His first child, Matthew, by his first wife, was born Aug.
16, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who was also a graduate student in the 1960s, was
granted the same kind of deferment in January 1966, about 10 weeks
after his wife, Lynne, became pregnant, and just after the
Selective Service made childless married men as vulnerable to the
draft as single men.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney would have remained protected from the draft even without
the fatherhood deferment because he remained in school until after
he turned 26, when men became exempt from conscription.
</P>
<P>
   But because Lieberman was finishing law school, he would have
been subject to the draft almost immediately without the 3-A
deferment, according to Richard Flahaven, a Selective Service
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman did not turn 26 until Feb. 24, 1968. Flahaven said
that under Selective Service rules, the oldest eligible men were
drafted first.
</P>
<P>
   With their exemptions, Cheney and Lieberman were part of a large
cohort in their age group: The number of men who were exempt from
the draft because they had children exceeded the number of men, 2.6
million, who served in Vietnam from 1964 to 1973.

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Under the watchful gaze of North Korean
minders here, 100 families separated for the last five decades
began on Tuesday the arduous process of rebuilding relationships
torn apart by war.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers embraced children long given up for dead. Brothers and
sisters struggled to identify adults they knew until now only as
children. Wives steeled themselves to meet husbands long since
wedded to other spouses, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   And underlying all the carefully choreographed drama,
custom-made for tear-jerking footage and heartbreaking copy _
indeed, making it possible _ was the surprisingly sophisticated
political maneuvering of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. Kim,
known as dear leader to his people, until recently was regarded by
the outside world as a reclusive, dictatorial oddity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much for being alive!'' 87-year-old Hong
Ghil-soon exclaimed as she embraced her daughter, Kim Ok Bae, who
arrived Tuesday morning on the first North Korean plane to land on
South Korean soil since 1950. ``Thank the dear leader for taking
such good care of you!''
</P>
<P>
   Here was a South Korean mother whose daughter was effectively
kidnapped by North Korean troops during the war heaping praise upon
the man whose father, Kim Il Sung, had led those troops and founded
the totalitarian state that split her family apart.
</P>
<P>
   The plane that brought the 100 people south carried another 100
people north on its return trip for similar reunions.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in these reunions clearly did not care that
they have become political pawns. They are simply happy to be
families once again.
</P>
<P>
   The vast convention hall where the meetings took place Tuesday
reverberated with shouts of joy and peals of happy laughter _ not
to mention a fair amount of relieved sobbing, as families solved
long-standing mysteries and confirmed or discarded long-held
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   For five decades, Moon Kyung-ja has wondered what happened to
her mother, who was thrown in jail for aiding the North Korean army
during the war that divided the Korean peninsula _ and who was
never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday she got her answer from her eldest sister, Moon Yang
Ok, whom she had not seen since the war and had at times presumed
dead. Their mother had not died in jail, as Moon Kyung-ja had
feared, but instead had escaped and walked to safety in North Korea
with her two oldest daughters and baby son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother passed away without fulfilling her dream of seeing
you,'' Moon Yang Ok told her sister while stroking her face. ``But
your brother and sister are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, they are alive!'' Moon Kyung-ja shouted, throwing
her hands in the air. ``My family is alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Her sister hugged her hard. ``Let me see you, let me see your
face,'' she said. ``I have learned how long a day is, waiting this
last week to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunions Tuesday are the first in what South Korean
officials hope will be a series of three family gatherings this
year. Kim Jong Il, who met with South Korean news media executives
last week, told them that he intends to arrange two more reunions,
in September and October. Southern officials say the planning for
those gatherings is already underway.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are part of a strategy, mapped out by Kim Jong Il
and the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, in their historic
meeting in June, to begin the process of reunifying the two
countries by breaking down the barriers that divide their people.
Already, North Korea has agreed to re-establish rail lines between
the two countries, and last week it signed an agreement with one of
South Korea's biggest conglomerates to develop a permanent meeting
place for separated families, at Kaesong.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has even said that he would like to find a way to
allow visiting relatives to stay in each other's homes, rather than
meeting in convention centers and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hopes are high that these are the first steps toward a more
sweeping rapprochement, including greater economic cooperation and
decreased military tension between the two countries, which are
technically still at war.
</P>
<P>
   But how far the current thaw will go remains to be seen. North
Korea was careful to arrange an insurance policy against
defections, making sure that the South Koreans who have gone north
will not leave until all of the North Korean family members are
home.
</P>
<P>
   And a South Korean official said Tuesday that this country fully
expects to pay the impoverished North for these reunions. Already,
the South Korean government has given each family $500 to give to
its visiting relatives from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans who arrived here Tuesday all appear to be
members of the country's elite: professors, doctors, artists and
the like. During interviews, a few referred to the fact that they
were ``chosen by the dear leader'' to make the trip, suggesting
that they have ties to the North Korean political hierarchy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They were in high spirits, waving and clapping as they left the
plane, and seemed more affluent than their South Korean relatives
had expected. Many South Koreans had purchased watches to give
their northern relatives, but many of the visitors arrived wearing
nice watches. Two or three of the seven North Korean women wore
exquisite _ and expensive _ han dok, the traditional Korean dress.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some of the delegation's spit-and-polish seemed a
bit contrived. Several of the men seemed to be wearing identical
suits and identical ties, and none of them carried any hand
luggage, in stark contrast to the South Koreans who went north
practically staggering under tote bags jammed with gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about what the visitors from the North thought of
Seoul were ignored or brushed aside, and the visitors took every
opportunity to praise the dear leader and the great leader, as Kim
Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, was known.
</P>
<P>
   Moon Yang Ok proudly showed her sister a handsome watch with
``Kim Il Sung'' written in elegant red calligraphy across its light
silver face. ``I received this as an award for my academic
achievements from the great leader,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches medicine, as does their younger brother, who was 2
years old when they fled for the North. ``Thanks to our great
leader, we have become medical professionals, and my younger
brother is the leading academic at the Hamheung University School
of Medicine,'' she said. ``There aren't many people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother had invented a machine to treat arterial
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   But others were more unsettled by the attention they received
Tuesday. ``My sister seems really nervous,'' said Kim Suk-bae,
whose sister, Kim Ok Bae, arrived in Seoul Tuesday. ``Whenever the
men from the other side come by, the ones with badges, she keeps
praising the dear leader and tells us to do the same. We feel like
we have to play along because if we don't, something bad might
happen to her when she returns to her home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Ok Bae turned her head away whenever she was asked a
question, so her sister answered for her. She said Kim Ok Bae left
their house in September 1950 on a school trip to perform for North
Korean troops. The performance was so good that the North Koreans
``recruited'' the performers to travel around and keep morale high.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kim Ok Bae became an anatomy professor, her
sister said. She is married to another anatomy professor and has
two children, a son who is a movie producer and a daughter who is a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister said that Kim Ok Bae told the family that every year
on her mother's birthday, she prepares a birthday feast, sets a
beautiful table and celebrates by herself. ``I have lived until now
with the guilt of having been a bad daughter,'' Kim Ok Bae said to
her mother, Hong Ghil-soon, who is 87, when they met Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've turned out wonderfully!'' her mother exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many cases the North Korean visitors seemed better
off than their southern relatives, which is probably precisely the
message Kim Jong Il wished to send. Kim Hyun-ki remembered his
older brother, Kim Hyun Suk, who disappeared from school shortly
after the war started, as a bright, handsome, engaging youngster.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Kim Hyun Suk did indeed seem to be all of those
things _ and much younger than his two younger brothers. A tall man
with a thick head of salt-and-pepper hair, he spoke animatedly
during their meeting. ``I went into the army for three years, and
after that I went to college,'' he said. ``They sent me to college
to study engineering, and I studied really hard, father.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his three children also have college degrees. No one in
his South Korean family, which found it difficult to eke out a
living here once the authorities found out they had a family in the
North, can make a similar statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong-man was not about to let his brother Kim Dong Jin
forget the hard times his ideological beliefs had brought upon his
family. Kim Dong Jin joined the North Korean army after being
jailed several times for his communist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean army then threw his father into prison because
of his son's activities and confiscated all of the family's
possessions, Kim Dong-man said. ``My father died because of my
older brother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong Jin, a retired civil servant, sat silently as his
brother described the family's woes. ``He still hasn't told me what
he did for a living in the North,'' Kim Dong-man said. ``But he did
say he lives in a 100-square-yard house, and from that, I know he's
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dong Jin then broke his silence. ``I feel like a rich man
today because I am able to see my family again,'' he said quietly.
``But if I would have stayed in the South, I would have died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 24 and the North Koreans took me in, all I had were
my two fists. But the great leader educated me and gave me a job.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kim Dong-man said he holds no grudges against his
brother. ``Older brother told me he is sorry,'' he said. ``These
tragedies happened because we lost our country to the Japanese and
then fought ourselves after that. My brother was part of that. I
want all of this suffering to end with my generation.''

<P>
   The Democratic Convention appears to have achieved its
objective: absolutely everyone in the Staples Center will vote for
Al Gore. Winning over the delegates, however, doesn't mean you've
won the heart of America.
</P>
<P>
   The more close-up experience one has with conventions, the more
one believes that the right to vote should be withdrawn entirely
from delegates. People this enthusiastic should be manacled and
placed in a small dim closet until the election has passed _ if
only for their own safety. If Bill Clinton had concluded his speech
by going all Jim-Jones on the Stapleites, announcing that the
forces of darkness were coming and they had to drink this Kool-Aid
to move on to a better place, they'd have lined up and asked for
Big-Gulp portions.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone. Hillary won't drink Bill's Kool-Aid. Oh,
she'll put the cup to her lips and make sipping noises, but she'll
spit it out when no one's looking. Her opening night speech proved
three things:
</P>
<P>
   1. She'll never again be content to cool her heels in Bill's
long shadow. Her speech concluded with a list of people she had to
thank for the last eight years; her husband was not among them.
Perhaps it was a trick. Perhaps if he later said, ``Thanks for the
acknowledgment, hon,'' she'd know he'd yanked a toothsome campaign
worker into the green room, locked the door and turned off the TV.
Or at least turned down the sound.
</P>
<P>
   2. She'll never be half the leader Bill is. She's a dud on the
stump. The nation really hasn't seen a full-strength feature-length
Hillary speech before. We've been served thin pink slices of Rodham
over the years, but it's been years since she's given a purely
political speech for national consumption. Her opening night speech
answered the question: Can someone nag in a shouting monotone? Yes.
Through a novacaine smile, no less.
</P>
<P>
   3. She doesn't buy this new moral Democrat stuff, either.
Hillary had a litany of concerns she'd personally experienced
during the last eight years -- to our surprise, it turns out she
hasn't been in D.C. at all. She's spent the time on porches and
factory floors, holding the hands of people, ordinary people,
decent people, who would all be decomposing skeletons now if Bill
hadn't been elected. With every sob story she told, she got a
cheer, as if people were applauding for the continued existence of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   Then she brought up the difficulty of raising children in a
world saturated with media violence. She seemed to be bolting down
the sentence like a child eating beets to get to the pudding. The
crowd hardly mustered a cheer. This is Lieberman's territory, and
it either bores the faithful or makes them nervous. Honest Joe,
after all, has worked with Bill Bennett, whom the hard left regards
as a roly-poly ayatollah intent on stuffing all women back into
Donna Reed dresses and making sure children memorize Robert Service
poems while they get flat-top haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   The left doesn't share Lieberman's Silver Sewer crusade; to the
left, the real villains are those who question public funding for
transgressive art, or radio talk-show hosts like Dr. Laura. She's
spent about 3 percent of her shows airing a religious view of
homosexuality drawn from the same faith as Joe Lieberman, and this
makes her a threat to civilized society. Let a rapper such as
Eminem announce that he hates gays, and that's different. If your
Hollywood contributors make money from the sale of hate, it's
artistic license.
</P>
<P>
   Let us quote from the artist himself: ``My words are like a
dagger with a jagged edge that'll stab in you head whether you're a
fag or a les.'' Do Democrats support these sentiments? No. But they
can't support the people who worry about Eminem, because they think
they're fun-killing Gingrichian cads in Snidely Whiplash cloaks,
eager to jail Teletubbies for violating sodomy laws.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dems' new family-friendly, post-Clinton pro-morals
incarnation regards cultural rot as just an unfortunate form of
weather. And as a wise man once noted, everyone engages in
meaningful dialogue about the weather, but no one efforts any
actionable positions. The entertainment medium could stand a little
shaming now and then, but the left can't bring themselves to do it,
any more than the right can pretend they're doing jumping-jacks
over Bush's pro-government talk. It's a rough year for the
hard-core faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but Kool-Aid -- and watered-down stuff, at that.

antiquity to be ``rich as Croesus.'' But they are also finding much
more: monumental remains of the passage of time and fortune for a
major city under subsequent Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine
rule. This material, taken from the gold refining area in ancient
Sardis, is part of the archaeological evidence that the gold of
Croesus was no legend, and that the first coins of pure gold and

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   However, faced with the intolerable prospect of seeing their
comrades suffocate, Russian officials met with NATO representatives
Tuesday at the organization's Brussels headquarters, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be starting work on Thursday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities ingor Sergeyev offering U.S. military help
in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
ional crews and professional people who are trained for submarinh
the submarine with a capsule capable of bringing men to the surface
in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the capsule from
the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineide the submarine were flooded, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarinef flooding. It may be impossible to operate the
submarine if several compartments, including the control center,
are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. ``It is difficult for the ships to hold their course. All the
ships and the capsule should be directed at a certain angle to
ensuthe vessel's hull, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were y five years ago and represents the
height of Russia's nuclear submarine technology.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to the
environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the reactor
that powers its engines had been shut down. Officials in Norway
said there was no sign of a radiati

   SEOUL _ A half-century's worth of pent-up emotion, long-buried
hopes, and unforgotten love poured out in a torrent of tears and
desperate embraces Tuesday as 200 families torn apart by war came
together for a few hours in the capitals of South and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Live television coverage of the heart-wrenching meetings
mesmerized a nation torn in half by ideology and Cold War-era
conflict, spurring hopes for the eventual reunification of the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred North Koreans, citizens of the world's last
hard-line Stalinist nation, flew to the southern capital to meet
sobbing parents, children, siblings, and spouses. The long-lost kin
hugged for minutes at a time, moaning and repeating each other's
names, touching faces in disbelief, clutching each other as if they
would never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ``Mother!'' ``Where have you been?,'' ``We thought you
were dead!'' ``Oh! How I've missed you!'' and ``Sweetheart, it's
me,'' filled the air in the vast convention hall where the reunions
took place at 100 separate tables.
</P>
<P>
   In Pyongyang, the scene repeated itself, as 100 southerners were
showered with tears, interminable embraces, and yelps of joyful
recognition tinged with pain. ``Is that you, my brother? Are you
the real one?'' one woman cried, holding her brother and patting
his back again and again, as if to make sure he was really there.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the emotion of seeing the son she long believed
dead, one elderly woman in Seoul collapsed and had to be carried
out on a stretcher. Another woman hugged her brother so hard that
both fell to the ground, arms intertwined, sobbing hysterically.
Others burst into tears repeatedly, drinking bottles of herbal
medicine to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shivering and shivering,'' whispered Lee Dok Soon, 86, at
the sight of her 65-year-old son An Soon Hwan, who went to school
one day 50 years ago at the outbreak of the war and never came
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother!'' he cried, grasping her knees and prostrating himself
before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon Hwan, my son, where have you been?'' she sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of southerners are believed to have been abducted
during the chaos of war, forced into the North's army or kidnapped
for their special skills. Many others joined the northern side by
choice. They never saw their families again when the war ended with
a permanent division along the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, more than 1 million northerners fled
south or were taken prisoner. They, too, were never able to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, the 70 million people on either side of the
world's most militarized and impregnable border were denied any
contact, even letters or phone calls, and the vast majority have no
idea what happened to missing relatives. This week's brief
reunions, carefully monitored by North Korean officials and
restricted to no more than five relatives for each visitor for a
few hours a day, will end Friday morning. The families will then
say goodbye, perhaps never to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   These are only the second-ever official reunions. In 1985, 50
families from each side met, but have not been permitted to contact
each other since.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was palpable for those excluded from the reunions; one
woman who was not among the five relatives permitted to meet with
her brother stood vigil outside his hotel with a placard bearing
his name. When Kim Yong Hwan, 68, marched out in step with the
North Korean delegation and heard his youngest sister's voice, his
mouth froze in a grotesque expression of pain, and he faltered on
his way to the waiting bus. The two were prevented from greeting
each other by a security cordon, and sister Kim Yong Soon collapsed
in tears, crying, ``Older brother! Older brother!''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the chosen didn't make it to the big day. Mun Byong
Chul, 68, learned that his 90-year-old mother died three days after
learning last week that he was alive and might be permitted to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least before she passed away, she was told her son was
still alive and was seeking his mother,'' Mun's sister told him.
``She asked, `Can I meet him? Can I meet him today?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so betrayed when you left us and went to North
Korea,'' his sister continued, until Mun, holding back tears,
begged her to stop, saying, ``Let's meet up again tomorrow and only
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   At another table, Hong Kil Soon, 87, grabbed her daughter, Kim
Ok Bae, an aspiring dancer who disappeared on her way to high
school one day during the war and is now the North's best known
teacher of dance and gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and her family clasped each other in a group embrace, crying
out each others' names. Like others who met their parents, Kim
bowed before her mother, knelt down, and put her face in her
mother's lap. The family pulled out black-and-white baby photos and
class pictures of Kim, presented her with a huge diamond ring
belonging to her mother, and asked her why she disappeared. Kim,
67, told them she went to North Korea to perform for soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed Tuesday night after the reunions broke up for the
evening, Kim Sook Bae, 64, said she still believes her sister was
kidnapped because of her fame as a promising young dancer, but
added quickly, ``We're only guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a dinner in which the families were oddly separated again
in the banquet hall, Kim's brother, Kim Yu Kwang, 57, said he would
feel empty when his sister leaves on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now I feel empty,'' he confided sadly. ``It feels like I
got a rain shower _ when it first hits you, it feels cool and nice,
but when it's over, you feel cold and clammy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bittersweet day for spouses who were separated
when husbands were conscripted into or joined the North Korean
army. ``She was so young and lively at 23. She's just the same _
she hasn't changed a bit,'' Kim Hi Young, 72, said quietly of his
wife. He later remarried in the North.
</P>
<P>
   It was painfully clear, however, that Jeong Chun Ja, 73, could
not rejoice, because of her guilt over having remarried seven years
after her husband Kim disappeared. ``I didn't have any money. I
couldn't survive on my own. If I had a father and brothers to
support me, I would never have remarried,'' she repeated again and
again in apology. She was widowed 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sorry you remarried,'' Kim reassured her. ``I
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 77,000 applicants in South Korea, 100 were chosen by a
lottery to go north. North Korea apparently chose its 100 delegates
on the basis of their accomplishments and loyalty to the regime.
The northern visitors wore lapel pins featuring their late ``Great
Leader'' Kim Il Sung, and whenever officials listened in on
conversations, the visitors sat up, thanked the North's current
``Dear Leader,'' Kim Jong Il, and made impassioned, if stiff, pleas
for national reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Though the reunions are fleeting and restricted to hotel rooms
and escorted tours, they are arguably the most important outcome of
the landmark summit between the leaders two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an apparent detente has blossomed in countless ways;
Tuesday, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung called for the
creation of a North-South military hotline and echoed Kim Jong Il's
vow to repair a defunct railroad link.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il has called for more reunions in September and
October and suggested families might be able to visit their
hometowns next year.
</P>
<P>
   The communist North and democratic South remain technically at
war, since a peace treaty was never signed to end the 1950-53
conflict, and as recently as last year, the North provoked a naval
battle with the South. But South Koreans' hopes for peaceful
reunification were bolstered by the successful summit, and even
more so by Tuesday's reunions.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats are dealing with an undercurrent of
concern that vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman might
cool African-American enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket, for
which overwhelming support from black voters is a prerequisite of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman got a warm reception from the Democratic National
Committee Black Caucus Tuesday, but potential for problems in the
black community arises from his past rhetorical flirtation with
efforts to end affirmative action, and his history-making place as
the first Jewish candidate on a national ticket. The campaign
cannot help but touch occasionally on tender matters of
black-Jewish relations.
</P>
<P>
   The microscopic attention to Lieberman's record on race also
offers a window into what may be a dawning new era in American
racial politics. With the exit from office of Bill Clinton, a
president who achieved unparalleled rapport with African-American
voters, and the entry into presidential politics of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who is attempting a wholesale makeover of his party
on issues of diversity and inclusion, the Democratic Party is
entering a nervous period in sorting out whether it will continue
to draw the overwhelming enthusiasm of black voters.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence yet that disaffection with the
Lieberman choice is deep or powerful in the black community, the
black vote is so crucial to Democratic fortunes, and turnout so
volatile, that even the slightest falloff in black participation
could prove fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Walters, a professor of political science at the University
of Maryland who played a major role in Jesse Jackson's campaigns
for the presidency, said the Democrats will now need a
``monumental'' registration and get-out-the-vote effort to overcome
what he thinks will be a Lieberman drag on the ticket. ``If they
don't do anything, it could have a chilling effect.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, an expert on black politics with the Joint Center
for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, said he thought
that in the context of attracting black votes, Lieberman was
``probably the least desirable choice'' among the names on Gore's
short list. ``I don't know what the consequences are going to be,
quite frankly,'' said Bositis. ``I have a hard time imagining it
would be a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican efforts to present a much more multiracial face to
America at their convention in Philadelphia were aimed primarily at
attracting white swing voters, Bositis said. But, he said, it is
not beyond the realm of possibility that Republicans could
marginally improve their standing with black voters over their
performance in the last four presidential cycles when they won
about 10 percent of the black vote.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore's
choice of Lieberman, who built his reputation as a Democrat who was
unafraid to depart from party dogma, may have brought home to some
people just how much more conservative their party has become in
the Clinton era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of Bill Clinton was that he stole Republican
thinking and gave it a liberal bent,'' said Michael Eric Dyson, a
cultural critic and one of the leading voices of the black left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that Gore is any more dead center or right of center
than Clinton, but he doesn't have Clinton's intimate contacts with
black people that allowed him an entre that Mr. Gore simply does
not possess,'' said Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that black people are very nervous,'' said Dyson, who
teaches at DePaul University in Chicago. As a seminary student in
Hartford, Conn., when Lieberman was first elected to the Senate in
1988, Dyson voted for Lieberman's incumbent opponent, the
independent Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker. ``The problem with
Lieberman is that he is a Republican masquerading as a Democrat,
and that's a profound problem,'' said Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton managed to support the death penalty, enact welfare
reform and transform the Democrats into the balanced-budget party
while becoming more popular with black Americans every step of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   But, Walters said, Gore does not have that ``magic.'' And
Lieberman, like Clinton and Gore, is prominently associated with
the Democratic Leadership Council, which was formed to move the
party toward the middle and away from what was seen as the party's
overweaning devotion to minority causes.
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of Los
Angeles, who has raised questions about the Lieberman choice, the
rest of the black political establishment has lined up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest source of concern about his record centers on
affirmative action. On Tuesday, Lieberman said he regretted what he
characterized as a naive expression of support back in 1995 for
Proposition 209, the California ballot initiative that did away
with racial and gender preferences in the California public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tom Wood, the co-author of 209, and Ward Connerly, the
black businessman who led the successful effort to enact it, said
they thought Lieberman's explanation -- that he didn't understand
the implications of what he was saying -- is disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood acknowledges, as Lieberman now brags, that he has
consistently voted to defend affirmative action in the Senate.
Lieberman said he shared the Clinton and Gore sentiment that
affirmative action should be ``mended not ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has also been criticized for supporting the
experimental use of school vouchers in order to offer what he
described as a ``lifeline'' to poor students trapped in lousy
schools. But, while most black leaders oppose vouchers, they are an
idea that polls have indicated blacks as well as whites tend to
favor.
</P>
<P>
   In his appearance before the Black Caucus, Lieberman noted, as
Clinton did in his convention speech the night before, that he was
a Freedom Rider,helping to register blacks in Mississippi in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But Dyson said, ``Too many people point to their glorious past
to cover up their problematic present.'' And, fairly or not, his
record may suggest comparisons with those of influential Jewish
neoconservatives whose intellectual trajectory has taken them from
'60s liberalism to contemporary conservatism, particularly on
issues of race.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict over ``racial quotas'' -- which most everyone agrees
are bad, though they may sharply disagree on when and whether they
exist -- has proved to be the fulcrum of that controversy, and has
helped to fuel some tension over the years between blacks and Jews
(many of whom continue to support affirmative action).
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   The first voice raised in criticism of the Lieberman choice came
from Lee Alcorn, the head of the Dallas NAACP, who said Jews could
not be trusted because of their obssession with money (he was
immediately fired by the national NAACP), and Nation of Islam
minister Louis Farrakhan, who wondered whether Lieberman's firt
loyalty would be to Israel or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Waters has been critical, demanding that Lieberman reassure
black voters of his commitment on racial justice issues. While many
other members of the black caucus sat on the dais with Lieberman
Tuesday, Waters sat in the front row. Early in his remarks,
Lieberman noted that it was Waters' birthday and led the singing of
``Happy Birthday.'' Afterward, Waters joined him on stage and they
briefly held hands.
</P>
<P>
   James Clyburn, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and Al
Edwards, the chair of the DNC Black Caucus, said they already had
been reassured by Lieberman and enthusiastically back his
nomination. Many black leaders followed the lead of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who recalled the historical alliance of blacks and Jews in
the civil rights movement, and suggested that breaking the barrier
against Jews holding national office would hasten the day a black
might serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be far behind,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the
District of Columbia's non-voting delegate in Congress, who
introduced Lieberman at the Black Caucus meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   One source of tension between blacks and Jews in recent decades
has been how successful Jews as a group have been in America since
the Holocaust, compared with the continuing struggle of many blacks
in a nation that was the source and site of the slavery that some
call ``the Black Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Bositis said he thinks Lieberman's being a Jew may contribute to
his problems with some black voters.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey of black and white Americans by the Joint
Center last year found that 39 percent of blacks felt Jews have too
much influence. Only 19 percent of white respondents felt the same.
Those feelings among blacks were, interestingly, strongest in the
Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lynch, a veteran political organizer from New York who is
vice chair of the national Democratic Party, said he thought some
people were attempting to stir black-Jewish animosities to
undermine the Democratic ticket, but that it would not work.
``Lieberman vs. (Republican vice presidential nominee Richard)
Cheney? No comparison,'' said Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Cora Masters Barry, wife of former Washington Mayor Marion
Barry, agreed. She is directing voter registration efforts for the
National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and for the Million
Family March that Farrakhan has called for Washington in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are so high, any reservations they may have about
Lieberman are going to be neutralized,'' said Barry. For starters,
she said, while in Congress Cheney voted against a resolution
calling for Nelson Mandela's freedom. And, she said, with the death
penalty so frequently invoked in Texas, ``Gov. Bush fries an
African-American a month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think we are going to state that?'' said Barry.
``We're going to get down with it. We have to take the gloves
off.''

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW

<P>
   LONDON _ As the Russians continued their desperate attempt to
rescue 116 sailors trapped inside a grounded nuclear submarine,
there were signs that an international effort _ perhaps including
the United States _ could be assembled to assist the task.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials met with NATO counterparts Tuesday evening as
their attempts to get to the crew in the submarine some 350 feet
below the surface were foundering.
</P>
<P>
   A first attempt by the Russian navy to dock a rescue capsule to
the sunken submarine failed in the heavy storms with 12-foot waves
lashing the Barents Sea near Norway. The submarine went down
Saturday, and concerns about the dwindling oxygen supply aboard
were heightening steadily Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that the oxygen could be exhausted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, the Russian navy plans to attempt to raise
the crippled submarine to the surface with inflatable 400-ton
pontoons, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 rescue vessels and warships were sent to the area where
the massive Kursk, one of Russia's most modern submarines, went
down during training exercises. Russian officials said the Kursk
was not carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Because the power has been off since the boat's nuclear reactor
was shut down, the crew has been able to communicate only by
tapping on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Navy spokesman said Tuesday the tapping was growing
fainter. ``The signal is getting weaker,'' the spokesman told
Reuters. ``Of course, the oxygen is running low, people just need
to lie or sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, Russian Navy commander Vladimir
Kuroyedov said the prospects for the crew was bleak. ``What remains
is our hope, which leaves us fewer and fewer chances every day,''
he said. ``Our calculations show that by August 18 they will run
out of oxygen. I am not a pessimist, I am a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kuroyedov described their chances as ``very grim'' in a
report to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is on vacation at a
Black Sea resort.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials earlier said they would not seek assistance,
even though it has been offered by the United States and Britain.

WEATHER HAMPERS RESCUE OF RUSSIAN SUBMARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With oxygen dwindling aboard a stricken Russian
submarine and the frantic tapping of SOS by the trapped sailors
inside growing faint, rescue vessels Tuesday braved an icy Arctic
gale to launch a desperate undersea rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue efforts were thwarted repeatedly by the foul
weather, and the outlook for saving the 116 sailors trapped 354
feet below the surface was growing bleak, Russian navy officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that there are still people alive, and they are
signaling SOS,'' said Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, the chief of
Russia's navy. ``What remains is our hope, which leaves us fewer
and fewer chances every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapping has been the only way the crew of the Kursk, one of
Russia's most modern submarines, have been able to communicate
since an accident during naval exercises last weekend forced them
to shut down the reactor, sending the craft to the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The drama in the Barents Sea took on a increasingly grim cast
Tuesday as Admiral Kuroyedov confirmed that the first two
compartments of the submarine had been flooded at the outset by
what appeared to have been an explosion on board. Normally, 60
percent of the crew and most of the commanders on Oscar-2 class
submarines like the Kursk are in these two compartments, although
naval officials said they still do not know whether there had been
any casualties on board.
</P>
<P>
   A navy spokesman said one rescue attempt had failed once because
of a 30-knot winds and 12-foot waves on the surface. The storm,
typical August weather far above the Arctic circle in the Barents
Sea, hampered efforts to lower a rescue capsule to make contact
with the hatch of the stricken sub.
</P>
<P>
   Navy analysts said the most difficult task, maneuvering the
capsule to latch on to one of the submarine's cargo hatches, was
complicated further by strong currents on the sea floor and the
position of the Kursk, which is resting on the bottom at a 60
degree angle. That caused the capsule to slide off as soon as it
made contact.
</P>
<P>
   As the weather improved slightly, the capsule was lowered again
late Tuesday, but Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said there was no word
on whether the attempt had been any more successful. It it failed,
Kuroyedov said, the backup plan was to try to lift the crippled
vessel to the surface by strapping 400-ton pontoons to both sides
and inflating them under water with highly pressurized air.
</P>
<P>
   The race to save the 107-man crew, along with nine senior
officers of Russia's Northern Fleet who were on board to observe
the exercises, became all the more desperate when the Russian navy
disclosed that the accident had occurred Saturday, not Sunday, as
officials had earlier reported.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency air supply on the Kursk is designed to last for
five days, meaning that in the best case scenario _ assuming that
no air escaped during the as yet unexplained explosion that caused
the accident _ the supply would run out Wednesday. However, Admiral
Kuroyedov said he did not expect the air to run out until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the crew's woes is the likelihood that the backup
system that purifies the air on the vessel in an emergency has most
likely stopped functioning, said one former submarine captain who
has been following the submarine drama. The rising carbon dioxide
level from the crew's own exhalations would make it harder for the
men on board to help rescuers _ if they are able to successfully
complete the tricky docking maneuver with the submarine _ to open
hatches and prepare themselves for the grueling ascent, which takes
up to seven hours to avoid decompression sickness, or ``the
bends.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the attempt is successful, it would not be possible to
rescue the entire crew. The rescue capsule Russia is using can only
carry up to 20 crew members at a time.
</P>
<P>
   This led the former submarine captain, who spoke on condition he
not be identified, to suggest that at least some of the crew would
not make it _ assuming that none had died in the explosion or
during the subsequent flooding of the two compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the survivors, he said, would probably have been in the
aft of the submarine, although some may be trapped in the fifth
compartment in the middle of the vessel. Reaching them from the
stern would mean going through the compartment which holds the
Kursk's two reactors. Although they have been shut down, the former
captain said, the reactors are probably not being cooled, since the
pumps that do this have most likely been damaged, meaning that
temperatures in the compartment could be higher than 170 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the nose of the submarine, sending it crashing to
the sea bottom, Admiral Kuroyedov said. Earlier he had said that
the Kursk had collided with something.
</P>
<P>
   Russian state television showed Kuroyedov pointing out damage to
the bow of the craft on a diagram that showed a torpedo hatch wide
open on the starboard, or right, side and damage to the sail, or
conning tower, that rises out of the rounded hull. The illustration
also showed bits of the vessel were scattered on the sea floor
outside the port side. Other naval officials said it appeared that
water was getting into the sub.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion inside the torpedo chamber, which contains
conventional warheads, would probably have caused extensive
casualties in the nearby main compartment and the command center,
analysts said. But officials were giving little firm information
about the cause of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will know when they get at least one survivor up to the
surface,'' the former captain said.
</P>
<P>
   As the navy briefed relatives of the men on the stricken boat
behind closed doors at a naval base in Murmansk, the head of the
Russian Orthodox Church, Patriach Alexy, called for prayers for the
crew at a service in Moscow. In Kursk, the southern Russian city
which gave the submarine its name and has proudly sent dozens of
draftees to serve on the vessel, NTV television showed anxious
relatives waiting for news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to hope this terrible nightmare will end,'' said
Valentina Staroseltseva, who said her son was on the distressed
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of eight giant aircraft-carrier destroying
Oscar-2 class submarines in the Russian fleet, was commissioned
only five years ago and is considered the pinnacle of Russian
submarine technology. Over the past decade, Russia's once mighty
nuclear submarine fleet has deteriorated with neglect as the
military budget was slashed, but many naval specialists expressed
surprise that this particular boat sank the way it did.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Arkady Yefanov, who commanded another Oscar-2 submarine
from 1987 to 1993, told NTV television that the Kursk was designed
to float to the surface in the event of an accident, even after
sustaining a hit from a torpedo. He said it was odd that the Kursk
went to the bottom and that it failed to launch its own rescue
capsule, which is capable of taking up to 130 men to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The chief designer of the submarine, Igor Baranov, was quoted by
Russian news agencies as saying ``something extraordinary beyond
the imagination of an engineer'' must have happened to the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of Russia's parliament, Gennady Seleznyov, called on
the military to seek assistance from abroad, but Moscow has so far
declined offers of help from the United States and Britain. Both
countries have miniature submarines that are designed to rescue
crew members from sunken subs. Kuroyedov said a group of naval
officers would go to NATO headquarters in Brussels Wednesday to see
what help the alliance could offer.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to the
environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the reactor
that powers it had been shut down. In Norway, which closely
monitors Russian submarines operating off its coastal waters in the
Barents, said there was no sign of a radiation leak. Russian
officials said that the main worry now was saving the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to absolutely find out the situation on board,''
Dygalo, the navy spokesman, said.

<P>
   Durk I. Jager lasted 17 months at the helm of Procter &AMP; Gamble,
resigning last month after the shortest tenure of any chief
executive in the company's 163-year history. The board of Mattel
asked for the resignation of the company's leader, Jill E. Barad,
this year after only three years. M. Douglas Ivester, after years
of being groomed for Coca-Cola's top job, quit in February after
two years in it.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence seems compelling that CEOs at America's largest
companies have less staying power than they did just a few years
ago. The stock market is far more volatile than it used to be,
management experts say, and directors punish poor results swiftly.
But a new study suggests that CEO tenure, at least at the nation's
largest companies, has not become shorter, but has actually
lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Between the beginning of 1995 and the start of 2000, the average
tenure of leaders at 65 large companies rose one year, to 8.3
years, according to research by SCA Consulting, a New York
management consulting firm. Looked at another way, half the chief
executives in 1995 served more than six years, half less. In 2000,
the median length of service is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study have left corporate governance experts
puzzled. ``It's definitely counterintuitive,'' said Michael Useem,
director of the Center for Leadership and Change at the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Donald P. Jacobs, dean of the Kellogg Graduate School of
Management at Northwestern, agreed. ``I would have said it would be
exactly the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The possible reasons for lengthened tenure are many, management
analysts said. The expanding pay packages of chief executives,
heavily weighted toward stock options, play a role in keeping them
in their current jobs, according to a separate recent study. The
bull market, particularly among blue-chip companies, has left
investors and board members satisfied at many companies. And boards
seem to spend more time planning succession than they once did; as
a result, many end up choosing better candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could draw a lot of conclusions'' from the research, said
Russell H. Miller, an SCA partner. ``But it probably asks more
questions than it answers.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear from the results is that turnover among chief
executives at the best-known companies has changed less in recent
years than many executives, recruiters, analysts and journalists
have suggested. One reason for this, Miller said, is that, even in
a booming economy in which job-hopping among sought-after managers
seems rife, very few jobs can match the pay, power and prestige
that come with the CEO spot at a major company. Of course, that
bond is weaker at many smaller companies, and some management
experts said they thought turnover had risen at a broad
cross-section of American companies the last few years. Other
research also suggests that turnover has become more common
recently. For instance, two of three large companies around the
world have installed a new chief executive since 1995, and almost
half have made a change the last three years, according to Drake
Beam Morin, the placement firm, which looked at 476 companies in 25
countries. Many of those changes, however, were the result of
mergers, a phenomenon that says little about the behavior of
executives and directors. Companies that have merged were excluded
from SCA's study, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, another job placement company, Challenger
Gray &AMP; Christmas, has counted news reports of chief executives'
departures from American companies of all sizes. The average
monthly number has been 65, which most analysts said was probably
significantly higher than it would have been in previous decades.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that changes the central conclusion of SCA's
research: turnover did not rise in the corner office of America's
largest companies in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defining management trends the last decade has been
the gravity-defying increase in executive pay. A decade ago, chief
executives of the 200 largest companies in the United States made
an average of $2.8 million a year, according to a survey by Pearl
Meyer &AMP; Partners, a pay consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, that number had more than tripled, to $9.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The power behind the pay explosion is stock options. By 1999,
they accounted for more than half of the pay packages, or about $5
million, up from $720,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The packages are working to retain people,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one future development that would almost certainly put
chief executives in danger: a tepid stock market. In the 1990s, the
great majority of stocks rose in value. Large companies did even
better than the market as a whole. And rising share prices tend to
obscure conflicts between executives and board members that can
cause a resignation or firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excellent performance of the stock market has camouflaged
a lot of poor leadership among chief executives,'' said Jeffrey E.
Christian, the chairman of Christian &AMP; Timbers, a search firm in
Cleveland. ``My sense is that we are going to see a new period of
boards becoming more critical of their CEOs.''

 &HT;    LABOR LEADERS HERE EMPHASIZE AGREEMENTS WITH GORE
 &HT;    By WILLIAM HERSHEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When President Clinton passed the Democratic torch
to Al Gore in Michigan on Tuesday, Clinton went out of his way to
praise a labor leader who until last week was anything but a
Clinton-Gore pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank Steve Yokich and the UAW for being here,'' said
Clinton, singling out the president of the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question for Gore as he arrives here Wednesday to
claim the presidential nomination is whether Yokich, the UAW and
the rest of the nation's nearly 16.5 million union members will be
with him on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 4,368 delegates to the Democratic
National Convention are union members.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., his running mate, are
counting on union members for grass-roots help in getting out the
vote this fall, particularly in battleground states such as Ohio
and Michigan with big union memberships.
</P>
<P>
   There has been virtually no mention here at the Democratic
National Convention of the issue that has cooled relations between
labor and the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Labor opposes normalizing trade relations with China, but
Clinton and Gore won House approval in May of a bill to do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The China vote was terrible,'' said William Burga, president
of the AFL-CIO in Ohio, where there are about 1 million union
members. Burga is a convention delegate.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard Trumka, the sometimes fiery national AFL-CIO
secretary treasurer, spoke to the convention Tuesday, he didn't
mention trade but gushed about the ties that bind Gore and American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats know and Al Gore knows working people are the engine
that propels the American economy,'' Trumka said
</P>
<P>
   The national AFL-CIO endorsed Gore for president last October,
contending that the issues they agreed on far outweighed their
disagreement over trade.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW withheld its endorsement until last week, and even
flirted with the idea of backing consumer advocate Ralph Nader,
who's running under the Green Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Burga, the Ohio AFL-CIO president, said his greatest fear is not
that union members will back George W. Bush but that they will sit
out the election, as many of them did in 1994 when Rep

 &HT;    RUSSIANS ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE SUB CREW

media reports.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official told the Associated Press that Russian officers
came to NATO headquarters from the Russian Embassy in Brussels at
about 7:30 p.m. (local time) and spoke via teleconference with
alliance naval experts in Northwood, England, headquarters of
NATO's naval command for the Eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians wanted to know what kind of help the alliance could
provide. The Russians initiated the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides exchanged technical information for about 30
minutes during the conference. On the basis of this information,
Russia will decide whether to make an official request.
</P>
<P>
   The best immediate source of NATO help for the Russians would be
the Royal Navy submarine recovery team, a 20-member unit made up of
experts in submarine rescue and escape. That unit is under the
Eastern Atlantic naval command.
</P>
<P>
   The team's equipment is on the south coast of England and could
be ready to move in a matter of hours, said Paul Beaver of Jane's
Defense Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a sub that could be put in the back of a large
transport aircraft and flown to Murmansk in a matter of hours,''
Beaver said. ``They probably would get a commercial ship to meet
them there and could be r possibilities include the American
vessels Mystic and Avalon, which could be loaded on a C-5 transport
aircraft and arrive in about the same time-frame, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegians and the Germans also have extensive undersea
oilfield experience in the North Sea and could be of help, Beaver
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sent a letter
to Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev offering U.S. military
help in the rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this most troubling time,'' Cohen said, ``My department
stands ready to provide any assistance you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Weaver(CQ), a defense analyst for Sky News, said a request
for help has been expected for days, even though the Russians
historically have been deeply reluctant to work closely with NATO.
``After all, the British and the American navies are both experts
at submarine rescue, and, unlike the Russians, they have
professional crews and professional people who are trained for
submarine rescues.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has two Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles that
can conduct rescue operations in depths of up to 2,000 feet and
evacuate up to 24 crewmembers at a time. Britain has put a similar
deep search and rescue submarine on standby.
</P>
<P>
   If a request is officially made Wednesday, Weaver estimated that
rescue crews from NATO nations could be at the site by early
Thursday, providing teams enough time to save the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have been careful not to raise hopes too far.
The undersea evacuation is a complex maneuver made far more
difficult by the violent weather in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian rescue teams Tuesday night launched a second attempt
to reach the submarine with a capsule capable of bringing men to
the surface in groups of about 15. The crewmembers would enter the
capsule from the submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was still unclear. Igor Baranov, the
submarine's chief designer, suggested that something catastrophic
must have happened. ``Something extraordinary beyond the
imagination of an engineer,'' Baranov told the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said there might have been an explosion in the torpedo
compartment in the submarine's nose, sending it crashing to the sea
bottom. An explosion inside the torpedo chamber, which contains
warheads, would probably have caused extensive casualties, analysts
said. Navy officials said casualties could not be ``ruled out,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Several compartments inside the submarine were flooded,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines are divided into compartments that can be sealed off
in case of flooding. It may be impossible to operate the submarine
if several compartments, including the control center, are flooded.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Russia's Northern Fleet described the
difficulties of the rescue in a telephone interview with Reuters.
``The ships are being blown off their anchors,'' the spokesman
said. ``It is difficult for the ships to hold their course. All the
ships and the capsule should be directed at a certain angle to
ensure less resistance to the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storms have calmed down somewhat, although waves are still
high. But the current is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine is tilted on the seabed, with its bow pointing
down, and also listing sharply to one side. As a result, the
capsules and other devices are sliding off the vessel's hull, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroyedov said rescuers were driven by fear for the sailors'
lives. ``Our lack of knowledge about the fate of the crew has
marked all our work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. submarines close to the Kursk heard a blast late
Saturday or early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk, one of eight giant Oscar-2 class submarines in the
Russian fleet, was commissioned only five years ago and represents
the height of Russia's nuclear submarine technology.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said the stricken submarine poses no threat to the
environment, as it was carrying no nuclear weapons and the reactor
that powers its engines had been shut down. Officials in Norway
said there was no sign of a radiation leak.

CENDANT'S MOVE TO RE - AQUIRE AVIS LEAVES THE MARKET UNIMPRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Silverman, the chief executive of the Cendant Corp., made
a bid Tuesday to regain control of the Avis Group Holdings Inc.,
the nation's second largest rental car company, at a price the
market immediately deemed too low.
</P>
<P>
   The bid marks his return to the acquisition trail following two
years of accounting problems that grew out of his biggest merger,
with CUC International.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman offered $29 a share or a nearly 14 percent premium
over Avis' previous-day closing price, but investors bid up the
shares of Avis $5 to $30.50, their highest point in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was, in the words of Robert P. Napoli of ABN
Amro a ``ridiculously low'' bid for a leader in an extremely
undervalued industry. Before the offer, Napoli said he had expected
Avis shares to be trading at $52 a year in 12 to 18 months; Jeffrey
A. Diamond of Credit Suisse First Boston had a target price of $43.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole sector is under appreciated,'' said David Riedel of
Salomon Smith Barney. ``It's trading at 6.5 times next year's
earnings compared with 28 times earnings for the S&AMP;P index as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Faulhaber, a spokesman for Avis, of Garden City, N.Y.,
said the board would be meeting in the ``next day or so to
consider'' the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would bring back control over Avis to
Silverman after a four-year hiatus. Through a predecessor of
Cendant, HFS, he took over Avis in 1996, then spun it off as a
separate company a year later. But Silverman's organization
retained a stake of 18 percent and the Avis brand for which it
receives 4 percent of the rental car company's annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman's latest overture, Riedel said, could well serve as a
catalyst for higher share prices for the whole car rental business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very misunderstood business,'' said Diamond of First
Boston. ``The market thinks of it as highly cyclical like the
airlines and lodging.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other analysts said Avis and the other big car rental
companies like Hertz, the industry leader, National and the
Dollar-Thrifty Group have developed considerable flexibility that
should help them through an economic downturn since the days when
many of them were operated as subsidiaries of the big car
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Avis and the others, the analysts said, have deals that permit
them to return cars to the manufacturers without penalty when
business slows down and they have implemented computer programs,
similar to those used by the airlines, that enable them to shift
cars and prices to different locations according to demand.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, Riedel said, annual revenue growth
for the industry leaders has averaged 17 percent; net income has
been growing at 40 percent and return on equity has jumped to 18
percent from 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strong, profitable industry,'' Riedel said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman built an empire of well-known franchise companies like
Holiday Inn and Century 21 real estate through a series of
acquisitions. He joined his company, HFS Inc., with CUC
International, an online telephone and shopping services company,
to form Cendant in late 1997. A few months later, on April 15,
1998, Cendant announced the discovery of widespread accounting
irregularities in CUC units.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cendant has agreed to a $2.8 million settlement with
shareholders and three former CUC executives have pleaded guilty to
inflating profits to keep share prices high.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman suggested last month that the worst was past and that
he was on the hunt for acquisitions to inject new vigor into
Cendant. The Avis bid is his first move.

START-UP TO OFFER SOFTWARE FOR RECORDING RADIO BROADCASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's more fuel for the raging debate over free music:
</P>
<P>
   Gotuit Media Inc., an Andover, Mass. start-up with high-profile
backers, is raising money to launch its SongCatcher software, which
lets users record songs from their favorite radio stations directly
to their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gotuit announced its angel round of venture capital Tuesday:
$2.1 million from a group that includes Berkshires entrepreneur Bo
Peabody. Gotuit was founded a year ago by Jim Logan, former chief
executive of MicroTouch Systems Inc., a $150 million touch-screen
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said his company is not following in the controversial
footsteps of Napster Inc., which lets users download and share
music files over the Internet _ a practice the record industry
calls stealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a copyright perspective, we feel we're on pretty solid
ground here,'' Logan said. After all, people have been able to tape
songs from the radio and programs from television for years.
</P>
<P>
   Gotuit's software works like a stereo or a VCR and is meant to
create a kind of personal jukebox.
</P>
<P>
   Music lovers can plug a home radio into a PC's audio or
microphone jack to record music. The SongCatcher software,
available free on the Web, periodically fetches data from Gotuit to
identify the songs and artists and indexes the material.
</P>
<P>
   The recorded songs are delivered to the users e-mailbox and can
be deleted or saved easily, the company said. There is a
``NeverAgain'' button, so listeners can request that a certain song
or artist never be recorded in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sutin, a lawyer in New York who is with the law firm
Greenberg Traurig, said Gotuit will avoid the Napster problem as
long as users record songs for personal use only. Sharing music
files is the practice that has angered the record companies and
many artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all they're doing is making (songs) available for
time-shifting and personal use, then it appears that it's probably
legal,'' Sutin said. But if there's file-sharing in the plans, he
added, ``They can expect to have trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotuit has hired Mark Fischer as its lawyer. He is an expert on
recording-industry law at the Boston law firm Palmer &AMP; Dodge and
has been widely quoted on the Napster battle.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, Gotuit says it plans to offer a service that
lets users download their radio recordings to portable players.
</P>
<P>
   Logan calls SongCatcher ``artist friendly'' and says users can
click a button to purchase CDs when they hear songs they like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this might open up music to audiences that don't have
time to listen to the radio,'' he said, particularly
thirtysomethings who may be losing touch with new bands.
</P>
<P>
   Gotuit is also tackling the TV market with its software. It's
rolling out the same indexing capability for television that it's
introducing for radio, so that viewers can scan through recordings
on a set-top box to find the shows they want to see and delete the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board includes a slew of industry experts, among
them Harvard Law School professor Terry Fisher; Quantum Corp.
cofounder Joel Harrison; and Brian Zisk of iCast, who is also
cofounder of Green Witch Internet Radio.

 &HT;    PROTESTERS, POLICE TRADE CHARGES AFTER CLASH
 &HT;    By MIKE WAGNER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ricky Manuel pointed to the three-inch cut above
his eye and glared across the street at two police officers
patrolling outside the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cops hadn't charged into the crowd with their guns,
rubber bullets and horses, none of that stuff would have
happened,'' said Manuel, a 24-year-old protester from New York
City. ``Everything was cool, and then all hell broke lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Guay, one of the officers in Manuel's view, shook his head
in disagreement at the accusation that police acted too quickly
when a Monday night demonstration turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were throwing large rocks, bottles, signs and setting
things on fire,'' said Guay, a Los Angeles officer for seven years.
``It's easy to blame us when something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute clash between protesters and police continued to
be a hot issue Tuesday for many people at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was a day of peaceful demonstrations for more than 8,000
protesters until the melee erupted just as President Clinton took
the podium for his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-authoritarian Los Angeles band Rage Against the Machine
had just concluded its concert outside Staples Center when several
demonstrators climbed the 12-foot fence keeping them away from the
convention facility.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they told the crowd it had 15 minutes to disperse,
and after two more warnings began moving in.
</P>
<P>
   Officers, some on horseback, used pepper spray and rubber
bullets to disperse the crowd. Some of the 300 protesters responded
by throwing pylons, cans, bottles, asphalt and a
handicapped-parking sign. Other signs were set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   At least four people were hurt, none seriously. Most convention
delegates were kept inside the Staples Center until the protesters
were cleared away and there was no threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Video taken by an amateur photographer, aired on local
television, captured one incident where several officers charged
one man who didn't appear to be a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were already walking away when the police came
rushing in. It was ridiculous,'' said Marie Hammonds, a 34-year-old
demonstrator from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police officials didn't comment on the video, but
defended the actions of their officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of the crowd inside the area became very
violent,'' said Cmdr. David Kalish, spokesman for the Los Angeles
Police Department. ``It became necessary for our officers to move
in.''
</P>
<P>
   A few people who found themselves in the middle of the protest
after leaving the convention also defended the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was out of control when we were walking by, and when
they're acting like that, the police had do something,'' said
Audrey Love, a 60-year-old delegate from West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators earlier this month also protested at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, but police were
able to set up barriers at least a mile from the convention. In Los
Angeles, the area designated for protesters is about 50 feet from
the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials tried to keep the protesters farther away,
but lost a battle in court.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge blocked police from making any preconvention raids
on the demonstrators' headquarters to seize protest materials. The
American Civil Liberties Union, accusing police of harassing
demonstrators, had sought the court order.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the brief clash, the convention demonstration was a far
cry from other high-profile riots, such as the anti-globalization
protests at the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle last
year. In that demonstration, protesters went on a rampage on city
streets and caught unprepared police by surprise. No one was
killed, but scores were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles demonstrators represent a diverse collection of
causes and political stripes. Many are protesting corporate
globalization, the death penalty, the and treatment of the
homeless. One small group was even calling for an end to women
breast-feeding their children, saying it was ``immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon's demonstrations were calm, and included fewer
than 100 protestors for most of the day. But police say more
violence is possible Wednesday at a large demonstration against
``police brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it stays peaceful, but that one could be a lot worse
than what's happened so far,'' Guay said.
</P>

LOBBYISTS HEDGE THEIR BETS BY SUPPORTING BOTH PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Tuesday night, the lobbying firm Patton Boggs
hosted a cocktail hour and supper buffet at the Sunset Room in
Hollywood. Not much of a surprise: The firm's chairman, Thomas H.
Boggs Jr., is the son of the legendary Democratic congressional
leader, Hale Boggs of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Republican convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago,
Patton Boggs also had a very visible presence, sending a dozen
partners and associates _ all recently hired Republican lobbyists.
The firm hosted two lavish receptions in Philadelphia, including a
party honoring the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the same lobbyists who helped underwrite the Republican
convention are out in force in Los Angeles. With close races
anticipated for the White House and control of the House of
Representatives, the brigades from Washington's K Street, the
corridor filled with capital lobbyists and lawyers, are being more
careful than ever to cover both party bases with their largess.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyists' active schedules at both conventions represent a
growing trend of ``pragmatic political donors'' who aggressively
court both parties to insure they will have access and influence no
matter who emerges victorious in November. The urgency of such a
strategy is even greater this year, as lobbyists confront the
possibility that new parties will take control of both the White
House and Congress next January.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic firms first hurried to hire well-connected
Republicans shortly after Republicans won control of the Congress
in 1994. This year, however, lobbyists say they have noticed that
the city's largest firms are working hard to have a large presence
at both national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly an advantage when approaching possible
clients to have a political bookend to my Democratic
affiliations,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a Patton Boggs partner who
worked as a special counsel in the Clinton White House. Just
recently, Davis said a new client was pleased that he and a
Republican colleague _ Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a firm lobbyist and
the counsel to Gov. George W. Bush's campaign _ would work together
on a legislative issue.
</P>
<P>
   Patton Boggs has company among powerhouse lobbying firms who
have invested heavily in both national conventions to ensure
continued access to party leaders and to court and impress clients
with their bipartisan clout. Two other predominantly Democratic
lobbying and law firms _ Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, which
hosted a brunch at the Bevery Hills Hotel on Tuesday in honor of
the firm's founder and former Democratic Party chairman Robert
Strauss, and Verner, Liipfert, Bernard, McPherson &AMP; Hand _ are also
sponsoring receptions here, as they did in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Verner Liipfert gave a late-night party for
the Democratic National Committee at the Mondrian Hotel's Sky Bar
on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. Two weeks ago, in
Philadelphia, the firm sponsored a tribute to former Sen. Bob Dole
and Elizabeth Dole. Dole, the Republicans' 1996 presidential
nominee, is special counsel at Verner Liipfert.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's bipartisan roster of senior partners includes former
Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and George Mitchell and former Govs. James J.
Blanchard of Michigan and Ann W. Richards of Texas, all Democrats.
It also includesformer Sen. Daniel R. Coats and Leonard Garment,
the former White House counsel in the Nixon administration,both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beverly Hills Hotel on Tuesday, a veritable who's who of
the Democratic establishment turned out for a brunch of bagels and
fresh fruit in honor of Robert Strauss, who built both the
Democratic Party and Akin, Gump into financial powerhouses. Milling
around a large reception room were an assortment of Democratic
pols, including the Senate minority leader, Thomas Daschle, Sen.
John Edwards, former Democratic National Committee co-chairman
Donald Fowler and former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, a squad of Republican lawyers and lobbyists
hired in the past few years by Akin, Gump, led by former Rep. Bill
Paxon and Frank J. Donatelli, a longtime Republican political
operative, co-sponsored receptions for Republicans with their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   David Geanacopoulos, a lobbyist in Akin, Gump's Washington
office, said the bipartisan effort is a growing trend at most big
firms. ``Clients want to know that you have both Democrats and
Republicans who can help them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patton Boggs, a firm with deep Democratic connections, has been
especially aggressive in attempting to transform itself into a
bipartisan lobbying shop. Besides Ginsberg, the firm also hired
Brian C. Lopina, the firmer director of governmental affairs for
the Christian Coalition; Darryl D. Nirenberg, the fomrer chief of
staff to Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina; and Edward J.
Newberry, who worked for seven years for Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Partners and associates at the three lobbying firms have
increased the level of their political giving to Republicans in
this election cycle, which began in January 1999. The political
action committee for Akin Gump, has even given 54 percent of its
$296,000 in donations to Republicans. Verner Liipfert's political
action committee gave 55 percent of its $161,000 in donations to
Democrats. Patton Boggs does not have a political action committee
but its members have given $390,000 in campaign contributions this
election cycle, 63 percent to Democrats, 36 per cent to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lobbyists are also bulking up their Democratic
credentials. The United States Chamber of Commerce, the nation's
largest business lobby, reflects the trend toward ambidextrous
convention entertaining. In 1996, the Chamber sent its top
officials to the GOP convention in San Diego; it did not
participate at all in that year's Democratic gathering in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Chamber has sponsored parties at both
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place for us to be,'' said Thomas J. Donohue,
the Chamber's president. ``My contention is when all the interest
groups and business leaders and media have moved out here, I'd be a
damn fool if I didn't bring my assets to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Washington's lobbying firms are becoming bipartisan.
Some are fiercely partisan, like Barbour Griffth &AMP; Rogers, a
Republican firm whose leaders brag that they do not give a single
dollar to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works for us,'' said Ed Rogers, one of the firm's partners.
``We have made the conscious decision to be that way and make a
virtue out of it. When we are on the hill or dealing with an
elected official, we want them to know there is not someone down
the hall from us committed to removing them from office.''

   KIPP Academy, a pair of public middle schools in poor sections
of Houston and the South Bronx, requires 70 percent more class time
than its counterparts _including Saturday and summer sessions. Its
black and Hispanic students consistently get top scores on
standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   As the national political debate focuses on the agonizing
question of how to raise achievement among poor and minority
children, KIPP, founded five years ago by a pair of young Ivy
Leaguers, has drawn keen attention from left and right, idealistic
do-gooders and entrepreneurial free-marketeers. Honored last year
by the liberal Children's Defense Fund, the school was highlighted
last month at the Republican National Convention, where its star
pupils were on stage, rapping, ``Read, baby, read.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an unprecedented effort to turn a boutique beacon into a
system of success, Donald G. Fisher and Doris Fisher, the owners of
The Gap clothing chain _ who know something about building a
franchise _ have given $15 million in seed money to create a
network of hundreds of KIPP clones across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual demonstrates the possible,'' said Scott Hamilton,
director of the new KIPP Foundation, which will train teachers to
open charter schools in KIPP's image. ``If you can replicate the
success of KIPP at a bunch of places _ and eventually on a scale
that cannot be dismissed by lots of excuse-making _ do you end up
forcing change on the larger system? Our hope is the answer's
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful schools for the poor have long been written off as
random wildflowers in the educational desert that dominates their
neighborhoods _ mirages or miracles, but dubious prospects for
portability. Their outstanding results were chalked up to the local
context, support from private donors or, most often, the particular
brilliance of a dynamic leader.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of KIPP _ which stands for Knowledge is Power
Program _ is the most ambitious and intriguing of a host of new
replication projects spawned by the growing practice of holding
schools accountable for student achievement. Fueled by the freedom
offered by charter schools, which receive public funds but are run
independently, this trend could change the educational landscape
from one defined by districts and states to one divided more by
curriculum and style.
</P>
<P>
   Edison Schools, the for-profit company started by Christopher
Whittle, will soon have 108 campuses in 21 states, each copying a
carefully detailed program. Whole-school reforms like Success For
All, which sell packaged curriculums across grades, have become a
huge growth industry. There are also looser networks, like E.D.
Hirsch's ``core knowledge'' schools and Theodore R. Sizer's
coalition of ``essential schools,'' linked by a broad set of
educational values. And Teacher's College at Columbia University
has joined with Replications Inc. to copy KIPP and other excellent
schools in New York on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got brand-name everything elses,'' observed Chester E.
Finn Jr., an education analyst at the Manhattan Institute, a
conservative advocacy group. ``Now we have Comer schools and Hirsch
schools, and we're going to have KIPP schools and Edison schools _
you're going to be able to move into a new city and say, `Show me
the local Hirsch school.' That's not a bad idea for a modern mobile
society.''
</P>
<P>
   KIPP's ambitious project is unique for its focus on school
leadership, a concept that has grown in importance as education has
become infused with business principles. Taking a page from the
corporate world, the foundation created a year-long training
program that began this summer for the first four KIPP fellows with
an intensive six-week seminar at the University of California,
Berkeley, business school. This fall, the fellows will immerse
themselves in KIPP culture during eight-week ``residencies'' at
each campus. By January, they will be ensconced in Atlanta,
Houston, Washington, D.C., and rural North Carolina, working full
time to set up their schools, which are scheduled to open with 75
fifth-graders each next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating hundreds of new schools _ the fellowship
is slated to grow to 12 people next year, then 25, 50, 75, 100 and
150 _ the KIPP Foundation will search for existing schools that
share a similar philosophy. To remain in the network _ which will
bring financial support, technical assistance, camaraderie and
annual $25,000 bonuses for high performance _ schools will be
evaluated every four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's intriguing about it is that they are focusing on issues
of culture, the values and norms and beliefs about children's
capacities to learn and adults' capacities to teach,'' said Richard
F. Elmore, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
``That's where most of the so-called replication efforts fail; they
go after instructional practice or they go after organization but
they never go after culture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   KIPP grew out of a marathon 12-hour conversation about the
problems plaguing public education between Michael Feinberg and
David Levin as they drove a gray Ford Taurus from Los Angeles to
Houston in the summer of 1992. They were new recruits of Teach for
America, the national program that places college graduates in
impoverished schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, frustrated by the limitations of their
classrooms but inspired by a Los Angeles teacher, Rafe Esquith, the
pair persuaded the Houston district to let them stretch class from
7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. They recruited 50 fifth-graders, printed
T-shirts, and taped Esquith's motto, ``There are no shortcuts,''
over the door.
</P>
<P>
   Today, KIPP-New York outperforms all other Bronx middle schools
on New York's standardized tests, and 98 percent of the students at
KIPP-Houston pass all sections of Texas' state exams. Eighth-grade
graduates have earned $5 million in scholarships to the nation's
top private high schools over the past two years; students continue
to earn good grades in their new schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing these guys do,  &UR; nothing  &LR; that they do, is beyond the
reach of every school in the country, period,'' said Samuel Casey
Carter, who highlighted both KIPPs in a report on successful
schools for the conservative Heritage Foundation, and is helping
write a KIPP ``users guide'' for the new network schools. ``This is
not rocket science, this is very, very simple stuff, but it's
monitored and it's managed and it's continually improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Both KIPPs are marked by militaristic discipline and rituals,
children chanting ditties written by Levin's mentor, Harriett Ball,
a Houston teacher. (``How do you make good grades? We bring our
tools and follow the rules. It might sound square, but we're going
somewhere.'') After more than nine hours in class, students get two
hours of homework each night, which parents must sign. The schools
are focused on instruction, and instruction is focused on basic
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Students, teachers and parents all sign contracts pledging to do
their best. In Houston, children who misbehave must turn their KIPP
T-shirts inside out and speak only to teachers. In New York,
missteps and plaudits are carefully chronicled on weekly paychecks,
redeemable at the school store.
</P>
<P>
   The KIPP network will not mandate that its members mimic this
model. But every school must share the six ``pillars'': high
expectations, enrollment by choice, a principal who controls the
budget and hiring, an extended school day and year, rewards and
consequences for student and staff achievement, and outstanding
academic results. For now, the schools will not carry the KIPP
name, a brand the founders are wary of watering down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the smell of the place to be the same,'' said
Feinberg, a mix of drill sergeant and Little League coach who
stands 6-foot-4 and shaves his head. ``They'll look like cousins.
They're not twins, but they're all related.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is up to the school leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Though the foundation hopes to make its fellowship competitive
and prestigious, this year's class was selected in a hurry, largely
through word of mouth. Three of the fellows, like KIPP's founders,
are Teach for America alumni. The fourth is Derrick Lockwood, a
nondenominational minister and 15-year veteran of private and
public schools in Atlanta, where Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia hopes
to open as many as 10 KIPP academies. The fellows receive a $45,000
stipend, plus the Berkeley boot camp _ which cost $250,000 _ and a
$1 million facilities loan for their schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, literally, an opportunity that fell out of the sky,''
said Caleb Dolan, 25, who plans to open his school in Gaston, N.C.,
a tiny town near the Virginia border where he has been teaching
sixth grade since 1996. ``We came home from school one day and
there was a message on the machine that said, `Would you like to
run a charter school?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been my pipe dream,'' Dolan added. ``It's been my
late-night conversation for about three years now: If we ran the
school, if we ran the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they will. But first, there are classes in instructional
leadership, operations management, recruitment, accounting,
negotiations, even media training.
</P>
<P>
   Seated around a classroom festooned with KIPP's signature
aphorisms (``Work hard, be nice,'' ``Quality, not quantity is our
measure''), the fellows click away at their laptops, plotting
budgets, then role-play performance appraisals. Feinberg, who is
stepping down as director of KIPP-Houston to become chief executive
officer of the foundation, offers anecdotes from his own
experience, like how often to expect federal reimbursement for
subsidized lunches.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, the fellows were creating ``accountability
plans,'' breaking each part of their future schools' missions into
specific goals with assessment measures attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you write  &UR; all  &LR; students, or just students?'' asked Daniel
Caesar, 27, a KIPP teacher who hopes to open a second campus in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have `students,''' offered Susan Schaeffler, 30, who
plans to run the school in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All,'' insisted Dolan, ``it has to be all.''
</P>
<P>
   Finlay McQuade, an educational consultant who flew out from
Massachusetts to run the sessions on instruction, agreed, noting
the motto posted on the wall overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all students  &UR; will  &LR; learn, not all students can learn,''
McQuade said. Then, he added, ``These are goals, not necessarily
realities.''

COMMENTARY: STILL A BABY BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's economic miracle _ which Bill Clinton claimed as
vindication in his Monday speech, but George W. Bush insists was an
act of God _ didn't begin when Clinton took office in 1993. And no,
it didn't begin with Ronald Reagan either. In fact, it didn't
really start until 1996 or so. In other words, this boom is still
in its infancy; and like all infants, it remains vulnerable.
Clinton's greatest achievement is that during his second term he
avoided the fiscal irresponsibility that might have strangled our
``new economy'' at birth _irresponsibility that his opponent in the
1996 election would have practiced. Will his successor emulate his
example? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton prefers to think that everything good that
happened these past eight years was his own doing. You can see why:
Republicans confidently predicted that his 1993 tax increase would
produce disaster _ a recession, an even worse budget deficit. So
Clinton has an understandable urge to crow over the fact that even
in his first term things turned out pretty well.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking analysis here, not poetic justice; and the
truth is that growth from 1992 to 1996 _ like growth from 1982 to
1989 _ was just an ordinary business cycle recovery, with no sign
of an upturn in the economy's sluggish long-term trend. And
business cycles have very little to do with the administration that
happens to be in office; they are determined mainly by the actions
of the Federal Reserve, not the president. Jimmy Carter and George
Bush got blamed for the recessions that happened on their watches,
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton got credit for the recoveries that
happened on theirs; but neither the credit nor the blame was
deserved.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1996 _ even as the right was comparing Clinton's
recovery unfavorably with Reagan's _ that things really began to
change. Productivity, which had grown at a snail's pace for two
decades, began to accelerate _ and accelerate, and accelerate, with
recent numbers so high they take one's breath away. Unemployment
began falling to levels not seen since the inflationary years of
the late 1960s _ but this time without inflation. And from these
fundamentals many other good things flowed, from falling poverty
and plunging crime rates to a record budget surplus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did the Clinton-Gore administration create this miracle? Of
course not. The best guess is that a long process of technological
innovation finally reached critical mass, creating new
opportunities that American business was uniquely ready to exploit.
But the right question isn't whether the policies of this
administration gave birth to the new economy; it is whether
different leadership would have killed it. Not to put too fine a
point on it: What would have happened if Bob Dole had won? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been going back over Dole's economic program _ which,
remember, was centered on huge tax cuts _ and trying to calculate
what today's economy would look like if those tax cuts had been
enacted. One clear conclusion is that even if the economy had grown
as fast as it actually did, the federal budget _ certainly the
non-Social-Security budget, and probably the whole shebang _ would
still be in deficit. And it seems to me that our morale, not to
mention business confidence, would be a lot lower if that budget
were still out of control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the economy surely wouldn't have grown as fast as it
did. Our soaring productivity didn't come out of thin air; an
important, perhaps crucial ingredient was an amazing surge in
business investment, especially in information technology. And this
surge didn't have to happen. In a full-employment economy like that
of America in the late 1990s, budget deficits mean that the
government is borrowing money that would otherwise have been
invested. This drives up interest rates, depresses asset prices and
crimps business plans. Had Dole's tax cuts been enacted, the
resulting deficits would surely have crowded out a lot of
investment _ and quite possibly have crowded out the productivity
boom.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago America faced a choice between sober, sensible
fiscal discipline and huge, irresponsible tax cuts. We chose
discipline, and were rewarded with growth beyond our wildest
dreams. So why would anyone today propose exactly the kind of
irresponsibility we were lucky to avoid four years ago?

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT PROPOSES PLAN TO RESOLVE JERUSALEM DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In the face of seemingly intractable
separatist and sectarian conflicts of his own, President
Abdurrahman Wahid plunged into Middle East politics Tuesday,
offering a complicated formula he said could resolve the deadlock
over the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to break the ice,'' he told reporters,
referring to the collapse last month of Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks at Camp David. ``If they invite Indonesia to participate in
the discussions, that will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The overture was the latest surprise move by the unpredictable
president, coming in the middle of a fast-paced game of domestic
power politics in which he is battling a wide array of opponents in
a special parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
   He offered his power-sharing ideas after meeting in Jakarta on
Monday with former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel, an old
friend. Wahid plans to meet on Wednesday with the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, who is on a tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting his own analysis of the Camp David talks, Wahid said
the problem was that ``only one kind of sovereignty was discussed''
for Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim as
their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view we'd better differentiate between administrative
sovereignty, which will be in the hands of the Israelis, and
political sovereignty,'' which he said would be under control of a
seven-member committee.
</P>
<P>
   Such a committee, he said, would be made up of Egypt, Jordan,
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian entity and Israel as well as the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel had offered
the Palestinians limited control over Arab areas of East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War. But Arafat
demanded full sovereignty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since becoming president 10 months ago, Wahid has taken a
particular interest in foreign affairs _ which is not shared by
most people here _ traveling to 30 countries, sometimes on the spur
of the moment and without a clear agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under pressure from his opponents in Parliament, he
agreed to hand over some of his day-to-day duties to his vice
president, Megawati Sukarnoputri. He said this would free him to
concentrate more on foreign policy and suggested that Indonesia
could play a greater role in mediating international conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   His approach to Indonesia's own separatist and religious
conflicts, including recent violent episodes in the Maluku Islands,
has been one of mediation and conciliation rather than
confrontation. In some cases his efforts have had only limited
success; in others they have been disastrous failures.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation with 210
million people, has not played a significant role in the Middle
East in the past. It has never recognized Israel and has supported
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But Wahid, a moderate Muslim cleric, has a longstanding interest
in the Middle East and has called for normalizing relations with
Israel. He studied for a time in Egypt and for years has had a
friendly relationship with Peres.
</P>
<P>
   As one of his first acts as president, Wahid defied public
sentiment here by opening trade relations with Israel. Following
widespread criticism, he said formal diplomatic relations would
have to wait until the peace efforts with the Palestinians are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid signaled his intention to become involved in Middle
Eastern politics on Saturday, when he called for an end to the
trade embargo that was imposed on Iraq after the Persian Gulf war
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the blockade on Iraq lifted soon,'' he
said during a meeting with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
Chavez visited Jakarta after a trip to Baghdad, where he became the
first head of state since the end of the war to meet with the Iraqi
leader, Saddam Hussein.

CHARISMA IS ALL ON THE SURFACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   You didn't have to like Dick
Cheney to still wince at him being called boringly steady and
unexciting. Here, the guy agrees to run for vice president and
right away they call him white-bread and a grind. Like he'll never
make Prom King.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Both presidential candidates have been faulted for not being
exactly magnetic, which if you're only electing on personality,
makes it a race between Dull and Duller. But how important is it,
really, for a president, or for that matter, a mayor or city
councilwoman, to be irresistible?
</P>
<P>
   It's nice, of course, when that happens. It enlivens the budget
hearings. But haven't we got enough professionally cute and clever
people to allow a little blandness in our leaders?
</P>
<P>
   Government is not supposed to be full of cutups. Washington,
D.C., is not known as a fun place. Those people are there to do
serious work for us. We give them lots of power and money to keep
us out of nuclear war and ensure that all Americans get a fair
shake. They don't have to be TV personalities.
</P>
<P>
   We don't require other bureaucrats to charm us. You walk into
the post office and are lucky to get the clerk with the pony tail
who's always in a good mood. But if he never had stamps and your
package didn't make it to Denver, his smile wouldn't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   We don't need hip people running the country. We need good
people. Maybe it would be different if the White House really
worked like ``West Wing,'' the TV show where the staff is witty and
stylish, although Martin Sheen's president does get to be a bit of
a square.
</P>
<P>
   Serious and intense are probably good qualities for the
day-to-day running of a country. You imagine that some days the job
is so overwhelming a presidential head must ache over all the
things that need fixing, and couldn't come up with a witty line
even with Robin Williams whispering in its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Cute candidates are supposed to lure women to the voting booth,
as if all you need to get the girls is to have a straight nose and
nice hair. Give us a wink and we'll let you attack Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Bush tried that with Dan Quayle, foolishly thinking
his young good looks would turn fence-sitting women into Republican
groupies.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Republicans, if Cheney is a bad choice it should
have nothing to do with him being stuffy. It should be because he
thinks guns are no biggie and still believes that women shouldn't
control their own bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Personality contests get in the way of the real thing. Polls
show that only one in four Americans can articulate what the
candidates really stand for. But we know some voters don't like one
candidate's eyes and some don't like the other's wooden speech and
worry that neither squeezes out much charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Charisma is frosting. We've got three months to figure out
what's inside the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, charisma has its limits. Joe Eszterhas, who's written a
sleazy tale about the Clinton scandal, compares Clinton to a rock
star. He calls Clinton a dude, a lousy thing to say about a leader.

ALL ABOARD FOR A MUSEUM THAT ROLLS ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Okla, Tenn., Ga., Kan., Mich., Fla., Minn., Nev., Ill.,
Ind., Va., N.M., Pa., Calif.)   (For release Sunday, August 20)   By JONATHAN MANDELL  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Jeff Jewell, from Watertown, Tenn., (population
2,000), had never attended an art exhibition, and he had boarded a
train only once before in his life, when Artrain rolled into town.
When it left after a week, he left with it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two months and three towns later, he was helping to set up
here, along with the other members of Artrain's staff, who also got
hooked in their hometowns. Kim Kapalka, the tour manager, had
hopped aboard in Lawrence, Kan., leaving her job at a library.
</P>
<P>
   Since it began 29 years ago, Artrain USA, one of the oldest of
an increasing number of museums on wheels, has brought original
artworks by Picasso and Warhol, Calder and O'Keeffe, Rockwell and
Rauschenberg, to more than 600 towns and cities in 44 states. It
has gone to big cities like Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh and
Washington, but more often its destination isn't even a whistle
stop anymore _ places like Zeeland, Mich.; Plant City, Fla., and
Parkers Prairie, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``All a community needs is railroad tracks,'' Kapalka said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell's official title is facility technician, which means he
does the heavy lifting. His folks back home kid him that he's a
modern-day carny. ``It is like the circus,'' he admitted. ``Just
move along, set something up, then get going again.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky Schutt doesn't see it that way. ``I prefer the rock tour
analogy,'' she said. Schutt, from New Jersey, signed up for Artrain
while she was attending the University of Michigan and it was
resting in Ann Arbor, its home base. ``I tell my friends, `I'm on
tour,''' she said, ``so it sounds like I'm a rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   She is in the right town at the moment for such a fantasy;
Athens is best known as the college town that gave birth to the
rock bands REM and the B-52s, a place where young people go to
become rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athens has always been very, very supportive of people
creating stuff,'' said Michael Stipe, an actual rock star (with
REM) and a former art student. He was standing with friends outside
the Flicker Bar, which was having an art opening _ some half-dozen
photographs on a wall. ``In the mid-'90s, people began coming out
as much for the art as for the music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Artrain was on railroad tracks near the University of Georgia's
Lamar Dodd School of Art, which has 60 full-time faculty and is
named after a painter, educator and long-time resident of Athens
who had two works in the Artrain exhibition. This was a major
reason the people of Athens, especially C.L. Morehead, a collector
who owns hundreds of Lamar Dodds, sponsored an Artrain stop here.
</P>
<P>
   Athens is not typical of the places Artrain visits; in most
towns, its exhibition is often the Big Cultural Event. But no town
is really typical, staff members say. ``It might all be small-town
America, but each town is different,'' said Sheila Debrunner.
Another staff member, Kelly Raymond, added, ``We're often in towns
much smaller than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond and Debrunner were in the first of the train's five
cars, where Debrunner was reading a light meter in front of ``Earth
Crust,'' a lithograph by Robert Rauschenberg as Raymond made
notations on a clipboard. They moved to Andy Warhol's silkscreen
``Moon Walk (1),'' then to an oil painting by Peter Max, some
watercolors by James Wyeth and finally to another car, this one
full of works on paper. They were making sure that the paintings
and drawings were not exposed to too much light; the rocking of the
train can sometimes rattle the carefully calibrated track lighting,
knocking it off kilter. The works of art themselves were all bolted
into the walls and fronted by Plexiglas at the beginning of the
tour more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   This helps protect them not only from possible damage but also
from vandalism and theft. Artrain's adherence to standard museum
practice in climate control (to keep a steady temperature and
humidity), the handling of art and security has enabled it to
attract some high quality art, much the same as that lent to any
museum; Artrain has no collection of its own.
</P>
<P>
   A few cars down, Kapalka, the tour manager, had unpacked gift
items and shelved them in the gift shop, which also serves as an
art studio. There, local artists demonstrated their skills, whether
painting or pottery making. Kapalka soon moved to the office, at
the end of the fourth car, and phoned ahead to make arrangements in
Woodward, Okla., a stop more than a month in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Jewell and Emily Hewitt were setting up a canopy in the
parking lot next to the train and raising flags on the sides of the
railroad cars. Hewitt's official title is facility manager; she is
the only one of the seven staff members who actually rides on the
train as it travels from town to town. She also lives in the little
red caboose for as long as three weeks at a stretch. The others
drive vans and stay in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   This is not fun time. ``I'm not a railroad buff,'' Hewitt said.
Having no locomotive itself, Artrain must rely on the kindness of
railroad companies to move it along their tracks. Only rarely does
a railroad connect two small towns directly, so Artrain must often
travel a painfully circuitous route with many delays. It is
completely normal for a 14-mile trip to take 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing about their life on the road _ traveling 11 months out
of 12, eating on the go, rarely knowing where they will be from
week to week, having no permanent place to live _ one begins to
think of the Artrain workers as a group of art-history hobos.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell, a 22-year-old computer science major working on Artrain
for the summer, was also one of the few on the staff without a
background in art history. And even he can't help being influenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few nights ago in my hotel room,'' he said, ``I got a little
bored, and I started doodling. I wouldn't have done that before. I
would have just watched TV.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Artrain USA bills itself as the only art museum on a train, but
there are an increasing number of such museums in vans, buses,
recreational vehicles and tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone seems to want one,'' said Lee Skolnick, an
architect who designed two Movable Museums for the American Museum
of Natural History in New York and is working on four more such
mobile museums. One is for a new collection of antiquities in Las
Vegas, Nev., another for a children's museum in Chicago; the others
will be based in Indiana and Beirut, Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Va., last year, the Newseum, a museum about the
news media, introduced NewsCapade, a rolling exhibition of such
artifacts as a fragment of the Berlin Wall and Bill Gates'
autographed keyboard. The show is lugged by custom-designed trucks
to locations in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Most mobile museums travel within a limited region, often a
single state. The Museum of New Mexico sends out some of its
collection to rural areas in the state in a bus it calls the Van of
Enchantment. The Susquehanna Art Museum in Harrisburg travels the
state of Pennsylvania with a mobile museum it calls VanGo.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles operates both an
Earthmobile, which looks at a coastal Native American culture, and
a Seamobile, about the marine sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The American Museum of Natural History's two mobile museums
travel within the city limits. ``We've been in Winnebagos since
1992,'' said Jenny Lando as she drove one of them to a community
festival in Two Coves Park playground in Astoria, Queens. The
vehicle, almost as long as a city bus, held an exhibition about
dinosaurs. ``But the museum has had movable museums for a long
time,'' Lando said. ``They started with a suitcase. They were on
motorcycles in the 1920s. In the 1930s and 1940s, they used
converted ambulances.''
</P>
<P>
   Artrain itself began small, as a temporary program of the
Michigan Council for the Arts with the aim of reaching rural areas
of that state. But demand, and a grant from the National Endowment
for the Arts, turned it into a nationwide nonprofit arts
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward mobile museums is partly a result of modern
technological advances. Vehicles can now come with better climate
control and security and portable interactive computers. It also
coincides with the renewed popularity of museums. ``People are
going to museums for more things than ever before, not just to see
objects; they've become in some ways akin to malls,'' Skolnick
said. ``So it's not so surprising that these institutions are
looking for new ways to reach their public.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that is new about the phenomenon, there is also
something old-fashioned about what is going on, especially on
Artrain. ``Some of the draw is just the excitement of boarding a
train, the nostalgia of that,'' said Jean Steppe, a staff member.
``About a quarter of our visitors are railroad buffs who get an
education in art sort of accidentally.''
</P>
<P>
   At Artrain's opening reception in Athens, the first of four days
here, staff members have changed from their work clothes to evening
wear and welcome the local VIPs to the exhibition, the
organization's 14th, entitled ``Artistry of Space.'' Scheduled to
tour for two more years, the show offers a selection of 78 artworks
on space travel from the hundreds that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has commissioned over the last four decades as
part of NASAs art program.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA had hundreds of cameras photographing every nut and bolt,
but there was something missing,'' said James Dean, a retired
federal official who flew down from Washington. ``You had all the
facts, but you didn't have any of the emotion.'' Dean started the
agency's art program 38 years ago and is now himself a painter with
works in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artistry in Space'' harks back to a time when the space
program offered a new and exciting landscape for Americans to
explore, in the way that the trains offered Americans a fresh
landscape in the 19th century. Though the art in the exhibition is
varied _ one car is devoted entirely to abstract work _ paintings
like Attilla Hejja's ``Light Ship,'' which depicts the launching of
the Space Shuttle Challenger, recall the kind of detailed,
theatrical landscapes captured by 19th-century American artists
like Frederick Church. The fiery vapor, smoke and cloud bursting
from the booster rockets even bear some resemblance to the
billowing steam and smoke in 19th-century art featuring early
locomotives.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through Artrain, the students from Ben Bridgers'
intermediate drawing class at Lamar Dodd are impressed. ``People
don't even ride trains anymore,'' Bridgers said, ``much less expect
an art exhibition on one.''

A POLITICAL DAUGHTER STRIDES INTO THE SPOTLIGHT FOR HER FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karenna Gore Schiff reached into her purse and pulled out a
clump of typewritten pages. They were pockmarked by harsh X's
through several paragraphs, dashes through words and arrows to the
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess!'' she lamented. ``Here it is. It's like this, and
I'm trying to figure out this and I do it down here and I cross out
and then I've got all this and I'm not sure if I should add this,
and maybe it's too long, and I'm going this afternoon to type it up
again and ask someone to look at it, whoever has time.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff was going through a few unsurprising moments of panic as
she prepared to do something no other young woman has done:
nominate her father for president.
</P>
<P>
   However daunting the speech-writing process _ a task that, like
her father, she is doing herself _ she has a keen sense of her
purpose as one of her father's most trusted advisers. ``I care very
passionately about these issues, I really do, that's why I'm
involved in the campaign,'' she said in an interview in a hotel
room between campaign stops, referring to campaign finance, the
environment and matters of social justice. ``But I know that's not
why I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be there, on the podium Wednesday night at the
Democratic National Convention, because she is Al Gore's best
witness. The last year has been a coming out party, of sorts, for
Schiff, who, at 27, was only recently steeped in a self-described
``rebellious'' stage, in which she gave herself over to punk bands
and all-black outfits before and after attending Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result of her extensive work with her father, more than
a few Democrats have speculated that she will one day begin her own
political career, a notion she does not reject out of hand, but
does not relish talking about. Because she lives in New York, where
loads of Democratic campaign money can be found, Gore makes
frequent detours to the city. There, his daughter's Upper East Side
apartment serves as a kind of unofficial campaign headquarters, the
scene of cocktail receptions and strategy sessions and reunions
with his 1-year-old grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says his oldest daughter has ``perfect pitch, or very
nearly perfect pitch.'' And that trust has led to her involvement
in most of the major decisions of her father's campaign, from the
controversy over high-priced hiring of Naomi Wolf, the feminist
consultant and friend of Schiff's, to the selection of Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   But on at least one occasion, that pitch veered off-key, largely
because of her uncritical devotion to her father. A senior Gore
aide has said that it was Schiff who urged her father in March 1997
to hold a news conference at which he said seven times that there
was ``no controlling legal authority'' over whether he could make
fundraising calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff did not come up with that unfortunate phrase, advisers
say, but, because she so thoroughly believed in her father's
innocence, she pushed him to speak to the cameras before others
felt he was ready.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She has also been exposed to the chaos that can come from being
so close to the action. One searing experience occurred in February
at a hastily arranged meeting between her father and the Rev. Al
Sharpton, whose political blessing Gore wanted before the New York
primary _ but without pictures directly linking him to the fiery
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharpton rendezvous, stealthily conducted at Schiff's
apartment under the guise of a family visit, turned into a media
frenzy with television cameras staked out at her building and her
privacy threatened in a way she usually avoids.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a new wife (she married Dr. Andrew Schiff in 1997), a new
mother (son Wyatt was born July 4, 1999) and a newly minted
law-school graduate, she possesses important demographic
credentials. She has raised money for her father among women and
the under-30 set (she heads GoreNet, an outreach effort to young
voters) while growing ever more comfortable in speeches and the
chit-chat with strangers that accompanies such events.
</P>
<P>
   Her ease of manner, the hair elastic that she slips around her
wrist when she shakes out her ponytail and her exuberance at
extolling the virtues of the George Foreman Grill, as seen on
late-night infomercials, all lend her an air of authenticity that
the campaign hopes rubs off on her father. The not-so-subtle
thinking: If Gore can have a daughter who seems natural and
appealing, he must be a good guy himself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One striking scene earlier this year was when Schiff graduated
from Columbia Law School and her father spoke at the ceremony at
Lincoln Center. Gore shook hands with every graduate who collected
a diploma, and when his daughter strode across the stage, the vice
president formally stuck out his hand again, as if she were just
another graduate. No, Dad. (Or, as he might say in one of his
attempts to show he is with it: Hellll-o?) She pulled him close and
wrapped her arms around him.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   His daughter is also Exhibit A in conveying to working mothers _
a crucial voting bloc _ that Gore understands their needs and their
lives. He mentions his new grandson in nearly every speech, and the
campaign eagerly alerts reporters when Gore is babysitting, as he
did while Schiff attended the Million Mom March on behalf of gun
control. She also happily discusses the concerns of new mothers,
like breast-feeding. ``I am totally supportive of nursing in public
or wherever the hell it's necessary,'' she recently told
``thatglow.com,'' an online magazine about pregnancy. ``I remember
nursing in Central Park, and I fantasized about getting arrested
and thrown in jail for nursing; then I could lead a massive picket
line of nursing mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage for Schiff, evident this week during several
pre-convention activities, is that she provides an instant story
line as a made-for-the-media counterpart to George P. Bush, Gov.
George W. Bush's 23-year-old nephew, who is storming the youth
culture for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff, the granddaughter of a senator and the daughter of a man
who has served in the House (he was first elected on her third
birthday), the Senate and the vice presidency, can match the Bush
political lineage, although talk of being her father's political
heir-apparent makes her uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she might run for office some day, she rejects talk of
a Gore dynasty and shows a flash of anti-elitism. ``I just think
that there are so many other people who are really qualified and
care about the country, and no one asks them, and it doesn't occur
to them to run for office, and I think people all shouldn't come
from the same family,'' she said. ``I really honestly don't see
myself running,'' she added, a somewhat surprising conclusion since
she has on other recent occasions left the door more open.
</P>
<P>
   More immediate, she said, are plans to study for the New York
bar exam and to have more children.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was she who made the decision to take a public role in
her father's campaign (``It felt right for me'') and who emerged as
a natural political partner for her father. One of her younger
sisters, Kristin, 23, a comedy writer in Los Angeles, is
tentatively following her lead and making a few public appearances
at convention activities this week. But the other two siblings,
Sarah, 21, and Albert III, 17, remain in the background. Because
Gore felt so directed from an early age by his own father, friends
and family say that he has studiously avoided exerting the same
pressure on his own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really honestly never asked me to do anything, and I don't
think he ever would,'' Schiff said. ``He's very kind of protective
of us, and he doesn't want to force us into anything. He's very
conscious of not putting pressure on us.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I could just go off and be a quilter in the
mountains, and that would be more than fine with them. But it just
turns out that I actually am quite stimulated and engaged and
interested and really moved by this political moment.''

SECURITY BEEFED UP AFTER MONDAY NIGHT MELEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Downtown took on the feel of a militarized zone
Tuesday, with hundreds of helmeted police officers jogging from
block to block to keep peaceful protesters in check.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown was evident on every street corner after Monday
night's melee, which protesters called a police riot and which
police, who swept through the crowd on horseback, insisted was a
measured response to a handful of bottle-throwing troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 officers stood sentry outside the Ronald Reagan
Federal Building, where a parade of women met up with a parade of
teachers and students at noon. Hundreds more blocked intersections,
shouting ``Get back now'' at passersby who attempted to cross
public streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is frustrating to me is that a whole generation of young
people is growing up knowing that if they take to the streets, they
have to face down tear gas, rubber bullets, batons, and pepper
spray,'' said Han Shan, program director of the Berkeley-based
Ruckus Society, which held a training camp before the convention to
teach non-violent protest tactics. ``It's unconscionable. We're
wholly uninterested in confrontations with police.''
</P>
<P>
   Said LAPD Deputy Chief Maurice Moore as he monitored his
officers' movements Tuesday, ``We will have peace in the city. We
have a lot of resources and we're going to use them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive show of force was exceptional even for a city
plainly intent on using the Democratic National Convention to
showcase its rebound after from recession, riots, an earthquake
and, most recently, the widest-spread police scandal in Los Angeles
history. It came in response to what began as an isolated incident
during a free concert by the group ``Rage Against the Machine''
Monday evening but turned into 30 or more minutes of scattered fear
and fury as the mostly peaceful crowd tried to disperse as ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, thousands of concertgoers who had not been tossing
bottles and debris over a fence at police found themselves cornered
and fired upon with pepper spray, rubber bullets and other
anti-riot ordinance. Six people were arrested, police said, one for
assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon, the others for failure
to disperse. There was no official tally of injuries, although
demonstration leaders said they had reports of dozens, althogh none
serious. California state Sen. Tom Hayden said his son was hit in
the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, with both sides blaming the other, the Los
Angeles chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called the
police response unjustified and warned the city it should not be
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the police were trying to incite a riot, they couldn't have
done a more effective job,'' said Dan Tokaji, an ACLU staff
attorney. ``These peaceful demonstrations will not be stopped by
the unlawfulness of police.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji also said police stormed into Patriotic Hall, where the
Shadow Convention is being held, claiming a bomb threat had been
called in and halting a live broadcast by a social justice
journalism group. No bomb was found, and the ACLU is considering
seeking an injuction that would bar police from entering the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials defended their actions as necessary to prevent
property damage and more serious outbreaks of violence. During the
convention, 2,000 officers are assigned to the area surrounding the
hall and the entire 9,300-member force is on duty in 12-hour
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do anything unless people are breaking the
law,'' said Sgt. John Pasquariello, an LAPD spokesman. ``If people
are intimidated, I'm sorry that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators who gathered at downtown's Pershing Square Tuesday
morning to call for fair wages and dignity for women, as well as
those who massed at Belmont High School to rally for better
education, said they refused to be cowed into quiet. All but a few
condemned the trouble caused by a handful of black-clad youths,
saying that their worst fear was that the issues they hoped to
highlight _ from corporate money's influence on government policies
to the destruction of natural habitats _ would be obscured by the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to scare demonstrators off; if
anything, I've heard people say that it makes them want to come out
and be heard,'' said Steven Leigh, 51, a Seattle office worker who
was at the morning demonstration. ``I think what the police did is
disgusting. It's like they were just waiting for a chance to go
after people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the concert, the police officers and youths who identify
themselves as anarchists faced off through a fence, with one side
hurling bottles and the other responding, after a time, with pepper
spray. Tuesday, one 23-year-old anarchist who said he was at the
fence said his intention was ``to stand up for peace, equality and
freedom by raising our voices and our fists.''
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m., a police commander took to the makeshift stage to
announce the protesters and fans had 15 minutes to leave the
``protest pit'' across the street from Staples Center. The bands'
permit to perform did not expire for another hour, and with fences
and concrete barricades blocking three sides, they could not escape
fast enough. As they tried to depart, volunteer demonstrators
wearing armbands made of yellow police tape held hands in a human
chain intended to help keep order near the exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running for my life,'' said Garrick Ruiz, an activist
with the Rise Up/Direct Action Network in Los Angeles. ``I was
caught in the panic, trying to get over the concrete barricade. If
people are dispersing, let them disperse. Why shoot them in the
back'' with rubber bullets and foam projectiles known as skip
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the peace was holding as sundown neared Tuesday, both
police and demonstrators said they were wary of what might occur
Wednesday. The theme of the scheduled protests: police brutality
and other issues related to law enforcement.

OPPOSITION TRIES TO HINDER BARAK'S NEGOTIATIONS WITH PALESTINIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel's main opposition party used a depleted
special session of Parliament Tuesday to push through a resolution
aimed at impeding new peace talks with the Palestinians, but Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's government brushed the move aside as
political grandstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general who leads the
right-wing Likud Party, opponents of the peace negotiations called
Parliament into a special session that interrupted the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 39-1, with only a third of the 120 members present,
they approved another special session, tentatively set for Aug. 28,
to debate a resolution that would declare any attempts by Barak to
renew the peace talks without new elections illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition move came during a flurry of new peace maneuvers
aimed at bridging the deep differences on Jerusalem that caused
negotiations for a final peace treaty at Camp David to collapse
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who did not attend the parliamentary session, spent part
of his day meeting with top aides to discuss talks said to be set
for Wednesday between high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli television report, not confirmed by the government,
said that Shlomo Ben-Ami, who was named acting foreign minister
last week and who was one of those who met Tuesday with Barak, is
to meet with two top aides who accompanied Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian officials were named in the television report as
Mohammed Dahlan and Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian
Parliament and a man regarded as one of the most powerful figures
in the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The talks would be the highest-level contacts the two sides have
acknowledged holding since Camp David and seemed likely to focus on
Jerusalem. Since Camp David, both sides have marked out seemingly
irreconcilable positions on the city, with Arafat demanding that
Israel hand over sovereignty for all of east Jerusalem, and Barak
and his aides vowing that Israel will go no further than the
compromises suggested by President Clinton and tentatively accepted
by Barak at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Israeli and Palestinian officials, those
compromises would involve a limited Palestinian foothold over the
Muslim holy sites in the Old City as well as control of the old
Arab quarter and some Arab villages on the city's eastern
periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was also said to have agreed that Arafat could establish a
presidential headquarters for a Palestinian state in east
Jerusalem, allowing the Palestinians to declare it their new
capital.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's parliamentary session, Sharon sought to stir a
public groundswell against Barak with a highly charged speech that
depicted Barak as a usurper ready to trade Israel's control of
Jerusalem in return for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon contended that Barak, who lost his parliamentary majority
when three parties quit his coalition government immediately before
the Camp David talks, has no mandate to govern or to negotiate
peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak does not have the right to give up Jerusalem, which the
people received as a legacy,'' Sharon said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Barak dismissed the parliamentary vote as largely
irrelevant to the peace efforts, saying that Barak, elected prime
minister by a wide margin in the popular vote 15 months ago, has a
constitutional and political mandate to continue peace negotiations
unless ousted in a new election.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides, they said, Sharon and his right-wing parliamentary
allies failed to force early elections only two weeks ago, when a
no-confidence vote against Barak's government fell three votes
short of the 61 votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   The no-confidence vote was followed by another vote on Aug. 2 in
which opposition parties succeeded in mustering 61 votes in favor
of dissolving Parliament, which would lead to new elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's basic law requires such a vote to be approved
afterward by a parliamentary committee, then again by the full
Parliament, before becoming law _ a process not likely to be
completed, if at all, until Parliament ends its summer recess and
resumes on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sharon and his aides have been working to win over some
members who voted against the no-confidence vote, with a view to
trying to topple Barak during the recess, most Israeli politicians
believe that the prime minister will survive at least until the
fall session. Even if he is defeated then, either in a
no-confidence vote or by passage of a law mandating new elections,
Barak would have 90 days before an election to seek a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political commentators said that Sharon, lacking the
numbers for a no-confidence vote, appeared to have settled for the
time being on a course intended to undermine public confidence in
Barak.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, they said, the parliamentary debate later this
month seemed likely to be largely a forum for more impassioned
opposition denunciations of Barak. All the same, commentators said,
the parliamentary drumbeat against the peace talks was not likely
to encourage progress in the negotiations.

FORMER ARGENTINE PRESIDENT ISSUES DIRE ECONOMIC FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ At a time of deepening concerns about
the Argentine economy, former President Carlos Saul Menem has
predicted that Argentina faces a devaluation and a depression
unless President Fernando de la Rua either changes economic
direction or adopts the dollar as the national currency.
</P>
<P>
   Menem retains a strong reputation among some Argentine
executives and Wall Street analysts for reengineering the Argentine
economy in the early 1990s, so his public comments Monday propelled
a debate on Tuesday in the Argentine business press and sent
shudders through the government.
</P>
<P>
   Since De la Rua took office eight months ago, he has
concentrated on cutting government deficits to lower interest
rates. But with the prices of wheat and soybeans at record lows,
and the Argentine peso tied 1-to-1 to a strong dollar, the
country's exports and economy have stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in tax revenue and a decline in public spending this
year have pleased the International Monetary Fund, but unemployment
has increased to 15.4 percent, a three-year-high.
</P>
<P>
   Only five months ago, government officials said the economy
would grow at least 4 percent this year _ following a 3 percent
decline in 1999 _ but now most economists say the country will be
lucky to reach a 2 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness is especially startling when compared with the
performance of Latin America's two other huge economies _ those of
Brazil and Mexico. Last week Brazil reported its best quarterly
growth rate in three years at nearly 4 percent, and there are
widespread expectations it will grow 4 percent for the year in a
robust recovery from its own economic crisis in early 1999. And
today, Mexico, where the economy is in its best shape in years,
said its second-quarter growth rate reached 7.6 percent, far above
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, by contrast, seems mired in bad economic news. Even
Argentine beef, one of the country's most promising exports, is now
jeopardized by fears of a possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease. Demand from new markets in Asia has fallen, and experts
are predicting a loss of $130 million in foreign beef sales this
year.
</P>
<P>
   With confidence sagging, De la Rua is putting the final touches
on a new $50 million jobs program to alleviate poverty in the
provinces, but the plan is being greeted with skepticism since
salaries would be as low as $200 a month. Analysts hope that a
continued expansion in Brazil and an eventual strengthening of the
European euro could help boost Argentine exports by the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue on this path, I think there will be a
devaluation, or a dollarization of the economy,'' said Menem, who
is the leader of the opposition Justicialist Party and says he will
run for president again in 2003. ``If things go on this way, we are
heading into a depression that could be dramatic for Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina long suffered from cycles of devaluations and
hyperinflation until Menem redesigned the currency system in 1991
pegging the peso 1-to-1 to the dollar. The policy quickly toppled
inflation to a rate that is near zero today, but growth has been
slow and choppy over the last five years. Menem began floating the
idea of a complete dollarization during his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Loperfido, the government secretary of culture and
communication, bitterly criticized the former president Tuesday for
attempting to ``create a bad image of the country abroad.'' He
added, ``He's not doing the country any good.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the former president's dire prognosis came as
Economy Minister Jose Luis Machinea traveled to Washington Tuesday
to consult with international bankers and as De la Rua prepared to
be host of a two-day visit by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Molano, head of research for BCP Securities, a
fixed-income brokerage firm based in Greenwich, Conn., said Menem's
comment ``reflects a sense among the opposition that there is blood
in the water'' and it is now time to begin attacking the
government's economic policies in a more forthright manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are coming to a head in Argentina,'' Molano added.
``They are running out of rabbits to pull out of their hats.''

BUT CAN YOU SING A DUET WITH A PORCUPINE AFTER 6 P.M.?
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was glad to read that two women in my hometown of Sarasota,
Fla., had been arrested for cursing in front of children.
</P>
<P>
   The women were charged with violating a 1939 city law that makes
it illegal to utter the f-word and several other choice invectives
within earshot of children. If convicted, they each face up to 60
days in jail and a fine of $500.
</P>
<P>
   It is my position that children should not be exposed to
profanity unless they are at the movies, watching TV or listening
to popular music. In those situations, coarse language is
considered ``art'' and is not to be confused with the common,
gutter-variety obscenities one hears on the streets or at Little
League games.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that I have not ``slipped'' occasionally and
uttered a bad word in the presence of our 14-year-old, who for many
years thought his given name was Dammitmichael. Now that the cops
are listening, I will have to clean up my act.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Michael leaves his bicycle behind my car, chops a
sprinkler line with a shovel, or forgets to tell me until the night
before that he has a science-fair project due tomorrow, I will not
lose my temper and turn the air blue with four-letter words. I will
wait until he is out of earshot, or has his headphones on, then
curse.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger question here, I think, is: What other 60-year-old laws
are hanging around, waiting to trip us up in publicly humiliating
ways over and above fines and jail time?
</P>
<P>
   Florida, as you might expect, is a national leader in goofy
laws, some of which may or may not still be on the books. (For a
more comprehensive treatment of this subject, go to
www.dumblaws.com.)
</P>
<P>
   One antiquated law states that women can be fined for falling
asleep under a hair dryer, as can the owner of the salon.
</P>
<P>
   This seems like a perfectly reasonable law to me in that it is
not good public policy to have sleeping women's heads burst into
flames, particularly if they don't have insurance. To protect
themselves from prosecution, salon owners might want to give their
drowsy customers a brisk slap every now and then, or maybe whang on
their hair dryers with a curling iron every so often to keep them
alert.
</P>
<P>
   Another Florida law states that it is illegal to have sexual
relations with a porcupine.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I see nothing wrong with this law, though I seriously
doubt that porcupine sex is now, or ever was, such a problem that
it needed to be addressed by statute. The way I look at it, anyone
who attempts to have sex with a porcupine is going to be punished
enough without any further involvement on the part of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another law states that it is illegal to sing in a public
place while attired in a swimsuit. This, too, strikes me as a good
law, though you've got to wonder what kind of circumstances led to
its passage. Did people object more to the singing or to the
swimsuits? Or was it the combination that finally drove honest
citizens to seek legal sanctions? Who, for that matter, would want
to sing in a public place while attired in a swimsuit? Instead of
arresting these people, shouldn't we be showing them compassion and
perhaps help them get counseling? I've got to think the Republicans
were behind this one.
</P>
<P>
   Another law that must have strange origins is the law that
states you may not break wind in a public place after 6 p.m. on
Thursdays. Were people breaking more wind after 6 p.m. Thursday
than before? Why? Doesn't this law seem to encourage people to
break wind in public places on days other than Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   How would police go about collecting evidence? Isn't this whole
subject rather disgusting?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but not to the point that I'd want to curse. At least not
if there are children nearby.
</P>

AMERICAN HABITS REACH ACROSS THE PACIFIC TO CHANGE THE WAY A NATION
LUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BECKY GAYLORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Chalk up another victim of America's
eat-on-the-run workplace culture.
</P>
<P>
   First it was the French. Traditionalists watched in horror as
white-collar drones in the homeland of haute cuisine, caught up in
the pressures of the global economy, began abandoning the
wine-soaked three-hour lunch in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have thought Australians _ that
independent-minded, fun-loving lot Down Under _ would also succumb
to the capitalist credo that productivity and profit-making
constitute a higher calling than a leisurely midday meal?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the evidence of the Australian office worker's apostasy is
everywhere. Start with the upscale rotating Summit restaurant,
located atop a skyscraper in the heart of the business district,
where lunchtime business bustled a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to fill the buffet from one to three,'' said
Jenny-Lee Stefas, referring to lunch business. She took over last
year as sales and marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. By 1999, even after a refurbishment that
included funky red carpet, sleek white chairs and a minimalist
``Space Odyssey'' theme, business had dropped off so much that on
some days only three or four customers showed up, Stefas says. That
left room for 347 more.
</P>
<P>
   To lure more business people, the restaurant took aim at their
weak spot and advertised a rich repast in one hour. Business has
tripled _ to an average 75 diners. They are able to sit down at
noon and order, say, warm chili prawns with mango and cucumber
relish, followed by crisp-skin Tasmanian salmon with green-pea
puree, tomato provencale and olive oil, all of it washed down with
a good wine, and be out the door by 1 p.m. And if the Summit fails
to deliver on the one-hour guarantee, customers win a one-night
stay at a country resort.
</P>
<P>
   Other top restaurants have begun speeding things up. Late last
year, the highly regarded MG Garage restaurant formulated a
quick-lunch special for 25 Australian dollars, or $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come here with a main course and a glass of wine
already chosen to go with it, and that alone cuts the time of
having to look at the menu and decide,'' said Janni Kyritsis, MG
Garage's head chef.
</P>
<P>
   For years, American business people have avoided wine at work
day lunches. In Australia, the trend is newer, but growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go out for a boozy lunch, you write your whole
afternoon off,'' said Leigh Anderson, a manager at Morgan &AMP; Banks,
an executive recruitment firm here. ``People can't afford to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Anderson is a stranger to the long lunch. He said that
at the company he worked for six years ago in London it ``was
almost a condition of your employment to take people out for
lunch.'' And they could be fairly liquid affairs, he confessed.
Now, at Morgan &AMP; Banks, he said, ``we tend to discourage that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harland Koops, a partner at the law firm of Henry Davis York,
has also weaned himself of long lunches, though he says he was
never a regular player on the lunch circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvinistic instincts seem to be reasserting themselves,''
Koops said.
</P>
<P>
   Clients, he added, ``really have their heads down making money,
and they're not playing as much as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Australian business people claimed a leisurely
lunch of several courses and accompanying wines, followed by
dessert and coffee, as a national privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Until late last year, even the bond market closed for a
respectable hour and a half _ one of only a handful in the world to
cease business in the middle of the day. Throughout the 1980s and
into the early '90s, that shutdown created the occasional
phenomenon known as the claret run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when a market would go on a seemingly inexplicable
rally,'' one money market dealer explained. ``And it was based on
the fact that a few people would come back from lunch all liquored
up and decide they liked the market and start buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, they would not come back at all, and the business
lunch would slide into dinner. Such epicureans were known as FTRs,
for ``failed to return.''
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? What drove Aussies toward midday temperance?
</P>
<P>
   Time-poor, cholesterol-rich executives cite not just the global
economy and the competitive pressures it has unleashed, but also
fitness concerns. An increasing number are heading out for a
lunch-hour jog or a session with a personal trainer. Or else they
are eating at their desks so they can leave early for some surfing
or golf.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the government's elimination of tax-deductible
lunches in two stages _ the first in the 1980s, the second in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bilson, director of the chic Ampersand Restaurant, called
that change a ``body blow.'' It was followed by a new 10 percent
tax on restaurant meals, that began July 1, presaging even leaner
times to come. The trade at midday is so thin on some days that
Bilson occasionally mulls shutting Ampersand for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The same gastronomic drama has been playing itself in other
parts of the world, notably France, where long, liquid lunches had
been a sacred ritual for years. No more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone goes out to the boulangerie, and comes back with
bread, or cheese or something, and eats together as a group,'' said
Capucine Favet, 26, a designer of street events for W.M., an
outdoor-event company in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward faster midday meals has been long in the making
in France, but got a fresh nudge in January with a law that bans
salaried employees from putting in more than 35 hours a week. In
response, many companies have stopped counting lunch hours in the
figure, said Patrick Lenain, an economist with the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people who take two or three hours are executives, and
it's business lunches with clients,'' Lenain said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is giving way on the lunch front. Back in
Australia, there are still die-hard diners. ``I work with a fellow
who's known as Sir Lunch a Lot,'' Koops said. ``They're still out
there, mate. They're just lunching on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at 3:30 on a recent afternoon, Koops' colleague could
not be reached at his office. He was, his secretary said, still at
lunch.

<P>
   The ratings picture was generally positive for the TV networks
for opening night of the Democratic National Convention, with most
networks notching increases when compared with the convention four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, however, viewers continued to show a decided preference
for nonpolitical programs. For instance, 80,000 Boston-area
households switched from WHDH-TV (Channel 7) when ``Dateline'' gave
way to convention coverage. On WCVB-TV (Channel 5), more than
45,000 households tuned out when ``Monday Night Football'' ended
and convention coverage began.
</P>
<P>
   The first night of the Democratic conclave was a made-for-TV
spectacle whose headliners didn't appear until just a half-hour
before the end of prime time. President Bill Clinton did not begin
his speech Monday night until 10:52 EST, 40 minutes later than
party officials had planned. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did
not start her own speech until nearly 10:30 p.m. That could have
damaged the Democrats' chances of reaching a large audience,
especially on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But collectively, according to Nielsen Media Research, coverage
on the ``Big Three'' drew a combined audience of 17.2 million
viewers Monday night, nearly a million more viewers than tuned in
to the first night of the Democratic convention in 1996. NBC and
ABC both increased their audiences from four years ago, though CBS
was down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a bigger draw four years ago, when his acceptance
speech on the final night of the convention was watched by more
than 20 million viewers on the Big Three networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC did not cover the first night of the Republican convention
last month, but the audiences for ABC and CBS Monday night _ 5.99
million viewers and 5.2 million viewers, respectively _ were
roughly the same as their opening-night audiences at the GOP
conclave.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of viewership, ABC won by a whisker, followed by NBC,
with 5.95 million, and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service increased its audience Monday
night to 3 million viewers from the 2.3 million who tuned in for
its coverage of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three all-news cable networks improved on their
performance from day one of the Republican National Convention. CNN
drew 1.8 million viewers Monday night for Clinton's speech,
compared with 1.2 million who tuned in to hear retired General
Colin Powell kick off the GOP convention. CNN's audience was also
up substantially from the first night of the Democratic convention
in 1996. However, the CNN audience for Clinton's speech was much
smaller than the 2.7 million who tuned in for his acceptance speech
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for Fox News Channel dropped from 676,000 viewers
at the kickoff of the GOP convention to 420,000 viewers for the
Democratic conclave. The third all-news network, MSNBC, enlarged
its audience, increasing to 632,000 viewers from the 516,000 it
drew for the first night of the Republican convention.

LIEBERMAN TELLS BLACK CAUCUS HE SUPPORTS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DAN FREEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ As he prepared his acceptance speech before the
Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., was busy putting out a brush fire over his
civil rights record, telling African-American delegates: ``I have
supported affirmative action, I do support affirmative action and I
will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after his arrival here Tuesday, Lieberman found
himself placating Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., a prominent black
lawmaker, who said she could not support Vice President Al Gore and
Lieberman until they had clarified their positions on affirmative
action, education and criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   She singled out Lieberman, who in the past has questioned
affirmative action and supported school vouchers for children in
failing inner-city schools. Because other black leaders including
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., had praised Gore's selection of Lieberman,
Waters appeared isolated in her skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerned about party unity during the convention,
Lieberman went right to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions have been raised about my record ... and I want to
deal with it right directly,'' Lieberman told a meeting of the
Democratic National Committee Black Caucus. He compared the process
of scrutinizing his record to ``getting a medical procedure without
an anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman launched into a lengthy explanation of his civil
rights record, starting with his attendance at the historic 1963
march on Washington, D.C., where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave
his ``I have a dream'' speech. The Connecticut senator said his
commitment to racial equality ``begins with my religion, because I
believe as a matter of faith, not just that God created all of us,
(but) I believe that every human being is created in God's image,''
he said. Lieberman is an orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also told the audience:
</P>
<P>
   __ As a student in 1963, he traveled to Mississippi to register
black voters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Since winning election to the Senate in 1988, he has been a
consistent supporter of civil rights legislation as well as an
opponent of Republican attempts to dismantle U.S. government
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   __ He had questioned whether some federal affirmative action
had, in effect, sanctioned quotas in the mid-1990s. But he
concurred with President Clinton's ``mend it, don't end it''
approach to affirmative action in 1995 that essentially left the
program intact.
</P>
<P>
   __ He didn't actively support California's Proposition 209, a
1996 ballot initiative that effectively ended affirmative action in
all state and local hiring, college admissions and awarding of
contracts. He attributed confusion over his stance on Proposition
209 to a one-time positive response to a reporter's question on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   __ He agreed with Clinton that ``affirmative action was never
about having unqualified people take jobs from qualified people. It
was about qualified people (getting opportunities).''
</P>
<P>
   On his support for vouchers that would enable parents to
transfer their children to private schools, Lieberman said he
thought a pilot program would be worth trying until public
education could be fixed. But he added he had never retreated from
basic support of public education, and that public schools had
helped him rise out of limited circumstances in Stamford, Conn., to
attend Yale University and Yale law school. Lieberman did not talk
about criminal justice and the concern of many blacks that
African-Americans receive unequal justice when it comes to
prosecution and sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent black political leaders D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes
Norton and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater hailed Lieberman
as a champion of minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Waters told reporters she would work for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman ``seemed consistent with what I think the Democratic
Party ideals are all about,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spent a large portion of the day preparing his
Wednesday night prime-time speech.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki McLean, a campaign spokeswoman, said Lieberman would talk
about himself, ``the Al Gore he knows,'' and voters' ``choices for
the future ... It's not an attack speech, but he will draw sharp
contrasts'' between the Democratic ticket and Republican
challenger, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech would be a particular source of pride to
Jewish-Americans, said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and director of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which operates the
city's Museum of Tolerance featuring displays that teach about
hatred and bigotry.

   ``It's a moment of historic importance,'' said Hier, who is
non-partisan and spoke briefly at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia earlier this month. ``Whatever the
demographics (of Americans watching or not watching Lieberman's
speech), Jewish Americans will tune in in record proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``it's important to recognize that Gore
didn't go out looking for some Jew. He selected Joe Lieberman
because in addition to going to a synagogue, he is a man of great
integrity. That's why it's really a moment of pride.''

DRUG INDUSTRY INFLUENCE HURTING RESEARCH, DOCTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Some researchers with financial ties to the
pharmaceutical industry are eroding the integrity of medical
research and potentially harming patient care, a University of
California doctor told nearly 700 scientists, advocates and
policymakers gathered here Tuesday for a national conference on
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms that commercialism is hurting research includes studies
that are deliberately skewed to produce favorable results for the
funders' drugs, and research articles guest written by prominent
researchers whose only contact with the project is a paycheck from
drug makers, said Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, an internist at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer, who spent a year reviewing published accounts of
such problems in drug research, was invited to share his findings
by the National Institutes of Health, which sponsored the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking counterpoint to some other speakers who suggested
such conflicts are manageable by merely disclosing them to the
public, Bodenheimer said, ``Conflict of interest is associated with
intentional bias in the conduct and publication of drug trials.
Disclosure is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The NIH convened the conference in response to Congressional
demands for greater protections for research participants following
deaths in gene therapy experiment. The studies, including several
at St. Elizabeth's in Boston, were overseen by scientists with
financial stakes in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England
Journal of Medicine said Bodenheimer's ``terrific'' presentatiion
was the first comprehensive review of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bodenheimer showed that conflicts of interest have real
effects,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Grant, a representaitve of the Biotech Industry
Organization, defended the drug industry saying, ``Most of our
investigators are free from (Food and Drug Administration) defined
conflicts'' and that companies are very ``wary of compromising
their ability to get a drug licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA must approve all drugs before they can be marketed in
the United States. Grant, who is an executive with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals, said the companies must submit all data to the
FDA, not just favorable data.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer agreed that some of the research problems may occur
more frequently in tests after the drugs are approved by the FDA,
tests used to help market the drugs to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, when only the favorable data makes it into the
medical journals, he said, it leaves practicing physicians like him
relying on flawed data in deciding which drugs to prescribe for
their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer cited instances in 1990 and 1996 in which
pharmaceutical companies refused to allow researchers to publish
data unfavorable to company products. And he cited a recent review
of reports on 196 tests of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
that found, ``doubtful or invalid statements'' in 76 percent of the
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He also detailed 5 reviews of clinical trials made by other
researchers that showed that ``company-funded trials have a high
likelihood of favoring the company's products.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said that another researcher's study of 809
articles published in major journals found that 29 percent had
``guest or ghost authors,'' leaving researchers in the dark about
who had really done the research. Ghost authors are often hired by
drug companies, he said, but their names do not appear on the
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the article appears under the name of a guest writer
who has agreed to review it in exchange for an honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts carry over to the design of drug tests or trials,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last year, he said, examined tests of the effectiveness
of 2 anti-fungal drugs. In the studies funded by the maker of the
new drug, 79 percent of the patients received the older drug orally
even though it is an intravenous drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design virtually guarantees . . . the funding company's
drug will produce better results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer said that not every conflict leads to such
misconduct, but he proposed erecting barriers between drug company
funding and drug research. His most radical proposal called for
drug companies to turn over final testing of new drugs to the NIH
with the drug companies providing the funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth L. Kirschstein, principal deputy director of NIH called
that plan impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschstein said she thought simple disclosure of conflicts,
``certainly goes a long way toward solving any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Korn, senior vice president of the Association of
American Medical Colleges said he agreed with Bodenheimer that
disclosure was not enough, although he took issue with equating
conflicts of interest with scientific misconduct. Korn said
academic institutions should limit the financial involvement of
researchers, citing Harvard's strict policy restricting researchers
from participating in studies sponsored by companies that they have
an equity stake in.

AFTER 30-DAY REPRIEVE, DNA TESTS SEND TEXAS INMATE BACK TO DEATH
ROW 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Ricky Nolen McGinn, the only inmate ever granted a
stay of execution by Gov. George W. Bush, is headed back to death
row.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of raping and murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter,
McGinn, 43, came within minutes of being executed on June 1 when
Bush granted him a 30-day reprieve to allow for a series of new DNA
tests. But the results of the tests, made public at a court hearing
Tuesday, further incriminated McGinn and prompted the presiding
judge to reschedule the execution for Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the results were consistent,'' said Brown County District
Attorney Lee Haney, the prosecutor in the case. Asked if he was
relieved, Haney said, ``I'm certainly not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers had hoped that testing semen found inside the
victim would clear McGinn of the rape conviction. It was the
combination of rape and murder convictions that qualified him for
the death penalty. But each of the DNA tests conducted by the Texas
Department of Public Safety, the FBI and two defense experts,
served to further implicate McGinn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has presided over 139 executions since taking office
in 1995, the most of any governor in the nation, had never granted
a reprieve until the McGinn case. In a statement Tuesday, the
governor said he granted the stay ``because it was important, in
this case, that biological evidence be tested to help determine the
defendant's guilt or innocence of the rape charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district court action today also demonstrates the
safeguards present in our system,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurie Levin, one of McGinn's lawyers, credited Bush for
allowing the DNA tests, but disputed the belief that the results
should be interpreted as an endorsement of the death penalty system
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She aid that ``numerous exonerations, in capital and non-capital
cases, have been achieved through the use of DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Texas inmate, Roy Criner, was released Tuesday after
DNA tests proved he had been wrongly convicted of rape. Criner
spent 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature is expected to debate a host of death
penalty reforms in its 2001 session.

EDWARD BRODSKY, A LAWYER   WHO HANDLED SECURITIES CASES, DIES AT
70 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Brodsky, a nationally prominent courtroom lawyer who
specialized in securities cases and criminal law cases, died on
Friday in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan and
Southampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a family spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Brodsky was a senior partner in the
Manhattan-based law firm of Proskauer Rose, which he joined in 1992
after being a partner in two Manhattan firms.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the American College of Trial Lawyers in
1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky was the defense lawyer of Meade Esposito, a retired
Democratic Party leader in Brooklyn, who was indicted on charges of
making illegal payments to Mario Biaggi, a Democratic Congressman
from the Bronx. In 1987, Esposito was acquitted of bribery and
convicted of a misdemeanor, giving a gratuity to a public official.
He was fined $500,000 and given a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky represented many companies charged with securities
fraud. Among the cases were a number of civil actions involving
corporations controlled by the financier Ivan F. Boesky, who
pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky argued twice before the Supreme Court in connection with
criminal cases, the more recent of which involved an aspect of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   He also represented the village of Southampton in an action
brought in the late 1980's by a company whose owner said that the
village had deprived him of his property rights by failing to
permit him to do certain construction on his house. After a jury
sided with the company, Brodsky obtained dismissal of the action in
a federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he held posts in the
Department of Justice in Washington, including the post of special
attorney in the attorney general's group on organized crime, before
becoming an assistant United States attorney in the Southern
District of New York, where he became chief of the special
prosecutions division.
</P>
<P>
   He was a co-author of the book ``Law of Corporate Officers and
Directors'' (1985, Thomson) and he wrote, until his death, a
monthly column on corporate and securities litigation for The New
York Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he received a bachelor's degree from City
College of the City University of New York and his law degree cum
laude from New York University School of Law, where he was
associate editor of The Law Review.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Cynthia; three sons, Peter, Bill and
James, all of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.

CHARLES GIBBS, DIABETES GROUP LEADER, DIES AT 105 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Mex., N.Y.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Brooke Flint Gibbs, a Rochester internist who was
the last survivor of the founders of the American Diabetes
Association 60 years ago, died on Aug. 4 in Rochester. He was 105.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs was one of 32 founders of the association in 1940. Since
then, it has grown to 280,000 members, with a staff of more than
800 and an annual budget of $88 million.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gibbs, a native of Black River, near Watertown, N.Y.,
graduated from Syracuse University College of Medicine. He was its
oldest living alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   His own care of diabetics left an imprint on a number of
institutions. He was among the researchers at the University of
Rochester who worked to isolate insulin in the 1920s. The
university formed its medical school in 1925, and Gibbs organized
the region's first diabetes clinic that year at Rochester General
Hospital. He was named head of the first such clinic at Strong
Memorial Hospital the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The medical school named the library of its endocrinology
division in honor of Gibbs several years ago. He was a past
president of the Rochester Academy of Medicine and founding
president of the Rochester Regional Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs made house calls almost daily for 59 years, retiring from
active practice in 1980. He died in his sleep at a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Blanche Haynes Gibbs, died in 1998 after 76 years of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is survived by two daughters, Molly Gibbs King of Syracuse
and Nancy Zaenglein of Penfield, N.Y.; a son, Dr. Carl Gibbs of
Santa Fe, N.M.; 12 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.

HIGH COURT URGED TO HEAR MICROSOFT APPEAL QUICKLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Declaring that the outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case could
affect nearly every person who uses a computer, the Justice
Department on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to hear the company's
appeal quickly so ``that justice is not denied through delay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court can hear direct appeals in civil antitrust
cases brought by the federal government if it thinks the expedited
review is in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Tuesday, the Justice Department argued forcefully
that the Microsoft lawsuit is surely such a case. ``A lengthy
appeals process,'' the government stated, ``could irreparably harm
competition in a vital and rapidly evolving sector of the national
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Microsoft asked the court to let its appeal go first
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
which had ruled for the company in a related case. Microsoft said
the appeals court was the proper place for an initial review
because the company's appeal raised many technical issues and
argued that the trial judge made a series of procedural errors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will file a legal brief with the Supreme Court next
Tuesday, seeking to undermine the government's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   With its filing, the Justice Department essentially tried to
make it more difficult for the Supreme Court to decline a direct
review. It characterized Microsoft's arguments as all but an insult
to the court's competence. Microsoft, the government stated,
``overstates the complexity of this case'' and ``underestimates
this court's capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also suggested that if the court declined, it
would leave the antitrust Expediting Act of 1903, which was amended
in 1974, as a dead letter.
</P>
<P>
   From 1903 until 1974, all appeals of civil antitrust cases
brought by the government went directly to the Supreme Court, but
the 1974 amendment gave the court more discretion in which appeals
it heard directly. The standard, under the 1974 amendment, is that
the case should be of ``general public importance in the
administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In pointed language, the government told the court: ``The stakes
in this case for the national economy are immense. If this case
does not qualify for direct review under the Expediting Act, it is
difficult to imagine what future case would.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who heard the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court, ruled this year that Microsoft was a monopoly that
had repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. And he ordered
that the company be split in two, an order he later shelved pending
appeals. Microsoft is appealing both Jackson's ruling and his
breakup order.
</P>
<P>
   The votes of four of the Supreme Court's nine justices would be
needed for the court to hear an expedited appeal. If the case went
directly to the Supreme Court, it could be resolved in a year. If
it went first to the appeals court, the resolution could take up to
two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision on whether to hear the appeal
directly could well be crucial to the outcome and the impact of the
Microsoft case, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   If the court proceeded with a direct appeal, they say, it would
be a favorable sign for the government. The government would avoid
a federal appeals court where Microsoft has done well in the past.
And a move for expedited treatment would suggest that the court
wanted to resolve a pressing problem quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court's instinct is that Microsoft is a
monopoly whose activities are costly to society, it will be more
likely to take the case directly,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a
professor at the University of Iowa law school. ``But if not, then
the cost of lingering is not so high, and then it will be more
likely to let the appeals court review the case first.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of any sanctions against Microsoft, assuming it lost
the case on appeal, would probably be dulled by an additional year
of delay. ``For that reason, this is a decisive moment in the
litigation,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, the government addressed that issue, noting,
``Delay will postpone, and likely complicate substantially, the
restoration of competition in the affected high-technology
industries, which evolve at an extraordinary pace.''

VAL DUFOUR, STAR OF TV SOAP OPERAS, DIES AT 73  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Val Dufour, an Emmy Award-winning star of television
soap operas, died on July 27 in Manhattan, where he lived. He was
73.
</P>
<P>
   Dufour won an Emmy Award as outstanding actor in a daytime drama
series in the 1976-77 season for playing John Wyatt, a lawyer, on
``Search for Tomorrow.'' He made his daytime television debut in
the series ``First Love,'' which was presented live in the
mid-1950s. He also acted in ``The Edge of Night'' and ``Another
World.'' Periodically he worked on Broadway and in films.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Albert Valery in New Orleans. At age 6 he appeared
in a minstrel show that began his theatrical career. After
graduating from Louisiana State University and Catholic University
in Washington, he came to New York, where he studied with Uta Hagen
and at the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Dufour's first Broadway show was ``High Button Shoes,'' followed
by ``The Grass Harp,'' ``South Pacific,'' ``Picnic,'' ``Mister
Roberts'' and ``Stalag 17.'' He was also in revivals of ``Abie's
Irish Rose'' and ``Babes in Arms.'' In 1981 he acted with Danny
DeVito in an Off Broadway evening of one-act Pirandello plays, and
two years later he was in an Off Broadway version of ``Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde,'' starring Orson Bean.
</P>
<P>
   During seven years in Hollywood, Dufour was in many television
shows, including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Have Gun Will Travel.'' Among
his films were ``Ben Hur'' and ``King of Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four brothers, Irby, Filmore, Hillman and
Allen, all of Louisiana.

AMF BOWLING GETS 7 WEEKS TO REORGANIZE DEBTS OR FACE BANKRUPTCY
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)   By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMF Bowling, the world's largest operator of bowling alleys, has
been given seven weeks to come up with a plan for reorganizing its
debts or risk being pushed into bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   AMF, which is controlled by Goldman Sachs Group, said on Monday
that its lenders had agreed to waive some covenants of their loans
and allow AMF to skip a $13 million payment that is due on Sept.
15. The company, which is based in Richmond, Va., also disclosed
that the New York Stock Exchange had warned that AMF's depressed
stock price could cause it to be delisted.
</P>
<P>
   AMF has struggled for two years with slow growth and a
staggering debt load it took on in a bowling alley buying spree.
Its shares have traded for less than a $1 for two months and closed
Tuesday at 50 cents, up 3 cents. Goldman Sachs owns 54 percent of
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of the company's bonds also have sunk, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them Tuesday
on word of the plan to miss the debt payment. AMF said its lenders
set a deadline of Sept. 30 for a reorganization plan and Oct. 15
for approval by creditors.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P lowered AMF's corporate credit rating to CCC-minus from CCC
and lowered the rating on its subordinated debt two notches, to C,
the lowest rating short of default, from CCC-minus.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's, citing ``AMF's continued poor returns and insufficient
cash flow,'' cut its rating on the parent company's convertible
bonds to C from Caa2 and on its main subsidiary's subordinated
bonds to Ca from Caa1. The company owes more than $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a cat-and-mouse game,'' said Hal Diamond, an
analyst at S&AMP;P. ``The company has 30 days to cure the default or
the bondholders may choose to file the company into bankruptcy
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, AMF's bonds, which are classified as ``junk'' by
traders, were selling for about 25 percent of their face value,
said Phelps Hoyt, an analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in
Montpelier, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt said he thought the company would work out an arrangement
with bondholders to stave off a bankruptcy filing. That agreement
would likely be structured as an exchange of existing bonds for new
bonds that would carry smaller payments or no payments at all for
some period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would let the company see if they can turn it around,''
he said, and would ``let Goldman keep their equity, and if it's a
home run, fine.''

COURT LIMITS MONITORING OF CELL PHONES BY LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Tuesday struck down part of
a government order that had broadly expanded the ability of
law-enforcement agents to monitor cell phone conversations of
criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was considered a partial victory by privacy groups
that had challenged the order and was a clear setback for law
enforcement agencies, which must now consider revising the rules
for electronic surveillance of wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision by the the appeals court here gave the
authorities some of what they had sought. It upheld a provision of
the order that enabled federal agents to determine the general
location of a cell phone user by identifying which phone-company
antenna was used to transmit the beginning and end of a call.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit, which set out important statutory and
constitutional parameters for electronic surveillance, suggested
that agents seeking to monitor the location of suspects through
cell phones must first meet a high burden of proof to obtain a
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a provision of the year-old order by the
Federal Communications Commission that had required companies to
install equipment to detect telephone tones after a call is placed,
enabling agents to monitor the use of cell phones to make banking
transactions, get voice-mail messages, or send paging messages.
</P>
<P>
   It also struck comparable provisions that had required the
companies to install equipment to enable law enforcement agents to
monitor conference calls, call forwarding, call waiting and
messages left on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was filed last year by a coalition of telephone
industry groups that had complained that the government order was
too costly to implement and privacy rights organizations that said
the order had violated the constitutional rights of cell phone
users.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission issued the order last
August in an attempt to make it easier for law enforcement
authorities to monitor conversations on cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued the order after years of fruitless
negotiations by the government, industry and privacy groups to
implement a 1994 law, the Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act.
</P>
<P>
   That law required telephone companies and equipment makers to
build their networks in a way that enabled law enforcement to
intercept certain kinds of communications. It also imposed privacy
contraints and ordered regulators to implement standards in manner
that was least costly to industry.
</P>
<P>
   The issue posed by the appeal, U.S. Telecom Association v.
Federal Communications Commission, was whether the agency, in
issuing the order, exceeded its authority or failed to consider
privacy concerns and the financial costs of the new standards
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion written by Judge David S. Tatel and joined by
Judges Douglas H. Ginsburg and A. Raymond Randolph, the appeals
court found that in four instances that the FCC had failed to
explain the basis for its order properly. The judges also found
that the commission had failed to examine whether the standards
were too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that when the commission required that the
companies install equipment to monitor tones after phone calls are
made, the agency failed to consider the possible privacy
implications of its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers had defended the provision on the
grounds that after a telephone call is made, some callers use
``dial-around'' services like 1-800-CALL-ATT to then charge long
distance calls, a procedure that can be used to circumvent
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But the court accepted the concerns the privacy groups had that
the effect of the standard was to permit agents to also monitor
such activities as banking and paging by using the keyboard of a
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides of the case said that they had not decided
whether they would appeal Tuesday's ruling. If it is not appealed,
then the FCC must begin new proceedings to reconsider and possibly
rewrite its rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, government lawyers said, law enforcement
agencies will be constrained in their ability to monitor certain
kinds of communications through cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes amid growing concern by some lawmakers and
privacy groups that the government has been increasing its
electronic surveillance, and by competing concerns at the Federal
Bureau of Investigation that cannot keep up with advances in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, that debate has focused on a new computer
application called Carnivore that the FBI says it uses to sift
through millions of e-mail in order to monitor communications of
criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tuesday's decision did not directly address the issues
posed by the use of Carnivore, some privacy experts said that it
had important implications for how that computer application was
being used. The opinion generally upheld government surveillance of
digital communications through cell phones, a technology similar to
what is used for e-mail. As such, the opinion suggested
surveillance of e-mail would also be upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But the court also reiterated that to monitor the content of
those communications, federal agents must meet the same legal
standard as traditional wiretaps, and that innovative kinds of
surveillance cannot be used to circumvent those rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This imposes significant privacy protections on the use of
these capabilities and requires law enforcement to meet the highest
legal standards before using them,'' said David Sobel, general
counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
privacy-rghts group that was one of the organizations that had
challenged the rules.

VERIZON AND UNIONS CONTINUE TALKS, BUT NO MAJOR PROGRESS REPORTED 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unions representing more than 86,000 customer service workers
and technicians at Verizon Communications continued to wrangle with
the company over several issues Tuesday, extending a telephone
strike now in its 11th day.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon and the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are debating issues
that include job stress, mandatory overtime and the transfer of
work in response to the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, which
formed Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   No significant progress was reported from either side on
Tuesday. The unions and the company met for formal talks in
Washington on Tuesday morning, said people close to the
negotiations, and sidebar discussions continued throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are largely in agreement over wages, benefits and
a concession from Verizon allowing the unions to organize more
easily in the company's wireless division. But the differences over
work-place stress and the possible loss of job security because of
the merger have emerged as sticking points during the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike drags on, Verizon has attempted to deal with a
growing number of requests for telephone service, for repair of
existing service and vandalism. The company said it has had to
focus on repair requests instead of installations of new service
and has asked customers having problems receiving help from
directory assistance to look up numbers on its Web site
(www.bigyellow.com).
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, Verizon had to shut down a separate site to
which the company had been directing customers need to report
service problems, after an online magazine, SecurityFocus.com
alerted the company of a security breach that made it possible to
use the site to get access to customers' unlisted telephone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with other problems, Verizon has deployed about 30,000
non-union employees including managers and other staff such as
secretaries and attorneys to fill in for the 86,000 striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few days of the strike, the company had reported a
rash of vandalism, including severed lines. Those reports had
dwindled, but late Monday telephone service for 1,600 residential
and business customers in Massachusetts was knocked out after
vandals cuts three major cables at a pole in Tewksbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which managed to restore service by about noon
Tuesday, offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of people involved in the cable cutting.
``Whoever did this knew what they were doing,'' said Jack Hoey, a
Verizon spokesman in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was receiving about 80,000 requests for
repair each day, and dealing with as many of them as the fill-in
managers could handle.

IT TAKES A SOLID FOUNDATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By IDA L. CASTRO   (Ida L. Castro is the chairwoman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission; this was written with Deidre
Leipziger.)  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My parents were born in Puerto Rico. My father comes from a very
hard-working, large family _ all in all, there were 18 brothers and
sisters, and they helped maintain the little family farm. He came
to New York City in the early 1930s as a stowaway, looking for a
better life.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't speak one iota of English, and he had only the shirt
on his back. But he figured out how to survive _ became literally a
jack-of-all-trades, including a potato picker and assistant chef
for the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
</P>
<P>
   My mother also came here young, in the '30s, to help give a
better life to her family back in Puerto Rico. She worked as a
seamstress in a number of factories _ she'd learned how to sew
before she'd learned how to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   After they were married, my parents each worked three jobs a
day. They finally set up a bodega together. As they worked hard and
saved all they could, they would send for their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When I was about to be 7, my parents moved us to Puerto Rico.
They were grateful for the opportunities in New York, but also
eager to go back. There was a lot of hostility, lots of indignities
and obstacles in New York, and they wanted to give me and my
brother an environment in which we were judged by our merit, not by
our ethnic background. That was an important foundation for us.
</P>
<P>
   My father has only a second-grade education, and my mother only
a third-grade education, but if you met them you wouldn't believe
it. Education in my family was almost an obsession, not just with
my parents but with aunts and uncles on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a child, my father bought my brother and me what he
thought was the best encyclopedia in town: the Deluxe Britannica.
As my brother and I went to school and our learning increased, my
father read it to keep up, volume by volume.
</P>
<P>
   At home we debated all sorts of subjects. My father didn't have
much of a childhood, and didn't really know how to play with kids.
I'd read the newspaper so I could talk to him. We discussed Sputnik
and the Russians. I thought everybody did that. I found out later
on that this was not normal for a 7-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite TV programs were ``Laurel and Hardy'' and ``Abbott
and Costello.'' My mother would listen to the theme songs playing
and run over to turn off the TV. She would make me tell the
multiplication tables from one to 12, starting with zero _ and I
couldn't make a mistake _ before she'd turn the TV back on. After I
had that down pat, she'd have me do it in reverse, from 12 to one.
</P>
<P>
   When my own daughter was growing up, I made her do the
multiplication tables, but I didn't torture her.
</P>
<P>
   I'm grateful for the encouragement my parents gave and the
example they set. They told me that I could accomplish anything if
I put my mind to it. But they also wanted me to be ladylike.
Ultimately, I took the best of both positions. I would do
everything I put my mind to, and every once in a while would also
act ladylike. They were great risk takers and entrepreneurs, and
never took no for an answer. And that's a hallmark of my career.
</P>
<P>
   As much as my parents encouraged me to dream, as a child I never
dreamed I'd be working for the president of the United States, and
working in this capacity. I thought I'd be a pediatrician until I
discovered that when people told me their aches and pains I
fainted.

DEMAND FOR REGIONAL JETS BOOSTS EARNINGS AT EMRAER OF BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Benefiting from a vibrant demand for
regional jets, Brazilian aircraft maker Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica SA, or Embraer, reported a 35 percent gain in
second-quarter earnings Tuesday on a 54 percent surge in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Brazil's largest exporter of manufactured goods and
an emblem of Brazilian corporate success, earned 112.9 million
reais or $63 million compared with 83.6 million reais the year
before. Quarterly sales rose to 1.2 billion reais.
</P>
<P>
   The results reflect the demand for Embraer's short-haul regional
jets, the fastest growing segment of the commercial aviation
market. The planes seat 30 to 110 people, with a range of about
1,500 miles, and are more profitable to operate on many routes than
larger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the year, Embraer delivered 72 planes in
the 30- to 50-seater ERJ 135/145 family to airlines around the
world, up from 38 in the first half of 1999. In an effort to meet
increasing demand, Embraer has accelerated its production cycle to
14 planes a month and plans to speed up to 16 planes a month by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   The company's current backlog of undelivered airplanes is valued
at $20.7 billion, of which $15.5 billion are firm orders and $12.2
billion are options, Embraer said.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer's president, Mauricio Botelho, has said that the company
plans to invest about $1.4 billion between 2000 and 2004, with $1.1
billion going into development of new models and $300 million into
the construction of a new plant and research center. Embraer
recently began making the 44-seater ERJ 140, and is developing a
new family of jets in the 70 to 110-seat category.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of 2000, Embraer earnings more than doubled
to 210.4 million reais or $117 million on a 62 percent increase in
sales to 2.2 billion reais or $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's positive results helped draw attention away from
Brazil's recent loss at the World Trade Organization to Embraer
rival, Canada's Bombardier. The WTO, which arbitrates disputes
between member nations, is expected to rule in the next couple of
weeks over the value of sanctions the Canadian government can levy
on Brazilian imports.
</P>
<P>
   Embraer shares fell 2.3 percent to 10.7 reais on the Sao Paulo
exchange after having risen 5.8 percent on Monday. On the New York
Stock Exchange, Embraer's American Depositary Shares, which began
trading at $18.50 on July 21, fell 13/16 or 3.3 percent to $23
11/16.

AN ARTIST AND HIS MOUNTAIN GAIN NEW ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ The muralist, painter and author Tom Lea is
probably the only person, dead or alive, who can say he has been
threatened by Pancho Villa, interrupted by Chiang Kai-shek and
regaled by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Oddly enough, Lea was mostly
forgotten until he was quoted this month by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lea, who is 93, is sitting in the living room of his house on
the slope of the Franklin Mountains, the same simple home where he
and his wife, Sarah, have lived for decades above the dun-colored
streets of El Paso and its Mexican sister city, Ciudad Juarez. The
Texas folklorist J. Frank Dobie once surveyed the desert terrain
and complained that Lea did not even have a tree in his yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't have a mountain in yours,'' Lea answered.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lea, Bush was impressed with that mountain. Lea was
spending an evening at home when the telephone rang from the
Republican National Convention with the news that Bush planned to
mention him in his speech. Lea switched on the television and
watched the Texas governor quote a passage from his book ``A
Picture Gallery,'' in which he wrote of living ``on the east side
of the mountain:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sunrise side, not the sunset side. It's the side to
see the day that is coming, not to see the day that is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech and subsequent national attention have sparked a
happy, if modest, renaissance for Lea. He has always had passionate
admirers, and his drawings and paintings are displayed in museums,
including a gallery carrying his name at the El Paso Museum of Art.
But he was largely forgotten outside Texas. Now, a national art
magazine has inquired with his dealer, Adair Margo, about a
profile. The wire services ran stories of his emotional response to
the speech. Friends called with congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very moved,'' Lea recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He is fiddling with a hand-carved cane embossed with his name, a
gift from a fan. He can no longer see well enough to paint or read,
and even when he could, he always kept his distance from the modern
art world with its infatuation with introspection and
experimentation. The world that inspired him lay outside his
window.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would give an aspiring artist or writer,
Lea responded without hesitation, ``I'd tell them I hope they'll
study from life.''
</P>
<P>
   His own beginnings in El Paso, where he was born in 1907, came
when the city was little more than a dusty passageway north from
Mexico. Once, Lea's father, who served as mayor in 1915, jailed the
wife of Pancho Villa for gun running. Infuriated, the Mexican
bandit and revolutionary put a bounty on the mayor's head and
promised to kidnap Tom and his brother, Joe _ a threat that got the
boys a police bodyguard to and from school.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso sparked his imagination but offered Lea little in the
way of artistic training, so he went to the Chicago Art Institute
and studied under the muralist John Warner Norton. Lea illustrated
for magazines and painted murals, like ``The Nesters,'' for the
Benjamin Franklin Post Office in Washington. By World War II, his
work attracted the attention of Henry Luce, the Life magazine
publisher who hired him as an illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled more than 100,000 miles, painting the sinking of the
aircraft carrier Wasp in the North Atlantic and landing with the
marines on Peleliu Island in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Luce once dispatched him to paint a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek,
then the nationalist leader of China. Chiang, Lea recalled, arrived
with a sofa pillow and a miniature Big Ben clock. He placed the
pillow behind his back for support and set the clock ticking as Lea
began his profile. When 25 minutes passed, the clock rang clanged
and Chiang abruptly left. Lea then went upstairs, where Madame
Chiang proved a more willing subject. As she posed, Chiang entered
the room in an evening robe, bowing toward his wife, then to an
aide and then to Lea before leaving without a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she told Lea, ``my husband would be quite handsome
if he would keep his teeth in.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the war, Luce dispatched Lea to the White House to
present a collection of Life war paintings to Roosevelt, who spent
20 minutes chatting about how such works too often ended up in the
offices of one admiral or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Henry Luce and I have solved that,''' Lea recalled
of the president's deal to take control of the works. His painting
of the sinking of the Wasp remains on display at the U.S. Army
Center of Military History in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, Lea returned to El Paso, where he has
remained, even as interests broadened. He went to Mexico to study
the fighting black bulls and wrote and illustrated his first novel,
``The Brave Bulls,'' which became a best seller and a movie. His
subsequent novel of the border, ``The Wonderful Country,'' became a
best seller in 1952. In the movie, which starred Robert Mitchum,
Lea played the barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving old Mitchum a shave, and he needed one,'' Lea joked.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote other books, including ``The King Ranch,'' a two-volume
account of Texas' most famous ranch that established him as a
historian.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1992, when he joined with Margo, Lea never had an art
agent or dealer. Patrons simply inquired, and he put their names on
a list. When he finished a painting, Margo said, he would call the
next person on the list and invite the person to El Paso to take a
look. One painting not for sale, now or ever, is a portrait of his
wife of 62 years, ``Sarah in the Summertime,'' that hangs in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stand by that one,'' he says. ``Destroy all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leas were introduced to Bush and his wife, Laura, a few
years ago by Margo. A friendship ensued, and Bush honored the
couple at a dinner at the governor's mansion. Bush also quoted
Lea's passage from ``A Picture Gallery'' in one of his State of the
State addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The El Paso outside Lea's window is very different now. The
cowboys are harder to find, and the dusty border town is part of a
metropolitan area of more than 2 million people. Lea's yard now has
a tree, an Arizona cypress, and a carpet of green grass. His only
regret is that he can no longer paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I ever lifted a brush, I hoped I would make a
better painting,'' he said. ``That's my true wish: that I would be
a better painter than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the vantage point of the east side of the mountain, he
was more than good enough.

DEMOCRATS UPSTAGING GOP ON GRASP OF CONVENTION AS SHOWBIZ 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment to savor from the first days of the Democratic
convention did not come from any speech or from the uninspired
passing-of-the-torch from Bill Clinton to Al Gore in the Midwest
Tuesday in a photo-op that left Gore looking diminished.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was the irresistible moment when Clinton hoisted an Oscar
in his hand, given to him by California's governor, Gray Davis, at
a party at Paramount studios after Clinton's triumphant convention
speech on Monday. The image, which popped up on the cable news
channels and ``Entertainment Tonight,'' was almost too telling:
Bill Clinton is a once-in-a-lifetime political performer, at home
at this Hollywood convention.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than Clinton's star presence that has made the
Democratic convention more effective as television than the
Republican meeting was two weeks ago. Simply by lining up Caroline
Kennedy to speak in prime time, the Democrats revealed their grasp
of the convention as show business.
</P>
<P>
   She is the kind of personality who might attract viewers who
care nothing about politics (just as Christopher Reeve was the name
attraction at the Democratic convention four years ago). And she
provided the ripple effect of publicity few can, as she gave bland
interviews on Tuesday night's ABC, CBS and NBC evening news
programs alongside her uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Caroline factor is more emotional than high-minded, more
practical than political, and good marketing: viewers who come to
gawk at a celebrity may pick up a bit of the party's message along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Going in, the Democrats had more glitter to work with than the
Republicans. It was amusing to see stars line up to be interviewed
by the floor reporters, then evade the Joe
Lieberman-meets-Hollywood question. Christie Brinkley, a New York
delegate, was on CNN and Fox News; Sarah Jessica Parker was on
MSNBC. Asked about Lieberman's criticism of Hollywood as
irresponsibly loaded with sex and violence, they said it was great
that America allows for different opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Clinton's farewell speech that made him the
convention's true name above the title, demonstrating that he can
do what none of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates
on either ticket can: engage the camera and maintain a visceral
connection with his audience even when he's saying something
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, Lieberman and George W. Bush can all manage that emotional
contact in casual, close-up television appearances. (Dick Cheney
has trouble even with that much.) When making a serious point,
their own eyes seem to glaze over; imagine what happens to ours.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton said in his speech that it would be a mistake
to underestimate American military strength, he looked into the
camera ominously, as if staring down an enemy with his glare.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's mastery of political theater includes a shrewd
grasp of how it has changed in the age of talk-show confessions. By
talking about his need for forgiveness before an audience of
ministers and television cameras last week, he got the Lewinsky
affair out of the way before the convention. But even the famed
Clinton compartmentalizing only goes so far.
</P>
<P>
   His contrite appearance before the ministers was not quickly
shuffled to the video archives. Clips have been played so
relentlessly that it must be at least as familiar to viewers as any
snippet of his convention speech. In the end, even Clinton can't
completely control his image.
</P>
<P>
   And if he, with his supreme mastery of the media, can't do that,
what hope is there for a media mortal like Al Gore? His iconic
moment boomeranged Tuesday. In the joint appearance in Michigan,
Clinton spoke briefly, then relinquished his place behind the
podium with the presidential seal to the Gore, who took off his
jacket as he stepped forward. Maybe he was hot. But there has been
so much publicity about the reconstructed Gore images that the move
seemed calculated to show him in a more casual light and to
distinguish him from the president. Clinton would have made such a
gesture seem natural, even if it wasn't. Gore made it seem false,
even if it was genuine.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that while Gore was giving a typically stiff
speech, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and even Tipper Gore, stood
behind him waving to the crowd, whispering to each other, looking
as restless as a group of bored schoolchildren. If he couldn't keep
his friends and family interested, what will he do in his big
acceptance speech on Thursday?

BUSH STILL UNDECIDED OVER DEBATES, AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than eight months after the presidential
debate schedule was announced, Governor George W. Bush has not yet
committed to any of the three proposed debates and may participate
in only two, sources familiar with the process and campaign aides
say.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has ``not decided on the number of debates'' he will
attend, communications director Karen Hughes, said Tuesday, raising
the possibility that he would skip one of the events announced by
the Commission on Presidential Debates last January. Although Bush
plans on debating Vice President Al Gore in some fashion, his aides
``have not really had a formal discussion yet'' to determine what
settings would be appropriate, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe President Clinton and Bob Dole debated twice. I
believe two times has been the norm,'' Hughes said. ``But we have
not really talked through all those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has long said he would make his decision after the
conclusion of both conventions and is expected to do so in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The vague response from the Bush campaign is a growing concern
for officials in the cities hosting the debates, including the
first one scheduled in Boston Oct. 3 at the University of
Massachusetts. If Bush narrows his participation to two sites, it
would surprise few if he opts to bypass the liberal Northeast, a
region he largely avoids and one Republican official wryly
described as ``one of the less hospitable locations available.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the Bush campaign and the debate commission
point out that formal invitations have not been extended, a delay
designed to give third-party candidates a chance to rise high
enough in the polls to meet commission criteria for participation.
Both Bush and Gore are expected to be invited, and Gore agreed to
all three debates months ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the obvious question is whether a debate might expose
his weakest suit, creating a free-wheeling setting in which he
might make a verbal lapse or succumb to grilling by Gore on policy
details.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush, with a long-standing lead in the polls,
may have no real need for further exposure, several political
strategists said. But he could benefit from sharing a stage with
Gore, showing off his characteristic calm and humor and thereby
appearing more affable than his opponent, several Republican
officials said. And the public relations risk of rejecting one of
the three debates so late in the season is great, opening Bush to
accusations of being either scared or too arrogant to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore has pursued this line of attack, creating a
``debate duck countdown'' on his Web site and challenging Bush to
follow his example. And the Gore campaign has another, more potent
weapon on its side: David Letterman, who invited the two men to
debate on his late-night show and has relentlessly roasted Bush
ever since for failing to sign on. Gore has said he would do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get anybody from George W. Bush's office to return
our call,'' Letterman told his audience earlier this month. ``If
this is the way they run the campaign, how do you think they're
going to run the country?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a spokesman for the Gore campaign was clearly delighted
that the issue remains unresolved. Speaking by telephone from the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, spokesman Doug
Hattaway accused the Texas governor of ``ducking debates because he
wants to avoid talking about real issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we begin debating the issues, it becomes clear that
Bush's agenda is just a massive tax cut for the rich,'' Hattaway
said. Told that Bush might consider attending only two debates
instead of three, he said it would be ``part of a strategy of
avoiding debates in any way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was essentially calling the Texas governor a
chicken, Hattaway said: ``Duck is the closest I'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, the Bush communcations director, pointed out that the
Texas governor participated in numerous debates with his Republican
rivals earlier this year. If Gore accuses Bush of avoiding the
debates, she said, ``the vice president has a problem with
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the delay in making the decision is due to the number
of requests that have been extended. ``We've got a big stack of
debate'' invitations, Hughes said. Bush has also been practicing
his debating skills for months, indicating that he is serious about
participating. But not until the end of the Republican convention
has he turned his full thoughts to the next event, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Few political strategists, Republican or Democrat, believe Bush
is going to skip all of the events. To do so would be to defy
recent history. After a 16-year silence that began in 1960, every
presidential race since 1976 has included some form of debate among
candidates. And since 1988, the debates have been officially
organized by the non-partisan commission.
</P>
<P>
   The number of debates has, in fact, varied. In 1988 two
presidential debates were held, as well as one vice presidential
debate. Four years later, there were three presidential debates. In
1996 three presidential debates were scheduled. But when Middle
East peace negotiations grew serious, President Clinton and Senator
Bob Dole agreed to hold only two, said John Scardino, media
director for the Commission on Presidential Debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, we'd like to believe candidates would respect the
process we've come up with as an independent organization,''
Scardino said. ``We will do everything we can, but realistically,
there is no law that says there has to be any debate at all.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, in addition to Boston, debates are scheduled for Oct.
11 in St. Louis and Oct. 17 in Wake Forest, N.C. A separate vice
presidential debate is set for Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky. Alterative
sites are Madison, Wis., and St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Each debate costs about $550,000 to stage. The money is raised
by local host committees, and the commission also uses corportate
sponsors to help cover the expense.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: WITH SKIES CHOKED, A RAIL ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `t' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Daily Mail of London noted in an article this week that some
airlines in Europe are ``manipulating timetables'' _ arbitrarily
adding minutes to schedules to buy time against flight delays. One
flight from London to Paris that took 50 minutes in 1975 now is
scheduled for 95 minutes. That's five minutes longer than the same
flight took in 1947, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, as air traffic systems strain under the increased
demand, a third of the flights in Western Europe are delayed. Yet,
as annoying as this undoubtedly is, there is none of the same sense
of crisis in Europe as in the United States over mounting gridlock
in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that there are alternatives. In Europe, the
railroads remain vital components of the transportation system.
Experienced American business travelers, traveling through Europe
on those itineraries that flip them rapidly from one city to
another, have learned that the train is almost always a better bet
on a trip of 400 miles or less.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed trains traveling at speeds up to 200 miles an hour on
new networks of dedicated track have become major competitors to
airlines for the short-haul business travel market, said Joseph M.
Fiorenza, vice president for business travel services of Rail
Europe, a joint venture of the French and Swiss national railroads
that sells European rail services in the United States
(www.raileurope.com or 888 382-7245).
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of business travelers, the whole air-to-rail
equation is changing now that they can get from London to Paris,
say, in about three hours _ and that's downtown to downtown, not
outlying airport to airport,'' Fiorenza said.
</P>
<P>
   Eurostar passenger trains now make as many as 24 departures a
day from London to Paris (three hours) or Brussels (2 hours and 36
minutes). On other European rail systems, trains are taking market
share from planes. High-speed rail now accounts for 17 percent of
all western European passenger traffic. In France, the figure is 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, can we expect ever to see anything
approaching that kind of rail service as the air travel system
reaches capacity?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we have a long way to go, on bumpy roadbed,
before more than a relative handful of frequent travelers will
regard trains as a practical alternative to planes. While European
train lines persevered and improved over the years, the
once-awesome U.S. rail system degenerated into a comparative
Toonerville Trolley operation.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, the government-subsidized national rail company created
in 1970 to salvage some intercity rail service, has swallowed an
estimated $25 billion in subsidies since its inception. Some
critics say the money hasn't bought anything approaching a
first-rate rail system.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amtrak's costly and much-heralded Acela Express,
promising 150-mile-an-hour trains cutting about an hour off the
more than four hours travel time between New York and Boston, has
been delayed for more than a year because of track problems and
design problems with the trains themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are some small signs that, here and
there, trains are hauling at least a handful of people who
otherwise might be adding to sky-crowding. Last week, Amtrak said
that ridership on the heavily traveled Northeast corridor route was
up 6 percent in July. Travel to the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia accounted for some of that, but Amtrak said that
some appears to have come from passengers who took the train
because they were disgusted with routine flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 percent of the passengers on the Northeast corridor in
the 1998 fiscal year were business travelers, said Rick Remington,
an Amtrak spokesman. Critics of Amtrak as a sluggish bureaucracy
might find it interesting that the latest demographic information
Amtrak would provide for its ridership is two years old. Rail
Europe was able to readily produce current figures.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Amtrak eventually gets its Acela high-speed trains to
run, it remains to be seen whether more than a handful of American
business travelers will follow the patterns in western Europe,
where a three-hour trip has become the point at which the scale
tips between air and rail.
</P>
<P>
   Even with 1998 numbers, though, the prospects are interesting
for the 18.3 million passengers Amtrak says traveled by train or
air on Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Washington routes. Of that
number, the train got about 71 percent of all passengers traveling
between New York and Washington, a trip that takes about three
hours maximum.
</P>
<P>
   But between New York and Boston, a trip that now takes over four
hours by train, ``the figures really flip-flop,'' Remington said.
On that route, planes get about 71 percent of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The three hours is the tipping point here as well, he said,
adding, ``That's what high-speed rail is all about _ to get our New
York-Boston market share closer to what we are between New York and
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it would be a start. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once before, an incumbent vice president who had
loyally served a popular two-term president ran against a
successful governor with little national campaign experience. By
midsummer, he, too, found himself faced with a deficit in the
polls, struggling to define himself beyond the shadow of the
president he served.
</P>
<P>
   Having worked on Vice President George Bush's campaign in 1988,
I can see the similarities to this year. Al Gore's advisers have
certainly studied them, too, but does no one in the his camp think
it's a bad sign when your rallying cry is ``Remember Dukakis''? And
have these advisers forgotten that Gov. George W. Bush might have
learned a thing or two working on his father's 1988 campaign?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the differences between then and now should serve as a
cautionary tale for Gore, not a source of hope.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Vice President Bush came limping out of the primaries.
He had faced a bitter fight against Sen. Bob Dole and attacks from
Pat Robertson on the right. This year, by contrast, Vice President
Gore's challenger, Bill Bradley, wilted after New Hampshire, and
Gore went on to easy wins in state after state. Shouldn't the vice
president have been stronger after his painless primaries than Bush
was in 1988 after his bruising battle?
</P>
<P>
   Also, in 1988 Michael Dukakis defeated his rivals stealthily,
remaining relatively unknown until he was the last man standing
against the left-wing candidacy of Jesse Jackson. George W. Bush,
by contrast, had to slug it out with Sen. John McCain in New
Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan before his later victories
in New York, California and across the South. Shouldn't he be
weaker than Dukakis was at this point in the 1988 campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Some recent polls have Bush ahead now by roughly the same
percentage as Dukakis was at this point in 1988. Atwater and I were
skeptical then of Dukakis' lead. Today, though I believe that
Bush's true lead is probably not the 10 percentage points that some
polls estimate, I believe it is solid and durable.
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis was what Lee Atwater called a ``phenomena candidate.''
He came out of nowhere and quickly went somewhere in the polls,
capturing attention and imagination in the process. But his lead,
although intimidating, was weak and frothy. Instead of solidifying
his edge after the primaries, he squandered it by running an
unfocused and defensive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater always said, ``In politics, never kick a man when he's
up.'' The obvious corollary is to attack when your opponent is
weak. Dukakis took his lead for granted and failed to go after us
when we were at our weakest.
</P>
<P>
   After the conventions were over in 1988, we felt Dukakis had to
solidify his lead and go on the offensive to keep Vice President
Bush on the ropes. Much to our surprise, he did neither.
</P>
<P>
   Bush headquarters in 1988 had a giddy moment during the
Democratic Convention when Dukakis said the election was about
competence, not ideology. This was an unmistakable sign that he
would run a dry campaign for chief clerk, not for leader of the
free world. We soon knew that Bush could be on his way to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore wants to say, ``I'm like Bush in '88.'' But take it from
someone who was there: he looks more like Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   (Edward M. Rogers Jr., vice chairman of the lobbying firm
Barbour Griffith &AMP; Rogers, was deputy to Lee Atwater, the campaign
manager for Vice President George Bush in 1988.)

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The story of the Russian nuclear submarine sunk at the
bottom of the Barents Sea with a 116-man crew is terrifying, but it
should not be a surprise, especially to the Russian navy. Though
the submarine, the Kursk, is one of Russia's newest, and though the
details of what went wrong are still sketchy, the only surprise is
that this is Russia's first serious submarine accident in more than
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, which has been deteriorating for many
years, is now running on a mere $5 billion a year, in contrast to
the $300 billion the United States spends annually on defense. From
this meager allowance, Russia's commanders must pay 1.2 million
soldiers and maintain one of the two largest nuclear arsenals in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a Russian navy that by many accounts cannot
properly take care of its ships or submarines. According to
reliable Russian reports, routine maintenance is rare and, when it
is done, it is not always handled properly. Submarines often break
down and spend most of their time at military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Crew members are unable to conduct routine military exercises.
The skills and qualifications of the officers have eroded, and
young sailors, usually raw recruits, don't gain necessary
experience. Because officers are paid poorly, frequently less than
$100 a month, if they are paid at all, moonlighting is common,
meaning that they probably pay divided attention to their primary
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said that the Kursk was carrying no nuclear
weapons and that its reactors were shut down. Since the Soviet
collapse, the Russian navy has taken approximately 180 of its
nuclear subs out of service. But it has been unable to dismantle
more than 100 of them. Those vessels are kept afloat near their
former bases or their dismantlement sites _ two-thirds in the north
of Russia, on the Kola Peninsula and the White Sea, and one third
in East Asia, the Sea of Japan and Kamchatka. The subs are largely
deserted, some reportedly without security, even though highly
radioactive reactor cores remain on board.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is considerable. The vast majority
of decommissioned submarines have two reactors each. Therefore, one
or more of the 200 reactor cores could conceivably sink, sooner or
later. Already at least one decommissioned sub has sunk _
fortunately, any reactor cores had been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Russian government has mismanaged the stockpiles
it inherited from the Soviet Union. But it is more than Moscow's
problem. Any accident could result in the contamination of Pacific
and Arctic waters with radiation, and ocean currents and migrating
fish could spread it. Norway is just 30 miles away from one of
Russia's largest sites for decommissioned submarines in the Barents
Sea, and Alaska shares the Bering Sea with Kamchatka.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, the United States, Japan and Norway
have given Russia money to help dismantle nuclear submarines. But
dangers still exist, and efforts aimed at preventing further
accidents should be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia inherited huge foreign debts from the Soviet Union _
about $80 billion. Moscow cannot pay this debt in full. Would it
not be fair to forgive part of the debt under the condition that
the saved money will be spent on dismantling the remaining nuclear
submarines?
</P>
<P>
   This solution would also solve another problem. Europeans, who
benefited the most from the end of the Cold War, have not financed
their fair share of the Russian disarmament. The
debt-relief-for-disarmament option would change the situation; the
bulk of the Russia debt is owed to European nations. And it is
Europe, where the fear of another Chernobyl is the greatest, that
has the most interest in seeing the submarines dismantled.

COPS JUST WANNA GO HOME; KIDS JUST WANNA STAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, the confrontation between young people
and police that took place in the parking lot outside the
Democratic Convention on Monday night came down to what it often
comes down to: a stand-off between police officers who want to go
home and kids who don't want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the kids who don't want to go home _ a group of
indeterminate size that mingled with the political or anarchistic
groups outside the Democratic convention _ are a very special kind
of protest group in themselves. They don't have a formal
organization, membership, posters or agenda. But they are
everywhere these days, causing all kinds of problems, chiefly
because they don't want to go home and they want to be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   They made headlines at Woodstock 99 in Rome, N.Y., last summer,
when the festival ended unexpectedly early and the former Air Force
base erupted in arson and vandalism. Pundits pointed the finger at
factors from the heat to the high cost of bottled water, to the
lack of sanitation. But lurking behind it all was the restlessness
of the kids who don't want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the designated protest area where the
politically inflammatory rock and rap band Rage Against the Machine
was setting up for a free concert Monday felt a lot like Woodstock
99. Before the music started, excitable rock fans were moshing and
body-surfing. When the music stopped at 7:24 p.m. after a 40-minute
set, the audience simply turned its attention to another stage: the
fence separating the protest area from two rows of police officers
in riot gear and, behind them, the convention itself.
</P>
<P>
   Soon at least a dozen in the crowd were lobbing glass bottles,
smoke bombs and even a No Parking sign at the police. Eventually
the police moved in with rubber bullets and pepper spray. For Mike
Bigge, a 23-year-old Los Angeles resident, the show had just begun
when objects started flying. ``I came for a good time, and now I'm
having one,'' he said as mounted police forced panicked protesters
and rock fans out of the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Among those initially throwing projectiles was a teen-ager in a
black t-shirt who declined to give his name for fear of arrest. He
lit a firecracker and threw it over the fence. Why? ``Why not?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Was there anything in particular he was protesting? ``No,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed before, during and after the
confrontation harbored not a single political thought. ``I don't
really have an opinion on the convention,'' said Alberto Freire, a
13-year-old Rage fan from Torrance, Calif., before the disturbance
began.
</P>
<P>
   There were as many video and still cameras held in the air
during the Rage show as protest posters. Several camera-carrying
fans who showed up for the concert said they were not there to
convey a message to the Democratic party but to gather content for
their Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   If the convention in the hall is mostly a political show for TV,
the message of the medium applies to controlling crowds at concerts
as well: Put the police and a good rock band outside, and the crowd
will watch the band. But when the band wraps up early, the crowd's
attention will turn to whatever sideshow remains: the police. On
Monday, it was between acts _ after Rage's performance and before
the following group, a lesser-known Latin jam band called Ozomatli
_ that audience members started provoking the police.
</P>
<P>
   When Ozomatli started performing, the crowd at the fence started
to drift over to the stage to see which show was more entertaining.
But it was too late. During Ozomatli's second song, a police
commander walked on stage and announced that the gathering had been
declared unlawful and that the crowd had 15 minutes to disperse.
People lingered.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the police commander tried something ingenious:
he told Ozomatli to make music and lead the crowd out of the
parking lot Pied Piper-style, according to Bubba Cervantes, the
band's security guard. Band members picked up drums and started
playing, and the crowd gathered in a circle around them. Then, the
band began marching the group, comprising almost all of the several
hundred protesters who remained, towards the North exit of the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   But before they could reach the exit, as the time limit expired,
mayhem broke out and the police fired pepper spray, beanbags, and
rubber bullets, turning the march into a stampede.

 &HT;    Dell puts some muscle behind Linux operating system
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Michael Dell isn't about to abandon longtime
ally Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But as his Dell Computer Corp. continues to expand beyond
desktop computers and to more high-power, high-profit products like
Internet servers, it will rely more and more on the once-obscure
but fast-growing Linux software, Dell said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Linux as a significant growth opportunity for Dell,''
he told about 15,000 software designers and others attending the
LinuxWorld Conference &AMP; Expo.
</P>
<P>
   Dell is putting his money where his mouth is. Dell Computer has
invested millions in research and development for Linux-based
products, Dell said. Separately, its Dell Ventures subsidiary has
pumped millions more into Linux-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 10 percent of all servers sold by Dell Computer use
Linux, the free, open-source software that _ like Dell Computer _
has its roots in a college dorm room and grew with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vast majority of Dell machines run on Windows-based
software.
</P>
<P>
   Dell declined to give projections on how much of the company's
business might eventually come from selling Linux-based equipment,
but he said Linux's growth is more promising than proprietary
server software such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT and Sun
Microsystem Inc.'s Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Internet age, Linux makes far more sense that the
proprietary products now offered by some of our competitors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's appearance at the fourth annual LinuxWorld was the first
by a major computing executive and in itself provided a major boost
to the growing following of Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Other big-name companies also are putting their support behind
the system.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., Hewlett Packard Corp., Compaq Computer
Corp. and IBM Corp. are among those behind a new Linux organization
called the Gnome Foundation, whose goal is to create a suite of
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to do is get all these companies working
together,'' said Miguel de Icaza, founder of the Gnome project,
which resulted in Tuesday's collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   What all the companies are all trying to do is get a piece of
the fast-growing market for Linux.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after University of Helsinki at Finland student Linus
Torvalds invented the software and released it for free to the
world, Linux is the second-most popular server operating system
behind Windows, according to researcher International Data Corp.
Windows has about 38 percent of the server software market, while
Linux has about 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is much smaller in the personal desktop computer business,
however, capturing only about 4 percent of the market, just behind
Macintosh's 5 percent and Windows's 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But IDC predicts Linux will replace Macintosh in the No. 2 spot
within the next four years, and that it will continue to gain
ground in the server software business _ something that makes folks
like Dell pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone from sort of a secret movement to something much
much bigger,'' Dell said a press conference after giving Tuesday's
keynote speech at LinuxWorld. ``The key difference is that you have
much more broad, open support today.''

POLITICS SMILES ON THE NETWORKS

<P>
   The ratings picture was generally positive for the TV networks
for opening night of the Democratic National Convention, with most
networks notching increases when compared with the convention four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, however, viewers continued to show a decided preference
for nonpolitical programs. For instance, 80,000 Boston-area
households switched from WHDH-TV (Channel 7) when ``Dateline'' gave
way to convention coverage. On WCVB-TV (Channel 5), more than
45,000 households tuned out when ``Monday Night Football'' ended
and convention coverage began.
</P>
<P>
   The first night of the Democratic conclave was a made-for-TV
spectacle whose headliners didn't appear until just a half-hour
before the end of prime time. President Bill Clinton did not begin
his speech Monday night until 10:52 EST, 40 minutes later than
party officials had planned. His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did
not start her own speech until nearly 10:30 p.m. That could have
damaged the Democrats' chances of reaching a large audience,
especially on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But collectively, according to Nielsen Media Research, coverage
on the ``Big Three'' drew a combined audience of 17.2 million
viewers Monday night, nearly a million more viewers than tuned in
to the first night of the Democratic convention in 1996. NBC and
ABC both increased their audiences from four years ago, though CBS
was down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a bigger draw four years ago, when his acceptance
speech on the final night of the convention was watched by more
than 20 million viewers on the Big Three networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC did not cover the first night of the Republican convention
last month, but the audiences for ABC and CBS Monday night _ 5.99
million viewers and 5.2 million viewers, respectively _ were
roughly the same as their opening-night audiences at the GOP
conclave.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of viewership, ABC won by a whisker, followed by NBC,
with 5.95 million, and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Broadcasting Service increased its audience Monday
night to 3 million viewers from the 2.3 million who tuned in for
its coverage of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three all-news cable networks improved on their
performance from day one of the Republican National Convention. CNN
drew 1.8 million viewers Monday night for Clinton's speech,
compared with 1.2 million who tuned in to hear retired General
Colin Powell kick off the GOP convention. CNN's audience was also
up substantially from the first night of the Democratic convention
in 1996. However, the CNN audience for Clinton's speech was much
smaller than the 2.7 million who tuned in for his acceptance speech
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for Fox News Channel dropped from 676,000 viewers
at the kickoff of the GOP convention to 420,000 viewers for the
Democratic conclave. The third all-news network, MSNBC, enlarged
its audience, increasing to 632,000 viewers from the 516,000 it
drew for the first night of the Republican convention.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: WITH SKIES CHOKED, A RAIL ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `f' code) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Daily Mail of London noted in an article this week that some
airlines in Europe are ``manipulating timetables'' _ arbitrarily
adding minutes to schedules to buy time against flight delays. One
flight from London to Paris that took 50 minutes in 1975 now is
scheduled for 95 minutes. That's five minutes longer than the same
flight took in 1947, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, as air traffic systems strain under the increased
demand, a third of the flights in Western Europe are delayed. Yet,
as annoying as this undoubtedly is, there is none of the same sense
of crisis in Europe as in the United States over mounting gridlock
in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that there are alternatives. In Europe, the
railroads remain vital components of the transportation system.
Experienced American business travelers, traveling through Europe
on those itineraries that flip them rapidly from one city to
another, have learned that the train is almost always a better bet
on a trip of 400 miles or less.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed trains traveling at speeds up to 200 miles an hour on
new networks of dedicated track have become major competitors to
airlines for the short-haul business travel market, said Joseph M.
Fiorenza, vice president for business travel services of Rail
Europe, a joint venture of the French and Swiss national railroads
that sells European rail services in the United States
(www.raileurope.com or 888 382-7245).
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of business travelers, the whole air-to-rail
equation is changing now that they can get from London to Paris,
say, in about three hours _ and that's downtown to downtown, not
outlying airport to airport,'' Fiorenza said.
</P>
<P>
   Eurostar passenger trains now make as many as 24 departures a
day from London to Paris (three hours) or Brussels (2 hours and 36
minutes). On other European rail systems, trains are taking market
share from planes. High-speed rail now accounts for 17 percent of
all western European passenger traffic. In France, the figure is 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, can we expect ever to see anything
approaching that kind of rail service as the air travel system
reaches capacity?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we have a long way to go, on bumpy roadbed,
before more than a relative handful of frequent travelers will
regard trains as a practical alternative to planes. While European
train lines persevered and improved over the years, the
once-awesome U.S. rail system degenerated into a comparative
Toonerville Trolley operation.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, the government-subsidized national rail company created
in 1970 to salvage some intercity rail service, has swallowed an
estimated $25 billion in subsidies since its inception. Some
critics say the money hasn't bought anything approaching a
first-rate rail system.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amtrak's costly and much-heralded Acela Express,
promising 150-mile-an-hour trains cutting about an hour off the
more than four hours travel time between New York and Boston, has
been delayed for more than a year because of track problems and
design problems with the trains themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are some small signs that, here and
there, trains are hauling at least a handful of people who
otherwise might be adding to sky-crowding. Last week, Amtrak said
that ridership on the heavily traveled Northeast corridor route was
up 6 percent in July. Travel to the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia accounted for some of that, but Amtrak said that
some appears to have come from passengers who took the train
because they were disgusted with routine flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 percent of the passengers on the Northeast corridor in
the 1998 fiscal year were business travelers, said Rick Remington,
an Amtrak spokesman. Critics of Amtrak as a sluggish bureaucracy
might find it interesting that the latest demographic information
Amtrak would provide for its ridership is two years old. Rail
Europe was able to readily produce current figures.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Amtrak eventually gets its Acela high-speed trains to
run, it remains to be seen whether more than a handful of American
business travelers will follow the patterns in western Europe,
where a three-hour trip has become the point at which the scale
tips between air and rail.
</P>
<P>
   Even with 1998 numbers, though, the prospects are interesting
for the 18.3 million passengers Amtrak says traveled by train or
air on Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Washington routes. Of that
number, the train got about 71 percent of all passengers traveling
between New York and Washington, a trip that takes about three
hours maximum.
</P>
<P>
   But between New York and Boston, a trip that now takes over four
hours by train, ``the figures really flip-flop,'' Remington said.
On that route, planes get about 71 percent of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The three hours is the tipping point here as well, he said,
adding, ``That's what high-speed rail is all about _ to get our New
York-Boston market share closer to what we are between New York and
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it would be a start. &QL;

DEFENSE BLAMES BIAS IN PROSECUTION OF LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.M.)   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ In the first of two days of potentially
pivotal hearings in the case of the scientist accused of
mishandling important nuclear weapons secrets, defense lawyers
offered evidence Tuesday suggesting that the scientist was singled
out for prosecution largely because he was Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, who has been held for
eight months on charges that he improperly downloaded some of the
country's most sensitive nuclear secrets, offered affidavits and
interviews from a number of top intelligence officials suggesting
that Lee was made the target of the investigation at least in part
because of his ethnicity, while some whites who might also have
come under suspicion were not pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosecutors have denied these allegations, the
defense contentions are among the reasons that Asian-Americans, the
American Civil Liberties Union and some other legal groups have
embraced Lee's case as an example of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the arguments in U.S. District Court here Tuesday
are not expected to be known for several days at least as the
judge, James Parker, decides whether to allow the defense to gain
access to reams of government documents regarding investigations of
Asian-Americans on security matters. If the defense is given access
and is able to prove that Lee was unfairly singled out for
prosecution, the judge could order that the charges in the 59-count
indictment be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially more significant hearing is scheduled for
Wednesday, in which the defense will argue again that Lee, who is
60, be released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was denied bail twice, in December and again in January,
largely because government experts contended that he had mishandled
what amounted to the ``crown jewels'' of the country's weapons
program and that if the secrets found their way to a foreign power
they could alter the international balance of military power.
</P>
<P>
   A number of portable computer tapes on which Lee stored the
secrets are missing and, though Lee has said he destroyed them, the
government has insisted he may be able to pass them to a hostile
country if he is released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has affidavits from a former Los Alamos director and
some other experts arguing that much of what Lee downloaded from a
secure to an unsecure computer at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory was either already available publicly, would be of
modest or no use to most countries, and was not even given a secret
classification until after Lee had been fired last year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the judge earlier appeared to have relied heavily
on government allegations that Lee deceived another Los Alamos
scientist by using the other person's computer for downloading. The
defense says it now has evidence that no such deception took place.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have indicated with their filings that they
still believe Lee presents a grave risk and that bail is not
justified.

 &HT;    As weather warms, Els would like to turn up heat on Woods
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Ernie Els navigated the steep hill from the
18th green to the clubhouse Tuesday afternoon, signed a few
autographs and immediately sought shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough week, especially with the heat, and I
think it's going to get warmer,'' Els said. ``It's already in the
90s, and it feels like it's 120.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to acclimate himself last week by practicing at
mid-afternoon in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Els has been the runner-up in all three of this year's majors so
far, twice to Tiger Woods, in the U.S. Open and British Open. But
the South African hopes for a different forecast beginning Thursday
at Valhalla Golf Club. The obvious goal is to turn up the heat on
Woods in the 82nd PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will try for three majors in a season for the first time
since Ben Hogan in 1953. But Els has won two of his last three
events the European Tour's Loch Lomond Invitational before the
British Open and then the International on the PGA Tour after St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not complaining about my year,'' said Els, who won U.S.
Opens in 1994 and 1997, before Woods started his major championship
pillage. ``I'm not feeling like a loser out there. . . . But I
still believe if I play my best golf, I can really give it a
shot.'' Else doesn't want to complete an Avis Grand Slam on Sunday.
``I've had a pretty good year, even if I don't play well from here
on, which I don't want to do,'' Els said. ``I think the guy that
won obviously just played unbelievable. You're playing a guy that's
just playing out of this world. . . . But, hopefully, this week I
can play at a little higher level, and let's see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Greg Norman shared the lead after 54 holes of all four
majors but won only the British Open. Norman has been the runner-up
in six Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he was asked if he had ``given Els any advice on
finishing second in majors.'' The old, less mellow Norman might
have jumped over the interview table at the reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any advice for him, but I think he dropped that
hurdle at the International,'' Norman said. ``Sometimes, you just
run into an unusual shot or a hot player. I think if Jack Nicklaus
had the same question asked about how many seconds he had at major
championships (19), I'm sure (he'd say) you can't control what
other people do and feel. I'm sure Ernie feels the same way. He
can't control what other people do. So, sometimes second is better
than 10th.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said, ``I think Ernie has had one of the greatest years in
golf, for not winning a major, like what Greg (Norman) did in '86
-- the Saturday Slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to that,'' Wood said. ``He's played
absolutely wonderful golf. It's just that unfortunately he has come
up second. He's proven that he's a great player, and, by finishing
close to winning, you learn a lot. I'm sure he has learned, and
he'll probably apply it this week.''
</P>
<P>
   With every mound, hump and collection area the 30-year-old Els
visits at Valhalla, his comfort zone could be growing. A winner 10
days ago in the International at Castle Pines, another Jack
Nicklaus course, Els sees some of the same target lines and can
visualize shaping the same shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite a major championship golf course, meaning that
it doesn't quite live up to Pebble Beach and St. Andrews,
history-wise, but it's a very good golf course,'' Els said. ``It's
a good golf course to play a major championship at. The condition
of the course is brilliant. It's much better than it was four years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a venue that should bring more players into contention
than might normally be the case at a major. Not overly long at
7,167 yards and running faster by the day, Valhalla has more of a
TPC feel than traditional major sites. For the longer hitters, the
four par-5's are reachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put it in the fairway, the long hitters definitely have
a chance to turn their rounds around,'' Els said, ``but generally
speaking, you've got to put the ball in play. The longer hitters
can do that with 2-irons and 3-woods. Other guys might have to use
drivers, but if they're straight enough, they can play with the big
guns this week.''

 &HT;    University of Georgia to halt using race in borderline
admissions cases
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The University of Georgia will no longer consider
race in borderline admissions decisions, president Michael Adams
said Tuesday, while it appeals a ruling by a federal judge that the
practice is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement many considered inevitable, Adams focused on
the university's decision to take the July 24 ruling by U.S.
District Judge B. Avant Edenfield to the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in Atlanta _ and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to use race in admissions decisions would only invite
more lawsuits, Adams said, a position echoed by Chancellor Stephen
Portch. Many on the UGA campus and in the state legislature
expected the university to appeal. Attorney Lee Parks, who sued UGA
over the policy, said Adams has a lot of constituencies to answer
to, including politicians, the Board of Regents, alumni and
faculty, who expect him ``to pursue what they consider the high
moral ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Appealing was the university's only political option, Parks
said, calling it ``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits focused on the Total Student Index, or TSI, an
evaluative tool used in about 1,200 admissions cases. It assigns a
numeric value to various factors, including economic and academic
disadvantage, Georgia residency, academic factors, leadership,
whether parents attended college, whether immediate family members
are UGA alumni and _ until Tuesday _ ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of previous litigation, UGA dropped gender from the
TSI last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the university's 23,000 undergraduates were admitted on
academic merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions that I announce today are in keeping with our
goal stated last year to continue to act both aggressively and
responsibly in this area,'' Adams said. ``It is clear that the
State of Georgia must do all it can to make the benefits of higher
education available to the broadest possible segment of its
population.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has agreed to comply with the court's order by
offering admission and paying damages to three women _ Jennifer
Johnson, Aimee Bogrow and Molly Ann Beckenhauer _ who sued UGA over
its admissions policies.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, who represents the three, said they are ``getting their
books'' and are happy not to wait another year to enroll. He
praised the university for admitting the women and not using the
appeal to block them from attending UGA.
</P>
<P>
   Adams wouldn't discuss how much money was paid inthe settlement,
saying such issues were better left to attorneys. But he did say
the university has spent more than $400,000 in its defense. Parks
said he has submitted a $500,000 bill for his legal services, which
span three years.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he consulted extensively with Gov. Roy Barnes, Portch
and the regents, ``looking at as many options as possible,'' and
that they reached ``near unanimity on the decision to move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents has vowed to pursue an ``extremely
vigorous'' legal appeal to allow UGA to use race in admission
decisions. The Georgia policy was devised after the 1978 Supreme
Court ruling in Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate on the use of affirmative action in promoting
diversity on the nation's college campuses for educational purposes
has reached the critical point where a clear-cut decision must be
reached,'' said Portch. ``The University System of Georgia and
other universities throughout the nation face continuing litigation
on this issue. We are willing to assume a leadership role if it
will help resolve this issue definitively. It is in the interest of
the state, the nation and the academic community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents met behind closed doors last week to
discuss the case. Chairman Glenn White said the board considers the
issues important enough to continue the fight and is prepared ``to
take any and all steps necessary to resolve this matter.''

DRUG INDUSTRY INFLUENCE HURTING RESEARCH, DOCTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE DEMBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Some researchers with financial ties to the
pharmaceutical industry are eroding the integrity of medical
research and potentially harming patient care, a University of
California doctor told nearly 700 scientists, advocates and
policymakers gathered here Tuesday for a national conference on
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms that commercialism is hurting research includes studies
that are deliberately skewed to produce favorable results for the
funders' drugs, and research articles guest written by prominent
researchers whose only contact with the project is a paycheck from
drug makers, said Dr. Thomas Bodenheimer, an internist at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer, who spent a year reviewing published accounts of
such problems in drug research, was invited to share his findings
by the National Institutes of Health, which sponsored the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking counterpoint to some other speakers who suggested
such conflicts are manageable by merely disclosing them to the
public, Bodenheimer said, ``Conflict of interest is associated with
intentional bias in the conduct and publication of drug trials.
Disclosure is not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The NIH convened the conference in response to Congressional
demands for greater protections for research participants following
deaths in gene therapy experiment. The studies, including several
at St. Elizabeth's in Boston, were overseen by scientists with
financial stakes in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England
Journal of Medicine said Bodenheimer's ``terrific'' presentatiion
was the first comprehensive review of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bodenheimer showed that conflicts of interest have real
effects,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Grant, a representaitve of the Biotech Industry
Organization, defended the drug industry saying, ``Most of our
investigators are free from (Food and Drug Administration) defined
conflicts'' and that companies are very ``wary of compromising
their ability to get a drug licensed.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA must approve all drugs before they can be marketed in
the United States. Grant, who is an executive with Aventis
Pharmaceuticals, said the companies must submit all data to the
FDA, not just favorable data.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer agreed that some of the research problems may occur
more frequently in tests after the drugs are approved by the FDA,
tests used to help market the drugs to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, when only the favorable data makes it into the
medical journals, he said, it leaves practicing physicians like him
relying on flawed data in deciding which drugs to prescribe for
their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer cited instances in 1990 and 1996 in which
pharmaceutical companies refused to allow researchers to publish
data unfavorable to company products. And he cited a recent review
of reports on 196 tests of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
that found, ``doubtful or invalid statements'' in 76 percent of the
articles.
</P>
<P>
   He also detailed 5 reviews of clinical trials made by other
researchers that showed that ``company-funded trials have a high
likelihood of favoring the company's products.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said that another researcher's study of 809
articles published in major journals found that 29 percent had
``guest or ghost authors,'' leaving researchers in the dark about
who had really done the research. Ghost authors are often hired by
drug companies, he said, but their names do not appear on the
articles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the article appears under the name of a guest writer
who has agreed to review it in exchange for an honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts carry over to the design of drug tests or trials,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association last year, he said, examined tests of the effectiveness
of 2 anti-fungal drugs. In the studies funded by the maker of the
new drug, 79 percent of the patients received the older drug orally
even though it is an intravenous drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design virtually guarantees . . . the funding company's
drug will produce better results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bodenheimer said that not every conflict leads to such
misconduct, but he proposed erecting barriers between drug company
funding and drug research. His most radical proposal called for
drug companies to turn over final testing of new drugs to the NIH
with the drug companies providing the funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth L. Kirschstein, principal deputy director of NIH called
that plan impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschstein said she thought simple disclosure of conflicts,
``certainly goes a long way toward solving any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Korn, senior vice president of the Association of
American Medical Colleges said he agreed with Bodenheimer that
disclosure was not enough, although he took issue with equating
conflicts of interest with scientific misconduct. Korn said
academic institutions should limit the financial involvement of
researchers, citing Harvard's strict policy restricting researchers
from participating in studies sponsored by companies that they have
an equity stake in.

IF SPORTS GAMES ARE A BUSINESS, COLLEGES INVITE PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One autumn day in the 1970s, when Harold L. Enarson was
president of Ohio State University, he attended a football game in
which Ohio State was pitted against one of its traditional rivals.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, Ohio State lost. And, as even worse luck
would have it, Enarson encountered a reporter for the student
newspaper as he left the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter asked for his reaction to the defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Enarson shrugged and said, ``After all, it's only a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, a banner headline in the newspaper screamed
``AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY A GAME!'' and an editorial thundered against
the president for being destitute of team spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That remark was never forgotten and never forgiven,'' Enarson
recalled recently. ``No matter how dutiful I was in attending
athletic events, which I hugely enjoyed, any hint that I wasn't a
true jock was held against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Intercollegiate football _ the players are already in training
for the new season _ demands absolute devotion. Not just from
players, coaches and presidents, but from students, faculty,
administrators, alumni and fans. And that is why abuses in the
system so often go unreported and uncorrected, and why the game _
now more a fixture of the national entertainment industry than
higher education _ is allowed to spread a corrupting influence.
</P>
<P>
   Standards of admission and academic performance are routinely
cast to the winds for star football players, according to Linda
Bensel-Meyers, a Renaissance literature scholar at the University
of Tennessee, who has challenged her university on those practices
and is now embroiled in a bitter legal dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, athletes are not infrequently accused of theft and
the physical abuse of women, and the authorities are notoriously
reluctant to punish them.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before his death a year ago, Michael
Hooker, who was chancellor of the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, said that corruption was widespread in intercollegiate
football.
</P>
<P>
   But little is done about the problems because of this need for
total devotion to the sport, and because so many colleges and
universities have allowed themselves to become dependent on
football for two vital commodities: money, from donors and from
lucrative television contracts, and a flood of choice students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're in the midst of a major fund-raising
campaign,'' explained the trustee chairman of a large Midwestern
university, ``and the entertainment value of football has a way of
helping by keeping our name before the public.''
</P>
<P>
   As for recruiting students, admissions officers talk with awe
about ``the Flutie spike'' _ the phenomenal increase in
applications at Boston College in the mid-1980s tied to the
heart-stopping performances of a quarterback named Doug Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions officers know that a star player can attract many
more students than half a dozen Nobel Prize winners on the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any deliverance from this situation, it may be found
in the work of Harvie Branscomb, the former chancellor of
Vanderbilt University who died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his inauguration as chancellor, Branscomb recalled in
his memoir ``Purely Academic'' (Vanderbilt University Press, 1978),
how he set out to ``de-emphasize'' intercollegiate football. He
decided to ``build up a countertradition, one of playing
prestigious institutions not eminent for their athletics but for
their academic accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan backfired when Vanderbilt crushed Yale, dashing all
hope of a rematch with any Ivy League school. A few years later,
Branscomb urged the Vanderbilt trustees to put into practice a
series of reforms, including reducing the number of athletic
scholarships. But three days later, the Vanderbilt football team
once again unwittingly sabotaged his effort. The team scored a
sensational victory over Alabama, 22-20, which created such
excitement in Nashville that all thought of reform evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In his memoir, Branscomb made a final stab at the problem, which
merits consideration today.
</P>
<P>
   Academic institutions that feel the need for semiprofessional
sports teams, Branscomb said, should establish a school of
athletics much like ones for dentistry and agriculture. The schools
should offer preparation for sports careers and should also recruit
the players needed for strong teams. And, responding to the
concerns of people like Bensel-Meyers, these specialized schools
should relieve their academically oriented counterparts of the
pressure to compromise admissions and other standards in order to
produce championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   Who'll be the first to give it a try?

TEXAS DEMOCRATS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
lieb
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is there anything sadder in the world than a Texas
Democrat?
</P>
<P>
   Texans claim to love it when things get hopeless. Witness the
religiosity of the Alamo experience that permeates the Lone Star
culture. But how much fun can it really be to face the Bush
juggernaut as it rumbles across the Lone Star state like Sherman
through Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' counters Representative Martin Frost, chairman of the
Texas delegation here, ``How'd you like to be running as a Democrat
in Idaho?''
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't be a barrel of laughs either. But this valiant
effort to change the subject does nothing to alter the grim reality
for Democrats in the home turf of George W. Bush: They wake behind
enemy lines. Every day.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, they favor one of the last refuges of modern
psychotherapy: denial. Never is heard a discouraging word. Their
smiles are frozen in rictus to deflect negative questions. They
rely on the hardscrabble conviction that the other guys will get
theirs sooner or later. And they still find life a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Georgy Bush project. A group of former Bill Bradley
stalwarts from Austin calling themselves The Publicity Seekers have
produced a CD that lambastes their nemesis with tunes like ``Georgy
Bush'' _ sung to the sixties tune of ``Georgy Girl'' _ and ``Gana
Dinero'' (More Money), sung to the tune of ``Guantanamera.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegation vice-chairman Glen Maxie delights in The Barbie
Question. Barbie Dolls were distributed to delegates in
Philadelphia and Los Angeles. (Why is anyone's guess.) ``We got
Anglos, Hispanics, African American Barbies,'' he notes. ``I'd like
to know if the Republicans got any African American Barbies in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful, chimes in Jim Nickerson of Pittsburg, Texas: ``The
minorities were there all right, but they were outside serving
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the sniping, the Democrats think small. Frost maintains
they can pick up the one seat they need to regain control of the
state Senate, increase their six-seat edge in the state house, and
pick up two congressional seats while absorbing the Bush tsunami in
the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk may not be as absurd as it sounds. He points out that
while Bush drubbed Gary Mauro with almost 70 percent of the vote in
his 1998 reelection bid, Democrats gained a seat in the state
Senate while holding the state house and their congressional edge.
(He fails to mention that Bush turnout destroyed all Democrats in
statewide races.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is life or death for us,'' says Frost about these lesser
contests. ``The legislature will redraw the congressional
districts, and the Republicans have already said publically they
intend to erase eight Democratic districts in Congress if they take
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush specter produces another ripple. ``The pressure is off
at the top of the ticket so we're free to vote our conscience,''
says Kelly Holmes, a 22-year-old delegate from Austin, a hotbed of
liberal activism, who carries the Georgy Bush CD. Translation: I
might vote for Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vote for Gore is worthless in a winner-take-all state,''
she reasons. ``So do I throw away my vote or help Nader get 5
percent so he can get matching funds next time?''
</P>
<P>
   Such heresy exemplifies the Democratic penchant for hara-kiri
utterly absent in Philadelphia. Then again, many Democrats wouldn't
be caught dead in the loud Lone Star flag shirts and humongous
cowboy hats favored by the GOP there. ``This is a political
convention, not a costume ball,'' snaps Frost.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegates confess to indulging dark thoughts earlier
in the race but claim to have put the razor blades away. ``We kind
of thought at one point about how demoralizing it is to be in this
situation, but then we decided to turn it into a positive,'' says
Karen Loper of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This transformation gave birth at the convention to the Texas
Truth Rangers, a Democratic posse bent on telling their side of the
Bush saga. But it's a crowded field. The Republicans have sent
their truth squad to Los Angeles, led by the prominent Hispanic,
Henry Bonilla. And a band of well-heeled Democrats in cahoots with
the Republicans have arrived to spread their gospel as well.
</P>
<P>
   Truth squads are fine, but they are no substitute for a good
year that gives you bragging rights at the bar. ``It hasn't been
our year in a long time,'' laments Ann Hubener of Duncanville.
``The last time we had a winner was Jimmy Carter.''
</P>
<P>
   This dark thought doesn't stop Jim Nickerson from crowing,
``2002 will be a great year for Texas Democrats. We'll be coming
back.''

BOSTON GLOBE TO UNVEIL FOUR NEW SECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Boston Globe next month will unveil four new
sections, expanded business coverage, and a graphic redesign of the
entire newspaper, publisher Richard H. Gilman announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thursday, Sept. 28, a 16-page ``Globe West'' section
will focus on Boston's western suburbs. It will cover 35 cities and
towns west of Boston, providing more local news coverage for
readers in that growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Town and school news will receive greater attention in the new
section, as will local voices, and information on dining and
entertainment, events, and real estate. There also will be coverage
of issues related to senior citizens and youth, as well as expanded
high school sports news. It will be published in four different
editions, each covering six to 11 communities. There will be two
advertising zones to allow local stores the ability to target their
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important new program that will make the Globe more
useful and informative for readers in the growing metrowest area,''
Gilman said. ``It will provide more local news coverage for readers
and more marketing opportunities for local advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   The section will replace the existing Sunday ``West Weekly''
section and run on Thursdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said having two zoned editions would benefit local
merchants, who will be able to better target advertisements to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   In other initiatives:
</P>
<P>
   --The redesigned pages of the Globe will make their debut
Wednesday, Sept. 13. The redesign will feature new typefaces
throughout the paper for a cleaner, more readable look on the
narrower 50-inch pages the Globe adopted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   --The Globe also is introducing ``Life at Home'' and
``Marketplace.'' The first will be a revitalized version of the
current ``At Home'' section and will appear on Thursdays, starting
Sept. 14. It will focus on decorating, lifestyles, entertaining,
gardening, and home renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Marketplace, set to launch two weeks later, will be a
stand-alone classified advertising section that also runs
Thursdays. It will be published in six editions and will feature
articles on real estate, jobs, and cars.
</P>
<P>
   --Business coverage also will be expanded significantly.
Beginning Sunday, Sept. 17, a new section called BostonWorks will
add stories and columns on careers and recruiting issues to the
current Help Wanted section. The Sunday business section will be
enlarged and redesigned, and the reporting on the biotechnology
industry will be increased in the daily paper.

<P>
   BRONSON, Fla. _ Stretched around the circular drive outside
Ellas McDaniel's home near Bronson, the three lanky cars conjure
images of opening night at The Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines Jackie Wilson or the Isley Brothers sliding out of
the back of the white-on-brown Lincoln limo. Or Ruth Brown and
Chuck Berry being ushered out one of the eight doors of the
too-long Mercury. And God only knows who might emerge from the
stern of the purple Caddy hearse.
</P>
<P>
   Why, it's none other than the man in the know, Bo Diddley.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cars represent the real roots of rock 'n' roll,'' said
McDaniel, known professionally as Bo Diddley, the Chicago-bred Rock
'n' Roll Hall of Famer who for years has made his home, and music,
in rural North Central Florida. ``These cars helped us survive.
Cats who couldn't afford the big buses rode in these things to get
to their gigs.''
</P>
<P>
   The energetic 71-year-old rock legend has added a trio of
unusual cars to his eclectic fleet, which varies from a motorless
'53 Chevy to a motor home he said is difficult to park. With one of
his grandsons and a family friend, McDaniel has resurrected three
aging cars that are at once an eye-catching archive of rock history
and a billboard to his vision of a drug-free opportunity for
youths.
</P>
<P>
   His pride and joy may be the stretched 1978 Mercury station
wagon he found this past fall in near-by Chiefland. At 25 feet
long, he thinks it might have been used by a funeral home to
transport the bereaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was all rotted out,'' McDaniel said, tapping the wagon's
right rear corner with thick fingers that have strummed some of the
most influential guitar notes in music history. ``We put all new
metal in there. There's very little Bondo,'' he said, referring to
a type of plastic filler used in body repair.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a building McDaniel built on the family compound, he and
his helpers rebuilt the Mercury's engine and transmission, brakes
and other parts. They re-covered the vinyl top and painted the car
lime green.
</P>
<P>
   To the sprightly canvas McDaniel added a litany of titles from
his catalog of hit songs and, on both front doors, graphics of his
signature ``square-headed'' guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You Don't Know Diddley,'' ``Gun Slinger'' and ``Say Man''
adorn the Mercury's hood. ``This is real Rock and Roll'' reads the
left front fender. Down the block, doors are embellished with ``I
Am A Man,'' ``I Am Sorry'' and ``Diddley Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't It Good to Be Free'' decorates the right rear fender.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something everybody in America should cherish,''
McDaniel said, rubbing the letters made for him by a friend. ``Good
to be free. These kids today should understand that, but they
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed among the mobile library of hits are messages aimed at
young people. For years McDaniel has crusaded for youths, and has
played many free concerts devoted to helping at-risk youths choose
alternatives to lives of drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids Being in a Gang Is Lame,'' ``Keep Kids Drug Free'' and
``Down With the Pusher'' are among the body-panel slogans. A ``Keep
Kids Drug Free'' specialty license plate rides the Mercury's rear
bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message for children is to see that you can be constructive
and not destructive,'' McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1977 Lincoln limousine he has rebuilt, he said, was similar
to one he and other rock pioneers used to ride in 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie Wilson had one just like it,'' he said. ``Or was it
Ruth Brown?''
</P>
<P>
   A work in progress is the '69 Cadillac hearse painted purple.
It's a year newer than the hearse McDaniel used a generation ago to
travel from gig to gig, towing a U-Haul trailer for the
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   With help from his wife, Sylvia, McDaniel is fitting the
hearse's cavernous interior with a mobile recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ripped all the casket junk out of it,'' said McDaniel, who
noted that he never attends funerals. ``Yeah, I plan to do some
recording in there. I'm thinking about putting `Wanna make a
record? Climb In' on the side ... I'd like to be able to help some
of these young kids _ not the bad ones _ make their own CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel said he's always been fascinated with automobiles and
motors. His first car was an air-cooled 1920s Franklin given to him
by an uncle who owned an auto salvage yard in Chicago. He has
always been a tinkerer, he said, and enjoys woodworking and auto
mechanics as a way to relax.
</P>
<P>
   He's mindful, though, of taking care of his hands when he's
working on cars. For a man who still plays music all over the world
dozens of times a year, his hands are his livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel demonstrated that _ after rain drove him away from
showing off his cars _ in a tiny studio where he continues to make
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've created a new beat,'' said McDaniel, whose unique rhythms
45 years ago helped transform popular music. ``I call it the
Bounce, the Bathroom Bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel cued up a 16-track tape, tinkered with some buttons and
levers on his new mixer and produced an unfinished version of his
new sound. The driving beat was infectious, and when he cranked up
the volume, even the motorless '53 Chevy out back almost came to
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you do, to show fans that you're not finished
yet,'' McDaniel said after playing a sampling from another of his
new projects, a lengthy, hard-driving ode to the Book of Genesis he
has titled ``The Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasional trips around the region or farther _ ``I could
head to California in the Mercury right now,'' McDaniel said _ he
hopes his classic vehicles might inspire some thoughts about what
it was like for the hard-working leaders of the rock movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cars are some of where I came from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These latest additions to McDaniel's fleet may have been
inspired by a car he found in the late 1960s along side a road in
St. Louis, a stretched 1957 Chevy wagon. He named it ``Betsy,'' and
it took him and his band, Bo Diddley &AMP; Co., all over the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '57 Chevrolet put us over the hump,'' McDaniel said. ``It
never failed me ... We had a rack on top where we put our
instruments. That '57 carried us everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel will probably never find another Betsy, but he seems
just as happy with his purple hearse, chocolate limo and especially
the eight-door Mercury.

NAVISTAR CUTS 1,100 JOBS, CITING TRUCK ORDER DROP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Responding to a slowdown in heavy-truck orders in
North America, Navistar International Corp. said Tuesday that it
would lay off 1,100 employees, or about 15 percent of its
white-collar work force.
</P>
<P>
   The company, one of the world's largest makers of heavy trucks,
buses and diesel engines, said that after several years of
spectacular growth, the company had to act because orders for big
trucks in North America had been falling steadily, largely because
of higher interest rates, soaring fuel prices and a glut of used
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Navistar, which is based in Chicago, comes
just a day after Freightliner, a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG and the
world's biggest maker of heavy trucks, said that it would cut 3,475
jobs, or about 19 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Paccar, the world's No. 2 truck maker, based
in Bellevue, Wash., said that it would lay off 430 workers at a
big-truck plant in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Though the economy remains strong, and demand for diesel engines
and buses is robust, Navistar and other truck makers are trying to
head off a cyclical downturn after what some industry experts said
was two years of ``excessive demand'' for heavy-duty rigs. Higher
interest rates have made it more expensive to finance the purchase
of a new truck, and higher diesel prices have forced some trucking
companies to park their rigs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, over the last year, orders for heavy-duty trucks _
which often cost $80,000 to $100,000 _ fell nearly 30 percent.
Freightliner said Tuesday that it expected heavy-duty truck sales
in North America to drop about 25 percent from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, Navistar laid off 800 employees in
Canada, where its heavy-duty trucks are made, and the company says
it may cut 500 more jobs. The company, which markets its big trucks
under the International brand name, has 19,000 employees worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Navistar announcement was contained in its third-quarter
earnings release, which reported profits excluding special items of
$76 million, or $1.27 a share, compared with $77 million, or $1.17
a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $1.92
billion from $1.88 billion. The results slightly beat Wall Street
projections of $1.24 a share, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Navistar, which have been weak for much of the last
year, fell $1.9375 Tuesday, to $37.125.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Horne, the chairman and chief executive of Navistar,
said in a statement that the company was working to become less
cyclical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps we plan will allow us to continue to build a healthy
business in the downturn,'' he said, ``and come out even stronger
when the market turns up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would also take a charge in the fourth
quarter related to the 1,100 job cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Though heavy trucks orders, which make up about a quarter of
Navistar's sales, are in decline, orders for medium-sized trucks
are more stable, and sales of Navistar's diesel engines, which are
used in UPS, U-Haul and pickup trucks, continues to grow. The
company is also supplying diesel engines to Ford Motor Co., which
uses them in its sport utility vehicles. The company also said its
school bus division is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that they were not surprised by the
Navistar announcement. Many investors have been warned about a drop
in orders going back more than a year, and the stock prices of many
of the big truck and engine makers have fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the ninth inning in the stock prices,'' said Tobias
M. Levkovich, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``This news has
all been discounted and we think we might see a recovery by next
spring in the order patterns.''  &QL;

JESSE JACKSON CALLS DRUG WAR RACIST; DEMANDS MORE TREATMENT
PROGRAMS &HT;    By MARK HELM
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking at a so-called
Shadow Convention here, called Tuesday for an end to the country's
war on drugs, which he said unfairly targets minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader likened the government's antidrug
program to ``friendly fire (that) is killing Americans rather than
helping Americans, a policy driven by fear, race and greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said African Americans comprise nearly two thirds of all
drug offenders admitted to state prison although their rate of drug
use is roughly equal to that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are poor, brown or black or don't have a lawyer, there
is no category called youthful indiscretion,`` he said in a veiled
reference to questions about whether Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush used cocaine in his past, questions that the
candidate has refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984 and 1988, called, as he has in the past, for
loosening state and federal drug laws and increasking drug
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers at the Shadow Convention, which is running in
tandem with and counter to the Democratic National Convention here,
included New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky
Anderson and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., and Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who is the Republican
candidate for Senate against incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also attacked the nation's war against drugs as a
failure. He said that while government spending on enforcement of
drug laws has increased from about $1 billion in 1980 to more than
$40 billion this year, the availability of illegal narcotics has
increased dramatically and the price has fallen over the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a 1999 report by the U.S. Health and Human Services
that found that 88 percent of 12th graders said marijuana was easy
to get, 47 percent said cocaine was easy to get, and 32 percent
said heroin was easy to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think drug and alcohol use is a terrible thing, which is
exactly why I'm not going to keep pretending that a policy that
doesn't reduce drug use or the availability of drugs is working,''
said Johnson, who does not smoke or drink. He also called for the
legalization of marijuana and for treatment programs for first-time
drug ofenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which is being held a few blocks from the
Democratic gathering at the Staples Center here, is also taking up
such subjects as campaign finance reform and the gap between rich
and poor. The first Shadow Convention, which addressed the same
issues, was held in Philadelphia during the Republican National
Convention two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of controversial columnist Arianna Huffington,
the counter-culture conclaves have been billed as the
``un-conventions'' and antidotes to what organizers call the
scripted coronations of the Republican and Democratic
nominees.``There's no competition anymore, no question of the
outcome,'' said comedial Bill Maher, host of the television show
``Politically Incorrect.'' ``The other conventions are infomercials
and bad ones,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Along with discussions on political issues, the Shadow
Conventions also offer comedy and political satire. ``Our goal is
to put some well-known people out in the morning to talk about the
issues that are being ignored by both parties, and then in the
evening focus more on entertaining people,'' said Ethan Nadelmann,
a Shadow Conventions organizer and director of the New York-based
Lindesmith Center, a drug policy institute. ``Politics does not
have to be serious all the time,'' he added.

N.J. HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN BILL REQUIRING PARENTAL NOTIFICATION
OF ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURA MANSNERUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Rejecting the State Legislature's attempt to
join the growing list of states that restrict abortion for
teen-agers, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down a
law requiring parental notice for unmarried girls under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 4-2 decision held that the notice requirement,
enacted and signed by Gov. Christie Whitman last year, violated the
equal protection guarantee of the New Jersey Constitution by
imposing a burden on minors seeking abortions that it did not
impose on those who continue their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision signaled that even with many new appointees, the
court continues to give individual liberties more expansive
protection than the federal courts, as it has for decades. And
lawmakers complained on Tuesday, as they have for decades, about
the court's readiness to overturn legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County,
said the decision ``stretches the imagination.'' He added: ``This
court, as they continually do, decide what they want the laws of
this state to be.''
</P>
<P>
   By relying on the State Constitution, the court was more
protective of abortion rights than the U.S. Supreme Court, which
has upheld parental notification statutes as long as they provided
for a waiver of the requirement by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 states have enacted laws requiring parental
involvement, and in some cases a parent's consent, in a minor's
abortion decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision cannot be appealed, as the State Supreme
Court is the final arbiter of the New Jersey Constitution. The
court had blocked enforcement of the law pending its full review.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agreed on Tuesday that the court's strong language
left little if any room for the Legislature to amend the statute.
Rather, opponents of abortion said they would work toward a
constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Marie Tasy, an official of New Jersey Right to
Life, said, ``I think the decision is outrageous, that it defies
common sense and ignores the integrity of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, some legislators called for a reconsideration of
the judicial selection process here and even for impeachment
proceedings against the four justices who joined the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The decision relieved abortion rights advocates, who had been
surprised by the legislation and alarmed by Whitman's quick assent
to it, at a time when she was currying support from conservatives
in preparation to run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just delighted that the Supreme Court reaffirmed New
Jersey's strong commitment to reproductive choice and recognized
the substantial burdens this placed on New Jersey teen-agers,''
said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties
Union Foundation, who argued the case for Planned Parenthood and
abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to the decision by Whitman, a Republican, was
muted. The governor said in a statement that the administration was
reviewing the opinion and that when she signed the legislation, ``I
believed that the bill struck a common-sense balance'' between the
rights of parents to be informed and the rights of minors to choose
whether to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the court's majority opinion, Chief Justice Deborah T.
Poritz said that the State Constitution ``does not permit the state
to impose disparate and unjustifiable burdens on different classes
of young women when fundamental constitutional rights hang in the
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenora Lapidus, legal director of the ACLU in Newark, noted that
the justices, most of them appointees of Whitman, ``did nothing out
of line here but continued the long tradition of interpreting our
state's Constitution protectively and broadly to guarantee
fundamental rights.'' Lapidus said parental notice statutes had
been struck down on similar grounds by state courts in Florida,
Montana, Alaska and California.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey law, passed in June 1999 by a vote of 59-17 in
the Assembly and 31-8 in the Senate, was supposed to have been
saved by its ``judicial bypass'' provision. That provision allows a
judge to waive the notification requirement if it would not be in
the girl's best interest or if she is ``sufficiently mature'' to
make her own decision. But the court held that the hearing
procedure itself was a burden that could not be justified by the
state's interest in requiring notification.

GORE FINALLY OUT FRONT AS CLINTON STEPS ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Mich. _ In one dramatic moment, strolling offstage under
a flurry of confetti, an emotional President Clinton symbolically
passed the presidential mantle Tuesday to his vice president, Al
Gore, who Thursday will accept the Democratic Party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Clinton and his family went to a McDonald's, where the
president ordered a crispy chicken sandwich meal. His daughter,
Chelsea, said she hadn't been to a McDonald's in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That stop, on the way to the airport before a flight back to
Washington, ended a chapter on a partnership that America was
introduced to at the Democratic National Convention in 1992, when
two baby-boomer couples bounded onto the stage to claim the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready to win this election for Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman?'' a beaming Clinton asked a crowd of more than 10,000
cheering fans. Gore, ``my partner and friend for the past eight
years, understands where we are, where we're going and how it will
affect ordinary citizens more than any other public figure in the
country over the last 20 years,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the right person to be the first president of the 21st
century,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a returning hero's welcome in this industrial
state, where unemployment has plummeted to 2.2 percent from 8.8
percent in 1992, when Clinton first campaigned in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a suit, Clinton watched with apparent pride as Gore,
looking ready-to-work in shirtsleeves, thanked Clinton for ``giving
me the chance to serve my country during these years of prosperity
and progress by working to help strengthen your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took what has often been Gore's role onstage, standing
behind his vice president as Gore praised his close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the chance
to serve my country for these years of prosperity and progress by
working to help strengthen your hand,'' Gore said, as Clinton
wrapped an arm around his wife, Hillary, and Tipper Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's done well, but I' tell you, you ain't seen nothin'
yet!'' the vice president yelled. ``We will go forward to even
better times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept his speech short, waxing nostalgic only briefly
before lavishing praise on the vice president. He reminisced about
the bus trip they took after the convention in 1992, saying that
helping working-class towns like Monroe rebound from the sluggish
economy was the reason they ran. ``The people who live here are the
kind of people we ran to change the future for,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign chose this quaint setting for the hand-off
because Clinton and Gore had campaigned in a nearby town in 1992, a
time when Monroe's economy had been hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every good thing that has come out of our administration in
the last eight years, Al Gore was at the heart of,'' Clinton said
before clasping hands with his wife and daughter and exiting the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they letting Clinton go and leaving Al Gore up
there?'' complained a young girl, straining to get a picture with
her disposable camera.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his opponent, George W. Bush, are in a dead heat in
Michigan, a deegate-rich state which the Clinton-Gore ticket took
in 1992 and in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But while Clinton's popularity is high in Michigan, ``the
electorate hasn't really warmed up to Al Gore yet,'' said Michael
Traugott, a political science and communications professor at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans hold most statewide-elected offices here,
Traugott said, Gore needs help from such oganizations as the United
Auto Workers, which endorsed Gore Friday after a long
decision-making process. The auto workers' union backing is crucial
and will likely boost Gore's numbers when they start working for
him, Traugott predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who has to follow Clinton _ it's an especially hard
job,'' said Carole Van Brandt, 55, an enthusiastic Gore supporter
at Tuesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd said Gore would strengthen his following as the
campaign progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe that once people get in the voting booth and
have to choose between the son of a president we threw out of
office and someone's who's been working there eight years, I have
no doubt Al Gore will get elected,'' said Carl Pate, 35.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore appearance came a day after both Clintons
addressed opening night of the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles. The president's 40-minute farewell speech was viewed
as an opportunity to transfer some of his magnetism and appeal to
Gore and allow the vice president to come into the convention and
claim it has his own.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, aboard Air Force One, Clinton said Gore and Lieberman
phoned him after his speech and ``said they liked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it helped him,'' Clinton said. ``We'll see. Maybe it
did. I don't know. But the main thing was I just wanted to thank
the people and say what I believed. And, I got a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his farewell speech, he said, ``I'll never forget this as
long as I live.''

in recent weeks in similar accidents as a result of
black-marketeers' rupturing pipelines to siphon fuel.

GRAND SLAM LIFTS A WEIGHT OFF BROGNA'S SHOULDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are so many unforgiving winter mornings, when it
would be so easy for him, as a baseball player, to still be in bed.
Instead, he is in a gym, lifting weights and running laps, alone
with his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the times,'' Rico Brogna said Tuesday, ``when you
think and dream of moments like this. That's why you really play.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the day after Brogna, a child of New England, hit a
game-winning grand slam for the Red Sox, a bottom-of-the-ninth
slice of high drama Monday night that not only instantly leaped to
the top of his personal highlights list but also made the uniform
he is now wearing feel so much more comfortable than it had.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' he said, ``I now feel like I have been here a
lot longer than I have, even though it's just been a couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite feeling of bonding that goes to another
level after a moment like that. You really feel like you're a part
of something. The reception I got from the fans and my teammates,
I've never experienced anything like that. It was fantastic, really
fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox claimed Brogna on waivers just 13 days ago from the
Philadelphia Phillies. He and his wife, Melissa, and their
soon-to-be 3-year-old daughter, Alexa, are staying in a Boston
hotel, debating whether they should remain there for the balance of
the season. In the offseason, they live in Watertown, Conn., the
town to which Brogna's family moved from Turners Falls, Mass., when
he was 7 years old, but he is a free agent after this season, and
where he fits in the Sox' long-term plans is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   But those concerns can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``A moment like this doesn't last long,'' Brogna said. ``It's a
new day, there's a new game. But you only have a few moments like
this, and there's no question you enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you go to the ballpark, you dream of that kind of
scenario playing itself out. In this day and age, people have this
misconception that ballplayers play for other reasons, like
monetary and whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play for two reasons: To win, and to have moments like
(Monday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brogna came to the ballpark on a gloomy, soggy Monday
afternoon, he wasn't even in Jimy Williams's starting lineup. He
was on the bench until the eighth inning, when he entered as a
pinch runner for Brian Daubach. He remained in the game at first
base, and was in the dugout in the ninth, the score still tied at
3, when Darren Lewis was hit by a pitch and stole second. A fly
ball by Trot Nixon advanced Lewis to third, but the Sox were down
to their final out after Jason Varitek struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild then elected to walk Carl
Everett and Nomar Garciaparra, preferring to take his chances with
Brogna. Brogna said his legs were shaking when he went to the
plate, a sellout crowd screaming, ``Ri-co, Ri-co,'' as he strode to
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   You know that stuff about players blocking out all sound when
the place is going nuts? Maybe that's true for some guys. Brogna
heard it all, and it left his palms slick with perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Taylor, the Devil Rays' reliever, threw four straight
fastballs, running the count to 2-and-2. Brogna guessed he might
get a breaking ball. He guessed right, and drove the ball over the
head of right fielder Jose Guillen. Brogna had taken just a few
steps when the ball landed in the visitors bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Grand slam, great win.
</P>
<P>
   Walk-off home run? Hardly. Brogna was greeted at home plate by a
swarm of teammates who formed a laughing, screaming circle that
bounced up and down and transported him off the field in a crazy,
impromptu dance of joy. And the roar that Brogna heard from the
crowd as he made his way back to the dugout, his arms triumphantly
raised, was the same roar he once imagined in his backyard, as a
child of Red Sox Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To feel that electricty first hand,'' he said Tuesday, ``was
amazing. Everyone was standing, just going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he talked by phone to his mom and dad and Melissa's
parents, back in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family said everyone back there was going berserk,'' he
said. ``I saw it on the highlights on TV a couple of times. I still
got chills watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a great way to start a homestand, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can build on something like this,'' said Brogna.
``I've seen teams gain momentum from wins like this, regardless of
who gets the hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he was in the starting lineup, but Brogna has no
promises from Williams that he'll be playing every day. Last
weekend in Texas, Williams pulled him aside and told him he'd be
sharing time with Daubach. And Jose Offerman will soon be off the
disabled list, which could cut even more into his playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to take the same approach,'' said Brogna.
``That this is the way it's going to be the rest of the year. I'm
just a spoke in the wheel.''

CLINTON EXTOLS GORE IN SYMBOLIC `PASSING OF THE TORCH'

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, Mich. _ With a bear hug and a slight nudge, President
Clinton pushed his understudy, Al Gore, to center stage Tuesday,
relinquishing the limelight to the man he hopes will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a metaphoric ceremony that Gore has longed for as Clinton
has effortlessly dominated news coverage and captured public
attention _ and overshadowed Gore's efforts to present himself as a
leader in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to pass that mantle Tuesday to Gore before a crowd
here of more than 15,000 people, the largest audience Gore has seen
since he officially announced his campaign more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nominee of the Democratic Party, my partner and friend for
the last eight years, understands where we are, where we're going
and how it will affect ordinary citizens more than any other public
figure in this country over the last 20 years,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Vouching for Gore, Clinton, who was operating on three hours of
sleep after delivering his valedictory speech in Los Angeles on
Monday night, added: ``I hope you'll take my word for this, because
I spent most of my adult life studying economics and the
development of our country. The things that have happened in the
last eight years _ the good things _ are nothing compared to the
good things that can happen in the next eight years. Nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had been standing ramrod straight behind the president
with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and his wife, Tipper, then
embraced the president and shed his jacket as he moved to the
lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me a chance to
serve my country for the last eight years, by working to help
strengthen your hand,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced his wife as ``the woman I love,'' and went on to
tell the stories of several people whose lives had been improved by
programs of the Clinton administration. He said Clinton had built a
strong foundation for the nation and that the question in the
election was whether voters wanted to build on that foundation or
allow it to erode. Gore did not mention the name of his Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but he did refer to the
governor's proposal for an across-the-board tax cut of $1.3
trillion over 10 years. Gore himself has proposed targeted tax cuts
of about $500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy
right,'' Gore said. ``And I'm pledging to you here today, I am not
going to let the other side wreck it and take it away from us.
We're going to keep the prosperity going!''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether this ceremony would usher
in for Gore a transfer of attention _ and an enhancement of his
standing with the electorate _ or whether Clinton would continue to
steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Clinton upstaged Gore as soon as the symbolic
``passing of the torch'' was over. (No object was actually passed,
as television producers had been led to believe might happen.) As
Gore began speaking, eyes were diverted by Clinton draping his arms
around Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign picked small-town America _ and a battleground
state _ for the ceremony, a hot, confetti-strewn affair that drew a
mass of more than 15,000 people, according to local police
estimates. This was by far the largest crowd that Gore has seen in
the last year and a half of his presidential campaign, and several
people said they mainly had come to see the president.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, a town of 22,600 people near Lake Erie, was chosen
because it represents the challenge ahead for Gore. It is in a
swing district that includes both rural and suburban voters, both
high-tech and low-tech workers and an equal number of Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a bellwether area of the state, having voted for
winners in most presidential elections in modern history. A survey
from earlier this month, after Gore picked Sen. Joseph Lieberman as
his running mate, gave Bush 45 percent of likely voters and Gore 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore can win here, he can win the state'' and the national
election, said Ed Sarpolus, a pollster in Lansing. ``This is one of
Gore's toughest audiences. His problem is still Bill Clinton the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The area also underscores the major theme of both the Clinton
administration and the Gore campaign, which is the economic success
of the last eight years. As Clinton noted, unemployment here was
8.8 percent when he took office in 1993; it is now 2.2 percent.

DIVING BELL OLDEST UNDERWATER RESCUE DEVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using diving bells to rescue crewmembers from a downed
submarine, as the Russians are trying to do, is the oldest method
around, but _ conditions permitting _ it is a method that is known
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander the Great took a dive in a kind of diving bell in 330
BC.
</P>
<P>
   There are newer rescue devices, such as the small submarines
developed by the US Navy, but they have yet to be used in a real
rescue situation. Diving bells, on the other hand, have been used
with success, including in 1939 when most of the crew of the US
submarine Squalus was rescued after the vessel went down off
Portsmouth harbor following the failure of a valve.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three of Squalus' crewmembers safely reached the surface.
Twenty six others died onboard before the rescue vessel arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The situation those submariners endured for more than 24 hours
before the rescue was eerily similar to that faced by the Russian
crew now: They were in the dark, it was cold, oxygen was dwindling,
and the only way they could communicate with the outside world was
by banging on the hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would tap on the hull with a hammer to send messages,''
said Gerald McLees of Portsmouth, N.H., one of the Squalus
survivors. ``They would reply through underwater sound gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cold and darkness, the survivors at least were able
to tell exactly what was going on around them because of the
sounds, McLees said. ``Noise carries forever, seems like, under the
water. They sent Morse code, and you could hear it underwater.''
And when the rescue ship Falcon came near, he said, ``We could hear
their engines perfectly clearly. When a diver came down and was
walking around on the deck, we knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   During the long hours before the rescuers arrived with the
diving bell, McLees said, there was no panic whatsoever, because
they knew help was coming. ``We had to wait in the dark. Some of us
went to sleep. We laid in our bunks and covered up to keep warm.
There was very little talking, because they told us to conserve
oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those appear to be essentially the same conditions faced by the
Russian sailors now, except that there are two additional problems
faced by their rescuers: The weather at the surface, and the angle
of the submarine itself.
</P>
<P>
   The surface weather is a major issue, because stormy seas can
make it difficult or impossible for the surface ship to keep its
exact position over the downed submarine while the bell is lowered
and raised by cable.
</P>
<P>
   The other big problem is the angle of the submarine itself as it
lies on the bottom. Reports say the sub is tilted in two
directions, both nose down and turned on its side 60 degrees from
the vertical. Since the diving bell has a hatch on its bottom that
must line up with the sub's rescue hatch on top, and the bell has
little or no maneuvering ability, it may be impossible to make a
secure seal between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Rioux, the diving safety officer at Woods Hole (Mass.)
Oceanographic Institution, served aboard a US Navy submarine rescue
ship until 1975. He said trying to line up the craft with a tilted
sub would be ``very difficult. You need it to be vertical.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher van Alt, an engineer at the Woods Hole institution,
agreed that the angle poses a real problem. The rescue bell is
``hanging from a wire, and it's like trying to screw the lid on a
jar, and the jar is tilted.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's impossible to attach the hatch, he said, it might be
possible for the crewmembers to swim out to the rescue bell, but at
such a depth and in frigid water that would be a highly risky
last-ditch effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood of its working is pretty slim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Persico of Amsterdam, N.Y., another of the Squalus
survivors, was only 20 and the youngest crewmember to survive the
1939 accident. He came out in the last of four rescue trips by the
diving bell, and during that last trip the cable that was used to
lower the bell became snagged on something on the way down, and it
took four hours to get it clear. In the end, the last part of the
ascent was accomplished by sailors hauling in the damaged cable
hand-over-hand, he said, and when they got to the top they found
that all but two strands of the cable had broken. They were almost
literally dangling by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky there,'' Persico said laconically. But he agreed
with McLees that there had been no sense of panic. ``You're
encouraged to think positive in a submarine,'' he said. ``If you're
chicken, that's not the place for you to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Until they knew that a rescue ship would be coming, McLees said,
officers had discussed the possibility of having the crew leave the
sub through an escape hatch and make a ``free ascent'' to the
surface. But from the depth of 250 feet where the sub lay, and in
frigid water, that would have been a risky effort. ``A lot of
people probably wouldn't have made it,'' McLees said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Russian submarine, 100 feet deeper, the risks of such an
escape would be even greater, and the chances of rescue are
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks bad,'' Persico said of the situation aboard the
Russian sub. ``I hope they just hang in there. I hope they make
it.''

MILLER ALLOWED TO COMPETE IN TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shannon Miller took a giant step toward a return to
Olympus Tuesday, her petition accepted to compete in the Olympic
Gymnastics Trials that begin at the FleetCenter Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The most accomplished and decorated gymnast in US history,
Miller was among four women who competed in front of a panel of
four judges at the Fleet, their routines marked as if they were
participating in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, Jeanette Antolin, and Amanda Stroud all were proclaimed
fit to compete in the trials. Robin Phelps, hindered by an
Achilles' tendon injury, was unable to complete the tryout.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Magnificent Seven who won the team gold medal at the
'96 Olympics in Atlanta, Miller has been recovering from a hairline
fracture in her shin and was unable to compete fully during the US
championships last month in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Antolin is recovering from an ankle injury and Stroud injured a
knee at the nationals.
</P>
<P>
   The women will make their first appearance Friday night in the
preliminaries, beginning at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Miller competed in bars at St. Louis, but was reluctant to do
more for fear of reinjuring the shin and compromising her chances
to compete here. After the nationals, Bela Karolyi, team
coordinator for the women's squad, was guardedly optimistic about
the possibility of Miller making the US squad again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' said Karolyi, ``she has to prove in three other events
that she will be capable to sustain a strong and strenuous
competition for several, several days, in the Olympic
competitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Karolyi is a big believer in the value of experience and what
someone with Miller's maturity could mean to what likely will be a
very young squad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The men's squad held an evening workout at the Fleet and will be
back Wednesday for another session, part of media day festivities.
The women take the floor for their first tuneup Wednesday night . .
. There is a slight but significant difference in how the men's and
women's squads will be picked. The four men with the highest
combined scores, factoring in the nationals (40 percent) and trials
(60 percent), will go to Sydney. Two other members will be
handpicked by head coach Peter Kormann and USA Gymnastics
officials. None of the women is guaranteed a ticket to Australia,
no matter what their combined scores, although the top three will
receive prime consideration. In the end, Karolyi and USAG directors
will make all six choices . . . Miller's medal count: 16, in world
and Olympic competition. She won two golds in Atlanta, including
team and balance beam . . . John Roethlisberger, now 30 and the
squad's senior statesman, finished seventh in the all-around
competition at the Games in '96. Blaine Wilson ranked 10th . . .
Kormann, who grew up in Braintree and won a bronze medal in floor
exercises at the '76 Games, on Wilson: ``Blaine Wilson has been the
undisputed best male gymnast in the last five years. But that is
different than winning every single time. I added up all the times
Blaine has been undefeated in the United States, and it's 110
gymnastics competitions, that he has yet to lose to another
American. That's rare. Even if you're the best guy, to go out 100
times and five consecutive USA (national) championships and prove
it on the floor _ that's extremely rare.''

RUSSIA'S ORTHODOX BISHOPS ADOPT DOCTRINE APPROVING PRIVATE
PROPERTY  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian Orthodox Church adopted a social doctrine
Tuesday that condemns genetic engineering, homosexuality,
euthanasia and abortion approves of private property and confirms
the church's close relationship with the military.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine was approved by the 150 bishops of the Russian
Orthodox Church, who are sitting as the Council of Bishops. On
Monday, the council elevated the last czar, Nicholas II, and his
family to sainthood, a move that had been sought by conservatives
within the church.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine is the first of its kind for the church, which is
still establishing its place in Russian society after 70 years of
atheist Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   The council, the church's second highest body, has been meeting
since Sunday in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, rebuilt since
1995 after Stalin ordered the earlier building blown up in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops at Tuesday's gathering said theirs is the only such
doctrine they know about from an Orthodox church. Eastern Orthodox
churches are less likely than the Roman Catholic Church to set out
the church's position on social issues in such a way.
</P>
<P>
   In another document issued Tuesday, the Russian church defined
its relationship to other religions. It condemned attempts by other
religions to win converts from the ranks of Orthodox believers,
including proselyting by Roman Catholics. The Russian Church has
expressed anger in the past at what it considers the Vatican's
expansion in its canonical territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the document also defended the Russian Orthodox Church's
involvement in the ecumenical movement, which has been reviled by
right-wing forces in the church.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Kirill of Smolensk and Kaliningrad, leader of the
church's external relations department, was in charge of developing
the social doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   In comments Tuesday after the release of the doctrine, Kirill
said that the Orthodox churches showed solidarity during the NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia, which he condemned. But he also called for
continued dialogue with Western churches, especially the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the social doctrine does not explicitly condemn the
former Soviet rule, but it calls for a clear separation of church
and state. It also states that Christians must avoid accepting
government authority as absolute and must recognize its purely
earthly bounds.

   The doctrine warns the state against interfering in the life of
the church _ in its teachings, its liturgical life and its
spiritual practices.
</P>
<P>
   While there are strong forces within the church preaching views
on property similar to those of Communists, the doctrine recognizes
all forms of property and states that private property is a gift
from God to be used wisely for the common good.
</P>

   In some cases however, market relations are described
negatively. Doctors are urged to take patients' well-being into
consideration without worrying about material rewards, although
providing adequate pay for medical workers is described as a
priority.

<P>
   The doctrine defines war as evil, but it does not mention the
Russian operation in Chechnya.

<P>
   The doctrine is approving about the church's increasingly close
cooperation with the military, describing it as a means of
returning servicemen to the time-honored Orthodox traditions of
serving the homeland.

 &HT;    Biotech `gold rush' taking dot-com funds
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ You'd expect an office like Lew Shuster's at a
budget-conscious growing technology company.
</P>
<P>
   His walls are bare, dominated by a pair of mismatched
bookshelves containing financial documents and company catalogs.
His office furniture is cheap and nondescript. All he really needs
sits on the credenza behind his desk: A laptop, a Palm Pilot and a
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Around him, his business is bustling. After raising nearly $53
million in an initial public offering a year ago, the company has
just moved into one new building and has another _ its third _
under construction. Last month, it completed a string of
acquisitions and its stock is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's company has nothing to do with dot-coms or the
Internet. His Invitrogen Corp. is in biotechnology, an industry
that is booming these days. The boom is being driven by interest in
the human genome project, new drugs coming to market and investors
looking for a new place to put their money after the dot-com
cool-down.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech sector is outperforming the overall Nasdaq market
4-to-1. Venture capitalists, including many burned by biotechs a
decade ago, are pouring money into them again. There were more
initial public offerings last month of biotech companies than of
Internet-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Gene mapping companies like Celera Genomics and giant drug
makers like Amgen Inc. may grab the headlines but behind them are
hundreds of companies such as Invitrogen, which makes testing kits
used in gene analysis and other research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the gold rush,'' explained Shuster, chief operating
officer of Invitrogen, based in Carlsbad, Calif., just north of San
Diego. The region has become one of the nation's hotbeds for
biotechnology. ``And we're selling the picks and shovels and
wheelbarrows.'' Though Invitrogen made $9 million last year, just
as with dot-coms, biotechs don't have to make money to make it on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Testing equipment company Luminex Corp. of Austin, Texas, isn't
expected to make a profit until sometime in 2001. But its stock
price, currently around $36, is double what it was when it went
public in March. Chief Financial Officer James Persky attributes
interest in his and other biotech stocks in large part to the
dot-com fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just so much money that went into dot-coms,'' he
said. ``When money started moving out of there and they were
looking for someplace else to put their money, biotechs became a
hot area.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't bypassing everything else to get into biotechs,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   While dot-coms are generally down, stocks of companies that
drive the Internet _ fiber-optics, Internet software and hardware
makers _ still rule on Wall Street. And the amount of venture
capital being sunk into biotechs is still just a fraction of the
money going into Internet-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disproportionate amount of action continues to be in the
(other) tech-related issues,'' said Gail Bronson, a Silicon Valley
Internet start-up executive who also is an analyst for the
publication IPO Monitor. She predicts Internet-related companies
will continue to dominate the market for new stock issues this
year.
</P>
<P>
   That said, despite one of the worst stetches on Wall Street this
year, several new biotech issues hit the floor running in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Molecular Evolution Inc., a gene therapy company, saw
its stock shoot up $11.88, or 62 percent, during its IPO a few
weeks ago. Medical products company Rita Medical Solutions Inc.'s
stock rose 20 percent on its first day of trading. Several other
biotech companies had strong IPOs in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology drugs are those based on cells, genes and other
living matter, as opposed to chemicals. While many chemical drugs _
asprin, for instance _ treat symptoms, biotech drugs _ such as
Epogen or Newpogen, which help create blood cells _ typically are
designed to treat the underlying causes of medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is hot and there's a lot of attention on it,'' said
Tracy Lefteroff, global managing partner for consulting firm
PricewaterhouseCooper's venture capital and private equity
businesses. ``People are very excited about the completion of the
human genome project and all that it means.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter of this year, more venture capital went
to biotech than in any other quarter in history. According to
figures from the National Venture Capital
AssociationOTECHFIRMS-0816-COX 08-15  &UR; BC-BIOTECHFIRMS-0816-COX

<P>
   Start-ups key to growth of biotechnology sector
</P>
<P>
   By Michael E. Kanell
</P>
<P>
   c. 2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA - If biotech is to grow, the sector must be fed with a
stream of start-ups coming out of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, two of the more likely sites for those labs
are Emory University and Georgia Tech, which have partnered with
state officials and the Georgia Research Alliance to start the
Emory-Georgia Tech Biotechnology Center Initiative, now being
referred to as EmTech BioSciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to build in Atlanta is critical mass,''
said Anthony J. Shuker, executive director of EmTech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deepening relationship between Emory and Georgia
Tech,'' he said. ``There is an increasing prominence of Emory in
the health care arena. And also the Georgia Research Alliance has
raised the ability to do biotech to a new level. These three things
really come together in this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Located on Emory University's 42-acre West Campus on Briarcliff
Road, EmTech is to be housed in modified trailerlike facilities
known as ``modular units.'' With about 8,000 square feet of space,
the trailers can house eight to 10 companies, said Rebecca
Kaufman-Gessner, associate director of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Emory contracted with Ayers Saint Gross Architects and Planners
of Baltimore, which developed a master plan for the site that
included a number of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more ambitious hopes for the facility, ``We simply don't
have the resources identified to build permanent facilities,'' said
Charlotte Johnson, senior vice provost for administration at Emory.
``I wish I could tell you when that will happen, but I cannot. But
it is an evolving project, and the first stage is modular units. We
have to see if this baby can crawl before we ask it to walk and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, the kind of start-up companies sought by EmTech are
not likely to expect the most lavish home or to be thinking of
settling at Emory as they grow. ``We would certainly hope, if we do
our job properly, that no company starting at EmTech would be there
longer than three years,'' Shuker said.
</P>
<P>
   EmTech got a boost several weeks ago, landing its first tenant:
Nu-Tec Services shifted its headquarters to Atlanta from a suburb
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Nu-Tec is in bioinformatics, selling supercomputer analysis that
can be used to solve biotech problems like gene design. It has just
six employees here, although it plans expansion to 30 by the end of
2001, according to Chief Executive Michael S. Keehan. The center
has been searching for other tenants, Shuker said. ``We are in
negotiations with a number of different folks, really three or four
companies. I am hoping there will be results soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And how long after that will incubators begin churning out
success stories? ``We would love to see research projects coming
out of Georgia institutions in the next 12 to 18 months be turned
into thriving enterprises,'' Shuker said. ``That would be
spectacular.''

 &HT;    Armed with a repaired hip, Norman hopes to contend in the PGA
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Just two weeks after Greg Norman underwent hip
surgery June 28, he was back at his club, the Medalist, in Hobe
Sound, Fla. Not to play, not to hit balls, not even to walk the
course.
</P>
<P>
   He just wanted to smell the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like someone who's about to walk away from the
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him with such a buzz about his game in a long
time,'' said David Leadbetter, his swing coach. Two weeks after his
smell-the-blades walk at the Medalist, and just a month after
surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip, Norman was fourth
at the International, matching his best finish on the PGA Tour
since his third at last year's Masters.
</P>
<P>
   That showing has fueled speculation that Norman, at 45, can be a
factor this week at the 82nd PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like my chances,'' Norman said Tuesday. So do others. ``I
think he's one of the 10 players to beat this week,'' Mark
Calcavecchia said. ``Greg still has a lot of golf left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough golf left that Norman says he has shelved his
``seven-year plan'' to step away from competitive action after this
season to devote his energies to his Great White Shark Enterprises
and his family. His Jupiter, Fla.,-based business, which ranges
from designing courses to designing yachts, from growing grass to
making wine, will have to wait a few more years to get Norman's
full attention.
</P>
<P>
   There is time to make up for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I have missed out on a couple of years of
the prime of my golf because of a pathology problem in my body,''
Norman said. ``But now it is gone and I feel great, and hopefully I
can just keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in at least six years, Norman says he can
swing a club without pain. His left shoulder was surgically
repaired in 1998 and now his right hip can drive through shots
without causing him to wince. He can even bend over to line up a
putt without pain shooting through his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him practice as much,'' said Pete Draovitch,
his personal trainer. ``He can't wait to get out there to hit
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadbetter said the most recent surgery has enabled Norman to
return to the swing that won two majors (the British Open in 1986
and '93) and more than 70 tournaments worldwide. The operation was
shown on Norman's Web site (shark.com)
</P>
<P>
   But for Norman to finally win his first major in America, he
will have to beat the odds. Only four players have won a major at
45 or older: Julius Boros, Jack Nicklaus, Old Tom Morris and Hale
Irwin. Norman pays no attention to this bit of trivia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 45 is just a number for me,'' Norman said. ``I think
my body tells me I am probably 10, maybe seven years younger. It
gives me the belief in myself that I can continue on past 45. I
know right now I can definitely compete.'' Like Nicklaus, who
underwent hip-replacement surgery last year, Norman said he had
reasons other than golf to get his body in better shape. There was
also a quality-of-life issue such as being able to scuba-dive with
his two children, go hiking with his wife or even be able to eat
breakfast sitting at a table (he had to eat standing up because if
he sat down, it would take several minutes before he could put
weight on his hip).
</P>
<P>
   Norman had millions in the bank, but he didn't have one of the
things he treasured most: his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up golf and I would give up everything to feel
the way I feel . . . to go hiking in the mountains and
fly-fishing,'' he said. ``There are times when I would just sit on
the boat while my children were scuba-diving because it hurt so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the surgery, it's unlikely Norman would be able to carry
the Olympic torch across the historic Sydney Harbor Bridge on its
final leg before next month's opening ceremonies of the Olympic
Games in his homeland. Norman said that moment will rank just
behind his British Open victories as the biggest sports moments of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big honor for me to be able to do that at the 2000
Olympics in Australia,'' he said. ``I just wish golf was an Olympic
sport. It should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman will have his mind on other things this week. He
knows it has been 16 months since he contended in a major, but he
thinks he remembers how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding a bike,'' he said. ``Once you put yourself
back in that position, a competitor is a competitor. You know to
feel the feel.''

 &HT;    2-year-old died from heat, officials find
 &HT;    By Maurice Tamman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - An examination of the body of a 2-year-old who died
after being left in his grandmother's car all day Monday indicated
he probably died of excessive heat, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They said they found no evidence of any other injury or illness
that could have caused the boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the head of the day-care center the boy, Hezekiah
Silvester Welch, usually attended described him as a ``nice,
playful'' child. She said the boy's grandmother, Deborah Welch, 41,
appeared to be an attentive guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Welch found her grandson's body in her car at 4:15 p.m. Monday
after leaving work at the Social Security office at South DeKalb
Mall. The locked car, its windows closed, had been parked in the
mall lot since 7:30 a.m, when she reported to work, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch apparently forgot to drop off the youngster at the Decatur
preschool before work and didn't realize he was still in the car,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators questioned Welch Monday and Tuesday, but she was
not charged. DeKalb County police spokeswoman Mikki Jones said a
decision about charges, if any, will be made today.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kelhofer, chief investigator with the DeKalb Medical
Examiner's Office, said the boy's body showed no evidence of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Stuckey, family education director of YMCA Family Place,
said the toddler had attended the Flat Shoals Road preschool since
May. Stuckey said Welch told her she needed day care near her
office.
</P>
<P>
   Welch works as a service representative at the Social Security
Administration office in the mall, administration spokesman William
DeBardelaben said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuckey said Welch dropped the boy off and picked him up daily.
``She was a very friendly parent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her records showed Welch and her husband were the boy's
guardians. Stuckey said she did not know the name of the boy's
mother but had talked to her on the phone. Jones said Welch and her
daughter had an informal agreement that Welch would care for the
boy. Jones also could not identify the boy's parents A man came to
the scene late Monday identifying himself as the child's father and
was taken away by police.

BLACK DELEGATES TAKE LIEBERMAN TO TASK OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a bold stroke for the instinctively
cautious Al Gore: Pick a running mate from the party's more
conservative center, electrify the country by putting the first
Jewish American on a national ticket and hope that the decision
will lure crucial swing voters to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the decision's downside was also on display.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, who will be nominated for vice
president Wednesday night, spent an hour seeking to mollify a
critical Democratic constituency, black voters, who were concerned
about his 1995 statements that affirmative action programs ought to
be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, distinctive in the Senate for his single-minded
independence and best known to the country for his early
condemnation of President Clinton's sexual affair, assured the
party's most influential black officials that he didn't really mean
it. They left saying they felt reassured.
</P>
<P>
   If the session solved one problem, it underscored another for
Gore and his running mate. The very ideological inconoclasm that
has so distinguished Lieberman, and made him a potential draw for
the middle-of-the-road voters who will decide the election, has
eroded. Lieberman has hardly morphed into another Gore. But in
adjusting to his new role as Gore's understudy, he has publicly
disavowed some of his more conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, few voters will look past Gore and his GOP opponent,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, when they choose the next president.
Nonetheless, some Democrats fear that Lieberman's greatest
political strengths as a Gore ticket-mate may expose
vulnerabilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   To win, Gore must tout the successes of the Clinton-Gore years,
but he will do so standing beside the man who is best known for his
condemnation of the tawdriest moments of Clinton's Presidency,
including Gore's own fundraising excesses in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And as Lieberman has retreated from his past support for school
voucher experiments and for allowing taxpayers to supplement their
retirement savings by investing part of their payroll taxes,
Republicans have found an avenue of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has spent much of the nine days since
Lieberman was tapped by Gore arguing, sometimes hyperbolically,
that Lieberman shares more with Bush than with Gore on several
major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's retrenchment on some issues is nothing new for vice
presidential nominees. In 1980, for example, Bush's father was
accused of placing his manhood in a blind trust for the compromises
he made to become Ronald Reagan's running mate. The elder Bush
disavowed his view that Ronald Reagan's economic plan amounted to
``voodoo economics.'' And Bush, who had favored abortion rights,
became a staunch opponent of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In both parties, the most successful politicians are most often
the easiest to pigeonhole. Not so Lieberman. On some issues, like
his support for the environment and abortion, he is among the
Senate's most ardent liberals. On others, like school vouchers,
welfare reform and Social Security reform, he has sometimes voted
with the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Lieberman's brief brushfire Tuesday seems
inevitable, given the number of times he has taken positions
counter to some of the the party's more influential factions.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from party orthodoxy, in either party, can be costly:
Former Sen. Bill Bradley's primary campaign collapsed in the face
of Gore's withering attacks on him for taking positions supporting
school vouchers, raising the age for Medicare eligibility and
oposing ethanol subsidies. Bradley and Lieberman voted together on
those issues.
</P>
<P>
   While he was an undergraduate at Yale, Lieberman helped register
black voters in the South. And the NAACP has given him a 100
percent rating. But in 1991, though he ultimately voted against the
Supreme Court nomination of Clarence Thomas after the airing of
Anita Hill's sexual harrassment allegations, Lieberman initially
angered liberals by announcing that he would vote to confirm the
controversial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is willing to challenge the conventional thinking of the
Democratic Party,'' says Sen. John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a
friend who preceded Lieberman as chairman of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council. ``His goals are the same as the
party's goals, but his methods are different.''
</P>
<P>
   But affirmative action, like abortion, is a risky issue for
Democratic politicians seeking to stake out new ground.
</P>
<P>
   US Rep. Martin Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, who knows
Lieberman from their joint efforts on campaign finance reform,
compared Lieberman with the late Massachusetts senator, Paul
Tsongas, who often took positions that angered party
traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tsongas, Meehan said, ``Joe Lieberman is very independent,
always on the cutting edge when it comes to new ideas. . . . But
there are risks associated with being ahead of the curve.''
Lieberman's 1995 statements on affirmative action, Meehan said,
``represent one time he took a risk that wasn't in his political
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Meehan: ``I'm sure Joe would like to take those (1995)
comments back.'' That is what Lieberman effectively did later
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also serves to shine a spotlight on how
Democratic attempts to paper over their differences are sometimes
more obvious than when the GOP confronts similar divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's press secretary, Dan Gerstein, has asserted for
several days that 1995 news accounts misrepresented Lieberman, that
the senator has never said he opposed affirmative action programs,
only quotas. But a transcript provided by Lieberman's office apears
to contradict Gerstein, as do 1995 news accounts which the Globe
cited in an article last week.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming to Lieberman's defense has been Rev. Jesse Jackson _
Tuesday night Jackson called the Gore-Lieberman ticket a ``dream
team.'' But in 1995 Jackson swiftly denounced Lieberman's comments
on affirmative action and led a protest against Lieberman in New
Haven, Conn., where he called the senator a ``Demo-publican.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue first surfaced on March 9, 1995, the day Lieberman was
installed as chairman of the centrist DLC, and just months after
Republicans won control of the House with a conservative agenda
that included an end to all affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman was asked about the issue at a news conference,
he said, ``You can't defend policies that are based on group
preferences as opposed to individual oportunities, which is what
America has always been about,'' according to the transcript. He
called such programs ``patently unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Lieberman expressed suport for an upcoming 1996 ballot
initiative in California, which subsequently passed, which wiped
out all public sector affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he added: ``I think we all want to say we're
against quotas and, ah, and against group preferences.'' Several
news organizations, including the New York Times, the Washington
Post and Scripps-Howard, reported that Lieberman was opposed to
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton then reviewing such programs, Jackson reacted
swiftly. According to news accounts, he fired off a 4-page letter
to Lieberman, calling his March 9 remarks ``particularly
irresponsible.'' On March 21 Jackson and Patricia Ireland,
president of the National Organization for Women, organized a
protest rally in New Haven, urging that Lieberman be dumped from
office if he didn't change his stand, according to an article in
the New Haven Register.
</P>
<P>
   A day later Lieberman appeared to modify his blanket criticisms
of March 9, warning that ``those who refuse to acknowledge that
there are problems with some government affirmative action programs
risk dooming all afirmative action programs to defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year the Progressive Policy Institute, an arm of the
DLC, issued a report calling for an end to government affirmative
action programs, except those affecting college admissions. Jackson
again visited New Haven, where, the Hartford Courant reported, he
said, ``I've been surprised and disappointed'' with Lieberman,
adding, ``Usually people expand their visions. His seems to have
narrowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day Lieberman issued a statement saying he believed
that``many affirmative action programs must change because they are
inconsistent with the law and with the basic American value of
equal treatment and oportunity.''

DEMOCRATS FACE LEFT TO APPEASE LIBERAL WING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Faced with an undercurrent of grumbling about the
centrist tone of its ticket and platform, the Democratic Party
devoted much of its convention Tuesday to reassuring its liberal
base, while its vice-presidential candidate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman,
appeared before black delegates to declare his unequivocal support
for affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was for affirmative action, am for affirmative action and
will be for affirmative action,'' Lieberman, who has been critical
of racial preference programs, told the convention's Black Caucus.
Immediately afterward, Rep. Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, who had
voiced strong doubts about Lieberman this weekend, declared she
would support him wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   But other leading liberals continued to express doubts about
Gore himself. Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco said in an
interview Tuesday: ``The most important thing to me is that Gore is
not emotionally in touch with the party's base. He will have to
find ways to repair that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown added, ``If he's smart, he'll go to a black church every
Sunday from now until Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge the depth of discontent among black
voters, union members and other core Democrats with the ticket and
its agenda. But Gore's selection of Lieberman, a Connecticut
senator who has staked out centrist positions not only on
affirmative action, but also on school vouchers, military spending
and Social Security, seems to have crystallized their worries that
Gore is taking them for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments pose a potentially significant problem for Gore
because black voters and union members are among the party's
largest and most loyal constituencies. And while some of those
voters might defect to Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, the
Democrats' greater fear is that their base will simply stay home on
Election Day, making it difficult to win closely contested swing
states like Michigan and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `We don't see the Democrats standing for
us,' '' said Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota Democrat, a leader of
the party's liberal wing. ``It is a hurdle to overcome. And the
vice president needs to do it soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood Tuesday, one movie star well known as well for
championing liberal causes, said he and his friends were very
dissatisfied with Gore. He said they planned to wait a few days,
during which time Gore and Lieberman would address the Democratic
Convention, and then decide whether to support Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the current chairman and Gore a former chairman of
the party's leading centrist organization, the Democratic
Leadership Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign moved swiftly Tuesday to address worries
within the party, not only through Lieberman's appearance before
the Black Caucus, but also by dispatching two black Cabinet
secretaries, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman, and other prominent black Democrats to
declare their strong support for Lieberman on television and in
meetings with black delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased whenever a barrier is broken,'' said
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate from the District of Columbia,
said before the Black Caucus of Lieberman, the first Jewish
candidate for vice president. ``Because when they break a barrier
for somebody excluded, we cannot be far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the list of convention speakers Tuesday night
was almost a Who's Who of leaders from the party's liberal wing,
including two union presidents, a prominent environmentalist, gay
rights and abortion rights leaders, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Four Kennedys, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, spoke to the
convention Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That liberal lineup represented a sharp contrast from the
Republicans, who carefully choreographed their convention two weeks
ago to keep conservative activists backstage, making it easier for
their presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, to reach out to
moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats say that the Republicans appeased their core
voters in other ways: with the party platform, which remains
staunchly conservative on issues like abortion, gay rights and
military spending, and in the selection of Richard Cheney, who
compiled a consistently conservative record in Congress, as the
vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore reached toward the political center with his
selection of Lieberman, a leader of the party's centrist ``New
Democrat'' wing. And his aides rebuffed repeated efforts by
liberals to insert language into the platform calling for universal
health care, cuts in defense spending, a moratorium on capital
punishment and increased spending on the poor.

DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE THEIR LIBERAL HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs to update and change byline; another sub will follow
shortly)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty years after John F. Kennedy accepted the
Democratic nomination in this city, his daughter, brother, niece
and nephew sought to revive the liberal hearts of his party Tuesday
night by recalling the slain president's legacy and tying Vice
President Al Gore to it.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has offered himself as a president for a new century,
the Democrats, on the second night of their national convention,
staged a festival of the past. It was a carefully choreographed
program intended to reassure loyalists that despite Gore's
overtures to moderates, their party was not drifting from its
principles of inclusiveness and tending to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured a parade of liberal stalwarts, from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy to Jesse Jackson, to former Sen. Bill Bradley,
Gore's vanquished foe. There were also speakers representing
important Democratic constituencies: union members, abortion rights
advocates and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leftward tableau on stage was at odds with the platform that
the delegates approved Tuesday night, which was a decided play for
the middle, calling for a more potent military, expanded global
trade and for schools to be more accountable for student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and
security for all,'' the platform proclaimed, ``we cannot afford to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most stirring speeches were about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40
years ago, that America first looked across the New Frontier,''
said Kennedy, the most prominent liberal in Congress, in his
prepared remarks. ``A New Frontier, as my brother said, where there
were `unsolved problems, unconquered pockets of ignorance and
prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his brother, Kennedy said, ``How proud he would be
of Al Gore and our party and the new barrier of bigotry we are
breaking down with the choice of Joe Lieberman as the next vice
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, the late president's daughter, who in her first
speaking appearance before a Democratic convention said she was
proud that Gore's running mate, Lieberman, had been inspired by her
father to enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as I look out across this hall and across the country,''
Kennedy said in her prepared remarks, ``I know that my father's
spirit lives on.'' Her address was particularly poignant because
she is the sole survivor of the late president's immediate family.
Her mother Jacqueline, died in 1994, and her brother, John F.
Kennedy Jr., was killed in a plane crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sentimentality, the symbols of the party's liberal
wing were on stage to address one of Gore's most frustrating
political problems: He is not particularly popular with the base
voters of his party, and, according to surveys, is not nearly as
well liked in his party as Gov. George W. Bush is among
Republicans. Gore is counting on loyal Democrats to flock to the
polls in November. But the longer he has to worry about energizing
those voters, the less attention he can pay to the swing and
independent voters who are crucial for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The calvalcade of liberals was a decided contrast to the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, when conservative figures,
the most steadfast party loyalists, were largely kept off stage as
the party sought to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Republicans put Bush's primary opponent, Sen. John
McCain, on center stage, the Democrats on Tuesday night gave a
prime time spot to Bradley. Offering some of his most lavish praise
thus far for the vice president, Bradley said in prepared remarks:
``I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging intellect, with a
deep desire to serve, profound preparation for the job, a strong
sense of loyalty, and a life infused with tolerance and roots in
religious faith. What strikes me is that what we share is so much
more than what we disagree on.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were not as anticipated as McCain's had been,
perhaps because Bradley _ who did not win a single state in the
primaries _ is not viewed as much as a force in his party. And
Bradley devoted most of his speech to delivering a pitch for his
party and excoriating Republicans as impostors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't window-dress diversity, we're the party of
diversity,'' Bradley said in his prepared remarks. ``Don't read our
lips. Watch what we do. Watch what we have always done, what our
party values have always been.''
</P>
<P>
   In hewing to the old-guard theme of the evening, he went on,
``The convictions that Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon
Johnson stood for, that Jimmy Carter is living for even now, that
Bill Clinton still works for, the ideals that Jack and Bobby and
Martin died for.''

PROGRAM RECOGNIZES TEACHERS' EXTRA EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Caffrey had been teaching English for 31 years
when he heard about a new way to gain recognition for his skills,
one available to teachers nationwide. The hitch: Applicants had to
pass a rigorous and time-consuming assessment that included videos
of their teaching, samples of their students' work and essays
analyzing their classroom techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey, who was teaching middle school in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn, was not the type to mind the extra work. He already had
two master's degrees and was eager for another credential, even if
it did not mean higher pay or career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply wanted to be recognized as an expert in my field,''
Caffrey said last week. ``I wanted the confidence that affirmation
like that could bring.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1995, Caffrey became one of the first New York City
teachers to earn advanced certification from the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, an independent panel that sets
standards for experienced teachers. The board, created in 1987, was
recommended in a landmark report, ``A Nation Prepared: Teachers for
the 21st Century,'' by the Carnegie Forum on Education and the
Economy. National board certification does not replace state
certification, which remains an entry level requirement for all
teachers. Instead, it helps teachers with at least three years of
experience measure their skills using benchmarks set by the panel,
which is mostly made up of teachers but also includes school
administrators, union officials, lawmakers and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It recognizes people who go beyond what is expected,'' said
Karen Zumwalt, a professor at Columbia Teachers College, ``and it
motivates people who want to grow professionally but aren't sure
how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a record 2,967 teachers earned national board
certification, bringing the total to 4,804 nationwide since 1995.
But only 62 teachers in New York State have earned the credential,
and of those, only 25 work in New York City. Randi Weingarten,
president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the program
has been slow to catch on here because there were few financial
incentives attached and because city teachers were overextended as
it is.
</P>
<P>
   But as education has become a crucial election issue and states
have scrambled to attract teachers in the face of a shortage, New
York has joined several dozen other states in creating incentives
for teachers to get national certification. The state now pays the
$2,300 application fee for most teachers. And starting this year,
the state plans to give $10,000 a year for three years to teachers
who earn the advanced certification and agree to work in
low-performing schools. In New York City, that means the 99
``schools under registration review,'' which have been designated
by the state as failing.
</P>
<P>
   City teachers who earn national certification also can get a
$3,700 raise. But those who have earned 30 credits beyond their
master's degrees _ about 44 percent of the city's 78,000 teachers _
already have received that increase and cannot get more for
certification. Weingarten said this lack of an additional incentive
was the main reason so few city teachers have gone through the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The new incentives may be working. This spring, 100 teachers in
New York state submitted applications to the national board, up
from 59 in 1999. Those teachers will find out in November whether
they passed the assessment. Meanwhile, about 50 city teachers are
applying for national certification in the coming school year, up
from 20 this spring. Typically, slightly more than half of each
year's applicants are certified .
</P>
<P>
   During the school year, applicants videotape their classroom
instruction, submit lesson plans and student work samples, and
write essays reflecting on how they help students learn. They also
have to write extensively about their work outside the classroom
with colleagues, parents and the community. In the summer, they
finish the process with written exams on the subject they teach, as
well as teaching techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes up all the extra time that you possibly have,'' said
Beverly Tinort, who teaches first grade at C.S. 21 in Brooklyn and
earned national board certification last year. ``But it's so worth
it. Teachers in New York are so burdened, we never get a chance to
stop and reflect on how we're doing our job. This is a blessing
because it forces us to stop and reflect.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the assessment, Tinort had to sit with colleagues and
watch a video she had made of herself teaching sixth-graders. Her
colleagues picked apart everything from her body language to why
girls seemed more engaged in the lesson than boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on it was very painful to watch yourself with that
critical eye,'' Tinort said. ``But you pick up so many things that
you never would have realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really pick up on your weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Caffrey, said the national certification process
did not improve their skills but simply affirmed that their
teaching methods were on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go into classrooms now I have a sense of
accomplishment,'' said Caffrey, who now runs a union-sponsored
teacher training center in Brooklyn's District 14. ``I always felt
teaching was a noble profession and I worked so hard every day, and
it just didn't seem to me that people in the management system
recognized that. Now I have some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics question whether nationally certified teachers are
really better. Chester E. Finn Jr., an assistant secretary of
education under President Ronald Reagan, said there was no data on
how the students of these teachers performed compared with their
peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years and gazillions of dollars and an awful lot of
states being wooed to give bonuses to these folks, all we know is
that other teachers admire their teaching,'' Finn said. ``I need to
see some proof that these teachers are more effective in terms of
student learning.''

JESSE JACKSON CALLS DRUG WAR RACIST; DEMANDS MORE TREATMENT
PROGRAMS &HT;    (EDs: UPDATES with 6th graf showing Jackson speaking at the
Democratic convention, edits to conform.)
 &HT;    By MARK HELM
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking at a so-called
Shadow Convention here, called Tuesday for an end to the country's
war on drugs, which he said unfairly targets minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader likened the government's antidrug
program to ``friendly fire (that) is killing Americans rather than
helping Americans, a policy driven by fear, race and greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said African Americans comprise nearly two thirds of all
drug offenders admitted to state prison although their rate of drug
use is roughly equal to that of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are poor, brown or black or don't have a lawyer, there
is no category called youthful indiscretion,`` he said in a veiled
reference to questions about whether Republican presidential
nominee George W. Bush used cocaine in his past, questions that the
candidate has refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1984 and 1988, called, as he has in the past, for
loosening state and federal drug laws and increasing drug treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he criticized both parties for not addressing the
issue, Jackson addressed the Democratic National Convention here
five hours later and praised the party for its diversity and
presumed presidential nominee Al Gore for his promises to fight for
working families.
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers at the Shadow Convention, which is running in
tandem with and often counter to the Democratic conclave, included
New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson
and Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., and
Tom Campbell, R-Calif., who is the Republican candidate for Senate
against incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also attacked the nation's war against drugs as a
failure. He said that while government spending on enforcement of
drug laws has increased from about $1 billion in 1980 to more than
$40 billion this year, the availability of illegal narcotics has
increased dramatically and the price has fallen over the past 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a 1999 report by the U.S. Health and Human Services
that found that 88 percent of 12th graders said marijuana was easy
to get, 47 percent said cocaine was easy to get, and 32 percent
said heroin was easy to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think drug and alcohol use is a terrible thing, which is
exactly why I'm not going to keep pretending that a policy that
doesn't reduce drug use or the availability of drugs is working,''
said Johnson, who does not smoke or drink. He also called for the
legalization of marijuana and for treatment programs for first-time
drug ofenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention, which is being held a few blocks from the
Democratic gathering, is also taking up such subjects as campaign
finance reform and the gap between rich and poor. The first Shadow
Convention, which addressed the same issues, was held in
Philadelphia during the Republican National Convention two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of controversial columnist Arianna Huffington,
the counter-culture conclaves have been billed as the
``un-conventions'' and antidotes to what organizers call the
scripted coronations of the Republican and Democratic
nominees.``There's no competition anymore, no question of the
outcome,'' said comedial Bill Maher, host of the television show
``Politically Incorrect.'' ``The other conventions are infomercials
and bad ones,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Along with discussions on political issues, the Shadow
Conventions also offer comedy and political satire. ``Our goal is
to put some well-known people out in the morning to talk about the
issues that are being ignored by both parties, and then in the
evening focus more on entertaining people,'' said Ethan Nadelmann,
a Shadow Conventions organizer and director of the New York-based
Lindesmith Center, a drug policy institute. ``Politics does not
have to be serious all the time,'' he added.

EDITORIAL: WARRING POPULISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your point of view, it was either old-time religion
night or dinosaur time at the Democratic National Convention. Two
of the party's great roarers, Sen. Ted Kennedy and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, were on hand to remind the faithful of the party's
traditional New Deal values. John F. Kennedy's only surviving
child, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, was on hand to remind voters
of that golden era when Democrats like her father could depend on a
solid base of blue-collar voters. Earlier in the day Vice President
Al Gore was in Michigan, the heart of union country, to warn that
``the powerful interests are going to fight against us with
everything they've got'' to prevent the Democratic ticket from
defending working families.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Franklin D. Roosevelt's politically productive
attacks on financial ``royalists,'' economic populism was a staple
of Democratic campaigns. For years, when Democrats turned to their
venerable themes of economic justice and fairer income
distribution, the Republicans accused them of promoting class
warfare, but to little avail. Then under the tutelage of Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the GOP learned to trump the Democrats'
appeals to middle-class financial solidarity with their own appeals
to Main Street in the form of a cultural populism built around a
powerful set of patriotic, religious and racial symbols. Now both
Gore and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, seem eager
for a renewed clash built around their competing brands of
populism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the apostate Clinton strategist, Dick Morris, argues
that Gore is making a mistake to revive ``liberal'' economic
themes, both Gore and President Clinton seem confident the
Democratic ticket can win an argument over who gets the fruits of
what Gore calls ``unprecedented economic abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the target presented by Bush, with his old-money
pedigree and his oil-patch running mate, is irresistible. He would
spend billions on tax relief for investors, top earners and
inheritors of large estates. His plan is a perfect setup for Gore's
favorite pitch that he ``fights for working families'' while the
GOP remains the party of ``the wealthy, the well connected and the
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rhetoric, like that of Kennedy and Jackson, has a root
system that dates back to William Jennings Bryan. Populism in its
original form arose as a protest against the ability of
agricultural, railroad and industrial interests to buy influence
over government policy. Today's soft-money game is a lineal
descendant of that form of corruption _ a fact that undercuts the
purity of Gore's claim to be an opponent of special interests. In
fact, the Democrats have been lapping up soft money from
corporations and wealthy donors, having already passed $120 million
before starting the fund-raising events associated with their
convention. As John M. Broder and Don Van Natta Jr. reported in
Tuesday's New York Times, corporate donors and lobbyists play the
money game at both conventions in what Sen. Russell Feingold calls
a ``system of legalized extortion and legalized bribery.'' The
inescapable conclusion is that Gore, no amateur exaggerator,
grossly exaggerates his party's independence of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the convention oratory reflects an underlying reality
that the Democrats do offer a fairer approach to parceling out the
benefits of the Clinton boom. Gore's promise to take on the drug
companies and health management organizations does have more
credibility than Bush's less aggressive proposals. Moreover, should
he carry out his campaign promise to outlaw soft money
contributions that have tainted both conventions, Gore will have
put some real muscle behind the Democrats' quadrennial exercise in
ringing the century-old chimes of economic populism.

 &HT;    Back problems force Duval to withdraw from PGA Championship
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLe, Ky. - David Duval won't suffer another disappointing
Sunday finish at a major championship this year. This time it
happened on a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still in search of his first major title, the world's No. 3
player has withdrawn from the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf
Club because of a continuing back injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' Duval said from Sun Valley, Idaho, where he is
attempting to rest an injury that has forced withdrawals from three
consecutive tournaments. ``My mind is saying, `Let's go play, let's
get after it. You're fit. You can work through this.' But as much
as I think this way, I know deep down the right thing to do is not
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Georgia Tech player said he has not hit a shot since
walking off the course six holes into the International two weeks
ago in Colorado. He also withdrew from last week's Buick Open. An
MRI has been taken on Duval's back, with the injury described as
``a ligment issue'' in his lower to middle back region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about, more than anything, just teeing off,'' Duval
said of the PGA. ``In the long term, that would have been a poor
decision. With the adrenaline and a strong desire, I might have
kept going and set myself further back and ended my year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who has not yet won a major, played in the final group at
both the 2000 Masters and British Open, where his back went into
spasm.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced in the field by Craig Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Elkington, who last week underwent hip surgery, was
replaced in the field by Edward Fryatt.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville native and past PGA champion Bobby Nichols also
withdrew. His spot was taken by Greg Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus pro Gill having heady time
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gill of Columbus' Maple Ridge Golf Club, the Georgia
Section's only representative in the PGA field, spent a memorable
practice round Tuesday, finding a game with Masters champion Vijay
Singh, two-time PGA champion Nick Price and two-time U.S. Open
champion Ernie Els. ``You can't believe how much fun I'm having,''
said Gill, who is playing his first PGA and also will represent the
organization in the PGA Cup in Wales.... Australian Greg Norman,
who will carry the Olympic torch in Opening Ceremonies in Sydney
next month, said it's ``a crying shame'' that golf is not an
Olympic event. ``It's time to take off the blinders and just see
how popular golf is on a global basis,'' Norman said, ``and it
deserves to be in there.'' Going just a bit overboard, Norman said,
``The Berlin Wall came down with a lot of chat, a lot of dialogue.
Why not get golf in the Olympics?''... Atlanta resident Billy
Andrade, who is 160th on the PGA Tour money list this year with
$131,827, is missing his first PGA since his first year on tour
(1988).... Augusta's Charles Howell, who probably will be attending
many PGA Championships in the future, has signed a three-year
contract with Callaway Golf for more than $1 million a year to wear
the company's logo on his bag, cap and clothes and play its clubs
and ball.... Tiger Woods, on Valhalla as a major championship
venue: ``I mean, you have Augusta, you have Pebble Beach and you
have St. Andrews and I don't think anyone is going to say that
Valhalla is in the same caliber as those three golf courses, but
this golf course is going to be a test and we can't ignore that.''

REGGIE LEWIS' WIDOW FILES TO REOPEN MALPRACTICE CASE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One month after a judge rejected her appeal of a jury
verdict clearing cardiologist Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. of negligence in
her husband's death, Donna Harris-Lewis has a new team of lawyers
and is asking that the case be reopened, claiming that her former
lawyer failed to pursue her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis also claims that attorney Neil Rossman, who
represented her during the retrial of her medical malpractice
lawsuit, was ``personally'' responsible for a $10,000 court
stenography bill sent to her _ a debt made public by unhappy court
reporters waiting for payment _ because she had previously paid him
$1.5 million in ``case costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's legal maneuver is the latest in a saga that began
seven years ago when her husband, Celtics captain Reggie Lewis,
collapsed and died of a heart ailment while shooting baskets at a
Brandeis University gym. Harris-Lewis accused Mudge, Lewis's chief
cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, of misdiagnosing her
husband's heart disorder in concluding that he suffered from a
benign fainting condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-profile trials followed, the most recent ending in May
with Mudge cleared of negligence in Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Harris-Lewis hired three new lawyers, including a
lead attorney from New Jersey, Anthony J. Macri, and two others
from Boston, Pamela Harris-Daley and Krista M. Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, they filed a motion in Suffolk Superior Court
asking Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith, who presided over both
malpractice trials, to revive the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis's new lawyers also asked Fremont-Smith to
reconsider his ruling last month ordering Harris-Lewis to reimburse
Mudge's lawyers $52,000 in court costs and deposition expenses.
Rossman had not opposed the reimbursement request.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he had not done so, Rossman replied, ``Well,
they're entitled to it, right?'' according to an affidavit filed by
Lewis's new lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lawyers have filed papers in court opposing
Harris-Lewis's motion to reopen the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply, enough is enough, and it is time for this case
to be at an end,'' wrote William J. Dailey Jr., Mudge's lawyer.
``The attorneys who represented Mrs. Harris-Lewis were top-notch,
they gave their all, and in at least one instance apparently
suffered financially,'' an apparent reference to the bankruptcy of
Harris-Lewis's former law firm, Harley &AMP; Brown, after the first
trial, which ended in a hung jury last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply by flailing around and apparently finding some attorney
who will now take a swing at a trial record that has already been
reviewed by an experienced trial attorney (Mr. Rossman) and found
to be without errors,'' Dailey continued, ``is not enough to serve
as a basis for the court to reconsider the decisions which were
appropriately made.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home, Dailey called the developments
``disappointing,'' and said that ``it's really time that everyone
moved on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Daley and Larsen, who are criminal defense attorneys,
referred all calls to Macri.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his New Jersey office Tuesday, Macri said
Harris-Lewis had been ``deprived of a fair trial'' and that her
appeal ``should never have been allowed to be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Macri said there were several legal errors made during the
retrial that satisfy grounds for appeal, including the introduction
of testimony about Lewis's alleged cocaine use and the $12
million-plus in insurance payments Harris-Lewis received after
Lewis died. That testimony was ``legally irrelevant'' and ``very
prejudicial to Donna,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the retrial, after the close of testimony, Fremont-Smith
told jurors they could not consider Lewis's alleged cocaine use
during deliberations because there was no evidence that drugs
played a role in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Tuesday, Rossman declined to comment on
Harris-Lewis's allegations that he had missed deadlines required to
continue her appeal. But he called her claim that she had paid him
$1.5 million ``palpably and pathologically false.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is in a court pleading, it's either a typo or it's an
attempt to perpetrate a fraud on the court,'' Rossman said. ``If it
weren't so ludicrous, it would be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rossman would not discuss his dealings with Harris-Lewis,
her lawyers claim in their court filing that Rossman told them he
had informed Harris-Lewis that he would not represent her on appeal
and had filed the initial paperwork only to preserve her legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Macri, Rossman said he had searched for issues to
appeal but had found none. He also said he delayed filing appellate
documents in order to give Harris-Lewis time to find a new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Macri said Tuesday that Harris-Lewis ``certainly has a right to
have her appeal heard on its merits and not have it dismissed on
procedural grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was prepared to try the case for what would be its
third round in court, Macri replied, ``Absolutely. And I think it
should be.''

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch proposed this week to add to his already vast
media holdings by buying WWOR Channel 9 in the New York City region
and nine other television stations across the country from
Chris-Craft Industries. The purchase would give his company, News
Corp., ownership of stations that reach more than 35 percent of the
viewing public in the nation, violating a rule of the Federal
Communications Commission. Murdoch plans to satisfy the commission
by selling as many stations as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the proposed purchase would create a troubling
concentration of media outlets. It would give him two television
stations each in New York, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Salt Lake City.
The commission allows for owning two stations if diversity of
expression is preserved. That means it requires that at least eight
independent TV stations survive in each market and that no one owns
more than one of any market's four top-rated stations.
</P>
<P>
   These rules would require Murdoch to sell one station in Salt
Lake City. But even in some of the cities where the ownership rules
are not violated, the commission might reasonably decide that
Murdoch's proposal, by eliminating competition between two
independent sources of news and entertainment, would not serve the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever pros and cons owning two stations may pose in other
cities, however, the commission should firmly reject it for New
York. There Murdoch owns not only another television station,
Channel 5, but also The New York Post, one of the city's four major
daily newspapers. Commission rules forbid joint ownership of
television stations and newspapers in the same city except in
emergencies. No such emergency exists that would warrant the
commission's waiving rules designed to preserve the diversity of
news and entertainment on which democracy thrives.
</P>
<P>
   The commission granted Murdoch a waiver in 1993 so he could buy
The New York Post despite the fact that he already owned Channel 5.
It reasoned, correctly, that the rule had to be waived to keep the
newspaper from going out of business. But this time there is no
such threat. Neither The Post nor Channel 9 is in danger of
collapse.

trial, which ended in a hung jury last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply by flailing around and apparently finding some attorney
who will now take a swing at a trial record that has already been
reviewed by an experienced trial attorney (Mr. Rossman) and found
to be without errors,'' Dailey continued, ``is not enough to serve
as a basis for the court to reconsider the decisions which were
appropriately made.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home, Dailey called the developments
``disappointing,'' and said that ``it's really time that everyone
moved on with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Daley and Larsen, who are criminal defense attorneys,
referred all calls to Macri.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his New Jersey office Tuesday, Macri said
Harris-Lewis had been ``deprived of a fair trial'' and that her
appeal ``should never have been allowed to be dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   Macri said there were several legal errors made during the
retrial that satisfy grounds for appeal, including the introduction
of testimony about Lewis's alleged cocaine use and the $12
million-plus in insurance payments Harris-Lewis received after
Lewis died. That testimony was ``legally irrelevant'' and ``very
prejudicial to Donna,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the retrial, after the close of testimony, Fremont-Smith
told jurors they could not consider Lewis's alleged cocaine use
during deliberations because there was no evidence that drugs
played a role in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Tuesday, Rossman declined to comment on
Harris-Lewis's allegations that he had missed deadlines required to
continue her appeal. But he called her claim that she had paid him
$1.5 million ``palpably and pathologically false.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is in a court pleading, it's either a typo or it's an
attempt to perpetrate a fraud on the court,'' Rossman said. ``If it
weren't so ludicrous, it would be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rossman would not discuss his dealings with Harris-Lewis,
her lawyers claim in their court filing that Rossman told them he
had informed Harris-Lewis that he would not represent her on appeal
and had filed the initial paperwork only to preserve her legal
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Macri, Rossman said he had searched for issues to
appeal but had found none. He also said he delayed filing appellate
documents in order to give Harris-Lewis time to find a new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Macri said Tuesday that Harris-Lewis ``certainly has a right to
have her appeal heard on its merits and not have it dismissed on
procedural grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was prepared to try the case for what would be its
third round in court, Macri replied, ``Absolutely. And I think it
should be.''

DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE THEIR LIBERAL HERITAGE

cavalcade XXX. Another sub to follow shortly.)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty years after John F. Kennedy accepted the
Democratic nomination in this city, his daughter, brother, niece
and nephew sought to revive the liberal hearts of his party Tuesday
night by recalling the slain president's legacy and tying Vice
President Al Gore to it.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has offered himself as a president for a new century,
the Democrats, on the second night of their national convention,
staged a festival of the past. It was a carefully choreographed
program intended to reassure loyalists that despite Gore's
overtures to moderates, their party was not drifting from its
principles of inclusiveness and tending to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured a parade of liberal stalwarts, from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's vanquished foe. There were also speakers
representing important Democratic constituencies: union members,
abortion rights advocates and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leftward tableau on stage was at odds with the platform that
the delegates approved Tuesday night, which was a decided play for
the middle, calling for a more potent military, expanded global
trade and for schools to be more accountable for student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and
security for all,'' the platform proclaimed, ``we cannot afford to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most stirring speeches were about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40
years ago, that America first looked across the New Frontier,''
said Kennedy, the most prominent liberal in Congress, in his
prepared remarks. ``A New Frontier, as my brother said, where there
were `unsolved problems, unconquered pockets of ignorance and
prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his brother, Kennedy said, ``How proud he would be
of Al Gore and our party and the new barrier of bigotry we are
breaking down with the choice of Joe Lieberman as the next vice
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, the late president's daughter, who in her first
speaking appearance before a Democratic convention said she was
proud that Gore's running mate, Lieberman, had been inspired by her
father to enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as I look out across this hall and across the country,''
Kennedy said in her prepared remarks, ``I know that my father's
spirit lives on.'' Her address was particularly poignant because
she is the sole survivor of the late president's immediate family.
Her mother Jacqueline, died in 1994, and her brother, John F.
Kennedy Jr., was killed in a plane crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sentimentality, the symbols of the party's liberal
wing were on stage to address one of Gore's most frustrating
political problems: He is not particularly popular with the base
voters of his party, and, according to surveys, is not nearly as
well liked in his party as Gov. George W. Bush is among
Republicans. Gore is counting on loyal Democrats to flock to the
polls in November. But the longer he has to worry about energizing
those voters, the less attention he can pay to the swing and
independent voters who are crucial for victory.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Democrats' drive to enliven the party, several
delivered intensely partisan speeches that bitterly repudiated
Bush's promise of compassion at his convention in Philadelphia as a
facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the inclusion illusion,'' Jackson said. ``In
Philadelphia, diversity ended on the stage. They could not mention
the words `Africa,' `Appalachia,' or `AIDS' once. So it is good to
be here in Los Angeles, to look over this great assembly and see
the real deal _ the quilt of many patches that is America.''
</P>
<P>
   After a riff in which he condemned the Bush clan, Jackson
repeated, ``America: Stay out of the Bushes. Stay out of the
Bushes. Stay out of the Bush,'' prompting the audience to respond
back with the same chant.
</P>
<P>
   The calvalcade of liberals was a decided contrast to the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, when conservative figures,
the most steadfast party loyalists, were largely kept off stage as
the party sought to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Republicans put Bush's primary opponent, Sen. John
McCain, on center stage, the Democrats on Tuesday night gave a
prime time spot to Bradley. Offering some of his most lavish praise
thus far for the vice president, Bradley said in prepared remarks:
``I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging intellect, with a
deep desire to serve, profound preparation for the job, a strong
sense of loyalty, and a life infused with tolerance and roots in
religious faith. What strikes me is that what we share is so much
more than what we disagree on.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were not as anticipated as McCain's had been,
perhaps because Bradley _ who did not win a single state in the
primaries _ is not viewed as much as a force in his party. And
Bradley devoted most of his speech to delivering a pitch for his
party and excoriating Republicans as impostors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't window-dress diversity, we're the party of
diversity,'' Bradley said in his prepared remarks. ``Don't read our
lips. Watch what we do. Watch what we have always done, what our
party values have always been.''
</P>
<P>
   In hewing to the old-guard theme of the evening, he went on,
``The convictions that Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon
Johnson stood for, that Jimmy Carter is living for even now, that
Bill Clinton still works for, the ideals that Jack and Bobby and
Martin died for.''

 &HT;    Judge says gag order applies to Al-Amin
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - For now, a judge is ordering Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin to
keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, defense attorneys asked the judge in Al-Amin's death
penalty case to allow him to talk publicly. Al-Amin is accused of
shooting two Fulton County sheriff's deputies, killing one. It
could be up to two years before his trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton Superior Court Judge Stephanie Manis barred everyone on
the defense and prosecution from talking to members of the media
about Al-Amin or the evidence against him. Manis wants to prevent
publicity from influencing potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Manis said the restrictions apply to Al-Amin,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right to say, `I'm innocent; I deny the charges
against me,''' said Jack Martin, Al-Amin's lead defense attorney.
``He has the right to describe and explain his political and
religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Martin does not want Al-Amin to discuss the evidence in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, who ran a Muslim mosque in Atlanta's West End, was a
leader of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee in the
1960s and, for a short time, a member of the Black Panthers. While
a member of those groups he used the name H. Rap Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Manis said she will look at other court rulings about a
defendant's right to free speech. She could rule in two to four
weeks. In the meantime, Al-Amin cannot give interviews, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an obligation to ensure a fair trial,'' Manis said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Martin complained he has not received notes
written by GBI forensic experts about DNA and ballistics evidence.
A GBI ballistics report says a rifle and handgun found in Alabama
where Al-Amin was arrested were the firearms used in the March 16
shooting in West End.
</P>
<P>
   The report and the surviving deputy's statement that Al-Amin was
the shooter are crucial to the state's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run the risk of having your reports excluded'' during
trial if the notes are not turned over, Manis warned prosecutor
Thomas Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Manis did not rule on the matter and told Martin to file a
motion about the notes.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also barred New York lawyer Michael Warren from
sitting next to Al-Amin during the hearing. Al-Amin's family wants
Warren to join the defense team. Manis said she wants Warren to
apply in writing first. Currently, Martin and Bruce Harvey
represent Al-Amin. Both are white.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is black and Muslim. He is known for his work with
William Kunstler in the successful defense of El Sayyid A. Nosair,
who was acquitted in 1991 of murdering Rabbi Meir Kahane in New
York. Warren argued the case against Nosair was a conspiracy.
Al-Amin, in his sole statement about his case, said it was a
government conspiracy.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government data released Tuesday evening showed
that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now
being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them
Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators said that they had received more than 750
complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62
deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than
previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety
recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall
of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978,
followed far more complaints to regulators _ 14,000 _ but fewer
deaths _ 41.
</P>
<P>
   Why have the recent tire failures been unusually deadly? The
tires recalled in 1978 were on cars; the tires at issue now are on
sport utility vehicles and a few pickup trucks, which are harder to
control when a tire fails.
</P>
<P>
   Safety groups and lawyers representing crash victims are urging
automakers to make changes, like redesigning the tires and the
suspensions, so that their sport utilities will be less likely to
go out of control and roll over when a tire fails. But automakers
have mostly rejected these ideas as they try to satisfy customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, putting nylon coatings inside would help hold the
tires together when the tread peels off, as has happened with the
Firestone tires. But that produces a bouncier ride, which few
drivers choose at showrooms, so automakers seldom request the nylon
from tire makers, said Brook Lindbert, the engineering director for
tire and wheel systems at General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Recommending a high inflation pressure for tires, which the Ford
Motor Co. did not do for the Explorer, reduces the likelihood of a
tire failure. But more fully inflated tires produce a bumpier ride,
said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American
trucks. If the recommended pressure is fairly low to begin with,
there is less of a safety margin to protect against leaks that may
cause tire pressure to fall to dangerously low levels, he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Most sport utility vehicles still use the stiff suspensions of
the pickup trucks on which they were based. These shared
suspensions hold down the cost and improve performance on rough
terrain, which many drivers cherish even if they never leave the
asphalt. But stiff suspensions also produce a bouncy ride that is
hard to offset without soft tires.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing these often conflicting demands is difficult. The
question now in court cases and for regulators is whether too much
safety has been compromised, and whether automakers have set a
balance too far in the direction of customer desires and too little
in the interest of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ford, which installed most of the recalled Firestone
tires on its Ford Explorer sport utilities, automakers say that
they have set an appropriate balance between customer satisfaction
and safety. Even with the deaths blamed on Firestone tires,
Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollovers than
other midsized sport utilities and a 24 percent lower death rate in
crashes over all, said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While sport utility occupants have high death rates in
rollovers, their overall death rates are no higher than for car
occupants. This is because sport utilities fare well in collisions
with lower-riding cars, he said, adding that, ``Customers should
look at and consider the overall accident rate in all types of
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deaths now being attributed to tires might seem
numerous to Explorer owners and are large for a recall of tires or
auto parts, they represent a smaller problem by traffic safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The tire-related deaths spread over the last several years are
just a tiny part of the much bigger problem of rollovers, which
kill 9,500 Americans a year. Rollovers, in turn, are just part of
the overall problem of automobile crashes, which claim 41,000 lives
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The high incidence of rollovers in the tire incidents could,
however, focus attention on a move by Senate Republicans and the
auto industry to block publication by the government of rollover
ratings for cars and for light trucks, a category that includes
minivans and pickup trucks as well as sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   After 27 years of study and numerous objections by the auto
industry, federal regulators announced plans on May 25 to begin the
ratings this autumn. But after strenuous auto industry lobbying,
the Senate inserted a little-noticed provision in the
transportation budget this summer barring regulators from issuing
the rules and ordering the National Academy of Sciences to conduct
a one-year study of the regulators' technique for the ratings. The
House version of the transportation budget does not contain this
provision, and House and Senate conferees are scheduled to work out
the differences in the budgets early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stanton, the senior lobbyist for the Washington-based
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the regulators' proposed
rating system was too imprecise. The system compares a vehicle's
width to the height of its center of gravity. The system does not
take into account high-tech features like roof-mounted air bags, or
the computerized vehicle stability systems that Ford said last week
that it would start offering on all sport utility and pickup truck
models.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricardo Martinez, the administrator until last autumn of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates
vehicle safety, said that the rating system was reliable and should
be adopted quickly. The system assigns vehicles one to five stars,
like government crash test ratings. &UR;  &LR;

</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities are more prone than cars to roll over if they
lose a tire, although rollovers also depend on variables like
driver skill, Lindbert of GM said. The higher a vehicle's center of
gravity, the more the vehicle and its occupants tend to lean
forward during braking, and this makes it important to retain as
much traction as possible on the rear tires to keep the back end of
the vehicle under control, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a rear tire develops problems, Lindbert said, ``in many
regards you have the potential to get sideways on the road,'' which
tends to produce rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's government data showed that while front and rear
tires are subject to failure, rear tire failures caused all but two
of the 131 rollovers reported to regulators. Not all rollovers
resulted in death. Calculating the frequency of rollovers when
tires fail is almost impossible because no one knows for sure how
many tire failures there are. The government does not collect the
data and tire makers do not share their data on their own brands.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of federal data on deaths in tire-related accidents
from 1990 to 1997, the most recent year available, shows that 91
percent of the deaths of occupants in Ford Explorers involved
rollovers. Only 28 percent of the tire-related deaths in cars
involved rollovers, said Leon Robertson, a retired Yale University
epidemiologist who analyzed the data and who has also worked for
plaintiff lawyers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The government data included public complaints of 52 deaths in
Explorers that rolled over after Firestone tires failed, and five
more deaths in Explorers for which the complaints did not mention
whether rollovers occurred. Only two Explorers did not roll over.
All of the remaining deaths also involved rollovers, mostly in
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Firestone tire problems, automakers had begun to
make changes to their sport utilities. The next generation of Ford
Explorers, which will go on sale in January, has a softer, car-like
suspension of coiled springs instead of a truck suspension of steel
bars that flex when the vehicle goes over bumps.
</P>
<P>
   With the new suspension will go new tires. Ford decided several
years ago that the new Explorers will no longer use 15-inch tires
but will have 16-inch tires instead. The 16-inch size has not been
recalled, although some plaintiff lawyers have called for this, and
is already used on the more expensive Explorers now. The tire has a
recommended inflation pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, four
pounds more than the 15-inch tires being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said Tuesday night that even
before the current problems, Ford was considering a pressure of
more than 30 pounds for the next generation of Explorers,
particularly for the rear tires.
</P>
<P>
   But safety experts caution that the biggest safety gains will
come not from tire changes but from motorists' buckling their seat
belts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Government statisticians say that halving the frequency of
unbuckled motorists, to one-sixth of front-seat occupants from
one-third, would save several thousand lives each year and would
provide the greatest benefits for people in vehicles that roll
over.

`NEW FRONTIER' TIMELESS, CAROLINE KENNEDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD AND YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's a very private person who shuns the
spotlight, but the torch has been passed and the legacy belongs to
her alone. So Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the only surviving
member of President Kennedy's immediate family, came forward
Tuesday night to commemorate the anniversary of her father's
historic nomination here 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look out across this hall and across this country, I know
that my father's spirit lives on, and I thank all of you,''
Schlossberg told more than 4,000 delegates to the Democratic
National Convention. ``Now it is our turn to prove that the New
Frontier was not a place in time, but a timeless call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are the New Frontier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Schlossberg was a child when her father inspired
Americans to reach beyond their private space and commit to public
service. Ironically, the woman who depended on her dashing,
celebrity brother to be the Kennedy family's public face has been
thrust by yet another family tragedy out of her own private life
and Tuesday night, onto a very big national stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is, there is a sense in each of the Kennedys that you
take up where the last one left off,'' said historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin. ``With her brother, John, gone, Caroline has accepted the
mantle that has fallen on her to keep the story alive.''
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews Tuesday, Kennedy Schlossbery joked that
she agreed to speak at her first convention because she could not
say no to her uncle, US Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Indeed, she has always been close to her father's youngest brother,
and in introducing him at the convention Tuesday night, she called
him ``a light and a life force in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No uncle could be better,'' Kennedy Schlossberg said in
remarks prepared for delivery. ``No senator has ever achieved
more.''
</P>
<P>
   But the woman many Americans remember as a little girl romping
around the Oval Office, or as the brave child who tenderly kissed
her father's casket, had a serious political message to deliver. In
good times, Americans must redouble their efforts to help children,
the elderly, and the poor, Kennedy Schlossberg said, adding that
the best way to guarantee that is to elect Al Gore president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a president who is not afraid of complexity, who
believes in an open and tolerant society,'' Kennedy Schlossbery
said. ``We need a president who knows that the world can be made
new again _ and that president is Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends insisted this was not a tryout for another Kennedy
political career. Foremost, Kennedy Schlossberg is devoted to her
children _ she and her husband, Edwin, have three school-age
youngsters and live an almost antisocial, family-centered life in
Manhattan and eastern Long Island. Trained as a lawyer, though she
never practiced law, Kennedy Schlossbery has co-authored two
scholarly books on the individual and privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks, which lasted about 10 minutes, Kennedy
Schlossberg said the nation had to be vigilant, as her father was,
in working to protect civil and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we believe in the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights _ including the right to privacy _ that our
personal financial and medical information should not be up for
grabs, and we should be able to make our own reproductive
decisions, that is up to us,.''
</P>
<P>
   She is also head of the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum
Foundation in Boston and is on the panel that selects winners of
the Profile in Courage award, which is conferred annually on public
officials who act on principle over politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a very smart and sincere person who tries to do the
right thing while maintaining a very private life,'' said a friend
did not want to be identified. ``She is not a public person and has
no intention of becoming one.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Schlossberg, who carries herself with the dignity of her
mother but has the skill to deliver a speech like her father, noted
Tuesday night that she did have a special kinship with Gore. His
parents, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. and Pauline, were Washington
matchmakers in bringing her parents, Jack Kennedy and Jacqueline
Bouvier, together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, in more ways than one, I wouldn't be here if it
weren't for the Gore family,'' the 42-year-old Kennedy Schlossberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone in the big Staples Center knew, too, that she
probably would not have been on the podium if her brother had not
been killed a year ago July in a plane crash off Martha's Vineyard.
John Kennedy Jr. spoke at the 1988 convention and was on the scene
in Chicago in 1996 as editor of George magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank all Americans for making me and John and all our
family a part of your families, for reaching out and sustaining us
through the good times and the difficult ones and for helping us
dream my father's dream,'' Kennedy Schlossberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Schlossberg's appearance moved many delegates in the big
Los Angeles arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe she's old enough to be doing this,'' said Kate
McKenna, 51, of Syracuse, N.Y. ``I saw her and her brother as
little kids. The life she's led. The tragedy she's endured. It must
be very painful and poignant for her to speak, especially so close
on the heels of losing her brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Though delegates could muster scant details about her life, many
felt they knew her, just as they knew all the Kennedys. Their
lives, after all, had been punctuated by so many of the sometimes
cataclysmic events in hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the Kennedys,'' said Bill Bryan, 55, of
Bowdoinham, Maine. ``I remember the election of Jack, and it was
really a wonderful kind of hope. Being Afro-American, I didn't
always feel a part of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pulling for Caroline,'' said Michael Lane, of
Dryden, N.Y. ``She speaks to something inside us. It's nostalgia,
it's sadness, it's happiness, it's hope for a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane remembers the convention of 1960, when her father was
nominated, and his assassination and funeral. He remembers hearing
when her uncle Robert Kennedy was killed. And when her brother's
plane went missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the nation held its breath for the family
again,'' he said. ``I can't think of another family that has that
effect on the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there another family that has the magnetism to attract a
crowd or the mystique to lure paparazzi. At an event Monday in Los
Angeles honoring a Profile in Courage winner, Kennedy Schlossberg
was swamped by dozens of elbowing cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget that this family has been the bread and
butter of the newspapers, magazines, and television for almost 40
years,'' said Carl Sferrazzi Anthony, a biographer of first
families. ``After her mother died, and now that her brother is
gone, the obsession settles on her.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government data released Tuesday evening showed
that virtually all the recent deaths linked to Firestone tires now
being recalled occurred when sport utility vehicles, most of them
Ford Explorers, rolled over after the tires failed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators said that they had received more than 750
complaints about the failure of Firestone tires, involving 62
deaths. That is significantly more complaints and more deaths than
previously announced, and more deaths than for any other safety
recall involving autos or any kind of auto parts. The only recall
of a comparable number of tires, another Firestone recall in 1978,
followed far more complaints to regulators _ 14,000 _ but fewer
deaths _ 41.
</P>
<P>
   Why have the recent tire failures been unusually deadly? The
tires recalled in 1978 were on cars; the tires at issue now are on
sport utility vehicles and a few pickup trucks, which are harder to
control when a tire fails.
</P>
<P>
   Safety groups and lawyers representing crash victims are urging
automakers to make changes, like redesigning the tires and the
suspensions, so that their sport utilities will be less likely to
go out of control and roll over when a tire fails. But automakers
have mostly rejected these ideas as they try to satisfy customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, putting nylon coatings inside would help hold the
tires together when the tread peels off, as has happened with the
Firestone tires. But that produces a bouncier ride, which few
drivers choose at showrooms, so automakers seldom request the nylon
from tire makers, said Brook Lindbert, the engineering director for
tire and wheel systems at General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Recommending a high inflation pressure for tires, which the Ford
Motor Co. did not do for the Explorer, reduces the likelihood of a
tire failure. But more fully inflated tires produce a bumpier ride,
said Tom Baughman, Ford's engineering director for North American
trucks. If the recommended pressure is fairly low to begin with,
there is less of a safety margin to protect against leaks that may
cause tire pressure to fall to dangerously low levels, he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Most sport utility vehicles still use the stiff suspensions of
the pickup trucks on which they were based. These shared
suspensions hold down the cost and improve performance on rough
terrain, which many drivers cherish even if they never leave the
asphalt. But stiff suspensions also produce a bouncy ride that is
hard to offset without soft tires.
</P>
<P>
   Balancing these often conflicting demands is difficult. The
question now in court cases and for regulators is whether too much
safety has been compromised, and whether automakers have set a
balance too far in the direction of customer desires and too little
in the interest of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ford, which installed most of the recalled Firestone
tires on its Ford Explorer sport utilities, automakers say that
they have set an appropriate balance between customer satisfaction
and safety. Even with the deaths blamed on Firestone tires,
Explorers have a 22 percent lower death rate in rollovers than
other midsized sport utilities and a 24 percent lower death rate in
crashes over all, said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   While sport utility occupants have high death rates in
rollovers, their overall death rates are no higher than for car
occupants. This is because sport utilities fare well in collisions
with lower-riding cars, he said, adding that, ``Customers should
look at and consider the overall accident rate in all types of
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deaths now being attributed to tires might seem
numerous to Explorer owners and are large for a recall of tires or
auto parts, they represent a smaller problem by traffic safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The tire-related deaths spread over the last several years are
just a tiny part of the much bigger problem of rollovers, which
kill 9,500 Americans a year. Rollovers, in turn, are just part of
the overall problem of automobile crashes, which claim 41,000 lives
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The high incidence of rollovers in the tire incidents could,
however, focus attention on a move by Senate Republicans and the
auto industry to block publication by the government of rollover
ratings for cars and for light trucks, a category that includes
minivans and pickup trucks as well as sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   After 27 years of study and numerous objections by the auto
industry, federal regulators announced plans on May 25 to begin the
ratings this autumn. But after strenuous auto industry lobbying,
the Senate inserted a little-noticed provision in the
transportation budget this summer barring regulators from issuing
the rules and ordering the National Academy of Sciences to conduct
a one-year study of the regulators' technique for the ratings. The
House version of the transportation budget does not contain this
provision, and House and Senate conferees are scheduled to work out
the differences in the budgets early next month.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stanton, the senior lobbyist for the Washington-based
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the regulators' proposed
rating system was too imprecise. The system compares a vehicle's
width to the height of its center of gravity. The system does not
take into account high-tech features like roof-mounted air bags, or
the computerized vehicle stability systems that Ford said last week
that it would start offering on all sport utility and pickup truck
models.
</P>
<P>
   But Ricardo Martinez, the administrator until last autumn of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates
vehicle safety, said that the rating system was reliable and should
be adopted quickly. The system assigns vehicles one to five stars,
like government crash test ratings. &UR;  &LR;

</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities are more prone than cars to roll over if they
lose a tire, although rollovers also depend on variables like
driver skill, Lindbert of GM said. The higher a vehicle's center of
gravity, the more the vehicle and its occupants tend to lean
forward during braking, and this makes it important to retain as
much traction as possible on the rear tires to keep the back end of
the vehicle under control, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a rear tire develops problems, Lindbert said, ``in many
regards you have the potential to get sideways on the road,'' which
tends to produce rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's government data showed that while front and rear
tires are subject to failure, rear tire failures caused all but two
of the 131 rollovers reported to regulators. Not all rollovers
resulted in death. Calculating the frequency of rollovers when
tires fail is almost impossible because no one knows for sure how
many tire failures there are. The government does not collect the
data and tire makers do not share their data on their own brands.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of federal data on deaths in tire-related accidents
from 1990 to 1997, the most recent year available, shows that 91
percent of the deaths of occupants in Ford Explorers involved
rollovers. Only 28 percent of the tire-related deaths in cars
involved rollovers, said Leon Robertson, a retired Yale University
epidemiologist who analyzed the data and who has also worked for
plaintiff lawyers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The government data included public complaints of 52 deaths in
Explorers that rolled over after Firestone tires failed, and five
more deaths in Explorers for which the complaints did not mention
whether rollovers occurred. Only two Explorers did not roll over.
All of the remaining deaths also involved rollovers, mostly in
sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Firestone tire problems, automakers had begun to
make changes to their sport utilities. The next generation of Ford
Explorers, which will go on sale in January, has a softer, car-like
suspension of coiled springs instead of a truck suspension of steel
bars that flex when the vehicle goes over bumps.
</P>
<P>
   With the new suspension will go new tires. Ford decided several
years ago that the new Explorers will no longer use 15-inch tires
but will have 16-inch tires instead. The 16-inch size has not been
recalled, although some plaintiff lawyers have called for this, and
is already used on the more expensive Explorers now. The tire has a
recommended inflation pressure of 30 pounds per square inch, four
pounds more than the 15-inch tires being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said Tuesday night that even
before the current problems, Ford was considering a pressure of
more than 30 pounds for the next generation of Explorers,
particularly for the rear tires.
</P>
<P>
   But safety experts caution that the biggest safety gains will
come not from tire changes but from motorists' buckling their seat
belts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Government statisticians say that halving the frequency of
unbuckled motorists, to one-sixth of front-seat occupants from
one-third, would save several thousand lives each year and would
provide the greatest benefits for people in vehicles that roll
over.

THE LAST KENNEDY TO OCCUPY THE WHITE HOUSE RECALLS CONVENTIONS
PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Invoking the themes her father delivered here 40
years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out of
her guarded private life Tuesday night to lend the family name to
Al Gore's presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its
support in yet another difficult year for the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our
family, a part of your families _ for reaching out and sustaining
us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping
us dream my father's dream,'' Schlossberg said, according to
prepared remarks released Tuesday evening. ``As I look across this
hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit lives
on _ and I thank all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time but a timeless call.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a poignant moment for Schlossberg. Her simple agreement
to appear before the convention _ she disappeared from public view
almost from the moment of her father's assassination _ was a
reminder that she is now the only surviving member of the Kennedy
family that occupied the White House from 1961 through 1963.
Schlossberg's brother, John Jr., who welcomed a starring role at
the 1996 Democratic convention, died in an airplane accident last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg was one of four members of the Kennedy family who
spoke here Tuesday night, and her official task was to introduce
``Uncle Teddy.'' But her prepared remarks were filled with
allusions to her father, who died when she was three years old, a
reminder of the continuing power the Kennedy family in general, and
John F. Kennedy in particular, wields at a convention where many of
the delegates were not even born when Kennedy served as president.
</P>
<P>
   The setting itself was striking; Los Angeles was the city where
Kennedy was nominated to run for president, with Lyndon Baines
Johnson as vice president, in 1960. But it was also the place where
Schlossberg's uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, a senator from New York,
was shot, just a flew blocks from where the convention is taking
place, on the night of the California primary in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   She alluded to the losses that her family has suffered through
violence, saying: ``If we believe that we have seen enough gun
violence in our land and in our lifetimes _ that guns should no
longer takes the lives of those we love _then it is up to us'' to
elect Gore, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg said that she and Gore had both been raised ``to
believe that we can make the world new again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why my father sought to do 40 years ago, in this city,
when he stood before you and declared the opening of the New
Frontier,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg directly used her father's words as she suggested
that his call today was as fresh as it was 40 years ago. ``Our call
is to the young at heart, regardless of age,'' he said. ``A whole
world looks to see what we will do. We cannot fail their trust; we
cannot fail to try.''

SENATOR, ACTIVISTS SEEK PROBE OF VIOLENT CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN
PROTESTERS, L.A. POLICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Activists, lawyers and a California state senator
Tuesday called for an independent investigation into violent
confrontations between protesters and the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the melee, only a few hundred peaceful demonstrators
marched through downtown Los Angeles on the second day of the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Their numbers were far less than the estimated 8,000 Monday
night who were herded away from a fenced protest area by mounted
police and officers on-foot firing firing rubber bullets and
canisters of pepper spray into the fleeing crowd. Ten people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters and their lawyers Tuesday said the show of force was
not necessary and abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened last night, make no mistake about it, was
nothing less than an orchestrated police riot,'' said Dan Tokaji a
lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Tokaji and California state Sen. Tom Hayden, a member of the
``Chicago 8'' protesters during the 1968 Democratic convention,
called for an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said his son was hit by rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that I saw on television were literally being hosed
with pepper spray in violation of any sensible guidelines,'' Hayden
said. ``This is part of a pattern and practice of overkill
accompanied by false public relations from the police department.''
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD has come under fire for corruption and mishandling of
rioters, most recently after the Lakers won the NBA championship
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials are weighing whether to fight the Justice
Department in court over the management of the LAPD or to cut a
deal that would require a series of changes demanded by federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the police in Los Angeles this week has been to
try to convince the citizenry that their excessive force is
necessary in order to build public support to get out from under
the reforms,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU already has won twice in court against the LAPD. One
court decision allows protesters to gather near the Staples Center.
The other prohibits police confiscating the activists' banner and
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the LAPD's third strike and it's time for them to be
out,'' Tokaji said. ``The LAPD cannot control itself and it's time
for the United States of America to come in and take control of a
department that no one else can control.''
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman said Tuesday the officers were justified when
they began herding the crowd away from the designated protest area
because several people had begun throwing objects at police and
were setting fires to piles of trash and hand-made signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our strategy was to use a lot of resources,''
Commander David Kalish said. ``You saw a lot of police officers
saturate the downtown area. The reason for that is to ensure public
safety. And it worked ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If people got pushed out of the way, sorry about that. That
was not the intent. The intent was to maintain public safety and
clear the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of delegates and reporters were knocked down and trampled
in the crowd as police moved in on horseback. Several were injured.
</P>
<P>
   After the area was cleared the Rev. Jesse Jackson walked amid
the debris, criticizing the ``excessive show of force'' employed by
police. He called it ``provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson argued that under such circumstances the police should
have concentrated on crowd control instead of creating ``a climate
for a showdown.''

ALMIGHTY DOLLAR MAKES VACATIONING A BARGAIN IN LAND OF THE EURO  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I just returned from a couple of weeks in
France, where almost every shop had big, bright signs in the window
screaming  &LR; Soldes &LR; , French for ``Sales.''
</P>
<P>
   What was really on sale, though, was France itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deteriorating euro _ which has fallen 22 percent
against the dollar since its introduction _ vacationing in France
and most European countries has been downright affordable this
summer. And things will get even cheaper in the fall, when hotel
rates and airfares go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Europe in fall and winter is going to be
sensational,'' says Carol Kaminsky, editor of Bestfares.com.
``Airfares (to Europe) have been ridiculously high this summer.
They should start settling down in September and really get
attractive in October and November.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``You can travel in Europe for much less than you'd
ever dream of paying in Chicago, New York or San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, my husband and I stayed mostly in three-star hotels
and never paid more than $100 per night, even on the Cote D' Azur
during the  &LR; haut &LR;  (high) season.
</P>
<P>
   Our hotel room in Paris' popular Latin Quarter _ small but cute,
clean and cabled for CNN _ totaled $200 for three nights, including
taxes and the 3 percent fee tacked on by our credit card company.
(Some card issuers charge less; check before you leave.)
</P>
<P>
   Three-course dinners for two with a bottle of wine that might
cost $100 (conservatively) in the Bay Area cost half that in
Provence.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar buys more than 7 French francs, the strongest it has
been since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The greenback is at or close to 10-year highs against most other
European currencies, especially those tied to the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven countries _ Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain _
are converting to euros.
</P>
<P>
   The big holdout is Britain, and the pound has held up better
against the dollar than the euro, making England less of a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Since it premiered in January 1999 at $1.17 per euro, the euro
has slumped to 91 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies in the euro countries have been trading in lockstep
with each other against the dollar for 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   So prices in dollars are rising and falling by essentially the
same amount in all the euro countries. There are still some price
differences between countries, but they should start to disappear
as most of Europe becomes one big market.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-border banking, government and most business transactions
are already taking place in euros, but you can't tuck a euro in
your money belt just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The currency won't premiere until January 2002, although most
merchants are pricing their items in euros as well as their home
currencies, which will be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   The indefatigable dollar has surprised just about everyone, and
it's all a result of ``the unexpected, continued strength of the
U.S. economy,'' says Robert Friedman, manager of the Mutual
European mutual fund. ``Generally, currency strength follows
productivity. The U.S. economy continues to be strikingly
productive. Meanwhile, France and Germany have been somewhat weaker
than anticipated,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign investors pour money into the booming U.S. financial
markets, they must buy dollars, and that makes the buck even
brawnier against scrawnier currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was dealt another blow when hedge-fund giant George
Soros said he was unwinding his euro position. That knocked the
euro from 95 cents to 90 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's not clear how European authorities will manage
their joint economy. ``Inflation is less than 2 percent in France
and Germany, but 6 percent in Ireland. If you raise rates to dampen
inflation in Ireland, you hurt growth in France and Germany,''
Friedman says. ``It's an unprecedented situation, and as a result,
people see the euro as a riskier venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the euro belong? The Economist magazine says the euro
should be worth $1, based on purchasing-power parity. But nobody
sees it getting there overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the U.S. convincing the world it can come into a soft
landing, and continue to grow without inflation, it probably
prolongs the period of relative U.S. dollar strength,'' says
Michael Levy, manager of the Deutsche European Equity fund.
</P>
<P>
   Before, he says, people were thinking the euro might reach $1
within three to six months. Now, he says, it's more like six to 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Ho, co-manager of the Wells Fargo International Equity
fund, says that the euro eventually will stage a convincing
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think the weak euro is bad. But it's not. It helps
the export structure,'' because European goods get cheaper on the
world market. ``If you have a weak euro and restructure (the
economy) at the same time, you can have economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1999, Ho explains, the dollar fell by half against
major currencies. ``This helped the U.S. to export. We also
restructured.'' Companies reduced junk debt, pared their workforces
and eliminated non-core businesses. ``That's why our economy is so
strong now,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ho predicts that ``this could be the European decade.'' But ``as
a traveler, you have at least a 12-month horizon'' before Europe
starts looking expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some people aren't taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very smart young man in my office is getting married in the
spring and honeymooning in Italy,'' says Friedman. ``He's buying
lira now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE ON FULL DISCLSOURE: In response to Friday's column on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's new full-disclosure
regulation, dubbed Reg FD, I got this e-mail from Charles Boucher,
managing director of equity research at Bear Stearns in San
Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``Interesting article, but I think it exaggerates the impact of
Regulation FD on leveling the playing field for small investors.
While companies may be less likely to call an analyst or (portfolio
manager) at a large fund like Fidelity or Putnam, it's not the
management guidance that moves stocks anymore, at least technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large investment funds, hedge funds and sell-side analysts
that do their homework discover material information well in
advance of management disclosure. That's why so many stocks move in
front of earnings conference calls or other significant events. In
fact, most analysts (good ones, anyway), use management as the
information source of last resort, and the conference call is
usually only an affirmation of whether the analyst has done their
job right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual investors that think that Regulation FD will give
them the same edge as large investment firms are deluding
themselves. The only way an individual investor can compete on a
level playing field is if they sweat the details the way that good
analysts and investors do, which is by calling plant managers,
customers, competitors, salespeople and other sources of primary
research.''

 LINUXWORLD GOES MAINSTREAM  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Backed by a growing parade of
computer-industry heavyweights, the Linux movement rallied
yesterday in San Jose, Calif., for its biggest-ever trade show.
</P>
<P>
   LinuxWorld Conference and Expo was in past years the province
mainly of little-known distributors and developers of the upstart
computer-operating system, but this year the show floor is
dominated by giant booths sponsored by the likes of Compaq, Dell,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and even Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Notably but not surprisingly absent was Microsoft. Linux, which
is developed cooperatively by thousands of developers around the
world and available free to anyone who wants to use it, is posing
an increasingly credible threat, at least in some markets, to
Microsoft's Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of Linux's changing role was a keynote speech by
Michael Dell, chief executive of the Dell Computer, who has long
been considered one of Microsoft's most loyal supporters in the
industry. In past years, most LinuxWorld speakers were gurus in the
open-source movement, the worldwide network of volunteer developers
who cooperatively maintain and enhance Linux and related software.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said his company, now the No. 1 supplier of personal
computers in the U.S. and No. 2 in the server market, is ``very
committed to Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   The open-source development model,'' Dell said, ``is built to
succeed in the Internet age.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing not only the low cost of the system but also its
stability and flexibility and the ease with which customers can
make modifications, he declared that ``the open-source model makes
a lot more economic sense than the proprietary model some other
companies use.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his point, Dell invited Bill Parducci, a
programmer working for Toyota, to explain why the auto company had
decided to use Linux rather than Windows on multimedia presentation
systems it is installing at dealers nationwide. Parducci explained
that Toyota had asked its previous operating-system supplier, which
he did not name, but said was ``out of Redmond,'' to make some
changes to its product to make it easier to keep large amounts of
multimedia data in readily accessible ``cache'' memory so dealers
wouldn't need to download it over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent 18 months on it and still couldn't get it into
their product,'' Parducci said. He and one other engineer, using an
old PC, finally went to work trying to add the capabilities they
wanted to Linux, and two weeks later, they had a working prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Some keynote attendees, however, greeted Dell's conversion to
their cause with some skepticism. During a question-and-answer
period after his speech, several demanded to know why Dell often
charges more for Linux systems than for comparable hardware running
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Dell gave no clear response but insisted his company had
``absolutely no secret obligations to Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from technical users and some college students, Linux has
made only limited inroads into Windows' domination of the desktop
on home and business PCs _ in part because it hasn't been as easy
to use and far fewer Linux applications for mainstream users have
been available.
</P>
<P>
   Linux supporters announced several initiatives intended to make
the OS more appealing to nontechnical users. Eazel, for example, a
Palo Alto, Calif., startup staffed largely by Apple alumni, showed
off new tools that make it easier to manage files on Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Gnumatic of Austin, Texas, previewed GnuCash, a personal-finance
program it called a ``quick and intuitive'' alternative to Intuit's
Quicken. And Helix Code of Cambridge, Mass., showed Evolution, a
new e-mail and personal-information management program designed as
an alternative to Microsoft's Outlook on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen companies, including Compaq, HP, IBM, Sun
Microsystems and several Linux leaders, also joined forces to form
the Gnome Foundation, a group that will steer and promote the
development of Gnome, one of several graphical user interfaces and
application frameworks for Linux. Despite the corporate support,
the new group's board will be elected by the hundreds of volunteer
developers who've contributed to the project.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 200 companies are strutting their stuff at the
show, and show organizers said they had to turn away 50 others for
want of space at the McEnery Convention Center. Next year, the show
will move to San Francisco to take advantage of the roomier Moscone
Center.

LIEBERMAN TELLS BLACK CAUCUS HE SUPPORTS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
<TEXT>
<P>
   (EDS: 2nd graf updates with Liberman's appearance on convention
floor)
</P>
<P>
   By DAN FREEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ As he prepared his acceptance speech before the
Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., was busy putting out a brush fire over his
civil rights record, telling African-American delegates: ``I have
supported affirmative action, I do support affirmative action and I
will support affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   He later visited the convention floor, triggering a tumultuous
five-minute demonstration by exuberant delegates that enlivened a
slow-paced program.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lieberman found himself placating Rep. Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., a prominent black lawmaker, who said she could not
support Vice President Al Gore and Lieberman until they had
clarified their positions on affirmative action, education and
criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   She singled out Lieberman, who in the past has questioned
affirmative action and supported school vouchers for children in
failing inner-city schools. Because other black leaders including
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, and Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., had praised Gore's selection of Lieberman,
Waters appeared isolated in her skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerned about party unity during the convention,
Lieberman went right to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions have been raised about my record ... and I want to
deal with it right directly,'' Lieberman told a meeting of the
Democratic National Committee Black Caucus. He compared the process
of scrutinizing his record to ``getting a medical procedure without
an anesthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman launched into a lengthy explanation of his civil
rights record, starting with his attendance at the historic 1963
march on Washington, D.C., where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave
his ``I have a dream'' speech. The Connecticut senator said his
commitment to racial equality ``begins with my religion, because I
believe as a matter of faith, not just that God created all of us,
(but) I believe that every human being is created in God's image,''
he said. Lieberman is an orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also told the audience:
</P>
<P>
   __ As a student in 1963, he traveled to Mississippi to register
black voters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Since winning election to the Senate in 1988, he has been a
consistent supporter of civil rights legislation as well as an
opponent of Republican attempts to dismantle U.S. government
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   __ He had questioned whether some federal affirmative action
had, in effect, sanctioned quotas in the mid-1990s. But he
concurred with President Clinton's ``mend it, don't end it''
approach to affirmative action in 1995 that essentially left the
program intact.
</P>
<P>
   __ He didn't actively support California's Proposition 209, a
1996 ballot initiative that effectively ended affirmative action in
all state and local hiring, college admissions and awarding of
contracts. He attributed confusion over his stance on Proposition
209 to a one-time positive response to a reporter's question on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   __ He agreed with Clinton that ``affirmative action was never
about having unqualified people take jobs from qualified people. It
was about qualified people (getting opportunities).''
</P>
<P>
   On his support for vouchers that would enable parents to
transfer their children to private schools, Lieberman said he
thought a pilot program would be worth trying until public
education could be fixed. But he added he had never retreated from
basic support of public education, and that public schools had
helped him rise out of limited circumstances in Stamford, Conn., to
attend Yale University and Yale law school. Lieberman did not talk
about criminal justice and the concern of many blacks that
African-Americans receive unequal justice when it comes to
prosecution and sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent black political leaders D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes
Norton and Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater hailed Lieberman
as a champion of minority rights.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Waters told reporters she would work for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman ``seemed consistent with what I think the Democratic
Party ideals are all about,'' she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman spent a large portion of the day preparing his
Wednesday night prime-time speech.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki McLean, a campaign spokeswoman, said Lieberman would talk
about himself, ``the Al Gore he knows,'' and voters' ``choices for
the future ... It's not an attack speech, but he will draw sharp
contrasts'' between the Democratic ticket and Republican
challenger, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's speech would be a particular source of pride to
Jewish-Americans, said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and director of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which operates the
city's Museum of Tolerance featuring displays that teach about
hatred and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment of historic importance,'' said Hier, who is
non-partisan and spoke briefly at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia earlier this month. ``Whatever the
demographics (of Americans watching or not watching Lieberman's
speech), Jewish Americans will tune in in record proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added, ``it's important to recognize that Gore
didn't go out looking for some Jew. He selected Joe Lieberman
because in addition to going to a synagogue, he is a man of great
integrity. That's why it's really a moment of pride.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Long before the Democratic National Convention
opened, the Los Angeles Police Department was haunted by unhappy
images from the past, from the 1992 riots here to the violent
protests at last year's World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle. This week, it has greeted the world with a massive,
intimidating picture: dark blue uniforms throughout on city
streets, under freeway overpasses, in convention hotels, on
scooters and bicycles, in helicopters and patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   The collective presence of law enforcement officers on display
seems to clearly outweigh the disparate group of several thousand
demonstrators supporting a dizzying array of causes. And the stakes
in this situation are high: Both Democrats and city officials know
that the whole world is watching the long-troubled LAPD this week,
and the early reviews are mixed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, as a hot day of peaceful protests turned
suddenly violent when a few dozen demonstrators flung chunks of
concrete, bottles and ball-bearings across a high security fence
ringing the Staples Center arena, the police wasted no time firing
back with rubber bullets and beanbags to disperse the unruly
remnants of a crowd of several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting television footage did not quite dispel the
lingering image of Los Angeles as the city where the videotaped
police beating of Rodney King ignited long-simmering tensions and
ultimately led to the 1992 riots, and where the Lakers'
championship victory just six weeks ago set off bonfires and
vandalism that the police did relatively little to stop.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, as demonstrations celebrating slogans like
``Value Women's Work'' and ``Justice for Youth'' proceeded calmly,
police officials strongly defended their tactics _ and Democratic
officials who were on the roof watching and approving their
tactical decisions backed them up.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, at least 25 animal rights activists opposed to
the fur trade were arrested near Pershing Square after banging on a
fur shop window, and the police shut down a two-block area while
they made the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's an armchair critic,'' said Commander David Kalish,
the senior police spokesman. ``I think people feel safer when they
see a lot of police on the street.'' He said that during a rock
concert on Monday by the band Rage Against the Machine, officers
had endured tossed rocks and bottles, but when some demonstrators
began tossing metal bars and scaling a 14-foot chain link fence
that officials feared might give way, the commanders on the scene
moved to disperse the crowd, and arrested about a half dozen
people.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Hale, a top aide to the Gore campaign overseeing
convention planning who watched the clash from the roof of the
convention complex, said Tuesday morning: ``We knew what they were
doing, and we supported them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the police had to contend with second-guessing on the
streets, a team of city lawyers was briefing the City Council in
private session on recommendations for how to avert a threatened
federal civil rights lawsuit by the Justice Department, which has
accused the Los Angeles department of systemic police misconduct.
And on Wednesday, officials are bracing for yet another
demonstration, this one protesting the city's worst police
corruption scandal in decades, in which officers have been accused
of fabricating evidence and framing innocent suspects in a gritty
precinct just west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, some demonstrators, delegates and other convention
participants expressed frustration at what they said seemed like
overkill tactics in marches and demonstrations that were peaceful
on the whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been chased out of our public streets and treated as if
our First Amendment rights don't mean anything,'' said Han Shan,
27, program director of the Ruckus Society of Berkeley, Calif.,
which trains protesters in civil disobedience. ``This was a youth
march devoted to equal access to decent education and the
priorities of funding schools and teachers. We had such radicals
marching with us as parents, teachers and high school students. I
can't believe the response.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Johnson, 56, a delegate from Columbus, Ohio, and his
friend Steven Lieber, 50, an alternate, both veterans of the 1970
anti-Vietnam protests at Kent State, said this generation of
protesters left them puzzled and a bit disappointed and that the
police presence did not seem unduly provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``These protesters are not impressing me when they become
violent,'' Lieber said outside the hall on Tuesday. ``But they can
only learn that through experience and through growing. If they
were to use non-violent civil disobedience, I would look at what
their causes were, and they would get some world-wide
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did take note of the sprawling security zone outside the
convention and said, ``The only time I see the protesters is on TV.
I've called home and my family thinks we're in a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, an event at the so-called Shadow Convention was
rousted from its meeting site when police arrived to investigate
what they said was a bomb threat and evacuated the building.
Arianna Huffington, one of the conventions organizers, said on
Tuesday that no bomb was ever found, and that she had simply led
her scheduled panel discussion featuring Gore Vidal out into the
street and made do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their whole response has been exaggerated and
overkill,'' she said. ``I think they were basically bringing the
same mindset to us that they were employing on the protesters. They
were making a distinction between the people inside the Staples
Center, who had to be protected at all costs, and the people
outside whom they regard as a threat. Instead of making a
distinction between the truly dangerous people _ and there were
some _ they just treated everybody the same.''

 MOTHER-AND-SON TEAM RELY ON EACH OTHER IN BUILDING EBENEFITS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; When Andy Kurtzig read ``Profiles of Genius''
as a college sophomore and discovered that most of the 13 featured
``change masters'' _ including Apple's Steve Jobs, Microsoft's Bill
Gates, FedEx's Fred Smith and CNN's Ted Turner _ never graduated
from college, he decided to drop out of the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to start a business and thought if I finish college,
it would be suicide,'' Kurtzig recalled. Then he talked to his
mother, Sandra Kurtzig, who founded Ask Group, one of Silicon
Valley's early software success stories. She persuaded him to
switch majors to business from engineering and start a venture on
the side if he desired.
</P>
<P>
   Family businesses in the United States are the rule, not the
exception. Ninety-five percent of all businesses are family owned
or controlled, and they produce close to 60 percent of the gross
domestic product. Many, though, don't have such well-known or
successful mothers as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurtzigs have enjoyed a good personal and professional
relationship. Four years ago, the two co-founded eBenefits in San
Francisco. Andy Kurtzig, 27, is chief executive officer of the
company, which links small businesses to human resources, payroll
and benefits management services via the Internet. Sandra Kurtzig,
53, is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kurtzig caught the entrepreneurial bug early. His mother
started Ask in 1974 when she was 27. It began in a spare bedroom
and grew as Sandra Kurtzig persuaded Hewlett-Packard to let her and
her programmers use one of the company's minicomputers after hours
from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. to create their manufacturing management
software.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kurtzig's father studied engineering under transistor
pioneer William Shockley at Stanford and started and sold a
touch-screen company called Personal Touch.
</P>
<P>
   Though born to two entrepreneurs, Andy Kurtzig's early ideas did
not fly.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a teenager, his father nixed his plan to produce
molded jumps for bicycle motocrosses because of potential liability
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Andy's notion of putting little flaps on the sides of airplane
tires so they would spin when hit by wind and thus reduce rubber
lost to skids when wheels touched the tarmac didn't take off,
either. Then someone beat him to a patent on an accordionlike
expandable PC keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of Kurtzig's notions as a senior at UC Berkeley was
moderately successful. Anser Corp., a play on the name his mother
chose for her company, developed software to automate calendar
listings for newspapers. In 1995, a year after he started the
venture, Kurtzig sold the software to one of his customers, the San
Francisco Bay Guardian, for nearly $500,000 and took a long
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, he kept thinking about human resources, the
part of the business he liked least. It was ``the biggest pain in
the neck'' for him at Anser and, Kurtzig reasoned, many of the
country's other 8 million small businesses with two to 100
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sandra Kurtzig was looking for investment
opportunities. She had left Ask Group in 1992 after leading it to
$500 million in annual sales in her second stint as CEO. Two years
later, the company was acquired by Computer Associates
International.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Family Business
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1996, Sandra Kurtzig recalls her son asked if she
wanted to set up a company together. ``It was every mother's
dream,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past four years, she said they have had only one
fight. It was about whether to provide free human resources
services. ``I never understood the concept,'' said Sandra Kurtzig.
``I thought companies that gave away everything for free were
nonprofits.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kurtzig argued that providing a free version of eBenefits'
service was necessary to win attention and market share. His mother
relented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good working agreement,'' Andy Kurtzig recalls. ``I
did all the work; she did all the agreeing.'' That included Sandra
Kurtzig agreeing to invest $500,000 to get the company up and
running in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The initial plan was to provide health-insurance quotes online
to small businesses. But the cost of acquiring customers was high,
and the market was developing slowly. By the end of 1997, eBenefits
was low on cash, and Andy Kurtzig recalled his mother telling him,
``You're on your own. Either close up shop and find a real job or
make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Andy Kurtzig broadened the scope of eBenefits to let
small businesses outsource not just health insurance, but payroll
and other HR services.
</P>
<P>
   Through eBenefits, employees can turn to the Web instead of the
business owner to compare and select health benefits, insurance
plans, payroll deductions and mutual funds for their 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Andy Kurtzig went out to raise venture capital. His
mother did not go with him, although she helped him practice his
pitch and peppered him with questions that VCs were likely to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Only after her son won commitments from venture-capital firms
Draper Fisher Jurvetson and W.R. Hambrecht did Sandra Kurtzig
advise him to also talk the New Enterprise Associates. Within 24
hours, eBenefits had taken in $8 million from three VC firms
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   EBenefits also has developed important strategic partnerships
with Automatic Data Processing Inc., the largest automated payroll
services company, as well as with the U.S. Small Business
Administration, AT&AMP;T and others.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing human resource services has become a huge business.
Dataquest estimates the market will grow from $900 million in 1999
to more than $12 billion by 2003 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The largest HR outsourcing companies, such as software vendors
SAP, Oracle and PeopleSoft and consultants Mercer and Hewitt, focus
on larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Banc of America Securities analyst David Scharf notes that
several Web-based companies such as Employease, EmployeeLife.Com,
iBenefits and eBenefits are providing online solutions to small and
midsize businesses that have been plagued by time-consuming and
cumbersome HR chores.
</P>
<P>
   For example, iBenefits in El Segundo, Calif., is developing
Web-based employee-benefits enrollment and administration tools for
companies with more than 200 employees. The company has raised more
than $53 million in venture capital since last year, including $41
million last month.
</P>
<P>
   BenefitPoint, a San Francisco company that started in 1998,
raised $52 million in venture capital in May and recruited former
McKesson Corp. CEO Mark Pulido in June to lead the company. The
company focuses on benefits procurement and administration for
companies with 100 to 5,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Although eBenefits hardly has the field to itself, Andy Kurtzig
sees his company as the ``leader in the small-business segment of
two to 100 employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, eBenefits expects to get a boost when about
2,000 ADP payroll services employees begin selling eBenefits' HR
services to their clients. That should expand eBenefits' customer
base of close to 14,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   One satisfied eBenefits customer is Netiverse. The San Jose,
Calif., company that was just acquired by Cisco Systems used the
free version of eBenefits' product to track personal information
such as vacation days and health benefits for its 34 employees.
``We were able to create a virtual HR department and create links
to other sites,'' said Netiverse office administrator Bridget
Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sandra Kurtzig went along with the idea of offering a
free version of eBenefits' service to some small businesses, that
is coming to a stop. By the end of the year, all small-business
clients will be charged $30 to $200 a month. In addition, eBenefits
receives a small commission from health-insurance and other
companies that sell services to its clients.

 FREE-LANCERS SUE FOR WEB ROYALTIES  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lawsuit filed in San Francisco on Monday is
continuing the debate sparked by San Mateo, Calif.'s Napster Inc.
over who should profit from intellectual property distributed on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the works in question are not songs, but articles
written by free-lance authors and resold on the Internet by three
database companies, including the search engine Northern Light.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the Napster case, the plaintiff's supporters cast the
suit as a battle to save copyright's function as a stimulus for
creative work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're fighting so hard for these issues is that we
believe that (copyright protection) is vital for culture to
survive,'' said Jonathan Tasini, president of the National Writer's
Union, which has long been active on the issue of royalties for
free-lancers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the databases being sued buy the rights to the material
they distribute from the magazines or newspapers that first
published them, the suit claims that the databases should also get
permission from the original authors and pay the authors a portion
of revenues from the resale of their work.
</P>
<P>
   A group of four free-lance writers, including the estate of
Oakland, Calif., writer Jessica Mitford, author of ``The American
Way of Death,'' is applying for class-action status, which would
give them the right to represent as many as 10,000 free-lancers
whose articles are included in the databases. Among the suit's
charges is that excerpts from Mitford's book, ``The American Way of
Birth'' were distributed by one of the database companies without
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Tasini likened the databases' business to fencing jewelry that
is known to be stolen. ``They are profiting off of stolen goods,''
said Tasini, who as a free-lance writer won a similar case against
the New York Times by appeal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the defendants say they respect copyright laws and pay
royalties to their suppliers _ the original publishers. Besides
Northern Light, the lawsuit names Thompson Corp. and its Foster
City, Calif., subsidiary Gale Group, as well as Bell &AMP; Howell,
which produces ProQuest, an article archive popular with schools
and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lawsuit was filed yesterday by the Authors Guild in
New York City against the same companies, in addition to Reed
Elsevier PLC, owner of the Lexis-Nexis database, and Dow Jones
Reuters Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   David Seuss, chief executive of Northern Light, dismissed
comparisons to the case involving Napster, the company that the
music industry has sued to stop free distribution of copyright
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster wasn't paying Sony every time someone downloaded one
of their songs,'' Seuss said. ``We pay those people. There's no
piracy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Fergus, attorney for the free-lance writers, said that in a
way the databases' business is an even worse copyright violation
than Napster's, because their databases charge money for the
material they distribute _ anywhere from a few dollars for one
downloaded article to thousands of dollars in corporate
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides an injunction to stop the resale of their work under the
current system, the writers seek an unspecified amount of money for
damages and lost royalties. Recent cases between writers and
Internet database firms settled both in court and less formally
have resulted in back payments to free-lancers and changes in the
way the companies do business.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver database company called UnCover settled a similar
lawsuit by agreeing to pay free-lancers royalties, and paid $7.25
million in back royalties. Earlier this month, Contentville.com and
the National Writer's Union agreed that free-lancers will receive
30 percent of the download fee (usually several dollars) each time
Contentville.com resells their articles. The Contentville.com
agreement stipulates that the writers receive a bigger cut than the
original publishers get, according to the union.
</P>
<P>
   Tasini, the union president, acknowledged that royalties on
republished work, whether in print or on the Internet, represent a
relatively small portion of most free-lance writers' income. But as
new technologies present new opportunities to reuse material and
more writers negotiate for reuse royalties, it's becoming a
more-important source of income, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit's defendants were chosen because they are among the
biggest companies that resell previously published content online,
Fergus said. Northern Light has 20 million articles in its
database, ProQuest archives the full contents of 8,000
publications, and Thompson's Gale Group archives 6,000 publications
in a database containing about 15 million articles, according to
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Fergus said the defendants will soon be served with papers
regarding the suit. A court date has not been set.

 HAMBRECHT HELPS DOW CHEMICAL OFFER DEBT ONLINE  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; WR Hambrecht, the San Francisco investment
bank that pioneered public stock offerings over the Internet,
extended its Web auction system yesterday with the completion of a
$300 million sale of five-year debt securities for Dow Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht officials said the sale marked the first time an
investment bank has carried out a debt offering for a client
entirely via an Internet auction. In the only previous online debt
auctions, two investment banks recently sold their own debt.
</P>
<P>
   Dow's notes pay a 7 percent interest rate based on their face
value. They sold in the auction for $995.54 for a $1,000 note,
bringing their actual yield to 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is 1.01 percentage points higher than the yield for U.S.
Treasury notes of comparable maturity and is at the high end of the
range of 0.92 to 1.02 percentage points over the government notes
that Midland, Mich.'s Dow sought.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht has previously held Internet auctions to sell stock in
four initial public offerings. The investment banks Bear Stearns,
HSBC Securities and Williams Capital Group co-managed the Dow debt
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Online debt auctions ``could become as big a deal, if not a
bigger deal, than (Internet) IPOs,'' said Hambrecht Chief Operating
Officer J.D. Delafield.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hambrecht's auction system, investors submit online bids
for stock or debt securities. The offering price is set at the
highest level the issuer can get and still sell all the securities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dow offering, Hambrecht received bids from 62
institutional or individual investors, 57 of which were accepted.
The auction took place over a two-hour period yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, securities prices are set by the issuer and
underwriters rather than by auction. Proponents say the auction
method is fairer because it uses a market-based system to determine
offering prices.

GORE AND THE GHOSTWRITER; CHAOS IN THE LIEBERMAN SUITE; WHAT'D HE
SAY?; JUST TWO PALS; THE FIRST FRIEND'S REPORT; STOPPING TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, the Gore strategist who has written some of the
most eloquent speeches of his generation, said Tuesday that Gore
was ``literally, truly and unquestionably involved'' in writing
acceptance speech to the Democratic convention on Thursday night.
With no help at all from Shrum, who wrote much of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's ``dream shall never die'' speech that ignited the 1980
Democratic convention in New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is writing his own speech,'' Shrum repeated by phone from
Michigan, where he was traveling with Gore. Shrum added that Gore,
a former journalist, was ``an excellent writer. He's got a very
real sense of imaging and the sounds and balance of language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shrum did advise Kennedy on his convention speech Tuesday
night. Shrum also said that when he wrote Kennedy's most famous
oratorical line _ ``the dream shall never die'' _ the idea
``basically just came out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos reigns at Hadassah Lieberman's office at the Biltmore
Hotel. Phones keep ringing. Calls are unanswered. An abrupt
decision by the Gore campaign asking her to nominate her husband,
Joseph, as vice president at the convention has thrown her small
staff into turmoil. Interviews are being canceled or rearranged as
speechwriters toil in the Lieberman suite.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman's role in the upcoming campaign is still under
discussion by the Gore and Lieberman staffs. But, they say, Mrs.
Lieberman, 52, will probably move out alone on the campaign trail,
without her husband, just as Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney,
the Republican vice-presidential nominee, has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hadassah's got a great story to tell, a really compelling
story,'' said Dan Gerstein, her husband's spokesman. ``She's the
daughter of Holocaust survivors. Her mother was liberated by
American GI's at Dachau. The fact that she'll be on the stage at
this convention is a powerful testament to the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as Lieberman was selected, the Gore campaign
asked Sally Aman, who had worked more than four years as Tipper
Gore's communications director, to serve in a similar role with
Mrs. Lieberman. Before this, Mrs. Lieberman had never had a staff
of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Lieberman, who has not spoken much publicly, nervous
about appearing before the convention? ``It's perfectly normal to
be nervous, and she is,'' said Aman. ``But she's talking about a
subject she knows very well. Her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The coda of President Clinton's speech to the convention Monday
night carried an unscripted _ and unexpected _ phrase that not only
seemed enigmatic but also confused some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from his prepared text _ as he often does _ Clinton
added a sentence in the final paragraph of his speech, saying,
``And remember,  &UR; whenever  &LR; you think about me, keep putting people
first.'' The White House quoted Clinton as making the comment. And
people listening to the speech agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But others who heard the speech said that was not correct. They
said they had heard Clinton say: ``And remember,  &UR; whatever  &LR; you
think about me...'' The word itself sounded blurry.
</P>
<P>
   The one-word difference, of course, carries an entirely
different meaning. One White House aide said he was fairly certain
that Clinton said ``whatever.'' If so, that would be the only
reference in the speech to the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, ``It
means `whether you think well of me or not, what's important is the
future of the country.' It means `don't get distracted by what you
think of me personally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The New York Daily News and The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch also used the phrase ``whatever you think of me.''
The New York Times, in its published transcript of the speech, also
had ``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the White House issued its official transcript of
the remarks, and it said ``whenever.'' A team of New York Times
editors also listened to the tape of the speech and agreed that the
president said ``whenever.'' Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Certain East and West Coast eyebrows were raised when Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., was spotted walking across the
convention floor on Monday night with his onetime close friend
Patricia Duff, former wife of the Revlon billionaire Ronald O.
Perelman and the former Tristar Pictures chairman Mike Medavoy.
There had been numerous tabloid reports of a Torricelli-Duff split.
</P>
<P>
   Were they back together? Torricelli would not say. ``There is a
bond between all the Democrats who were on the convention floor,''
Torricelli pleasantly replied, ``but it is something short of
marriage.'' Duff, who has been through an ugly, highly publicized
child custody battle with Perelman, was one of Bill Clinton's first
and biggest fund-raisers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, Clinton fund-raiser extraordinaire and close
presidential pal, got the first hug after Clinton finished his
convention speech. Holding court with reporters Tuesday after
speaking to a breakfast meeting of the New York delegation at the
Century Plaza Hotel, McAuliffe said that after Clinton leaves the
presidency, ``he has no interest in making money.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark may be of some interest to Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who has worried about the couples' extraordinary legal bills.
McAuliffe also said that the retired president would spend a third
of his time at his presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., a
third of his time traveling and a third in New York. As to whether
the Clintons would keep their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. _ the loan
for it was temporarily guaranteed by McAuliffe _ the presidential
fund-raiser replied: ``You'll have to talk to the first lady and
the president about their plans. They've got their own mortgage
now. They don't need me.''
</P>
<P>
   The model Christie Brinkley, a member of the New York
delegation, caused such a traffic jam of television cameras on the
convention floor on Monday night that security guards finally asked
her to move into the hallway so they could clear the aisles. ``I
wonder why,'' New York state Comptroller Carl McCall dryly
observed. Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, was one of
hundreds of New York delegates and elected officials left in the
shadows with the departure of Brinkley and her klieg lights. ``This
shows the proper media understanding of how politics works,''
Spitzer said.

GORE HITS POPULIST NOTE EN ROUTE TO CONVENTION &HT;    (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES Democrat Al Gore, taking party leadership from
President Clinton Tuesday, headed toward the waiting limelight at
the Democratic National Convention here with promises to ``stand
up`` against ``powerful interests'' that he said are aligned with
Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore took the helm of the Democratic party from Clinton at a
boisterous campaign rally in Monroe, Mich., where the vice
president cast his contest with Bush as a struggle between an
experienced, hard-working populist ally of ``working families''
pitted against a Republican beholden to so-called ``special
interests'' and who wants to enrich the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we've got a hard-fought race ahead,`` Gore warned
placard-waving supporters, with his wife Tipper, Clinton and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton standing nearby. ``I know the powerful
interests are going to fight against us with everything they've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore headed toward a Democratic convention that had been fired
up Tuesday night by speeches by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and four
members of the Kennedy clan, led by Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, and Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., who lost brothers John and Robert to assassins'
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the veteran civil rights leader, scoffed at what he
termed the ``inclusion illusion'' staged by Republicans at their
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago. He urged Americans to
``stay out of the Bushes'' when it comes to choosing the next
president. Jackson warned that President George Bush had named
Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court; Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had
dismantled affirmative action; and the GOP nominee _ when he was a
candidate in the Republican primaries _ had chosen ``the
Confederate flag over the American flag'' in the dispute over
banners flying over the South Carolina state house.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy coined the term ``the New Frontier'' at the
1960 Democratic convention in Los Angeles; his daughter, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, rallied the delegates Tuesday night with her
challenge that it was now time ``to prove that the New Frontier was
not a place in time but a timeless call'' to action to clean up the
environment, end gun violence and protect human and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Americans ``doing so well,'' Kennedy Schlossberg
declared, ``it is time once again to ask more of ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the senator from Massachusetts who inherited his
brother's Senate seat in 1962, urged Americans to support Gore
because ``he's fighting for you'' to expand health care coverage
against plans by a Republican rival who is willing to ``look inward
(and) look backward'' in order to ``comfort the comfortable.''
Kennedy, who lost his own presidential bid against Democratic
President Jimmy Carter in 1980, urged the nation to ``not turn back
to old policies and old ways that favor the few at the expense of
the many.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy-Townsend, the 49-year-old daughter of Robert
Kennedy and the lieutenant governor of Maryland, who plans to seek
the state's governorship, voiced the family's commitment to the
downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward we cannot leave anyone behind,''
Kennedy-Townsend said. ``We Democrats stand not just for the
success of the few but for opportunity for all.'' Robert F.
Kennedy, Jr., also spoke to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., the convention keynote speaker,
said the nation is at a crucial juncture. ``Will the amazing
advances of tomorrow be fenced off for the few _ or will they be
tools for all of us to build better lives?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Late polls showed Gore had plenty of work ahead of him to close
in on Bush, the second-term governor of Texas who waited out the
Democratic convention at his 1,500-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas,
before planning to take the fight to Gore in his native Tennessee
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide surveys by the Los Angeles Times and for Voter.com
showed Bush holding a 9-percentage point lead over Gore. The Los
Angeles Times survey spotlighted problems Gore has with Democrats,
capturing only 78 percent of Democrats compared to Bush's 18
percent. Bush also holds a 16-percentage point edge over Gore among
independent voters, the constituency expected to decide the outcome
on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, 52, who served 16 years in the House and Senate before
joining Clinton's ticket in 1992, appeared to be banking on his
tough-edged populism to help him rebound. Gore warned the Michigan
rally that ``all the powerful interests are lined up against'' his
succession, including big oil, big tobacco, big drug companies and
big polluters. Gore used the word ``fight'' no less than 13 times
in his brief remarks, adding: ``As president, I'll stand up to them
and stand up for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' aggressive us-versus-them populist rhetoric
recalled the GOP primary campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who
unsuccessfully challenged Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination. Campaign advisers said Gore must seize his first
moments outside Clinton's shadow to dramatically introduce himself
to the nation as a leader of the future rather than the trusted,
loyal sidekick to one of the most controversial and popular
presidents of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Democratic delegates approved a party platform
that reflected Gore's priorities and heard the unambiguous
endorsement of Gore by his defeated rival in the Democratic
presidential primaries, former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore-crafted party platform built upon the fiscal caution of
the Clinton-Gore years that transformed the political landscape
from political fights over deficit spending to disagreements over
how to distribute the federal budget surplus. The Democratic
document opposes school vouchers and partial privatization of
Social Security. The document vows to pay off the publicly held
national debt in 12 years, provide prescription drug coverage under
Medicare and tax cuts targeted to the middle class.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty years after John F. Kennedy accepted the
Democratic nomination in this city, his daughter, brother, niece
and nephew sought to revive the liberal hearts of his party Tuesday
night by recalling the slain president's legacy and tying Vice
President Al Gore to it.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has offered himself as a president for a new century,
the Democrats, on the second night of their national convention,
staged a festival of the past. It was a carefully choreographed
program intended to reassure loyalists that despite Gore's
overtures to moderates, their party was not drifting from its
principles of inclusiveness and tending to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured a parade of liberal stalwarts, from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's vanquished foe. There were also speakers
representing important Democratic constituencies: union members,
abortion rights advocates and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leftward tableau on stage was at odds with the platform that
the delegates approved Tuesday night, which was a decided play for
the middle, calling for a more potent military, expanded global
trade and for schools to be more accountable for student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and
security for all,'' the platform proclaimed, ``we cannot afford to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most stirring speeches were about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40
years ago, that America first looked across the New Frontier,''
said Kennedy, the most prominent liberal in Congress, in his
prepared remarks. ``A New Frontier, as my brother said, where there
were `unsolved problems, unconquered pockets of ignorance and
prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his brother, Kennedy said, ``How proud he would be
of Al Gore and our party and the new barrier of bigotry we are
breaking down with the choice of Joe Lieberman as the next vice
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, the late president's daughter, who in her first
speaking appearance before a Democratic convention said she was
proud that Gore's running mate, Lieberman, had been inspired by her
father to enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as I look out across this hall and across the country,''
Kennedy said in her prepared remarks, ``I know that my father's
spirit lives on.'' Her address was particularly poignant because
she is the sole survivor of the late president's immediate family.
Her mother Jacqueline, died in 1994, and her brother, John F.
Kennedy Jr., was killed in a plane crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sentimentality, the symbols of the party's liberal
wing were on stage to address one of Gore's most frustrating
political problems: He is not particularly popular with the base
voters of his party, and, according to surveys, is not nearly as
well liked in his party as Gov. George W. Bush is among
Republicans. Gore is counting on loyal Democrats to flock to the
polls in November. But the longer he has to worry about energizing
those voters, the less attention he can pay to the swing and
independent voters who are crucial for victory.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Democrats' drive to enliven the party, several
delivered intensely partisan speeches that bitterly repudiated
Bush's promise of compassion at his convention in Philadelphia as a
facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the inclusion illusion,'' Jackson said. ``In
Philadelphia, diversity ended on the stage. They could not mention
the words `Africa,' `Appalachia,' or `AIDS' once. So it is good to
be here in Los Angeles, to look over this great assembly and see
the real deal _ the quilt of many patches that is America.''
</P>
<P>
   After a riff in which he condemned the Bush clan, Jackson
repeated, ``America: Stay out of the Bushes. Stay out of the
Bushes. Stay out of the Bush,'' prompting the audience to respond
back with the same chant.
</P>
<P>
   The calvalcade of liberals was a decided contrast to the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, when conservative figures,
the most steadfast party loyalists, were largely kept off stage as
the party sought to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Republicans put Bush's primary opponent, Sen. John
McCain, on center stage, the Democrats on Tuesday night gave a
prime time spot to Bradley. Offering some of his most lavish praise
thus far for the vice president, Bradley said in prepared remarks:
``I learned that Al Gore is a man of wide-ranging intellect, with a
deep desire to serve, profound preparation for the job, a strong
sense of loyalty, and a life infused with tolerance and roots in
religious faith. What strikes me is that what we share is so much
more than what we disagree on.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were not as anticipated as McCain's had been,
perhaps because Bradley _ who did not win a single state in the
primaries _ is not viewed as much as a force in his party. And
Bradley devoted most of his speech to delivering a pitch for his
party and excoriating Republicans as impostors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't window-dress diversity, we're the party of
diversity,'' Bradley said in his prepared remarks. ``Don't read our
lips. Watch what we do. Watch what we have always done, what our
party values have always been.''
</P>
<P>
   In hewing to the old-guard theme of the evening, he went on,
``The convictions that Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon
Johnson stood for, that Jimmy Carter is living for even now, that
Bill Clinton still works for, the ideals that Jack and Bobby and
Martin died for.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of the past, the keynote speaker Tuesday night
was only 30 years old: Rep. Harold Ford Jr., from Gore's home state
of Tennessee. His father, Harold Ford Sr., was a longtime House
member who retired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Ford was a perfect cap for the evening
not only because of his youth, and because he is an African
American who represents diversity, but also because he is a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was also an opportunity to several Democratic
constituencies to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said, ``Because I am a woman,
because I am a mother and a grandmother, because I am an American,
and because I believe in the promise of this nation, I believe that
women must have the right to choose _ and so do Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his pitch, Gerald McEntee, president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, said,
``By electing Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, we're standing up against
the radical right wing that would dismantle worker rights, civil
rights and women's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates said they appreciated the tilt of the
speakers. ``There is definitely a left-leaning message to young
people like me and Democrats with a more idealistic agenda,'' said
Allison Friedrich, 22, a delegate from Athens, Ohio. ``It says
they're still fighting for us and that our vote is still important
to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   While the party put forth a largely united front, there were
some breaks in the Democratic facade. Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, who has pressed for retooling the campaign finance
system, expressed ``concern and dismay that `soft money' fund
raising has become so much a part of this convention. It should not
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evening was devoted to speakers' tales of attending
the Los Angeles Sports Arena when John Kennedy was nominated in
1960. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recalled that he was six years old when
he attended the convention and likened his uncle's New Frontier to
Gore, who he said ``will make history by validating our nation's
legacy for world leadership and environmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Jan Harman of California, recalled how, in an
experience that changed her life, she was an usher at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first Democratic convention was right here in 1960,'' said
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland.
``That year, as a young girl, I watched as my uncle, John Kennedy,
was nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of an American dream ``that my uncle and my father,
Robert Kennedy, shared, just as they share a love for the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not achieve that dream unless we have a leaders who
understands the forces at work in our world,'' Townsend said, ``and
works to extend the blessings of prosperity to every American. That
leader is Al Gore.''

Nadel, 26, a Washington lawyer, says he grew frustrated a few
months ago when he could not determine what was causing the sharp
decline in the value of his shares of an Internet stock fund.
Because most mutual funds disclose their complete holdings only

   MOSCOW _ Battling stormy seas and time, Russian seamen tried
again in the early hours Wednesday to lower a rescue capsule to the
nuclear-powered submarine lying broken and powerless on the floor
of the Barents Sea with 116 men aboard. An attempt on Tuesday
failed, and there was no immediate information whether the later
attempt was more successful.
</P>
<P>
   But with high seas, poor visibility and strong underwater
currents, and with the submarine lying at an angle at a depth of
350 to 480 feet, the chances for a rescue seemed to grow dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that there are still people alive and they are
signaling SOS,'' said the Russian navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov. ``Every day the chances are slimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The only communication with the submarine, the Kursk, was from
inside, from crew members tapping on the hull, Russian officials
said. There were reports that the tapping had grown fainter and
less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   During much of Tuesday, rescue efforts were hampered by winds
that reached 45 miles an hour and whipped up waves of 13 feet.
Water temperatures near the submarine hovered at 39 degrees.
Visibility under water was extremely low, as little as five feet,
the navy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the winds quieted in the night, enabling another rescue
attempt. At least two small bell-shaped rescue capsules, each able
to hold 10 to 20 people, were lowered to the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules are equipped with video cameras and powerful
searchlights and are normally run by three or four people,
according to the RIA news agency. The agency said docking with the
submarine required a high degree of precision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed in docking, the rescuers would probably
have to carry out exhausted and injured crewmen. Some reports said
that raising the rescue capsule, a simple chamber that hangs from a
ship, could take several hours to avoid potentially fatal
complications from decompression.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency quoted Kuroyedov as saying that if this
plan failed, the navy might try to raise the 14,000-ton submarine
with 400-ton inflatable pontoons.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts doubted that this could work, given the depth
and the enormous weight of the Kursk and the water that has entered
parts of the submarine. The experts also fear it might take too
long to attach pontoons to the submarine, given what is thought to
be the perilous state of the men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Though information about what happened remained fragmentary and
often contradictory, the Kursk was apparently damaged by an
explosion and partly flooded on Saturday during training maneuvers
of Russia's Northern Fleet. Some earlier reports said the accident
occurred on Sunday, but it now appears that the crew has been in
trouble since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is one of Russia's newest and most modern submarines,
and the navy press office said that several high-ranking naval
officers were on board to monitor the exercise along with the
regular crew.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the outside of the submarine, navy officials
said the most likely reason for the accident was an explosion,
possibly from a torpedo carried in the front of the vessel. Russian
officials insisted that there were no nuclear weapons on board and
that the submarine's reactors were shut down. Russia has been
accused of contaminating the Barents with radiation from discarded
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two Russian vessels were reported in the region
struggling to find ways of saving their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that oxygen supplies were likely to last only
till Friday and that they had not succeeded in attaching oxygen and
fuel lines to the Kursk. They said that the only power on the
submarine was a battery, which cannot be recharged underwater,
condemning the men to a slow death of asphyxiation if they were not
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that there was no information about the plight of the
seamen and officers. Submarine experts could only speculate why the
crew was not able to release an antenna, or how much of the vessel
was flooded, or what exactly went so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials in Washington said two American
submarines had been monitoring the Russian exercise, which began
last Thursday and involved a variety of vessels and aircraft, with
test firings of missiles. The officials said it was one of the
largest exercises held by the Russians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The American submarines detected a large explosion at about 7:30
or 8 on Saturday morning, the officials said, apparently from the
Kursk. The source was not clear, but the sound was not that of a
collision, they said. American officials ruled out any collision
with an American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were skeptical of a rescue, noting that the Kursk
was resting at a 60 degree angle, making it unlikely that a rescue
craft could successfully dock.

</P>
<P>
   Although American and other NATO navies offered to help, Russia
initially refused the offers, and in any case it was not
immediately clear what they could do.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Russian military officers met at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday night to see if there was anything
the Western alliance could provide. A NATO official said the
Russians discussed technical details in a telephone conference with
naval experts in Northwood, England, where NATO has its naval
headquarters for the eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication whether the discussions led to
any concrete action. The British and American navies have various
underwater rescue craft, and Norway and Germany have extensive
undersea oil exploring experience, but it was not clear whether any
Western vessel could link up to the Kursk's hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen sent a letter to the Russian
defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, offering ``any assistance you
need.'' There was no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy, said
the Navy had informed other countries in the past of the dimensions
of escape hatches that would be compatible with American rescue
capsules. But he did not know whether the Russians had adopted
those standards.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Quigley said the 60-degree list of the Kursk put it
``beyond the design parameters of the U.S. deep submergence rescue
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle A.H. Trost, a retired admiral who was formerly chief of
naval operations, said that even if the Kursk had a fully charged
battery when it went down, the power would probably last only two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere must be fouling very rapidly,'' said Trost, who
once commanded a nuclear-powered submarine. And ``lights last only
a very limited time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the trapped seamen dominated Russian news. On one
radio call-in show, a former professor demanded to know what could
be done to persuade the authorities to seek outside help: ``What
signs to we need to draw, to whom must we appeal to get them to
accept help?''
</P>
<P>
   At least six seamen from the southeastern Russian city of Kursk,
for which the submarine was named, were on board. One, Dima
Staroseltsev, 20, had finished a training course in June and wrote
home to say he was happy to be leaving for sea, his mother said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last letter was so joyful,'' the mother, Valentina
Staroseltseva, said. ``He said, mama, there's a great crew on board
here, a bunch of guys from Kursk. We're like one big family.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's commander, Gennadi Lyachin, 45, has served in
the Northern Fleet since 1978, according to Russian news reports.
The navy refused to give any details about the rest of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The crew's plight horrified Russians. ``They are sitting and
waiting,'' said Aleksandr Nikitin, an environmental activist who
once was an engineer on a nuclear submarine. ``This accident
sketches a pretty accurate picture of the state of the navy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of concrete information, experts said it was not
possible to say how long the men could go on. They could slowly run
out of oxygen, succumbing to mental dullness and possibly
convulsions before sinking into a comas and dying.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a buildup of carbon dioxide, the brain would
gradually stop functioning, the men would slip into unconsciousness
and their hearts would weaken and stop. Or, if the electrical
system had failed, they could freeze to death. Or they could perish
from a lethal buildup of nitrogen, sulfides and toxic gases.

 &HT;    WAR ON DRUGS? LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE
 &HT;    By FRANK CERABINO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I spent the day Tuesday listening to people talk
about drugs, both prescription and non-prescription.
</P>
<P>
   But first let me tell you about the freeway chase.
</P>
<P>
   They really know how to do car chases here. The driving is
crisp, the police pursuit worthy of Hollywood standards, and the TV
news coverage top-notch.
</P>
<P>
   There was a great one here Monday night, right after the
convention broke up. A guy stole a Geo Prism, and for the next
hour, he drove it all over L.A.'s freeways.
</P>
<P>
   The local FOX affiliate broke away from its convention coverage,
using a helicopter reporter, an anchor in the studio, and another
reporter at the Democratic National Convention to give play-by-play
(or maybe it's turn-by-turn) coverage to the meandering 110 m.p.h.
highway chase for the whole hour.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never watched a highway chase in such detail, so I was
impressed by the station's police specialist, Rod Bernsen, who was
kind enough to explain the intracacies of freeway chase etiquette
for all the convention visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you usually don't see _ I know there are a lot of
visitors here for the convention _ is for 10 or 15 cars to be in
pursuit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernsen explained that the police preferred to illuminate the
stolen car with a million-candlepower light, and hang back,
allowing the other motorists to make way for the pursuit parade.
</P>
<P>
   The TV station was kind enough to show superimposed highway maps
on the screen and make predictions about where the fleeing felon
might go next.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, he's westbound on 10, let's see if he's going over to the
101,'' the helicopter reporter says.
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``He didn't get off on the 405. He's going to run out
of exits here.''
</P>
<P>
   They gave ``oh boy'' comments when the car blew through red
lights and bumped cars. When the driver did two laps around Los
Angeles International Airport, zooming by pedestrians and shuttle
buses outside the terminal, the anchors felt obliged to add: ``This
person obviously needs to go to jail,'' and ``This guy's an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   They contrasted this chase with other freeway chases they've
covered too, giving the first-time convention visitor a little
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, we've covered a number of these pursuits,'' Rod says.
``This would would be the first one where we have someone in the
trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, it turned out that no one was in the trunk. And the
chase came to a happy conclusion when the driver lost control in a
turn, spun the car, hit the curb, and was caught making a run for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back to our scheduled programming.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking about the chase Tuesday with three convention
delegates from Florida, Phyllis Lapidus of Boca Raton, Marna
Davidson of Boynton Beach, and Maurice Sussman of West Palm Beach.
We were at an event called the Senior Power Fiesta held to get
seniors excited about, among other things, the Democrats' plan make
Medicare include prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham echoed the need for the prescription drug plan
during his convention speech later in the day, calling it ``a test
of our values.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are smart to thump on senior issues. But the most
intriguing talk about drugs Tuesday happened a few blocks away from
the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   This was about non-prescription drugs, and how the routine
imprisonment of drug offenders has swelled the prison population in
America, creating a jail-industrial complex full of recidivist drug
addicts who continue to commit crime because treatment isn't as
available as punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted felons, unlike seniors, don't vote. So you won't hear
about it, unless you attended the Shadow Convention _ a sort of
unconventional convention that is being held here, as it was in
Philadelphia during the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's topic was that the so-called war on drugs has been a
disaster in both human and economic costs, and that sensible
leaders should have chosen a different course long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins recited a litany
of cases of people serving life sentences for non-violent drug
convictions, often involving small amounts of drugs. Using the
South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles as an example, Robbins
said: ``Drugs are easier to get than education. There are no Betty
Ford treatment centers. Are we fighting a drug war ... or is this
just America's version of ethnic cleansing?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Maher, the host of the television show ``Politically
Incorrect,'' called the Partnership for a Drug Free America an
absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is swimming in drugs,'' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't eliminating all drugs, he said, but making
some acceptable while outlawing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prozac doesn't want to go up against marijuana,'' Maher said.
``It would lose.''
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I'm going to scan the channels for more televised
freeway chases.
</P>
<P>
   That's something I could get addicted to.

 &HT;    PARTY'S LIBERAL LIONS ROAR FOR GORE
 &HT;    Eds: Will be led with keynote speech, other remarks.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic convention delegates wistfully recalled
their party's progressive past Tuesday night with a nostalgic and
emotional look back at the ``New Frontier'' of John F. Kennedy and
a promise to take the country to ``New Heights'' under Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the only surviving member of
Kennedy's immediate family, stirred the memories of her
assassinated father with a rare appearance before the convention
that will formally nominate Gore on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strains from the Broadway musical ``Camelot'' greeted
Schlossberg as she reached the podium to add her voice to the
chorus of praise for Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who campaigned Tuesday in Michigan with President Clinton
in a symbolic passing of the torch, arrives in Los Angeles on
Wednesday to claim the party's presidential nomination, the
culmination of his 24 years in public office.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg followed other members of the Democratic Party's
most famous family to the podium in the standing-room-only Staples
Center in the heart of the city where Kennedy was nominated in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, and two
cousins, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist, and
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland,
also addressed the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 6 years old when his uncle became
the Democratic standard-bearer in 1960, noted that ``at that
convention, our party launched the new frontier with a Democratic
frontier.'' He added, ``This year, we will launch a new millennium
with a great national leader who will make history by validating
our nation's legacy for world leadership and environmental
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said the Democratic Party ``made history (in 1960) by
summoning the best of our country, challenging Americans to
serve.'' This year, she added, ``with renewed resolve, we'll make
history again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the most dynamic and most recognized
liberal voice of the party today, also electrified the delegates on
the so-called ``New Heights'' night of the convention with spirited
rhetoric that ridiculed the Republican Party's recent convention as
an ``inclusion illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also roused the delegates with a harsh critique of
Republican nominee George W. Bush's record as governor of Texas and
a reminder that ``Papa Bush,'' the governor's father, former
President George Bush, had elevated Clarence Thomas, a conservative
foe of affirmative action, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At several points, Jackson led the more than 4,000 delegates in
chants: ``Stay out of the Bushes,'' ``More with Gore'' and his
signature ``Keep hope alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson also reminded his fellow Democrats of the ``moral
disgrace'' of one in five American children living in poverty in a
time of unprecedented economic wealth and the ``great divide''
between the affluence of Beverly Hills and the poverty of South
Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He called for greater government efforts to combat poverty,
expand health care and job opportunities and improve the
environment and education.
</P>
<P>
   But he also blessed the Democratic ticket of Gore, a Southern
Baptist, and Lieberman, a Jew, as ``the All-American team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman paid a surprise visit to the convention floor Tuesday
night, and convention organizers immediately broadcast a video of
Kennedy declaring in 1960 that his religious beliefs _ he was
Catholic _ were ``not relevant'' to his campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket also got the blessing of former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, who carried the liberal wing's banner in the Democratic
primaries against Gore this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was highly critical of the vice president during
the primaries, vowed to ``work hard'' for Gore and other Democrats
this fall because ``our country needs a Democratic president, a
Democratic Congress and most important, a Democratic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley thanked those who supported him in the primaries and
called his campaign ``a joyous journey'' despite being left with
``scars'' from his sometimes cutting scrapes with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of his former opponent, he said, ``When you run against someone,
you get to know him very well. I learned that Al Gore is a man of
wide-ranging intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound
preparation for the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life view
infused with tolerance and rooted in religious faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Jackson, Bradley urged the party on to new heights,
specifically to ending child poverty in America and vanquishing
``the insidious bond between big money and political decisions.''
He said campaign finance reform ``will put the people back in
politics and usher in a new day full of hope and honesty, full of
humanity and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, the co-sponsor of campaign
finance reforms with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush's chief
opponent in the GOP primaries, urged the Democratic Party to
prohibit the raising of so-called ``soft money'' at future
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stand before you ... without mentioning my concern
and dismay that soft money fund-raising has become so much a part
of this convention,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day gathering of Democrats, which began Monday, is not
confined to the nomination of Gore and Lieberman and an approval of
a platform of principles on which they two will run this fall: It
also an unusually ripe opportunity for the party to raise funds
with the help of powerful friends in the city's entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform vowed to make the McCain-Feingold bill ``the
first piece of legislation in a Democratic administration.'' It
also committed the party to support ``a public-private, nonpartisan
endowment to raise money to finance congressional elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform, approved by the state delegations voting on sleek
iMac computers donated by Apple, also pledged support for abortion
rights, affirmative action, increasing the number of police, DNA
testing in some death penalty cases, putting 1 million new teachers
in classrooms, mandatory child safety locks for guns, expanded
health insurance for families, using budget surpluses to shore up
Social Security and Medicare and tax cuts targeted to middle class
families.

 &HT;    Once-promising startup living.com files for bankruptcy
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Living.com Inc., one of the richest and most
promising startups to emerge from Austin's high-tech community in
the past few years, closed its doors and filed for bankruptcy
Tuesday, the first major failure among the scores of fast-growing
Internet companies hatched here.
</P>
<P>
   In just two years, living.com had raised $68 million in venture
capital, launched a national ad campaign, attracted millions of
visitors to its online furniture store and allied itself with
e-commerce leader Amazon.com. But it was not enough to gird the
company against increasingly wary investors and a growing concern
that consumers are not embracing online shopping in all forms.
</P>
<P>
   At an emotional mid-afternoon meeting at the company's downtown
headquarters, founder Andrew Busey, Chief Executive Shaun Holliday
and other executives broke the news to employees.
</P>
<P>
   Workers had heard rumors for weeks and been anticipating the
closure since a grim meeting Friday. But the decision to close was
not made until the board of directors gathered late Monday, a
company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, living.com was able to attract $35 million in what
was at the time the biggest round of funding in Austin history from
some of the premier venture capital firms. But now, the stock
market has turned against Internet retailers and private investors
have followed suit, refusing to put more money in companies like
living.com. The fact that the company had burned through most of
its venture capital and was a long way from being profitable made
it an even tougher sell.
</P>
<P>
   Busey and Holliday were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the company stopped taking orders on its site, laid off
its 275 employees in Austin and North Carolina and began the
processing of selling its assets. Another 63 workers at Shaw
Furniture Galleries in Randleman, N.C., a furniture store bought by
living.com in 1998, also lost their jobs. None of the employees
will receive severance.
</P>
<P>
   In the current job market, many employees will likely find jobs
quickly, although the closing puts an unusually large number of
people out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The company said customers would find more information about the
status of their orders on the site in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Andrew Springate said he did not know what would
happen to the company's assets, which include an inventory of
goods, a database of customers, a lease on about 40,000 square feet
of office space at Congress Avenue and Third Street, as well as a
125,000-square-foot warehouse the company owns in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But its most valuable real estate, a ``tab'' on Amazon that
directed online shoppers to living.com, vanished late Tuesday,
leaving no trace of what both companies hoped would be a lucrative
relationship. In February, Living.com had agreed to pay Amazon $145
million over five years for the privilege of being its ``Home
Living Store,'' and Amazon had taken an 18 percent stake in the
startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this caught (Amazon) by surprise,'' said Heath Terry,
an analyst who follows the online retailer for Credit Suisse First
Boston in San Francisco. ``It wouldn't surprise me too much if the
situation at living was being presented in a better than reality
light in an effort to encourage Amazon to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he was not surprised that Amazon declined to rescue
living.com, though. Amazon has had its own problems lately
convincing investors that its way of selling everything from books
to garden supplies on the Internet is sound, and the demise of
living.com may be one more sign that the bloom is off the
e-commerce giant's rose. ``Amazon was always viewed as capable of
giving their blessing and that being a guarantor of success,''
Terry said. ``We realized for along time that was not necessarily
true and this, if nothing else, proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he also questioned the high price of the Amazon deal.
Originally it would have cost living.com far more than the company
was collecting in revenue, though the two companies renegotiated
the deal recently, Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts disagreed, saying that Amazon's 20 million
shoppers could have kept living.com afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they been able to stick around longer, that deal would
have paid off,'' said Seema Williams, an analyst at Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``The unfortunate thing that happened
for them is the . . . market kind of bottomed out before they were
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, living.com has not been the only one to struggle in its
industry. Framingham, Mass.-based Furniture.com, living.com's chief
rival, flirted with bankruptcy this summer before a last-minute
bail-out. Furniture.com has canceled plans for an initial public
offering, laid off 41 percent of its staff and is now facing
complaints from the Better Business Bureau. All of the startups
that have tried to sell furniture online have struggled with how to
handle merchandising, shipping and returns of products that often
weigh hundreds of pounds and cost thousands of dollars. Both
living.com and its subsidiary, Shaw Furniture Galleries, had
recently been the target of complaints about their customer service
filed with the Better Business Bureau in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>

PROGRESS REPORTED IN VERIZON TALKS

   Unions representing more than 86,000 customer service workers
and technicians at Verizon Communications continued to wrangle with
the company over several issues Tuesday, extending a telephone
strike now in its 11th day.
</P>
<P>
   Progress appeared to be made late Tuesday, however, at a meeting
between the company and union negotiators for the region that
includes New York and New England. According to a person close to
the talks, Verizon addressed some concerns over job security in a
development that could lead to the end of the strike in the next
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon and the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are debating issues
that include job stress, mandatory overtime and the transfer of
work in response to the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, which
formed Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   The unions and the company met for formal talks in Washington on
Tuesday morning, said people close to the negotiations, and sidebar
discussions continued into the night.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are largely in agreement over wages, benefits and
a concession from Verizon allowing the unions to organize more
easily in the company's wireless division. But the differences over
work-place stress and the possible loss of job security because of
the merger have emerged as sticking points during the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   As the strike drags on, Verizon has attempted to deal with a
growing number of requests for telephone service, for repair of
existing service and vandalism. The company said it has had to
focus on repair requests instead of installations of new service
and has asked customers having problems receiving help from
directory assistance to look up numbers on its Web site
(www.bigyellow.com).
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, Verizon had to shut down a separate site to
which the company had been directing customers need to report
service problems, after an online magazine, SecurityFocus.com
alerted the company of a security breach that made it possible to
use the site to get access to customers' unlisted telephone
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with other problems, Verizon has deployed about 30,000
non-union employees including managers and other staff such as
secretaries and attorneys to fill in for the 86,000 striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few days of the strike, the company had reported a
rash of vandalism, including severed lines. Those reports had
dwindled, but late Monday telephone service for 1,600 residential
and business customers in Massachusetts was knocked out after
vandals cuts three major cables at a pole in Tewksbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which managed to restore service by about noon
Tuesday, offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of people involved in the cable cutting.
``Whoever did this knew what they were doing,'' said Jack Hoey, a
Verizon spokesman in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was receiving about 80,000 requests for
repair each day, and dealing with as many of them as the fill-in
managers could handle.

COMMENTARY: ALL SHOOK UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Only a man with an impressive wingspan could have
done it. And only a man who had lassoed Arafat and Barak, and Gerry
Adams and David Trimble, would have tried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the president was determined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On stage in Monroe, Mich., on Tuesday, Bill Clinton spread those
long arms of his and firmly encircled the shoulders of Hillary and
Tipper, who were doing their darndest not to look at each other or
get anywhere near each other. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like an accordion player squeezing out a mighty chord on ``Lady
of Spain,'' Clinton slowly pulled the two blondes into the TV frame
_ as Al Gore growled at the crowd in a simulation of excitement _
to get that essential picture of One Big Happy Family. But in a
moment, the two women managed to escape his embrace and sidle back
as far stage right and stage left as they could manage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of course this is not One Big Happy Family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This quartet represents the most extraordinary collection of
festering resentments and seething jealousies and co-dependent
plotting that has ever darkened the White House _ with the possible
exception of when Richard Nixon dined alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The miracle was not that the baton got passed, but that nobody
got hit with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those few moments on stage in Monroe took weeks to negotiate,
with excruciating disagreements over the last few days about
exactly how to choreograph the symbolic moment between the two
couples. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team had nightmares that the president would do a fake
handoff, and say ``You got it!'' when the crowd chanted ``Four more
years!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tipper, who, out of the four of them, always has the hardest
time hiding what she is feeling, is clearly steamed that Elvis
never had any intention of leaving the building, and that Hillary
has turned Beverly Hills into the sixth borough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The convention should be celebrating the vice president's role
in creating a fat, happy country. But the undercurrents here could
suck down a battleship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Poor Gore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, he paid a facilitator to come into his Senate office
and the new Clinton/Gore White House and coach him and his staffers
on ``group  &QL; 
dynamics.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But no New Age psychobabble, no touchy-feely sessions in group
dynamics, can help you manage the tectonic plates of Bill and
Hillary's dysfunction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as Al Gore hits town to party, the trellis of competing
ambitions and interlocking needs and dueling grievances has left
everyone exhausted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill's mad at Al because Al chose Joe Lieberman, a Democrat who
outdid plenty of Republicans in sewing a scarlet ``A'' on the
president's polo shirt. Bill's also mad at Al because Al has been
at his elbow for eight years and still can't give a speech. If Al
can't give a speech, he can't beat W. And the Bushes as caretakers
of the Clinton legacy is a chilling thought. And Bill's also mad at
Al because the vice president paid tribute Monday to the notorious
monogamist Jimmy Carter, who never felt he got the respect from
Bill he deserved, and was delighted to go on zillions of TV shows
and wag a finger at Bill's ``escapades.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for why the vice president's mad at Bill, don't get Al
started. Just consider Monday night's goofy WWF-meets-Russell-Crowe
moment, when Clinton had more cameras rigged up to capture every
step of his stagey backstage stroll than you can find in the ``Big
Brother'' house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Al's mad at Hillary because she has turned his centrist
convention into a liberal campaign rally for herself, even managing
to ``accidentally'' maneuver her way onto prime time Monday night
(pushing the president's scheduled prime-time paean to Al into
Lenoland). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's mad at Bill. And you really don't want to get her
started.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of this familial angst is not what Al Gore needs. Because
his problem is that he's so plodding, so insecure, always searching
for the right look and sound, that it is tiring to watch him.
</P>
<P>
   You just know that Gore, who has grown more stiff lately
appearing with Clinton, left Monroe a nervous wreck. Clinton, on
the other hand, stopped his motorcade on the way out of town at a
McDonald's for a crispy chicken sandwich and french fries.

FOUNDER OF CANADIAN SOFTWARE DEVELOPER COREL RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Michael Cowpland, the founder of the Corel Corp.,
abruptly resigned Tuesday from all his executive positions at the
ailing Canadian software developer, and put its future in the hands
of a new chief executive and a revamped board.
</P>
<P>
   Cowpland resigned as CEO, president and chairman, but he said he
would remain a director.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Burney, formerly Corel's executive vice president for
engineering and chief of technology, has been appointed interim
chief executive and president.
</P>
<P>
   James Baillie, a well-known Toronto lawyer, has taken over as
chairman of Corel and will head a committee to review the
composition of the board and Corel's survival plan.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born Cowpland, 57, started Ottawa-based Corel 15
years ago after he and a partner, Terence Matthews, sold their
interest in a telecommunications equipment maker, the Mitel Corp.
Corel developed graphic design software like Coreldraw, and
acquired other office software products, like Wordperfect. Its
stock traded as high as $44.50 on the Nasdaq in 1999. But investor
confidence collapsed as the company continued to lose money and
failed to meet promised profit forecasts. On Tuesday, its shares
closed at $3.66, up 6.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   With sales of its older graphics design products in decline,
Corel tied its future to the Linux operating system, but the
collapse of a merger earlier this year with the Inprise Corp. left
it short of cash, and Linux has yet to build a substantial
commercial base among PC users. In June, 350 jobs were cut _ 21
percent of the staff _ as part of a plan to trim costs by $40
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, ended June 30, the company reported
lower-than expected sales of $38 million and a higher-than expected
loss of $24 million. Cowpland, who owns about 10 percent of Corel
and recently said he expects the company to be profitable by the
fourth quarter, said he would pursue start-up opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides failing to steer Corel back to profitability, Cowpland
is facing three charges of insider trading brought by the Ontario
Securities Commission last fall for selling $14 million worth of
shares in 1997 shortly before unexpectedly poor earnings were
reported.

RADIO-SHOW CALLER ARRESTED IN LIEBERMAN DEATH THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A caller to Howard Stern's radio show was arrested
Tuesday at his home on Long Island and charged with saying on the
air that he wanted to kill Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Democratic
candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, Lawrence C. Franco, 23, phoned the talk show around
6:25 a.m. on Monday and, according to a complaint issued by federal
prosecutors in Brooklyn, made several anti-religious remarks before
saying: ``So that Lieberman guy has gotta go. He is gonna take my
bullet. He's going to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is the first Jewish candidate to run on the
presidential ticket for either of the two major political parties.
Even so, Franco, who identified himself on the show as
``Nazarene,'' repeatedly made remarks like: ``I hate churchgoers. I
hate them all,'' according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   When Stern asked Franco whether he was actually threatening
Lieberman, Franco said, ``I'm telling you right now, you got the
killer on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Secret Service, which has been protecting Lieberman
since he was chosen last week to be Vice President Al Gore's
running mate, checked the records of calls to the station and
traced the number to a house in Farmingdale, where Franco lives
with his father, who is also named Lawrence. Although Franco
boasted on the air that he would have ``guns out the window'' if
federal agents came to get him, members of the Secret Service who
searched his bedroom found only a pellet gun.
</P>
<P>
   Franco earns his living assembling newspapers for Newsday, said
his lawyer, Abraham Klott. Appearing before Magistrate Joan M.
Azrack of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Klott said there was no
evidence that his client was truly a danger to Lieberman or anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was `The Howard Stern Show,''' Klott added. ``This is an
example of what happens with talk radio going out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Azrack released Franco on $200,000 bail and placed him under
house arrest. Outside the courtroom, a man who introduced himself
as the defendant's uncle said: ``It was the wrong thing to do. It
was a joke gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gerstein, a spokesman for Lieberman, who is in Los Angeles
at the Democratic National Convention, declined to comment on the
incident.

CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ARE FLOODING IN AFTER TIRE RECALL 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the recent spate of publicity about deadly accidents
involving Firestone tires, Tab Turner, a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer,
rarely received more than a call or two a month seeking his advice
about legal claims related to defective tires.
</P>
<P>
   But Turner, who has spent nearly all his time the last few years
on tire problems or litigation stemming from rollover accidents
involving sport utility vehicles, is no longer driving in the legal
slow lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 330 calls and e-mails on Monday,'' said Turner, mostly
from consumers angry about delays in having their tires replaced.
``We're getting overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say that the clamor for advice and, in some cases,
action against Bridgestone/Firestone, which makes the tires, and
the Ford Motor Company, whose Explorer sport utility vehicles
figure in most of the reported accidents, seems unlikely to abate
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while tire manufacturers and automakers have rarely had
to worry about anything beyond a steady trickle of lawsuits
stemming from tire failures, they are now attracting the attention
of big-name class-action law firms responding to widespread anger
at the recall plans.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action firms _ which have honed their skills in
multibillion-dollar battles with drug companies, asbestos
manufacturers and the tobacco industry _ have far more resources
than Mr. Turner, Bruce R. Kaster of Florida, Thomas Basse of
Arizona and other personal-injury lawyers that tire makers like
Firestone usually face.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the cases involving deaths and injuries in individual
traffic accidents, some of which have resulted in six-figure
settlements, the class-action suits are focused on the claims of
drivers who have yet to suffer any tire failure.
</P>
<P>
   Such claims are too small for personal-injury lawyers to pursue
individually, but together they could cost Bridgestone/Firestone
and Ford hundreds of millions of dollars beyond the expenses of the
recall. Last week, Firestone's Japanese parent, the Bridgestone
Corp., said it would set aside $350 million to cover recall costs,
and its stock has plunged 29 percent this month amid news about the
problem tires.
</P>
<P>
   The recall that Firestone announced last week _ for all 15-inch
ATX and ATX II tires, and for Wilderness AT tires made at its plant
in Decatur, Ill. _ focused first on Southern and Western states
where the vast majority of accidents involving the tires had been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the class-action complaints argue that millions of drivers
who are being asked to wait a year or more are being damaged by
that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the class actions demand that Bridgestone/Firestone
immediately replace tires in all states, or else cover the costs of
consumers who want to switch to other brands.
</P>
<P>
   Some seek compensation for the emotional stress to drivers or
the diminished resale value of vehicles that have been equipped
with the tires being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone moved on Tuesday to meet some of the
demands, announcing that it would reimburse customers up to $100 a
tire for tires purchased since Jan. 1 in order to replace the
recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would offer the same payment to customers
who have bought tires from other makers to replace Firestones since
it announced the recall last on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also face legal complaints over their decision to
limit the recall to 15-inch tires when some larger tires have
already been recalled in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, which is named in some but not all of the suits, said on
Tuesday that the recall had ``nothing to do with the litigation and
that the class-action lawyers were trying to capitalize on a
situation they have no influence over.''
</P>
<P>
   A Firestone spokesman said the company was too busy working on
the recall to comment on litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Personal-injury lawyers like Turner are not yet paying much
attention to the recall plan, but that could change if delays
replacing the tires lead to accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people trying to get their tires replaced tell me
that dealers say it will take three months to catch up with the
demand,'' said Dasse, a lawyer in Scottsdale, Ariz., which is in
the first group of states promised replacement tires. ``You are
going to see catastrophic failures in the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the companies could be exposing themselves to further
legal claims if Firestone continued supplying tires to Ford to keep
Explorer production lines up, instead of meeting the recall needs
first.
</P>
<P>
   The tire maker said on Tuesday that satisfying customer concerns
was its first priority, but added that it was also continuing to
send tires to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is no longer whether there is a problem,'' Turner
said. ``It's now an issue of what they knew and when they knew
it.''  &QL;

WOODS SETS HIS SIGHTS ON NICKLAUS' RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ A year ago, Tiger Woods turned the PGA
Championship into a turning point in his remarkable career.
</P>
<P>
   Just 365 days ago, Woods had won just one major championship _
the 1997 Masters. For a player who measures his success by major
championships, one was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't win a major in 1998, and he didn't win the first three
majors of 1999. Woods came to last year's PGA Championship at
Medinah Country Club in Illinois needing a victory to feed his
insatiable appetite for majors, to begin his pursuit of Jack
Nicklaus' 18 professional major championships in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   But after Woods won the PGA last year, holding off Sergio Garcia
in a riveting back-nine duel, Woods began distancing himself from
everyone else, like a Ferrari with the gas pedal nailed to the
floor. Starting with his victory at Medinah, Woods has won three of
the last four majors, the last two by incredible margins _ 15
strokes at the U.S. Open, and 8 strokes at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to defend his title this week at Valhalla Golf Club
in the midst of an extraordinary run that has made him the world's
most talked-about athlete. Should Woods win this weekend, he would
become the second player to win three consecutive professional
majors in one year, joining Ben Hogan, who won the Masters, the
U.S. Open, and the British Open in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Woods will be living in a fishbowl this week, as evidenced
Tuesday, when hordes of fans followed him in the 90-degree heat
during his practice round, getting a glimpse of a player who has
single-handedly increased the importance of the event. Even Woods
may never have another chance to win three majors in one year, or
three majors in succession. It will be a draining week, but for
Woods, winning makes everything worth it, and the possibility of
winning 18 or more majors no longer looks as unlikely as it once
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want to do, to win major championships,'' said
Woods, who will try to become the first player to win back-to-back
PGA Championships since Denny Shute won in 1936 and 1937. ``This is
going to be a long week. The golf course is set up very difficult,
and the weather is going to be sapping a lot out of you. Hopefully,
I can make a few putts and keep the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I pursuing Jack Nicklaus' records? He set the bar very
high, and he won the biggest ones over and over again. Have I tried
to chase him? I don't think it's realistic to think about that yet
until you get into double digits, maybe the teens. It's going to
take a long time. Hopefully, things will go well for a long period
of time in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that Woods will be paired on Thursday and Friday
with Nicklaus and Vijay Singh. Nicklaus, at age 60, may be playing
his last PGA Championship. Meanwhile, Singh won this year's
Masters, the only major that Woods did not win.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the galleries that will follow Woods and Nicklaus, in
what could be their last pairing together in an official event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Woods, of being paired with
the player he admires the most. ``It's going to be quite an honor
and a lot of fun to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for a first-round 75 at the Masters, where he settled for
a fifth-place tie, Woods could have conceivably entered this week
with a chance to win all four majors this year. If he were to win
this weekend, however, he would have a chance to win four
consecutive majors at next year's Masters, an idea that clearly
intrigued him when it was mentioned to him last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four in a row is four in a row,'' said Woods, his face
lighting up. ``I came close at Augusta this year. And I already
know I can win four tournaments in a one year. It's just a question
of peaking at the right time. And that's something I'm getting
better at doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that Woods can raise his game at majors is
undeniable. He holds the scoring record in relation to par at three
majors _ the Masters (18 under par), the United States Open (12
under par), and the British Open (19 under par). The PGA
Championship record is 17 under par, set by Steve Elkington and
Colin Montgomerie in 1995 at Riviera Country Club, where Elkington
won in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Does Woods want that record, too? Of course he does, but he is
more concerned with winning. He worked hard last week with Butch
Harmon, his coach, to perfect the shots he will need at Valhalla,
which requires a much higher ball flight than the British Open,
where the wind and links style of play required lower ball flight.
</P>
<P>
   When Harmon looks at Woods, he sees a player who is as
enthusiastic as he was when he was 17 years old, which is when they
began working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger thinks he can get better, and I think he's going to get
a lot better,'' Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon did not back off when he saw the raised eyebrows on the
face of the person asking him questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that sounds scary,'' Harmon said. ``But I think he can
get a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the last two majors, everyone in the locker room knows
who the player to beat is this week. And it will be interesting to
see who rises to the challenge of a player who holds a
psychological edge over some players even before play begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Nicklaus say this year that the other guys are running
up the white flag,'' said Steve Jones, winner of the 1996 U.S.
Open, who strongly disagreed. ``I've only won eight tournaments in
my life, but I enter every tournament to win. Hal Sutton beat Tiger
at the Players Championship, Phil Mickelson beat Tiger in San
Diego. But the guy is good. In basketball, you heard guys complain
that Michael Jordan got all the calls. Out here, we don't have any
refs. Tiger is making history. Whether he wins 23 majors, or
whatever, we'll see. But everyone knows who the best player is.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the world watching, again, Woods looked forward to
another memorable week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give it everything I've got,'' Woods said.
``Hopefully, it will come together by Thursday.''  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: MAHOMES IS `MR. ANY ROLE' ON METS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You're starting tomorrow,'' someone said to Pat
Mahomes Monday in the New York Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about that,'' replied the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine said so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He did? I gotta go in and ask him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, had also said
something else about Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of our hidden secrets,'' Valentine offered.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes is such a secret, apparently, that there are times when
even he doesn't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, there had been rumors but, in the best tradition of
cloak-and-dagger, the mystery took time unraveling. In the end,
Mahomes started.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Mahomes' fourth start this season in this, his
second year with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a good team without someone like Pat Mahomes
doing his job and doing it well,'' Valentine had said. ``His
contributions are at times overlooked. He doesn't have a defined
role. We only turn to him when we're in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night was one of those times. Mahomes has generally come
out of the bullpen in long relief, in short relief and everything
in-between. If the nachos or knishes vendor called in sick, it
wouldn't be a surprise for heads to turn to Mahomes for help. So
the Mets had been riding a hot streak. Now a doubleheader with the
Colorado Rockies came up because of a previous rainout and someone
was needed to step in.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones, a veteran starter, was to pitch one of the two
games, the second. Who's to pitch the other? Well, the vendors were
all present and accounted for, which freed up Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Valentine turned to Mahomes only when necessary,
but, added the manager, ``He's done exactly what we needed.'' In
Mahomes' three previous starts this season _ his last was May 13 _
his record was 0-0, but his earned run average was a superb 2.76.
His record as a reliever is 4-1, good but not quite as good as last
season when it was perfect, 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   When starting help was needed this season, the Mets called up
Class AAA pitchers. They were treated harshly by opposing hitters.
Now, Valentine looked not again to Norfolk but to the corner of his
clubhouse where Mahomes, the 6-foot-4-inch right-hander from Tyler,
Texas, sat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, most guys like a definite role,'' said Mahomes, ``and
for most of my career I was a starter, but I'm thrilled to be with
the Mets, with a contender, and in the big leagues, period. And I
like Bobby. When I look him in the eye, I know what he's saying. I
feel his trust in crucial situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes, who turned 30 last week, has been around, usually on
the big-league fringes. He came up with the Twins in 1992 and was
sent down to the minors, came up, and was down and up and down
again. He was traded to the Red Sox and the story was similar. In
1997 and 1998 he pitched in Japan. The Mets gave him another shot.
Called up from Norfolk in early 1999, he was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday the hidden secret was only partly revealed. Mahomes
pitched six and two-thirds innings, gave up five hits and left the
game with the Mets behind, 4-2. If it had not been for a pair of
run-involving doubles by Todd Helton, who was suffering with a .394
batting average entering the game, Mahomes would have fared even
better. But Mahomes did keep the Mets in the ball game, which is as
much as Valentine could have wished. And in the seventh, they came
back with four runs to take a 6-4 lead, en route to a 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes also distinguished himself with the bat and the glove.
He laid down a lovely sacrifice bunt that led to the Mets' first
run. And he caught a hard bouncer with his bare hand to force a
runner at second. If a team is going to win, it also needs such
professional executions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mahomes had spoken of visions of postseason play. He
said he remembered vividly the disappointment of the Mets losing in
the playoffs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the World Series from home, and thinking: `We're not
scared of the Yankees. We can beat 'em,''' he said. ``Nothing this
season has made me change my opinion. We can get there. We've
improved ourselves in a few positions, like starting pitcher. Guys
like Robin Ventura and Darryl Hamilton are healthy again, and our
bullpen is rested. Going down to the wire is going to be
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dennis Cook relieved Mahomes in the seventh, the fans gave
him a handsome round of applause. For them, it was as sweet as
having found a shiny prize in their Cracker Jack box.

MEMBERS MUST BRING OWN TOWELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ L.A. Fitness is throwing in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to soak up the annual $800,000 loss of its towels,
L.A. Fitness has told its members they'll have to show their own
towel to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members were taking the towels home,'' said David
Rodriguez, general manager at L.A. Fitness in Pasadena. ``They pay
dues, but they aren't entitled to take the towels home.''
</P>
<P>
   One member even sued the company because an L.A. Fitness towel
she used to dry her car scratched the paint.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule affects all 75 L.A. Fitness locations, including
those in Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys and Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez admitted there are members upset with the club's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But some L.A. Fitness facilities had been ordering hundreds of
replacement towels each month, at 85 &UR;  &LR; cents each.
</P>
<P>
   The losses, either due to theft or members inadvertently taking
them home, have frustrated gym owners everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ablondi, director of publishing at the International Health,
Racquet &AMP; Sportsclub Association in Boston, said it's a massive
expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Fitness is a large chain, and it wouldn't surprise me in
terms of their loss,'' Ablondi said.
</P>
<P>
   Some health clubs have even taken the extraordinary steps of
asking towel manufacturers to sew magnetic devices into towels that
can trigger sensors at club exits to reduce shrinkage.
</P>
<P>
   But Ablondi said most upscale health clubs continue to provide
towels for for their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't even want to hint to their members they may be
stealing,'' Ablondi said. ``They just eat the costs rather than
raising an issue.''

 &HT;    DEFINING YEAR AS BUSH AND BOOMERS GROW UP(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was an interesting subtext in George W. Bush's acceptance
speech, a quest to define the baby-boomer generation and the
lessons it should have learned from the cultural war of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't claim that the cultural war continues, as Pat
Buchanan mistakenly did at the 1992 convention. After all, there
aren't many baby-boomer adults going around proclaiming that the
country is rotten to the core, and that drugs and licentious sex
are good.
</P>
<P>
   There remain important cultural battlefields today. But the
cultural war of the 1960s, in which many boomers comprehensively
rejected the values of their parents, is over.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are '60s cultural warriors who still regard
their experiences as noble and inspiriting. Not that they are
anxious for their sons or daughters to replicate them, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons appear to fall in this category. When Bill was
caught dissembling about his draft circumstances during the 1992
campaign, Hillary vehemently objected to a proposed statement
because she felt it equivocated about the moral high ground of
those who objected to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bush framed his acceptance speech in terms of a generational
handoff. He began with a tribute to the World War II generation,
and then said, ``The question comes to the sons and daughters of
(their) achievement. What is asked of us?''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Bill Clinton as emblematic of the boomer generation, as
indeed he is. Smart without being wise. Professing virtues he does
not practice. Engaging in destructive personal behavior while
holding himself out as morally superior to those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   In a phrase full of self-revelation, Bush said the boomer
generation needs to ``show we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave boomers credit for ``test(ing) limit'' that led to
improved conditions for women and minorities. However, he said,
``At times, we lost our way. But we're coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   He described reforming Social Security and Medicare as a
generational responsibility ``before the challenges of our time
become crises for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's generational pitch isn't programmatic; it's moral,
and ethical, and religious. As he put it, ``We know we must renew
our values to restore our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Bush is appealing to boomers to redefine who they are
by replacing Bill Clinton, the first boomer president, with
himself, the son of the last president of the World War II
generation, and a boomer who has learned the right lesson of the
cultural war: that for much of what is truly important in life, our
parents were right and we were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Whether boomers feel they need to redeem themselves from the
example of Bill Clinton as the first boomer president is uncertain
political territory. And it is uncertain how this appeal applies to
Al Gore, as opposed to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush apparently was a fringe observer during the cultural war.
He wasn't a protester, and he didn't dissemble to avoid serving.
But he did act to make the likelihood of facing combat fairly
remote. He was admittedly undirected for much of his adult life,
ultimately given focus by faith and fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Gore volunteered for military service, although reportedly more
out of a sense of duty to his father than to his country. He
reports returning from the Vietnam War, and his father's electoral
defeat, disillusioned. But he recovered quickly enough to run for
Congress as soon as the Constitution's age requirement permitted
it. And he's been a politician ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The boomers are unquestionably the most self-indulgent
generation in American history. Paradoxically, Bush is catering to
this self-indulgence by casting the election, in part, as an
opportunity for boomers to redefine themselves as having finally
grown up.

CIVIL LAWSUIT BY BET'S FORMER CFO ALLEGES CORPORATE MISSPENDING AND
TAX EVASION 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former chief financial officer for Black Entertainment
Television plans to file a lawsuit in Washington Wednesday that
includes allegations that the parent company's chairman, Robert
Johnson, and its president, Debra Lee, made extensive efforts to
evade the payment of some taxes.
</P>
<P>
   BET is a subsidiary of BET Holdings II based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations appear in a wrongful-termination suit by the
former employee, Dwight Crawford, who is seeking $21 million in
damages for financial loss and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint, made available Tuesday by the Washington law firm
of Bernabei &AMP; Katz, describes a variety of misappropriation of
corporate funds for personal use, and strategies to reduce
corporate taxes by some top-level executives.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's suit contends that corporate officers used corporate
funds and credit cards for personal purchases, and then deducted
the purchases as business expenses. In one case, the suit states,
Johnson used company funds for expenses related to his daughter's
horse show.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also contends that BET made an agreement with the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a labor union,
for production and broadcast of movies and television programs that
required hiring union staff. But rather than BET hiring union
members, the company arranged with a friend of Johnson's to create
a dummy company that would hire staff and supply them to BET as
independent contractors. That strategy, the complaint states, would
let BET ``evade liability for withholding of taxes from wages of
these employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Johnson nor Lee could be reached Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Marchant, general counsel for BET, a network with four
cable channels, said, ``The company has not yet been served with a
complaint, so we don't have official notice of the suit, and I
cannot comment.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that in knowingly deducting personal expenses
as business expenses, BET violated federal and state law. The
executives, the suit adds, also avoided paying income taxes on the
value of the goods they had acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also contends that a 1999 audit by
PricewaterhouseCoopers found that BET was planning to take an
illegal $6 million tax deduction for 1998 when it had distributed
that amount in profits to Johnson, who owns 65 percent of BET, and
Liberty Media, which owns the balance. BET falsely reported the
payment as an expenditure for salary and consulting, rather than as
a dividend, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said he could not enforce financial compliance
standards without the support of top management. And as disputes
between him and other company managers mounted, Crawford said, Lee
made it clear that his services were no longer wanted. However,
Crawford said he did not resign, despite Lee's requests, and was
dismissed in January.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Battling stormy seas and time, Russian seamen failed
twice to hook up a rescue capsule to the nuclear-powered submarine
lying broken and powerless on the floor of the Barents Sea with 116
men aboard, officials said early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With little visibility, the attempts, on Tuesday and early
Wednesday, were unable to dock with the submarine. A third attempt
was planned. But with high seas and strong underwater currents, and
with the submarine lying at an angle at a depth of 350 to 480 feet,
the chances for a rescue seemed to grow dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that there are still people alive and they are
signaling SOS,'' said the Russian navy's commander, Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov. ``Every day the chances are slimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The only communication with the submarine, the Kursk, was from
inside, from crew members tapping on the hull, Russian officials
said. There were reports that the tapping had grown fainter and
less frequent.
</P>
<P>
   During much of Tuesday, rescue efforts were hampered by winds
that reached 45 miles an hour and whipped up waves of 13 feet.
Water temperatures near the submarine hovered at 39 degrees.
Visibility under water was extremely low, as little as five feet,
the navy said.
</P>
<P>
   But the winds quieted in the night, enabling another rescue
attempt. At least two small bell-shaped rescue capsules, each able
to hold 10 to 20 people, were lowered to the scene of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules are equipped with video cameras and powerful
searchlights and are normally run by three or four people,
according to the RIA news agency. The agency said docking with the
submarine required a high degree of precision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they succeed in docking, the rescuers would probably
have to carry out exhausted and injured crewmen. Some reports said
that raising the rescue capsule, a simple chamber that hangs from a
ship, could take several hours to avoid potentially fatal
complications from decompression.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency quoted Kuroyedov as saying that if this
plan failed, the navy might try to raise the 14,000-ton submarine
with 400-ton inflatable pontoons.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts doubted that this could work, given the depth
and the enormous weight of the Kursk and the water that has entered
parts of the submarine. The experts also fear it might take too
long to attach pontoons to the submarine, given what is thought to
be the perilous state of the men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Though information about what happened remained fragmentary and
often contradictory, the Kursk was apparently damaged by an
explosion and partly flooded on Saturday during training maneuvers
of Russia's Northern Fleet. Some earlier reports said the accident
occurred on Sunday, but it now appears that the crew has been in
trouble since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk is one of Russia's newest and most modern submarines,
and the navy press office said that several high-ranking naval
officers were on board to monitor the exercise along with the
regular crew.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the outside of the submarine, navy officials
said the most likely reason for the accident was an explosion,
possibly from a torpedo carried in the front of the vessel. Russian
officials insisted that there were no nuclear weapons on board and
that the submarine's reactors were shut down. Russia has been
accused of contaminating the Barents with radiation from discarded
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two Russian vessels were reported in the region
struggling to find ways of saving their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that oxygen supplies were likely to last only
till Friday and that they had not succeeded in attaching oxygen and
fuel lines to the Kursk. They said that the only power on the
submarine was a battery, which cannot be recharged underwater,
condemning the men to a slow death of asphyxiation if they were not
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that there was no information about the plight of the
seamen and officers. Submarine experts could only speculate why the
crew was not able to release an antenna, or how much of the vessel
was flooded, or what exactly went so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials in Washington said two American
submarines had been monitoring the Russian exercise, which began
last Thursday and involved a variety of vessels and aircraft, with
test firings of missiles. The officials said it was one of the
largest exercises held by the Russians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The American submarines detected a large explosion at about 7:30
or 8 on Saturday morning, the officials said, apparently from the
Kursk. The source was not clear, but the sound was not that of a
collision, they said. American officials ruled out any collision
with an American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were skeptical of a rescue, noting that the Kursk
was resting at a 60 degree angle, making it unlikely that a rescue
craft could successfully dock.

GALAXY'S VAGENAS, CALIFF NAMED TO U.S. TEAM; VICTORINE AN
ALTERNATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sasha Victorine's reward for making key contributions during
Olympic qualification: He was left off the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy teammates Peter Vagenas and Danny Califf were named to
the 18-man roster, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to a numbers game,'' said assistant Olympic coach
John Ellinger, speaking for coach Clive Charles on a conference
call Tuesday. ``Sasha has been with the team for a while and has
played well, but with the addition of over-age players, some guys
were going to be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles told Victorine he would be an alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I'm not directly going,'' Victorine said. ``I
knew my chances had been narrowed when there was talk of bringing
in (an over-age) defensive midfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   That player turned out to be Chicago midfielder Chris Armas,
who, along with Jeff Agoos (D.C. United) and Frankie Hejduk (Bayer
Leverkusen), were the three allowable over-23 players named to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Vagenas, UCLA, is having a fine regular season with the Galaxy,
earning a starting spot after Danny Pena went down with
season-ending knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Vagenas injured his ankle in a U.S. Open Cup
match against the San Diego Flash. It turned out to be a mild
sprain and a huge relief for Vagenas, who calls the Olympics a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over and we can all finally take a deep
breath,'' Vagenas said. ``Now we can concentrate on the task at
hand, which is our club team, then get ready for the Olympics later
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Califf, a likely MLS rookie of the year candidate, will be
sorely missed during the first-round of the MLS playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge relief to know for sure,'' Califf said. ``If they
had brought in a center back, I would have been the one not going.
We've been champing at the bit waiting, but now I'm just honored to
be going.''
</P>
<P>
   Vagenas and Califf will miss the final two Galaxy regular-season
games and at least the first round of the MLS playoffs to join the
Olympic team.
</P>

 MOSCOW: successfully dock. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although American and other NATO navies offered to help, Russia
initially refused the offers, and in any case it was not
immediately clear what they could do.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Russian military officers met at NATO headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, on Tuesday night to see if there was anything
the Western alliance could provide. A NATO official said the
Russians discussed technical details in a telephone conference with
naval experts in Northwood, England, where NATO has its naval
headquarters for the eastern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication whether the discussions led to
any concrete action. The British and American navies have various
underwater rescue craft, and Norway and Germany have extensive
undersea oil exploring experience, but it was not clear whether any
Western vessel could link up to the Kursk's hatches.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen sent a letter to the Russian
defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, offering ``any assistance you
need.'' There was no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, a spokesman for the U.S. Navy, said
the Navy had informed other countries in the past of the dimensions
of escape hatches that would be compatible with American rescue
capsules. But he did not know whether the Russians had adopted
those standards.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Quigley said the 60-degree list of the Kursk put it
``beyond the design parameters of the U.S. deep submergence rescue
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle A.H. Trost, a retired admiral who was formerly chief of
naval operations, said that even if the Kursk had a fully charged
battery when it went down, the power would probably last only two
or three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere must be fouling very rapidly,'' said Trost, who
once commanded a nuclear-powered submarine. And ``lights last only
a very limited time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the trapped seamen dominated Russian news. On one
radio call-in show, a former professor demanded to know what could
be done to persuade the authorities to seek outside help: ``What
signs to we need to draw, to whom must we appeal to get them to
accept help?''
</P>
<P>
   At least six seamen from the southeastern Russian city of Kursk,
for which the submarine was named, were on board. One, Dima
Staroseltsev, 20, had finished a training course in June and wrote
home to say he was happy to be leaving for sea, his mother said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``His last letter was so joyful,'' the mother, Valentina
Staroseltseva, said. ``He said, mama, there's a great crew on board
here, a bunch of guys from Kursk. We're like one big family.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine's commander, Gennadi Lyachin, 45, has served in
the Northern Fleet since 1978, according to Russian news reports.
The navy refused to give any details about the rest of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The crew's plight horrified Russians. ``They are sitting and
waiting,'' said Aleksandr Nikitin, an environmental activist who
once was an engineer on a nuclear submarine. ``This accident
sketches a pretty accurate picture of the state of the navy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of concrete information, experts said it was not
possible to say how long the men could go on. They could slowly run
out of oxygen, succumbing to mental dullness and possibly
convulsions before sinking into a comas and dying.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a buildup of carbon dioxide, the brain would
gradually stop functioning, the men would slip into unconsciousness
and their hearts would weaken and stop. Or, if the electrical
system had failed, they could freeze to death. Or they could perish
from a lethal buildup of nitrogen, sulfides and toxic gases.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: BUSH AND GORE BOTH SEEK VOTES WITH SALSA 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDRES MARTINEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Still exulting in President Clinton's performance,
delegates and party faithful celebrated on Monday night at the
Latino Committee 2000's block party in downtown Los Angeles,
featuring the queen of salsa, Celia Cruz. The bash felt like a
neighborly small-town festival, to the extent that an event brought
to you by AT&AMP;T, SBC Communications and Verizon _ to mention only
the phone companies chipping in _ can manage to feel neighborly.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is wooing the Hispanic vote for the same
reason Gov. George W. Bush has gone bilingual on the campaign
trail. Indeed, if America were a corporation, Wall Street would be
crying for a spinoff of its Hispanic subsidiary, its hottest growth
prospect. Over the next 30 years, Hispanics, now 12 percent of the
population of the United States, will account for 47 percent of its
growth, according to Census projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latino vote will be increasingly crucial,'' said Gloria
Molina, chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors,
``and both parties will have to pay attention to Latino issues.''
But then Molina added a caveat that bedevils all political
strategists seeking to capitalize on the demographic boomlet: ``Our
issues are essentially all-American issues like education, housing
and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rodriguez, a Los Angeles-based fellow with the New
America Foundation, calls the Latino community in the United States
``the least ethnocentric group of voters.'' Polls consistently
show, for instance, that immigration does not rank high among
Hispanics' leading concerns. He also believes that the Latino
community, which at 32 million is now larger than the population of
Canada, is too heterogeneous to be counted on as a monolithic
voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   It encompasses Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, Puerto Ricans
in New York, and Cubans in Miami. Among the latter, Bush leads Vice
President Al Gore by more than 50 points in recent polls. Among all
Hispanics, Bush's convention in Philadelphia, a veritable diversity
feast, cut the vice president's lead from 34 to 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   But while it is not easy to generalize about what Latinos as a
whole stand for today, polls do point to some general trends.
Hispanics are more likely than the population as a whole to believe
in an activist, compassionate government, and while their standard
of living lags behind that of other demographic groups, they
consistently have the most optimistic views about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics also tend to be more socially conservative, which is
one more reason that Democratic Party officials were incensed at
Rep. Loretta Sanchez's decision to play host at a fund-raiser at
the Playboy mansion this week. Public Policy Institute of
California surveys show that only 42 percent of the state's
Hispanics favor an unrestricted right to abortion, compared with 67
percent of non-Hispanic whites. Separate surveys show that
Hispanics favor school vouchers by a wide margin, and they were the
staunchest supporters of California's Proposition 22, a pre-emptive
strike against any move to recognize gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the former Republican governor Pete Wilson's strident
anti-immigrant rhetoric all the more baffling. Wilson won 44
percent of the Hispanic vote in 1990 before he and his party
embarked on their suicidal mission of alienating Hispanics. In
1998, their share had dropped to 17 percent. ``We really miss
Wilson,'' said Mary Rose Ortega, a hometown delegate and California
director of the National Education Association, reveling at
Monday's block party. ``I know many people who had previously not
been involved in politics who became citizens simply to vote
against the Republicans after Proposition 187,'' she said,
referring to the California voter initiative that deprived illegal
immigrants of public services. Like many Hispanics here, Ortega was
most offended by the tone of the debate at the time, not the
measure's specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Democrats, however, they will face not Pete
Wilson but George W. Bush in November. Bush could not have adopted
a more different tone than Wilson towards his state's immigrant
population. When he ran for re-election in 1998, his share of the
Hispanic vote was more than twice as large as his party's share in
California that year.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the question troubling Democratic Hispanic
officeholders in Los Angeles: Will Bush be able to replicate this
success nationwide? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' said Mayor Carlos Ramirez of El Paso, in a
telephone interview. Elected as a Democrat, Ramirez opted to miss
out on all the fun in Los Angeles and instead go to Philadelphia to
nominate Bush, whom he calls an ``inclusive, moral leader.'' He
says the governor's education policies have proven especially
beneficial to Hispanics. He also believes Democrats have fallen
short on traditional family values that Hispanics hold dear, by
going too far on issues like gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, the Los Angeles County supervisor, concedes that if
Gore's campaign does not make a passionate pitch to the Latino
voter, Bush could make serious inroads, and win as much as 35
percent of the Latino vote in California. ``I think,'' she said,
``there is a real danger that the Democratic Party will take our
vote for granted.''  &QL;

CITY REMAINS A RIDDLE FOR DNC DELEGATES
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A delegate from Connecticut thinks The Big One is
a wave. Another out-of-stater guessed that Staples Center is home
to the Yankees. And the only thing some Democratic National
Convention delegates seem to know about the San Fernando Valley is
-- omigod! -- the Valley girls live there.
</P>
<P>
   In the style of L.A.'s own Jay Leno, the Daily News cruised the
convention hall Tuesday quizzing delegates from across the nation
about their host city. There were no lifelines. No one won a
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And let's just say the delegates were, well, good sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a John Riordan, but not a Dick Riordan,'' said delegate
Mike Teefy of Vancouver, Wash., when shown the Los Angeles mayor's
name and asked to identify him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the Capital City of the 21st Century -- the DNC
host committee's adopted nickname for Los Angeles -- Brown Miller
of Hattiesburg, Miss., guessed: ``I'm not sure on this one; I'll
say Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   New York delegate Barbara Jackson didn't hesitate. ``It's New
York, without a doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of delegates, from Alaska to Florida, knew that The
Big One is the much-dreaded, long-predicted massive earthquake in
Southern California. Others didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Shaq,'' said Nick Blondin, who was trying to help his
mother, Connecticut delegate Audrey Blondin. But his mom had her
own idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big wave,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates were equally puzzled when asked to name two of the
four professional sports teams that play in Staples Center, the
sparkling new arena they were standing inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers? The Yankees?'' asked Emma Edwards of South
Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Mississippi delegate, got it half right. ``The
Lakers, and I think you have a professional women's basketball
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Lakers share Staples with the Clippers,
arena football's Avengers and hockey's Kings. The professional
women's basketball team -- the Sparks -- plays at the Forum in
Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   Other Los Angeles trivia questions baffled the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, the Yankees fan, pondered what a SigAlert might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that a Hollywood star that's making some kind of fashion
faux pas?'' she wondered.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Carter of Anchorage, Alaska, figured it was ``somebody
smoking a cigarette when they aren't supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Correct answer: A freeway tie-up in which one or more lanes will
be blocked for at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Teefy tried to remember exactly where the San Fernando Valley
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that where all the Valley girls are from?'' Teefy asked.
``I just assumed it's a Valley outside of L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Valley is still a part of the L.A. family, but is
talking separation.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News also asked delegates a nontrivia question: What
was their perception of Los Angeles before the convention?
</P>
<P>
   ``Floods, earthquakes and riots,'' said Travis Souza, of Reno,
Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers,'' Teefy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Damn, I have to go to this horrible place,' ''
Edwards said. ``But at least I have relatives there so I can kill
two birds with one stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Blondin, of Connecticut, said she had a strong opinion of the
city before she arrived for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people here.''
</P>
<P>
   And after?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people here.''

JUDGE ORDERS MAN DEPORTED FOR SERVING AS NAZI GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBRA WEST   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An 85-year-old Rockland County man faces deportation
for having served as an armed guard in a concentration camp where
42,000 Jews and other prisoners were tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. immigration judge in Manhattan ruled on Monday that
Michael Gruber, a retired auto mechanic who lives in New City,
concealed his Nazi past on his immigration application more than 40
years ago and should be deported to Austria, where he holds
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber's lawyer, Robert A. Murtha, said he planned to appeal.
``I was very unhappy with the decision,'' Murtha said. ``For one,
the client was too sick to cooperate in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   During the yearlong legal proceedings, Gruber admitted that he
served as a Waffen SS guard during World War II, but denied that he
had served inside the Sachsenshausen concentration camp or that he
had participated in the murder and torture there.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert D. Weisel, however, wrote that Nazi records
gathered by the government proved beyond a doubt that Gruber had
served at the camp from January 1943 to September 1944. Service in
a concentration camp is a legal basis for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was part of the machinery of brutalization and annihilation
at the Sachsenshausen concentration camp,'' said Eli M. Rosenbaum,
director of the Office of Special Investigations, the Justice
Department unit that tracks down and prosecutes Nazi war criminals.
``The job of all of the guards there was to enforce this regime of
ghastly persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, who is being treated for kidney cancer, was an auto
mechanic at Volkswagen in Queens until he retired in 1979. He lived
a quiet life in Rockland County with his wife of 65 years in New
City until news of his Nazi past spread, Murtha said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Investigation first contacted Gruber six
years ago, Murtha said. Gruber, who was born in Croatia, admitted
from the beginning that he had served in the elite armed guard
unit. He said that he had been drafted into the SS in 1942. Gruber
also admitted that he had served in the region around
Sachsenshausen, but said that he had guarded prisoners at the train
station, not the concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha argued in court that no direct evidence proved that
Gruber had participated in any persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argued that without evidence of direct participation in any
acts of persecution, that he was not deportable,'' Murtha said.
``The judge disagreed. That will be the basis of the appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In harsh language, the judge wrote that concentration camp
guards ``shall be consigned until the end of human history as the
ultimate in the personification of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Special Investigations seeks out Nazi criminals
who have hid their wartime activities and prosecutes them for
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has this conception that survivors recognize someone
on the street and that starts the investigation'' Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rosenbaum said, his department gathers information on
70,000 Nazis and Nazi collaborators from archives throughout Europe
and then compares the records with U.S. immigration records. The
office, which was formed in 1979, has had 53 people deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is like virtually all of the others, `` Rosenbaum
said. ``It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.''

SPARKS, COMETS GEAR FOR SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It may be called the Western Conference
Finals, but it is widely believed the matchup between the Sparks
and the three-time defending champion Houston Comets is the
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks and Comets finished the regular season with the best
records in the 32-game season, losing a combined nine games _ fewer
than any (ital)single(endital) team. The two teams were 21-1 _ New
York beat Houston _ against Eastern Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it at the beginning of the year and I still believe it
now, Houston is the team to beat,'' said Sacramento Monarchs coach
Sonny Allen after his team was eliminated by the Comets 75-70 on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets have run this league from the beginning, and the only
team that appears ready to unseat them is the Sparks, who are 3-0
against Houston this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is like a preview of the finals,'' Houston guard
Janeth Arcain said. ``I think whoever loses or wins Thursday will
be the champs of the WNBA. Because both teams, Houston and L.A.,
have played so good all season, I think both teams could be the
champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that the road to the championship would go through
Houston. The dynamics of the team has changed somewhat with Sheryl
Swoopes raising her game to take the attention away from Cynthia
Cooper. But that's nothing new. This team has dealt with negative
energy in the locker between the two since the league's inception
and it hasn't interfered with the Comets winning three consecutive
WNBA titles. Cooper added to the animosity when she announced her
retirement at midseason and failed to tell the coaches or her
teammates beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who swept Phoenix in the first round, have the edge
with a bench that Houston lacks. Not that the Comets have needed
one, at least until now.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sparks have the home-court advantage in this
best-of-three series, Game 1 on Thursday is in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the biggest game of both of our seasons thus
far,'' Sparks center Lisa Leslie said. ``It's very important who
wins the first game, I think. Obviously we're looking to steal one,
and they're looking to get a win at home since they're going to be
back here on the road for two games. I think it's going to be a
great game, very intense. We're looking forward to it.'' &QL;

CLEANING WOMAN ACCUSED OF CALLING PSYCHIC LINES ON EMPLOYER'S
PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By COREY KILGANNON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, N.Y. _ A cleaning woman who was upset about breaking up
with her boyfriend made $6,131 worth of phone calls to psychic hot
lines from an employer's home here, police said. She got plenty of
relationship advice, they said, but no warning that she would soon
be behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the joke around here this week,'' said Detective
Gerald Locascio of the Kent Police Department. ``We asked her if
the psychics told her we'd catch her, and she said no, but that she
had a feeling we would.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Patricia Ann Garofalo, 39, was charged Tuesday with
two counts of fourth-degree grand larceny in the Town of Kent
Justice Court. Police said she used her employer's telephone and
credit card numbers to make the calls over the last several months.
She is being held in the Putnam County jail in Carmel with bail set
at $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The employer, Margaret Hutcoe, 52, hired Garofalo last fall to
clean her small two-story house in Carmel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, MCI Worldcom cut off Hutcoe's long-distance service,
saying she owed about $1,000, mostly from calls made to psychic hot
lines. ``I told them I live by myself and I've never called a
psychic hot line, nor would I,'' she said Tuesday. ``It's just
ridiculous. I have three big dogs, and I know they're not calling
psychic hot lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she found that more than $4,700 worth of calls had been
made over a two-month period on a second phone line that she had
had installed in May for her computer but had not yet used.
Apparently, Garofalo had plugged a phone into that line and had
been intercepting the bill for it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, Hutcoe said, her stepmother called saying similar
calls had been charged to her credit card number, which Hutcoe had
recently used and left scribbled on a notepad in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcoe called detectives, who obtained phone and credit card
records that showed calls being made from her home during
Garofalo's regular cleaning visits, when Hutcoe was at work.
Garofalo was arrested on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Locascio said that Garofalo called many hot lines, including
Eclipse Psychic, which offers insights from a clairvoyant for $4.59
per minute, and the Voice of Astrology, which offers personal
astrology consultations by phone, costing $95 for 30 minutes, and
weekly chart readings for $249 per month.
</P>
<P>
   He said Garofalo told him she started calling the hot lines
after her boyfriend broke up with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to feel bad for her,'' he said. ``She was in rough
shape and looking for some guidance. She had just gone through a
breakup and was living with clients and friends, in her car and in
a tent at the campgrounds. She needed a lot of advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective said he was still investigating whether Garofalo
used other employers' telephones for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Prince, a spokeswoman for MCI Worldcom, said decisions
about how customers settle fraudulent bills are determined only
after investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Hutcoe said she hired Garofalo last fall after calling a phone
book listing for her business, Dust Bunnies. She had had difficulty
finding a cleaning woman, Hutcoe added. The few she had already
interviewed declined after seeing her dogs, two boxers and a pit
bull.
</P>
<P>
   But Garofalo agreed, and charged $40 per cleaning visit every
two weeks. Hutcoe said she never checked Garofalo's references
before giving her a house key. They talked regularly, and when
Garofalo was moving recently, Hutcoe agreed to let her stay in a
guest room for three days, she said, ``but then it became five, six
days, and I told her `That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hutcoe said she learned an important lesson: ``There's
definitely something to be said for cleaning one's own house.''

DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HIGHLIGHTS GOP DIFFERENCES ON GAY AND
ABORTION RIGHTS &HT;    By JUDY HOLLAND
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Rep. Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay
Republican House member, spoke at his party's national convention
in Philadelphia this month, he caused a stir among a dozen or so
delegates. They showed their disapproval of his sexual orientation
by removing their hats, bowing their heads and praying for his
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Democrats are parading six avowed homosexuals
before the cameras at their national convention here this week to
show that they welcome homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year when the distinctions between Republicans
and Democrats on such issues as education, race relations and
health care are fuzzy, the two parties have starkly contrasting
positions on gay and abortion rights. On Tuesday, the Democrats
sought to highlight those differences.
</P>
<P>
   They gave a prime-time speaking slot to Elizabeth Birch, a
lesbian mother of twins and president of the Human Rights Campaign,
the nation's largest gay and lesbian political group.
</P>
<P>
   Birch delivered an impassioned plea for equality for and broader
acceptance of homosexuals as many delegates waved placards saying
``Gays for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We seek simple equality _ the equal right to work, raise a
family, serve our country in every way and be free from the
shackles of brutality and hate,'' she said, citing the murder of
21-year-old Matthew Shepard, who in October 1998 was pistol-whipped
and hung on a fence to die near Laramie, Wyo. because of his sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we dedicate ourselves to healing the fractures _
soothing the wounds _ to making our American family truly whole,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Birch also addressed parents who have not been able to accept
their homosexual children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know that your gay children are gifted and
strong,'' she said. ``All are heroic in the way they have conquered
barriers to their own self respect. Many have suffered cruelty or
violence. Some serve their communities with leadership and grace.
Many are rich in faith, and have a deep love for this nation and
democracy. Tens of thousands have served with distinction in the
armed services. Many have lost their lives. ''
</P>
<P>
   She also praised Vice President Al Gore's ``forward thinking
leadership'' on gay issues and cited his support for legislation
that would ban job discrimination based on sexual orientation and
for ending the ban against gay and lesbian military service members
revealing their sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Birch called the Republican platform ``shameful'' and charged
that GOP candidates George W. Bush and Richard Cheney ``forego
invective but embrace indifference and call it compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Democratic Party positions, the Republican
platform opposes the current ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' policy for gays in the miltary, saying they should not be
able to serve at all, and says federal anti-bias laws should not be
extended to include gays.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., the first successful candidate for
Congress to campaign as an avowed homosexual, also spoke Tuesday,
calling for better health insurance for the grandmother she cares
for. She did not mention her own sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   One of 200 openly gay delegates among 4,368 at the convention
here, Baldwin said afterward that the Democratic officials'
invitation for her to speak shows that the party is inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Owens, a lesbian and a San Francisco School Board member
and candidate for the city's Board of Supervisors, stood on the
podium and praised the efforts of Gore and the party to make it
illegal to discriminate against gay workers. ``When Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman occupy the White House, they will put an end to unfair,
unproductive and un-American persecution in the workplace,'' Owens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other avowed homosexuals schedueled to speak this week are Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., Andrew Tobias, national treasurer for the
Democratic National Committee and Gloria Nicto, a Democratic
committeewoman at-large from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   David Elliot, spokesman for the National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force in Washington, called the speaking invitations to gays ``a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more visible than we've ever been before,'' Elliot
said.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion rights, the Democrats invited Kate Michelman,
president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, to speak after Birch.
</P>
<P>
   Mkichelman warned that the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling
that legalized abortion could be overturned if Bush is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman's right to choose took a century to win,'' she said.
``But it could be lost in only one day _ Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Today, that freedom hangs in the balance of a
closely divided court. If he has the opportunity, George W. Bush
will appoint enough Supreme Court justices to overturn Roe v. Wade
and end legal abortion. At every opportunity, Governor Bush has
made clear his intent to restrict a woman's right to choose. He is
one of the nation's most anti-choice governors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has consistently opposed abortion. But in the past he
favored allowing abortion in cases of rape, incest or where the
health of the mother is at risk. Yet this year he supported
retaining the Republican Party platform language calling for a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The Republican platform
makes no mention of the exceptions that Bush had previously
supported.

ONE CAN'T IGNORE X GAMES ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's admit it, maybe we're missing something. You know who you
are. All of you weaned on the three Big Sports. Who think a trip
down the sports wild side is watching ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Something else is going on here. Something that is catching on
and not going away. Yes, it has a different beat. OK, its athletes
do not exactly resemble Jerry West or Sandy Koufax. And the sports
are just so ... (ital) something.(endital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is flying through the air, flipping around and
landing,'' says Tas Pappas, a skateboarder originally from
Australia now in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they make their run, it's some pretty crazy-looking stuff.
And when they don't make their stuff, they go down pretty hard and
there's always a good chance of a major slam _ or seeing one of the
craziest tricks you've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Relax, and go with it. This weekend the fifth annual X Games
take place in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be intimidated. Remember when different was supposed to
be good? So you don't know hip-hop from be-bop.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't fit the traditional sports mold, that's the whole
point. It's sports for the thrill of it. What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said Rick Thorne, a bicycle stunt rider from
Orange. ``That's the whole reason everyone starts doing it _ it's
fun. You have individualism in the sports. It's kind of like an
expression in a competitive form.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports are marked by aggression. These are not sports
for the athletically timid. If there's no danger, there's no
appeal. It's partly like NASCAR _ everyone privately waiting for
the next crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that they're so gnarly,'' Pappas said. ``It's not like
running around in team sports.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas also has a rock band called ``Gudanunkas,'' which he
maintains, doesn't mean a thing. ``I made it up,'' he said. ``It
means whatever you think.''
</P>
<P>
   I sense your resistance, all ye fellow boomers and AYSO
veterans. These are the baggy-pants kids we used to chase out of
malls.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Wienert knows all your reservations. He's 55 years old.
He's the X Games executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I was seven years ago when I first started this
project,'' Wienert said. ``I went, 'Holy, smoke. What is this all
about? Are these sports? Are these athletes?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned very quickly that they are definitely athletes. They
are absolutely fabulous young men and women who do extraordinary
things that take a lot of courage and a lot of skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually have an event that represents the playgrounds and
softball diamonds of the 21st century. The kids today are probably
a lot smarter and need to be challenged a little more as
individuals as we did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my era, we grew up with team sports. For a variety of both
social and maybe economic reasons, these kids have to find a way to
challenge themselves in some type of activity. If it's a physical
activity, it's leaning more towards bikes, blades and boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Which appeal greatly to the young, particularly the male
variety. Last year's X Games broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC were
viewed by 5.9 million teens from ages 12-17 _ that's 27 percent of
all teen-agers in the United States. It was watched by 4.2 million
males 12-17 _ 37 percent of male teen-agers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris Poll released last January reported that the X Games
were the second-most popular sporting event in the country for
those ages 6-17, trailing only the Olympics _ and ahead of the
Super Bowl, World Series and World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And what appeals to the young appeals greatly to advertisers
desperate for a vehicle to reach a new generation. Thus, when ESPN
created the X Games, it tapped into something that's proven
explosive.
</P>
<P>
   So there are sports with in-line skating, bike riding on ramps,
motocross stunts, skateboarding, wall climbing, street luge,
wakeboarding and something called skysurfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a cross between the music industry and the sports
industry,'' said Thorne, who also hosts the ``X2day'' show on
ESPN2. ``Kids grow up and don't want to play soccer anymore because
you don't have any individualism in soccer, unless you're Pele. You
wear the team jersey, look like the guy next to you, you work on
these plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that in these sports. There's no one telling you
what to do or what to wear or how to be. That's the beauty of it.
It's like it's freedom in a sense. It's like you're painting a
picture, but the ramp is your canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still doubtful?
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way, how many times have you complained about
the high price of tickets at a major sporting event? The X Games
are free. They drew almost 270,000 during a six-day stint in San
Francisco last year.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you moaned about egomaniac players,
cutthroat competition and outlandish salaries?
</P>
<P>
   Extreme sports stars compete, but they help each other. Each
sport is almost its own self-supporting community. And most
athletes make comparatively modest incomes and only started
supporting themselves with their sport since ESPN came on the
scene. Egos remain in check, not out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it happening in my time,'' said Dave Mirra, a bike
stunt rider and the X Games' most decorated athlete with eight
golds. ``Fifteen years from now, you never know. But we're from
regular families. I just think riding a bike and skate boarding,
it's just come-from-the-ground-level stuff. You do it all around
the streets. I don't see it happening.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's Mirra, however, is the exception to the income
level among X-sport athletes. He said 90 percent of his income will
come from endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I'll clear $700,000,'' he said. ``I wouldn't trade
places with anybody. I think this year, realistically I'll make
seven digits. That's pretty crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, their world is changing. Thorne said he worked for seven
years busing tables at an Olive Garden restaurant in Kansas City
before he was able to support himself. But he said any extreme
athlete who starts to get full of himself is quickly put in his
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ride a bike, dude,'' Thorne said. ``If you're going to
have a lame attitude, if you're going to be pompous because you're
pro and making money and a cool guy, you're still a dork. Man, slow
down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   X Gamers are supposed to be rebels, anyway. They might be
against structure but more often might seem to be going the James
Dean route.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends, their home life wasn't `Leave it to
Beaver,' you know what I mean?'' Thorne said. ``We were definitely
on the rebellious side, but I think we just sort of fell into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't accepted in high school. We had a group of guys
called the BMX Brigade. Back then you had the stoners, the jocks,
and that was it. You either played football or you were a stoner,
and I didn't want to do either. People didn't like us for who we
were, and it kind of made us more rebellious then we intended to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   This rebel now supports himself with his own action figure,
trading cards and video. Mirra has a contract with Adidas and
signature sunglasses and a bike. They might not be going
mainstream, but they're not always fighting the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is real,'' Wienert said. ``The biggest thing we
have to do is not ruin it by overcreating rules and regulations. We
recognize almost all these athletes as being independent, and
loving their sport more than individual acclamation.'' &QL;

FEINSTEIN SAYS CALIFORNIA KEY FOR GORE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Worried that Democrats could be taking California
for granted, Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday said Vice President
Al Gore could lose the state without an all-out effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course &UR; , &LR;  he could lose,'' Feinstein said at a breakfast
with California political reporters. ``This state has become used
to the attention given it by Bill Clinton and it will want to see
the same from Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am of the belief that you cannot win the election if you
don't win California and the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she has not discussed the matter with the Gore
campaign, but believes he will visit California frequently during
his campaign. As vice president, Gore visited the Golden State more
than 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be won or lost depending on how California
goes,'' Feinstein said. ``If we take this election for granted, we
will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was the first to recognize the value of the
state in his 1992 campaign, with Democrats winning it for the first
time since 1964. Since Clinton's election, California Democrats
have been on an upswing, now holding all but one statewide
constitutional office.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein is also up for re-election this year, facing a
challenge from Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Campbell. Polls show her
comfortably ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   She has campaigned on her record on favoring abortion rights --
an issue she said she considers one of the major ones in this
election -- as well as her support for stronger gun control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, she said it is one of the defining issues between
Gore and Republican nominee George W. Bush and one she fears that
no longer motivates many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, I remember how bad it was before abortion was
legal,'' Feinstein said of her days serving on the California
Parole Board. ``I had to sentence abortionists and I remember the
horror of back-alley abortions and the morbidity and mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of women take it for granted on the right to
have an abortion. But it's only one vote away on the Supreme Court.
I don't want to see a return to those old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also talked of her desire to one day see a woman
elected president, saying she was sorry former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole dropped out early in the Republican
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to see her go the distance,'' Feinstein
said. ``At some point, we have to pierce that barrier. Women can be
a potent force in this country and can decide elections.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Feinstein had been mentioned as a potential Gore
running mate, but she said she had never been directly contacted
and would have had no interest in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know Al Gore that well and I'm running for
re-election,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would be interested in such a job in the future or
running for president, she replied: ``I'm keeping my options
open.''

<P>
   ``I think a lot of women take it for granted on the right to
have an abortion. But it's only one vote away on the Supreme Court.
I don't want to see a return to those old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also talked of her desire to one day see a woman
elected president, saying she was sorry former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole dropped out early in the Republican
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to see her go the distance,'' Feinstein
said. ``At some point, we have to pierce that barrier. Women can be
a potent force in this country and can decide elections.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Feinstein had been mentioned as a potential Gore
running mate, but she said she had never been directly contacted
and would have had no interest in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know Al Gore that well and I'm running for
re-election,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she would be interested in such a job in the future or
running for president, she replied: ``I'm keeping my options
open.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He calls it ``my new life,'' a life of arriving at
airports after midnight and finding 25 reporters waiting, of being
whisked about in motorcades as if lifted on a magic carpet, of
carrying the full measure of expectation that comes from being the
first Jew to be a presidential running mate of a major party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is as if you've been touched, called,'' Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut said Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago he and his wife, Hadassah, awoke to reports that
he had been chosen as Vice President Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Lieberman said, the notion comes as a sort of surreal
surprise, one that seemed beyond reach. And yet Thursday night,
Lieberman will stand before the nation and deliver the most
important speech of his life, one, he said, that he hopes a
lifetime in politics has prepared him for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the scope is obviously enormously larger, in many ways
my 30 years of public life have prepared me for this moment,'' he
said. ``I don't mean that anyone is ever fully prepared, but I feel
as if all the experiences, all that I've learned are coming
together, are being tested, and frankly I find it exhilarating. ''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, when he walked to the convention podium for a
brief rehearsal, he grinned broadly and spread his arms, as if
eager to embrace this strange new life. ``An only-in-America
moment,'' he said to a group of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday evening, Lieberman, 58, conveyed a sense
of easy anticipation as he relaxed in an easy chair next to an
untouched tray of tomatoes and black olives.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that he would use his address to foreshadow the
various roles he intended to fulfill in the campaign. But his first
task, he said, will be to introduce himself to the American public,
``who I am, what my values are.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that while he would not hesitate to ``respectfully''
point out differences with the Republican Party, he would not play
attack dog, the traditional role of the running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Al about this, and we're very intent on talking
about progress, not partisanship,'' he said. ``This is not going to
be a campaign of personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney ``decent and
likable people,'' who nonetheless represent ``a step backward for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he would seek to turn his campaign into ``a
conversation with the American people,'' one that emphasizes what
is at stake in the years ahead. ``The choices here are very
clear,'' he said. ``And these choices I think will significantly
affect the future of the people of this country. Government doesn't
do it all, but government sets a tone, sets a direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would help Gore reach for the political center by
talking about values and his faith, and said he would try to
neutralize years of White House scandal by vouching for Gore's
character. And, perhaps most difficult of all, he said he would try
to redirect his party's enthusiasm for Clinton toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, though, is just now discovering how difficult it can
be to stay focused on those roles. In forging a reputation as a
centrist Democrat, he has taken positions and made statements that
are unpopular among the party's more liberal members. Tuesday, for
example, he found himself defending his views on affirmative action
and school vouchers to several hundred members of the Democratic
National Committee's black caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Senate colleagues have been known to grumble about his
occasional flashes of self-righteousness. Tuesday, he blamed
inaccurate news coverage and Republicans for blowing minor policy
differences out of proportion. ``Don't let the press or our
opponents divide us,'' he told a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the criticisms had been raised _ and raised loudly _
by members of the black caucus. ``I and others raised the
questions,'' Rep. Maxine Waters of California said.

FOR RUSSIAN NAVY, A SAD RECORD OF DISASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Soviet Navy sent a powerful submarine to sea in the late
1980s, determined to strike some fear into the American Navy.
</P>
<P>
   But barely before the sub, the Komsomolets, could accomplish
anything, a fire burst out underwater. Some crew members escaped
after the sub fought its way to the surface of the Norwegian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But five men stayed inside and decided to trust their lives to a
rescue capsule built onto the top of the sub. That turned out to be
a deadly mistake. The crew had not been taught how to release the
capsule. And once inside, they desperately tried to read the
directions by holding a battle lamp over the instruction plaque.
The chamber jammed and did not release until the sub fell back to
the bottom of the sea. Only one of the five men survived.
</P>
<P>
   This disaster illustrates the long series of problems that have
plagued the Russian navy, the latest casualty being the the Kursk,
whose crew is lying at the bottom of the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses in technology, haphazard workmanship and a lot of bad
luck kept the Russian navy from being as powerful as it often
seemed to be, even during its glory days in the Cold War. And
though the Russians have proven to need rescue devices more than
any other nation with a submarine force, even their best equipment
has rarely worked.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an attitude toward crew safety that often
seemed callous to Westerners. The Izvestia newspaper recently
reported that 507 crew members have died during the 40 years that
the Russians have had nuclear-powered subs.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian officials insist they have done all they can for
their men, the true scope of the failures has become public only in
recent years, as the Russian news media has dug more aggressively
into areas that long were matters of state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers have proven to be occasions for great heroism. But
critics say that with severe budget cuts in recent years, the
problems have only grown worse.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Kursk accident, Peter Huchthausen, a former
U.S. naval intelligence official, said: ``I'm surprised it hadn't
happened earlier. This whole navy is an accident waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, many of the hazards developed out of
the intense pressure from political leaders to catch up with the
U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   After the United States launched the first nuclear-powered
submarine, the Nautilus, in the mid-1950s, the Soviets hurried to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Chernavin, a former commander in chief of the Soviet
navy, once said that as a young commander in 1959, he refused to
take one of the first Soviet nuclear subs out for sea trials
because of its poor condition.
</P>
<P>
   Russian sailors say that another nuclear-powered submarine,
K-19, had already gone to sea, despite a bad omen. At its
christening, the bottle of champagne failed to break.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, the K-19 was in the Norwegian Sea when its radiation
detection equipment came to life. A reactor shut down. But the fuel
rods continued to heat, and shot past 1,000 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account in Soviet Soldier magazine in 1991, nine
brave men volunteered to step into the highly radioactive reactor
compartment, climbing inside what they called ``the Boa's Mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   They remained there for two hours, each receiving 100 times the
lethal dose of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Then one last man, Ivan Kulakov, a 22-year-old chief petty
officer, rushed in after them, completing a jury-rig of the cooling
system to bring the temperature down and save the sub.
</P>
<P>
   The nine men died within weeks of radiation poisoning. But
Kulakov, who recounted the story to the magazine, survived,
crippled by terrible burns. The tragedy was so gruesome that Soviet
sailors gave the K-19 a gruesome nickname: ``Hiroshima.``
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, such a disaster would have marked the end
of the K-19's life. But the Soviets cleaned it up and eventually
sent it back to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Its luck, however, never changed. In 1969, it collided with a
U.S. submarine that was on a reconnaissance mission off the coast
of the Soviet Union. And in 1972, a fire broke out on the sub and
killed 26 crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Kursk, a total of four Russian subs sank, and many
others have been damaged in reactor accidents, fires and explosions
among the weapons they carried.
</P>
<P>
   Another accident occurred in 1986, when a Soviet Yankee-class
missile submarine, the K-219, had an explosion in one of its
missile silos while on patrol in the Atlantic, about 1,200 miles
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Two men died from the blast, including the missile officer.
</P>
<P>
   As recounted in the 1997 book, ``Hostile Waters,'' written by
Huchthausen and two other men, including a former Soviet submarine
officer, the sub clawed its way back to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   It had lost use of the remote controls for the reactors, and
when the reactors began to overheat, two men had to go inside the
shielded compartment to crank down the rods by hand. One man
collapsed within 20 minutes and was evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergei Preminin, a 20-year-old sailor, stayed amid the
radiation to shut down the last reactor and prevent a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the Russians have kept their subs close to home
since the Cold War ended, problems persist, often because of poor
maintenance and training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alarmingly, their submarine safety record has not improved
much in spite of years of operational experience,'' said Joshua
Handler, a former researcher for the environmental group
Greenpeace, who is now writing a dissertation at Princeton on
Russian nuclear hazards.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say the Russians have failed to maintain some
of their most sophisticated rescue equipment, leaving the fate of
the Kursk sailors to some of the oldest devices around.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Terrible Hours,'' a book published last year, Peter
Maas recounted how an American Navy officer, Charles Momsen,
pioneered the use of a diving bell and helped rescue more than 30
men from a downed submarine in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Under this design, a large bell-shaped vessel is lowered from a
surface ship and hooks into the hatch on a sunken submarine. The
men then climb into the bell, and it serves as a rescue elevator as
the mother ship slowly lifts it back to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in their latest crisis, the Russians essentially are trying
to duplicate what Momsen did 61 years ago. But they also are trying
to do it in waters that are twice as deep and far more treacherous,
and with time running short.

CLINTON EXTOLS GORE IN SYMBOLIC `PASSING OF THE TORCH'

<P>
   MONROE, Mich. _ With a bear hug and a slight nudge, President
Clinton pushed his understudy, Al Gore, to center stage Tuesday,
relinquishing the limelight to the man he hopes will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a metaphoric ceremony that the vice president has longed
for as Clinton has effortlessly dominated news coverage and
captured public attention _ and overshadowed Gore's efforts to
present himself as a leader in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried to pass that torch Tuesday to Gore here before a
crowd of more than 15,000 people, the largest audience Gore has
seen since he officially announced his campaign more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nominee of the Democratic Party, my partner and friend for
the last eight years, understands where we are, where we're going
and how it will affect ordinary citizens more than any other public
figure in this country over the last 20 years,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Vouching for Gore, Clinton, who was operating on three hours of
sleep after delivering his valedictory speech in Los Angeles on
Monday night, added: ``I hope you'll take my word for this, because
I spent most of my adult life studying economics and the
development of our country. The things that have happened in the
last eight years _ the good things _ are nothing compared to the
good things that can happen in the next eight years. Nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who had been standing ramrod straight behind the president
with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and his wife, Tipper, then
embraced the president and shed his jacket as he moved to the
lectern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you, Mr. President, for giving me a chance to
serve my country for the last eight years, by working to help
strengthen your hand,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He introduced his wife as ``the woman I love,'' and went on to
tell the stories of several people whose lives had been improved by
programs of the Clinton administration. He said Clinton had built a
strong foundation for the nation and that the question in the
election was whether voters wanted to build on that foundation or
allow it to erode. Gore did not mention the name of his Republican
opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, but he did refer to the
governor's proposal for an across-the-board tax cut of $1.3
trillion over 10 years. Gore himself has proposed tax cuts of about
$500 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Bill Clinton worked hard to get this economy
right,'' Gore said. ``And I'm pledging to you here today, I am not
going to let the other side wreck it and take it away from us.
We're going to keep the prosperity going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether this ceremony would usher in for Gore a
transfer of attention _ and an enhancement of his standing with the
electorate _ or whether Clinton would continue to steal the show.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Clinton upstaged Gore as soon as the symbolic
``passing of the torch'' was over. (No object was actually passed,
as television producers had been led to believe might happen.) As
Gore began speaking, eyes were diverted by Clinton draping his arms
around Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After they left, the Clintons stopped at a McDonald's, an event
that made a huge splash with local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton marked the moment with a crispy chicken sandwich and
fries. Whether he was anticipating one of the advantages of being
an ordinary citizen or downing some comfort food to soothe his
angst over the dimming of the limelight, he seemed cheerful enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to be a citizen again, I'm going to have to start
getting used to it,'' the president said as he shrugged and then
slipped a $20 tip to the teen-age waitresses, telling them to ``go
out and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign picked small-town America _ and a battleground
state _ for the ceremony, a hot, confetti-strewn affair that drew a
mass of more than 15,000 people, according to local police
estimates. This was by far the largest crowd that Gore has seen in
the last year and a half of his presidential campaign, and several
people said they mainly had come to see the president.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, a town of 22,600 people near Lake Erie, was chosen
because it represents the challenge ahead for Gore. It is in a
swing district that includes both rural and suburban voters, both
high-tech and low-tech workers and an equal number of Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a bellwether area of the state, having voted for
winners in most presidential elections in modern history. A survey
from earlier this month, after Gore picked Sen. Joseph Lieberman as
his running mate, gave Bush 45 percent of likely voters and Gore 37
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gore can win here, he can win the state'' and the national
election, said Ed Sarpolus, a pollster in Lansing. ``This is one of
Gore's toughest audiences. His problem is still Bill Clinton the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   The area also underscores the major theme of both the Clinton
administration and the Gore campaign, which is the economic success
of the last eight years. As Clinton noted, unemployment here was
8.8 percent when he took office in 1993; it is now 2.2 percent.

MARKET PLACE: SEC IS ASKED TO AMEND A NEW PROPOSAL ON AUDITOR
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chairman of Ernst &AMP; Young, a major accounting firm that has
been supporting the Securities and Exchange Commission effort to
tighten rules on auditor independence, said Tuesday that the SEC's
rule proposal goes too far and would create too much uncertainty
about what activities were permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the American Accounting Association meeting in
Philadelphia, Phil Laskaway of Ernst &AMP; Young said the proposed rule
``would make it impossible'' for audit firms ``to enter into
strategic alliances or joint ventures, including with companies
that are not audit clients.'' Such allegiances are needed, he said,
because they help the firms gain expertise to do their jobs better.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he still hoped the SEC would amend the
proposal in a way that would be acceptable. He suggested a rule
might ban firms from performing large amounts of internal audit
work for audit clients, but still allow smaller tasks to be
performed. The SEC has said it fears that outside auditors might be
reluctant to question internal auditing work if it was done by
people employed by the same accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Laskaway added that a new rule could provide for disclosure of
the total audit fee and the total fee for other services to the
company, to help investors ascertain whether there was reason to be
concerned about the auditor's independence.
</P>
<P>
   No disclosure is now required on nonaudit services, a fact that
makes it impossible to even begin to compile statistics that would
indicate whether audits that prove to be faulty are more or less
likely to involve companies that used their auditing firms for
other services.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, each of which is
getting out of consulting in any case, have been relatively
supportive of the SEC effort, while the other three major firms _
KPMG, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche _ have been harshly
critical. The SEC hopes that it can find a rule that the two firms
will support, and Laskaway's speech indicated that effort has not
yet borne fruit. If the SEC is going to pass a rule that has
support from major auditing firms, it will probably have to tone
down the proposal substantially.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview after the speech, Laskaway said, ``I
tried to lay out a blueprint that will get something done.'' He
added, ``I have hopes this will be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, said the commission
would consider the suggestions and voiced the hope that other firms
would also make suggestions for a rule that would ``insure that
investors will continue to trust the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the other big firms have indicated they will
fight the rule, whose most significant aspect would be to ban
accounting firms from doing certain types of consulting work for
audit clients, and have so far shown little indication they want to
reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   One effort under way, according to some people who have talked
to Congressional aides, is to persuade Congress to attach a rider
to an appropriations bill in the current session. Such a rider
would bar the SEC from acting on the rule before February, by which
time the opponents hope that a new president will have appointed a
new SEC chairman who will drop the idea. It is not clear if such a
legislative move will be made.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Laskaway said ``heightened scrutiny of auditor
independence'' had led some clients to demand that auditors not
perform other services for the company. He said it would be good
``if the SEC could provide greater certainty'' regarding what was
permitted. That would give firms the ``opportunity to move forward
with our clients'' and ``would also hopefully restore civility
between the profession and the regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the proposed rule, by adopting four
``overriding principles'' regarding independence, would create too
much uncertainty. Such principles should be modified, he said, if
they are kept at all.

A BIT BAFFLED, FLUSHING GREETS A CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With an eye toward reaching constituencies not
traditionally thought of as Republican, Rep. Rick Lazio on Tuesday
took a subway line nicknamed the immigrant express to Flushing,
Queens, a predominantly Asian community that his party is courting.
</P>
<P>
   When he stepped off the No. 7 line, he did not seem fazed that
some people who shook his hand, like Huan Lee, a restaurant
delivery man, did not know who he was; Lee, being a citizen of
China, also cannot vote. But there were plenty of other people
toting signs advertising Lazio's Senate candidacy who promised
support in November.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Serphin Maltese, chairman of the Queens County
Republican Committee, and Mei Lin Tan, a real estate broker and
vice chairwoman of the committee, escorted Lazio as he strolled
Roosevelt Avenue and adjacent streets in the heart of a Chinese
immigrant neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was also accompanied by supporters who tried to outshout a
group of counterdemonstrators backing his Democratic opponent,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a young man dressed as Uncle Sam repeatedly barked
at Lazio to release his income tax returns, reprising the role he
played at a news conference on Monday. Again, Lazio said he would
release the returns sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio pressed on with a smile as Tan introduced him to
residents, occasionally translating their remarks into English and
doing some cheerleading as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, come on!'' she shouted as she marched into a seafood
restaurant, motioning diners to clap their hands for Lazio, which
some did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be in the community, to take the type of
transportation every New Yorker takes here into the community and
to be walked around and get this level of support,'' Lazio said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The response from people, he added, was ``a terrific sign of
support for who we are and the inclusive campaign that we have and
the fact that our message is spreading.''
</P>
<P>
   Maltese said the party was aggressively courting Asian-Americans
in Flushing, who, he said, were undergoing a political awakening as
they developed stronger bonds to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He said many shopkeepers enthusiastically agreed to wave
placards and put campaign signs in their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's appearance was in line with what his campaign staff has
said would be a serious effort to woo minority voters. Lazio has
visited black and Hispanic neighborhoods and plans to begin a bus
tour across the state Wednesday with a stop at the National Black
Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio drew many well-wishers, though some offered no more than
polite handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, they don't know him,'' Tan said later of people's
familiarity with Lazio. ``But I tell them he will be the next
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Mei Jin, who works in a clothing shop on Roosevelt Avenue, said
she had seen Lazio on television but had not formed an opinion of
him or of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough about either candidate, but it's good he
came here to meet us,'' Jin said.

ROCKIES MAKE A MESS, LETTING METS CLEAN UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAFAEL HERMOSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets' recent tear was not paved with mistakes,
but it was still filled with potholes. Again Tuesday night, the
Mets patched up their gaffes. Using a fill-in starting pitcher and
playing without their best hitter, they survived a messy game in
the opener of a doubleheader against Colorado at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense was inefficient but productive enough to outlast
the Rockies for a 7-5 victory. The Mets, who rallied from a 3-0
deficit, won for the 17th time in 21 games. They have not lost
consecutive games since July 20 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets used a four-run seventh inning to recover from a 4-2
deficit. But the Rockies' relievers were as responsible for that
comeback as were the Mets, who rested Mike Piazza. The go-ahead run
and the Mets' final run both scored on wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this game was as filled with individual highlights as it
was with mistakes. The spot starter Pat Mahomes pitched into the
seventh inning and provided the Mets with the foundation for their
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's come up big for us,'' said manager Bobby Valentine. ``He
gave us exactly what we needed and so did the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo drove in the Mets' first two runs with a double
in the fifth inning and then scored their sixth run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But if anybody needed redemption in this game, it was Todd
Zeile. He struck out in the fourth inning as the Mets failed to get
a run in after loading the bases with no outs, and he was thrown
out trying for a double leading off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was given the perfect vantage point for the Rockies' low
point. In the seventh inning, he watched Jose Jimenez's 2-2 pitch
bounce in front of the plate, off the chest protector of catcher
Brent Mayne and down the first-base line. Darryl Hamilton broke
from third base and scored the run that put the Mets ahead to stay
when Mayne's throw from foul territory bounced off Jimenez's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pratt's leadoff double and Lenny Harris' pinch-hit single
had put runners on the corners with no outs. Rockies starter Pedro
Astacio left for reliever Craig House, whose first four pitches to
Hamilton missed the strike zone, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell struck out on three pitches, but Alfonzo, who hit a
two-out double in the fifth inning, drew a full-count walk to force
in the third run and cut the Mets' deficit to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Myers, a side-arming left-hander, replaced House and walked
Robin Ventura on a 3-2 pitch that sailed outside. Harris trotted
home with the tying run. After Jimenez's wild pitch scored
Hamilton, Zeile walked and Jay Payton's groundout scored Alfonzo.
Jimenez allowed another run in the eighth after making two throwing
errors and throwing a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes, making a start for the first time since May 13, did his
job. He allowed four runs in six and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we didn't have a long man because I was the long man,''
Mahomes said of his usual relief role.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahomes was at the mercy of Astacio, who was teasing the
Mets by putting runners on base and escaping jams.
</P>
<P>
   But after Astacio, the Rockies' underbelly remains their relief
pitching, and the Mets exploited it. Colorado led by 4-2 when he
walked off the mound in the seventh inning but even he must have
sensed that lead evaporating quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets appeared to have a rally brewing in the fourth inning,
when Bell and Alfonzo led off with walks and Ventura singled to
right to load the bases. But Astacio again turned stingy. He fell
behind Todd Zeile by 3-0 before striking him out on three straight
pitches. Payton followed the same course, flailing at Astacio's
fastball for the final strike. And Mike Bordick lined a 1-2 pitch
straight to shortstop Neifi Perez to end the inning to loud boos
from the afternoon crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more life on the bench after we left those guys on
than before,'' Valentine said. ``Some teams say, `That was our
chance, we muffed it and we'll get 'em tomorrow.' This team says,
`That was our chance, we'll get 'em the next inning.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd was not appeased until Alfonzo delivered a two-out
double in the fifth inning to score Todd Pratt from third base and
Bell from first. But the Mets did not look sharp, and Alfonzo was
no exception. He tried to score from second on Ventura's infield
single but was thrown out by first baseman Todd Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, one of the slowest players on the Mets, led off the sixth
with a hit down the right-field line and into the corner. But he
was easily thrown out by Rockies right fielder Larry Walker as he
tried to stretch the single into a double.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mahomes turned around his career as a reliever for the
Mets last season, he has had far better success as a spot starter
this season. He has a 4.82 earned run average as a reliever, his
primary duty, but entered Tuesday's doubleheader with a 2.76 ERA in
three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been careful not to turn to Mahomes each time
there is a need in the rotation. Valentine values Mahomes'
durability and his flexibility out of the bullpen. He can pitch in
long or middle relief. The last time the Mets needed a starter for
a doubleheader, they promoted the rookie Grant Roberts from Class
AAA Norfolk and survived his shaky start to sweep two games from
the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   With a deeper bullpen since they traded for reliever Rick White,
the Mets did not need to take that risk again Tuesday and Mahomes
provided them with the innings they desperately needed. His biggest
problem was surviving Juan Pierre's sharp grounder in the seventh
inning that he grabbed barehanded. Mahomes remained in the game for
one more batter, and allowed one more run.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets trailing by 3-2, Mahomes allowed Perez to drive a
2-1 ball off the right-field wall for a run-scoring double. Mahomes
was removed for Dennis Cook, who allowed six runs in a third of an
inning in Monday's 11-1 loss to San Francisco. Cook got Walker to
ground out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets fell behind, 3-0, on two Rockies rallies manufactured
by Helton, who went 2 for 4 and raised his average to .395.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeffrey Hammonds led off the second with a bloop single
and stole second base, Helton grounded a double down the left-field
line for a 1-0 lead. Mahomes escaped further damage.
</P>
<P>
   But Helton's next at-bat led off the fourth inning, and he drove
a double over Hamilton in left field. The ball fell on the warning
track, and Helton soon scored when Todd Walker doubled over Bell's
head in right field. Walker eventually scored on a groundout.

GALAXY SHOOTING FOR HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Galaxy, disappointed with a 1-1 draw with
Kansas City over the weekend, is going to plan B, according to
coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   A week after beating the Wizards 5-1 at Arrowhead Stadium, the
Galaxy could have pulled to within a point of the Wizards on
Saturday at the Rose Bowl. Yet even with the Wizards playing a man
down the entire second half after Matt McKeon was ejected, the
Galaxy couldn't pull out a victory.
</P>
<P>
   The tie left the Galaxy (11-7-8, 41 points) four points behind
the Wizards (13-6-6, 45 points). Kansas City has seven games left
to the Galaxy's six, so winning the Western Division will be no
easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid is concerned with earning the fourth seed, which would
guarantee home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs.
The Galaxy is tied with Chicago (12-8-5, 41 points) for that
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   After playing host to the Colorado Rapids (11-12-3, 36 points)
tonight at the Rose Bowl, the Galaxy travels to meet Chicago on
Saturday at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously disappointed we blew a tremendous opportunity
with K.C.,'' Schmid said. ``When you give them away, they don't
keep coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now our goal is not to win the division. We first have
to win the No.4 spot for the playoffs. If K.C. falters then we have
a chance, but the only thing we can control is the four seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmid will have to do without Mauricio Cienfuegos (El
Salvador), Cobi Jones (U.S.) and Ezra Hendrickson (St. Vincent &AMP;
the Grenadines), who are lost because of World Cup qualifying
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Luis Hernandez was also scheduled to miss the game after
participating in Mexico's 2-0 victory over Canada on Tuesday
afternoon, but Schmid said Hernandez is flying back to Los Angeles
this morning and could play in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid said he would choose between Brian Kelly, Jorge Salcedo,
Zak Ibsen and Ivan Polic to replace the three missing starters.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who has been sidelined the past three
MLS games and two U.S. Open Cup games after minor knee surgery,
will be activated tonight. Matt Reis, who has filled in nicely for
Hartman, will get the start. &QL;

FOR BARBERS, GOLF IS A FAMILY AFFAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With two holes remaining in the latest chapter of
Tommy Barber's most excellent golf adventure, the June graduate of
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High felt he needed two pars to guarantee a
berth in the U.S. Amateur Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The first had to come from off the wrong fairway and the next
from out of deep rough under trees.
</P>
<P>
   No problem for the grandson of 1961 Ryder Cup captain Jerry
Barber, whose closing skill carried him to that year's PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Young Barber pulled off his par-par finish, punctuated by a
66-yard wedge shot to within six inches of the flagstick on No18,
and shared the best score at 70-66_136 in last week's U.S. Amateur
qualifier at Hillcrest Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice ending to a nice day,'' said Barber, who shot 30 on the
first nine of his second 18 and finished 6-under par to earn a
berth in next week's centennial U.S. Amateur at Baltusrol GC in
Springfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew 136 was in low, and I knew I needed that for
co-medalist,'' he said. ``And, who knows, maybe I needed it to get
into the Amateur without going to a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished, and with the kind of scrambling success
that this year has overshadowed Barber's remarkable length off the
tee.
</P>
<P>
   At the Southern Section championship, Barber hit his first drive
out of bounds and missed eight greens, but shot a 3-under-par 69 to
finish in the top five, bouncing his final approach of the day off
the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   During another top-five finish in the CIF/SCGA championship _
the closest Southern California high school golfers get to a state
final _ Barber secured an early tap-in par after escaping a bunker,
hitting a tree and hacking out of rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunker, tree, stoney,'' deadpanned Griffith Park head
professional Tom Barber, in the gallery that day to track his son's
progress, as he always does, from on course or afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has marvelous hands, very similar to what dad had,'' Tom
Barber said of Tommy. ``The kid has wonderful imagination and a
very delicate touch. It's amazing that someone who hits the ball
that far has that kind of feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy appreciates the never-pushing paternal encouragement that
dates back to his early struggles with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come easy,'' he said. ``I wasn't very good when I
was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   But he could always discuss his game with a pro who had Tommy's
interest at heart well beyond golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to go home and have my dad there to support me, good
round or bad. Either way, he's there smiling or trying to cheer me
up if I haven't played well. Lately, I've been going home with some
pretty good news.''
</P>
<P>
   No area high school golfer was hotter down the stretch of the
2000 season than Barber, whose run started with the second of two
consecutive Mission League titles in May. He followed that with six
successive sub-par rounds _ in section team qualifying, section
individual qualifying, both rounds of a first-place effort in a
Catalina tournament and in the section and CIF/SCGA individual
finals.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes the U.S. Amateur at historic Baltusrol, which has
hosted seven U.S. Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been awesome,'' Barber said. ``I pretty much did
everything I wanted to do in high school golf in terms of making it
to where I wanted to be, and I played well when I got there. The
U.S. Amateur tops it off. It's unbelievable _ I still wake up
shocked sometimes that I qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the family tree, and maybe it isn't all that
surprising that the latest Barber golf sensation is playing in a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather is a two-time Ryder Cup member, and his father,
who has played on the PGA and Senior PGA tours, is a Southern
California PGA stroke and match-play champion.
</P>
<P>
   Four other members of Tommy's family are PGA professionals,
including great-uncle Willie Barber, who three times won the U.S.
National Senior championship _ the forerunner to the Senior PGA
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's cousins Bill Barber and Bob DeVore are PGA club pros and
brother Jeff is a PGA apprentice, teaching at Griffith Park, where
the Barber family has been running the pro shop since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's mother Diane has won the last two women's championships
at Lakeside Country Club, uncle Roger Barber plays to a 2 handicap,
and younger brother Danny was No.4 on the Notre Dame High team this
year as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Tommy literally grew up at Griffith Park, where he
took his first swing on the practice range at age 11 months, where
he learned to drive the ball nearly 300 yards and where he won last
year's men's club championship at age 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a lot of fun around here,'' he said Saturday,
after bouncing a few tee shots off the fence at the end of the
Griffith Park range, tuning up for next week's family trip to
Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys have befriended me here and played golf with me.
It's a whole family over here _ pretty much everybody, not just my
parents and brother. I've been here all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And helping churn the Griffith Park inventory in the process,
according to his father, who had this response when Tommy told him
_ at the Southern Section final in Palm Springs _ that he'd been
admiring a new putter in that pro shop:
</P>
<P>
   ``Son,'' the elder Barber said, ``I don't know it you know this,
but your father runs a pro shop, and he has 92 used putters there _
and they're all yours.'' &QL;

BROWN SAYS SIDE IS FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Kevin Brown said his right side is fine, and manager
Davey Johnson took it a step further by saying he would push the
Dodgers' right-hander up a day for a Friday start against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   That is, provided everything goes fine with a bullpen session
today.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said there are no lingering effects from the soreness
on the right side of his rib cage that forced him to have a
cortisone shot Friday, and he wasn't experiencing any pain or
discomfort during his start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' said Brown, who allowed nine runs in 11/3 innings
against the Marlins. ``I'd rather be hurting and getting people out
than pain-free and not getting people out. Unfortunately, you don't
get to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The side) is not an issue. It would be nice if it were that
easy to blame something on, but it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time this season Brown's health has been an
issue. He missed two weeks in April with a broken right pinkie,
then experienced stiffness in the back of his shoulder after a July
6 start in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers trainer Stan Johnston said Brown had irritation around
the rib cage after his start last Wednesday against the Chicago
Cubs, but the cortisone shot eased that pain.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is winless in his last four starts, going 0-2 with a 5.57
ERA. And though four of the runs the Marlins scored off Brown were
unearned because of three errors, he allowed seven hits and threw
46 pitches to record four outs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several of the Marlins remarked that Brown's sinker, which
is usually devastating, didn't have its usual bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game that started off wrong and it wasn't going to
get corrected,'' Dodgers pitching coach Claude Osteen said. ``He
said he felt fine and I believe it because you don't throw the way
he did in the bullpen with an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   HUNDLEY SCRATCHED: Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley, who's played in
only 60 of the Dodgers' 118 games, was scratched from the lineup
because of tightness in his right knee. He had trouble squatting,
which could cause problems for a catcher, and was replaced by Chad
Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know how it happened,'' Johnson said. ``He woke up
and it was stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley's already been on the disabled list twice this season,
missing most of June with a strained oblique muscle and three weeks
in July with a broken thumb. But Johnson said he was optimistic
Hundley could return Friday. He will get today off because Chan Ho
Park pitches, meaning Kreuter will catch, and the Dodgers are off
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   BELTRE BANTER: Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre continues to
confound, and Johnson said it's because of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre entered Tuesday second among National League third
baseman with 19 errors, including miscues in three straight games.
However, the 21-year-old also makes extremely difficult plays look
relatively easy, especially charging in, bare-handing slow rollers
and throwing out runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexperience, youth,'' Johnson said. ``Unfortunately, a
gifted athlete doesn't immediately do everything like a Gold
Glover. He's young defensively and offensively.'' &QL;

 &HT;    National party has high hopes for Nelson in Senate race
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten years ago, Bill Nelson was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders had abandoned him. His quest to become
Florida's governor, first hailed by party leaders, fizzled when
Lawton Chiles, then a retired U.S. senator, decided that Nelson
could not defeat the incumbent Republican. Chiles challenged Nelson
for the party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles defeated Nelson and Republican Gov. Bob Martinez. It was
a humiliating time for Nelson. The former Orlando congressman and
shuttle astronaut would spend the next four years in political
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade later, a much weakened Democratic Party is
counting on Nelson to win a U.S. Senate seat and help salvage a
battered state party desperate for success in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the popular Florida insurance commissioner, leads in
current polls against his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum
of Altamonte Springs. It will be a costly and hotly contested race.
Each side is expected to spend up to $10 million. In addition,
millions more will be spent by the Republican and Democratic
parties, which consider this race to be one of the most important
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats need to win just four seats to reach a 50-50 split in
the Senate. If Vice President Al Gore wins the White House, his
vice president, Joe Lieberman, would cast the tie-breaking vote for
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this is a very important race for
us,'' said U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``Florida is a state
where we believe Democrats have a very strong candidate in Bill
Nelson and where there is every reason to believe we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Nelson and McCollum have used the national conventions to
advance their campaigns. Both won afternoon speaking moments at the
convention. And both made the rounds of important political
gatherings hoping to keep the interest in their campaigns high.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson, this could be a career-ending campaign. If he fails
to win this seat, once held by Chiles and now being vacated by
retiring Republican Connie Mack, Nelson will once again be banished
to political oblivion. Nelson is determined not to go back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be one tough race,'' Nelson said Tuesday.
``You have their state party chairman already promising to do
everything they can to stop me from winning. I think they've made
it pretty clear that they are going to come after me and I'm going
to respond back as hard and as forcefully as I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson insists, however, that he has no intention of taking the
low road. ``People are tired of that kind of politics,'' Nelson
said. ``This is going to be a campaign of character and ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He bristles at McCollum's new campaign warning ``Bill Clinton,
Bill Nelson, Al Gore'' they're all the same. But Nelson insists
he's not backing away from the Clinton presidency, ``and some of
the remarkable things they have done for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum's tactic will backfire, said Nelson, because, ``it will
remind people of McCollum's sanctimonious image'' during the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Both men will be clashing on issues about Social Security,
Medicare, HMO reform and a host of other key Florida issues, Nelson
said. ``There are clear differences between the two of us and in
the coming weeks I believe the voters are going to see those
differences very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Democrats also believe Nelson's campaign is helped by
Gore's choice of Lieberman as his running mate. Lieberman, the
first Jew on a national ticket, has generated considerable
excitement in Florida's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lieberman is a great choice for Florida because I think the
enthusiasm for him will help Democrats all the way down the ballot,
and that includes Bill Nelson,'' said Bob Poe, chairman of the
state Democratic Party. During his Senate campaign announcement in
May, Nelson said he was particularly touched when Rhea Chiles,
Lawton Chiles' widow, spoke to the crowd and told them that she
wanted Nelson to have Chiles' old senate seat.

 &HT;    PARTY'S LIBERAL LIONS ROAR FOR GORE
 &HT;    Eds: Recasts top, adds fresh quotes throughout.
 &HT;    800&AMP;add.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats recalled their party's progressive past
Tuesday, emotionally linking the ``New Frontier'' of John F.
Kennedy to the ``New Heights'' they envision under Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night devoted to the champions of the party's liberal
wing, in eclipse for decades after a string of presidential defeats
and the ascendancy of Democratic centrists.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they trooped to the podium to declare that the
ideals they embodied were alive and well _ and would be in good
hands under a President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Even keynote speaker Harold Ford Jr., at age 30 the youngest
member of Congress, told the delegates, ``I also stand here
representing a new generation _ a generation committed to the
ideals of the past but inspired by unshakable confidence in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the only surviving member
of Kennedy's immediate family, stirred memories of her assassinated
father with a rare appearance before the convention that will
formally nominate Gore on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we are the New Frontier,'' she said, making the
connection between her father's generation and Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Strains from the Broadway musical ``Camelot'' greeted
Schlossberg as she reached the podium to add her voice to the
chorus of praise for Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg followed other members of the Democratic Party's
most famous family to the podium in the standing-room-only Staples
Center in the heart of the city where Kennedy was nominated in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Her uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, and two
cousins, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist, and
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland,
also addressed the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was 6 years old when his uncle became
the Democratic standard-bearer in 1960, noted that ``at that
convention, our party launched the new frontier with a Democratic
frontier.'' He added, ``This year, we will launch a new millennium
with a great national leader who will make history by validating
our nation's legacy for world leadership and environmental
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said the Democratic Party ``made history (in 1960) by
summoning the best of our country, challenging Americans to
serve.'' This year, she added, ``with renewed resolve, we'll make
history again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the most dynamic and most recognized
liberal voice of the party today, also electrified the delegates on
the so-called ``New Heights'' night of the convention with spirited
rhetoric that ridiculed the Republican Party's recent convention as
an ``inclusion illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also roused the delegates with a harsh critique of
Republican nominee George W. Bush's record as governor of Texas and
a reminder that ``Papa Bush,'' the governor's father, former
President George Bush, had elevated Clarence Thomas, a conservative
foe of affirmative action, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   At several points, Jackson led the more than 4,000 delegates in
chants: ``Stay out of the Bushes,'' ``More with Gore'' and his
signature ``Keep hope alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson also reminded his fellow Democrats of the ``moral
disgrace'' of one in five American children living in poverty in a
time of unprecedented economic wealth and the ``great divide''
between the affluence of Beverly Hills and the poverty of South
Central Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He also blessed the Democratic ticket of Gore, a Southern
Baptist, and Lieberman, a Jew, as ``the All-American team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman paid a surprise visit to the convention floor Tuesday
night, and convention organizers immediately broadcast a video of
Kennedy declaring in 1960 that his religious beliefs _ he was
Catholic _ were ``not relevant'' to his campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket also got the blessing of former Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, who carried the liberal wing's banner in the Democratic
primaries against Gore this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who was highly critical of the vice president during
the primaries, vowed to ``work hard'' for Gore and other Democrats
this fall because ``our country needs a Democratic president, a
Democratic Congress and most important, a Democratic conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his former opponent, he said, ``When you run against someone,
you get to know him very well. I learned that Al Gore is a man of
wide-ranging intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound
preparation for the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life view
infused with tolerance and rooted in religious faith.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Jackson, Bradley urged the party on to new heights,
specifically to ending child poverty in America and vanquishing
``the insidious bond between big money and political decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, the co-sponsor of campaign
finance reforms with Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Bush's chief
opponent in the GOP primaries, urged the Democratic Party to
prohibit the raising of so-called ``soft money'' at future
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stand before you ... without mentioning my concern
and dismay that soft money fund-raising has become so much a part
of this convention,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who campaigned Tuesday in Michigan with President Clinton
in a symbolic passing of the torch, arrives in Los Angeles on
Wednesday to claim the party's presidential nomination, the
culmination of his 24 years in public office.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day gathering of Democrats, which began Monday, is not
confined to the nomination of Gore and Lieberman and an approval of
a platform of principles on which they two will run this fall: It
also an unusually ripe opportunity for the party to raise funds
with the help of powerful friends in the city's entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform vowed to make the McCain-Feingold bill ``the
first piece of legislation in a Democratic administration.'' It
also committed the party to support ``a public-private, nonpartisan
endowment to raise money to finance congressional elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform, approved by the state delegations voting on sleek
iMac computers donated by Apple, also pledged support for abortion
rights, affirmative action, increasing the number of police, DNA
testing in some death penalty cases, putting 1 million new teachers
in classrooms, mandatory child safety locks for guns, expanded
health insurance for families, using budget surpluses to shore up
Social Security and Medicare and tax cuts targeted to middle class
families.

 &HT;    KENNEDYS SHINE AT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was a night filled with the echoes of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Kennedy family spoke Tuesday to the
Democratic National Convention, culminating in a ringing
endorsement of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman by Sen. Edward Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has only been three times in my life that I have
supported anyone as early and enthusiastically as Al Gore. Two of
them were my brothers,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But it may have been the family member who introduced the
Massachusetts senator, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who was most
affectionately welcomed by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, Schlossberg
has been the most reluctant of her family to seek the spotlight.
But she stepped to the Democratic podium Tuesday to introduce her
uncle, inheriting the public role played by her brother, John
Kennedy Jr., until his death in a plane crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time but a timeless call. Now, we are the New Frontier.
And now, when many of us are doing so well, it is time once again
to ask more of ourselves,'' said Schlossberg, evoking the rhetoric
of the Camelot era.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg told the Democrats that Gore's parents had been
matchmakers who helped bring the late president and her mother, the
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, together.
</P>
<P>
   And Ted Kennedy poignantly recalled how Caroline told her father
he'd been elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember election night in November of 1960. The results
were so close that my brother went to bed still not certain that he
had won. It was nearly dawn when victory finally became clear. And
here is how Jack learned about it _ from 3-year-old Caroline, who
woke him up by jumping on his bed and shouting, ``Good morning, Mr.
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time he ever heard those words from anyone,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the last one left. This is like a sentimental journey
for me to come back and see her in the same place where her father
was nominated,'' said Mike Vinich, a Wyoming delegate whose Marine
company was rescued in the Pacific during World War II by three PT
boats, including the one captained by JFK.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles holds bittersweet memories for the Kennedy family.
John F. Kennedy accepted the presidential nomination at the 1960
convention here, and the late president's connections with
Hollywood through Peter Lawford and other stars added to the
glamour of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   But the late president's brother, Robert Kennedy, was
assassinated in a hotel near the hall whether the Democrats
gathered this year on the night he won the California presidential
primary in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many comparisons with the 1960 convention this
week, because Kennedy was the first Roman Catholic to be nominated
by a major party, and Lieberman, who will accept the
vice-presidential nomination Wednesday night, will be the first
Orthodox Jew on a major party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``How proud he would be of Al Gore and our party and the new
barrier of bigotry we are breaking down with the choice of Joe
Lieberman as the next vice president of the United States,'' Sen.
Kennedy said of his late brother.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend,
42, a member of the party's platform committee, spoke on technology
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've re-established America as a lighthouse of prosperity and
hope. But this didn't happen automatically and there's no guarantee
it will continue,'' said Ms. Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Robert Kennedy Jr., also spoke Tuesday night. He,
too, invoked images from John Kennedy's administration to discuss a
contemporary concern, the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time that I was in Los Angeles for a convention was
in 1960 when I was 6 years old,'' he said. ``At that convention,
our party launched the new frontier with a Democratic president.
This year, we will launch a new millennium with a great national
leader who will make history by validating our nation's legacy for
world leadership and environmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kennedy's son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, 33,
spoke in the convention's opening session Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The program brought back memories of the 1960 convention to
Georgia Agriculture Secretary Tommy Irvin, the dean of the state's
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from the South, we were pledged to Johnson. But when
Kennedy came and spoke to our delegation, he turned me around. The
thing about Kennedy was he so energized me that as a second-term
legislator, I felt I had to go home and do everything,'' Irvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely a meaningful day to me. Because I think
that time really was Camelot. For people our age, it was the dream
age for politics, for family, for everything that was great. It was
just like a glorious era, and I think a lot of us want it to come
back,'' said Miki Pavelonis, 58, a delegate from Harrisboro,
Illinois.
</P>

   Jill Vejnoska of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution contributed to

POWERFUL MEXICAN FAMILY FILES SUIT OVER REPORT'S LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ohio, Texas)  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A college professor in Ohio has drawn the unwelcome
attention of one of Mexico's most powerful families.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for a bank controlled by the family of Mexican
billionaire Carlos Hank Gonzalez _ a former mayor of Mexico City _
say Donald E. Schulz leaked a secret Justice Department document
last year that described the Hank family as a ``significant
criminal threat'' and linked it to large-scale drug trafficking and
money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in federal court in Cleveland,
alleges that Schulz, who is now chairman of the political science
department at Cleveland State University, leaked copies of the
report to newspapers last year.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are Laredo National Bancshares Inc. of Laredo,
Texas, and the bank's president and chief executive officer, Gary
G. Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which asks for unspecified damages, is an early salvo
in what is expected to be a long and coordinated counterattack by
the Hank family, one of the wealthiest and most politically
influential clans in Mexico, against allegations it is involved in
the illegal drug trade. The family also faces scrutiny by
regulators at the Federal Reserve, who are examining Carlos Hank
Rhon's ownership in the Laredo bank.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was produced by the National Drug Intelligence
Center, an agency within the Justice Department, was cited last
year in articles in newspapers including the Washington Post and
the Dallas Morning News at a time when Congress was debating the
Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. The law, which Congress
later passed, gives the government the power to freeze bank
accounts and other assets of persons it labels significant drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The report alleged the Hank family was involved in money
laundering and drug trafficking and implied that it was protected
because of its strong ties to the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, according to news reports. Known as PRI, the political
machine dominated Mexican politics until this year, when the
National Action Party's candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, defeated
the PRI's candidate in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was disclosed, the Hank family mobilized to
rebut the allegations, hiring high-profile lawyers including Warren
Rudman, the former New Hampshire senator. This year, Attorney
General Janet Reno disavowed the report after Rudman wrote to her
to complain about its dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in a letter to Rudman, said that the subject matter in the
report was beyond the ``substantive expertise'' of the authors,
that the report's characterizations were not adopted as government
policy, and that the document had never received proper vetting
from government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed in Cleveland, lawyers for the bank and
Jacobs allege that an official of the National Drug Intelligence
Center gave a copy of the report to Schulz, who was then a
professor at the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and that
Schulz then leaked the document to reporters. The lawsuit also said
Schulz has denied to government investigators that he leaked the
document.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Schulz's residence in Cleveland were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, in an interview, said he was upset by any allegations of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am outraged about is that I have always been an honest,
law-abiding and compliant banker,'' he said. ``I believe my
constitutional rights have been violated. They are doing it with
reckless abandon and they should be held accountable for their
actions.''

<P>
   Robert Shrum, the Gore strategist who has written some of the
most eloquent speeches of his generation, said Tuesday that Gore
was ``literally, truly and unquestionably involved'' in writing
acceptance speech to the Democratic convention on Thursday night.
With no help at all from Shrum, who wrote much of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's ``dream shall never die'' speech that ignited the 1980
Democratic convention in New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``He is writing his own speech,'' Shrum repeated by phone from
Michigan, where he was traveling with Gore. Shrum added that Gore,
a former journalist, was ``an excellent writer. He's got a very
real sense of imaging and the sounds and balance of language.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shrum did advise Kennedy on his convention speech Tuesday
night. Shrum also said that when he wrote Kennedy's most famous
oratorical line _ ``the dream shall never die'' _ the idea
``basically just came out of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos reigns at Hadassah Lieberman's office at the Biltmore
Hotel. Phones keep ringing. Calls are unanswered. An abrupt
decision by the Gore campaign asking her to nominate her husband,
Joseph, as vice president at the convention has thrown her small
staff into turmoil. Interviews are being canceled or rearranged as
speechwriters toil in the Lieberman suite.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lieberman's role in the upcoming campaign is still under
discussion by the Gore and Lieberman staffs. But, they say, Mrs.
Lieberman, 52, will probably move out alone on the campaign trail,
without her husband, just as Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney,
the Republican vice-presidential nominee, has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hadassah's got a great story to tell, a really compelling
story,'' said Dan Gerstein, her husband's spokesman. ``She's the
daughter of Holocaust survivors. Her mother was liberated by
American GI's at Dachau. The fact that she'll be on the stage at
this convention is a powerful testament to the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as Lieberman was selected, the Gore campaign
asked Sally Aman, who had worked more than four years as Tipper
Gore's communications director, to serve in a similar role with
Mrs. Lieberman. Before this, Mrs. Lieberman had never had a staff
of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Is Mrs. Lieberman, who has not spoken much publicly, nervous
about appearing before the convention? ``It's perfectly normal to
be nervous, and she is,'' said Aman. ``But she's talking about a
subject she knows very well. Her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The coda of President Clinton's speech to the convention Monday
night carried an unscripted _ and unexpected _ phrase that not only
seemed enigmatic but also confused some newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from his prepared text _ as he often does _ Clinton
added a sentence in the final paragraph of his speech, saying,
``And remember,  &UR; whenever  &LR; you think about me, keep putting people
first.'' The White House quoted Clinton as making the comment. And
people listening to the speech agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But others who heard the speech said that was not correct. They
said they had heard Clinton say: ``And remember,  &UR; whatever  &LR; you
think about me...'' The word itself sounded blurry.
</P>
<P>
   The one-word difference, of course, carries an entirely
different meaning. One White House aide said he was fairly certain
that Clinton said ``whatever.'' If so, that would be the only
reference in the speech to the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, ``It
means `whether you think well of me or not, what's important is the
future of the country.' It means `don't get distracted by what you
think of me personally.'''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The New York Daily News and The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch also used the phrase ``whatever you think of me.''
The New York Times, in its published transcript of the speech, also
had ``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, the White House issued its official transcript of
the remarks, and it said ``whenever.'' A team of New York Times
editors also listened to the tape of the speech and agreed that the
president said ``whenever.'' Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Certain East and West Coast eyebrows were raised when Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., was spotted walking across the
convention floor on Monday night with his onetime close friend
Patricia Duff, former wife of the Revlon billionaire Ronald O.
Perelman and the former Tristar Pictures chairman Mike Medavoy.
There had been numerous tabloid reports of a Torricelli-Duff split.
</P>
<P>
   Were they back together? Torricelli would not say. ``There is a
bond between all the Democrats who were on the convention floor,''
Torricelli pleasantly replied, ``but it is something short of
marriage.'' Duff, who has been through an ugly, highly publicized
child custody battle with Perelman, was one of Bill Clinton's first
and biggest fund-raisers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, Clinton fund-raiser extraordinaire and close
presidential pal, got the first hug after Clinton finished his
convention speech. Holding court with reporters Tuesday after
speaking to a breakfast meeting of the New York delegation at the
Century Plaza Hotel, McAuliffe said that after Clinton leaves the
presidency, ``he has no interest in making money.''
</P>
<P>
   That remark may be of some interest to Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who has worried about the couples' extraordinary legal bills.
McAuliffe also said that the retired president would spend a third
of his time at his presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., a
third of his time traveling and a third in New York. As to whether
the Clintons would keep their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. _ the loan
for it was temporarily guaranteed by McAuliffe _ the presidential
fund-raiser replied: ``You'll have to talk to the first lady and
the president about their plans. They've got their own mortgage
now. They don't need me.''
</P>
<P>
   The model Christie Brinkley, a member of the New York
delegation, caused such a traffic jam of television cameras on the
convention floor on Monday night that security guards finally asked
her to move into the hallway so they could clear the aisles. ``I
wonder why,'' New York state Comptroller Carl McCall dryly
observed. Eliot Spitzer, the state attorney general, was one of
hundreds of New York delegates and elected officials left in the
shadows with the departure of Brinkley and her klieg lights. ``This
shows the proper media understanding of how politics works,''
Spitzer said.

DEMOCRATS' LIBERAL LIONS GIVE GORE ROAR OF APPROVAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN &QL; 
C.2000 Houston Chronicle &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats promoted their traditional cause of
social equality Tuesday, striving to unify liberals behind
presidential candidate Al Gore and rekindle the inspiration of
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton off the national convention stage and
Gore yet to arrive, the podium bustled with the adoption of a
platform and speeches by four Kennedys, three labor union
presidents, abortion and gay rights activists, former Gore foe Bill
Bradley, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a featured, young black
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In lockstep, they touted Gore as the standard-bearer for the
Democratic mission of making sure that rights and riches spread
beyond the privileged few. It was a message that laid the
groundwork for Gore to tell middle-of-the-road voters that there is
a difference of vital substance between the Democratic and
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the day's energy was also spent on uniting the
party's left wing behind the relatively moderate message of Gore
and vice-presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman. National voter
surveys continued to indicate Tuesday that Republicans are more
solidly behind GOP nominee George W. Bush of Texas than Democrats
are behind the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman himself worked the unity message Tuesday. He met here
with black delegates and congressmen _ some of whom had blasted his
stances on affirmative action and school vouchers _ and earned
standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   At a Michigan campaign rally, Clinton, Gore and their wives
presented Gore as the key to continuing the country's economic
growth. It was a symbolic political handoff, with Gore making his
way to the convention and Clinton heading off to the final months
of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ford Jr., a 30-year-old congressman from Gore's home
state of Tennessee, said in the prepared text of his keynote
address that the Democratic ticket ``believes the future is for
everyone'' while Republicans ``would have us go back to a past
where prosperity touches only the well-off and well-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in
previous years, denounced Bush and his family's political record _
``Stay out of the Bushes,'' the civil rights leader chanted _ and
portrayed the White House contest as a stark economic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Infusing the convention with an indignation that few speakers
displayed at the GOP convention, Jackson said Bush and running mate
Dick Cheney would give most of the federal budget surplus ``to
those who are already doing just fine (while) the Gore-Lieberman
team says the money should be used to make America stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This contest is not about race or religion,'' Jackson
continued, ``but about resource distribution and budget
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who lost a bitter primary contest to Gore, delivered an
unrestrained endorsement of Gore and said he would work hard for a
Democratic victory.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the party to take up the cause of campaign reform and
said his differences with Gore were small compared to their harmony
on policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read my lips _ watch what we do,'' the former senator
and basketball star said, arguing that the Democrats practice
diversity and quality while the Republicans only preach it.
</P>
<P>
   But speeches by U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy and his niece, Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg, provided the emotional center of the
convention's second day.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy _ brother of Edward and father of Schlossberg
_ was nominated for president at a Los Angeles convention in 1960.
JFK was assassinated three years into his White House term. His
other child, John F. Kennedy Jr., died in a plane crash last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg, making her first speech to a Democratic convention,
invoked her father's policy agenda, called the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are the New Frontier,'' she said. `` ... As much as we
need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness
and decency'' that Gore would strive to install.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my father's spirit lives on and I thank all of
you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy said Gore, in contrast with the Republicans,
would expand health care benefits and related consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not turn back to old policies and old ways that favor
the few at the expense of the many,'' the Massachusetts senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Lieberman entered the convention hall to hear
Schlossberg and the senator speak, the convention displayed a film
of JFK telling voters in 1960 that he should not be judged by his
religion. He was the first Roman Catholic president; Lieberman is
the first Jew on a major party presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and environmental
lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also spoke Tuesday. They are the
children of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Democrats stand not just for the success of the few, but
for opportunity for all,'' Townsend said, sounding the evening's
theme of economic equality.
</P>
<P>
   On-scene Republican officials criticized the Democratic
proceedings Tuesday, just as Democratic leaders slammed the GOP
gathering in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said the Democratic convention has not
seen Gore yet because there is an attempt to downplay Gore's
desire, as expressed in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' to
eliminate the internal combustion engine or tax fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the candidate? He's a shadowy figure in the background
that they seem to want to hide as long as they can,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer criticized Jackson's speech as
``old-style attack politics'' and said that if Gore ``was serious
about renouncing personal attacks and unkind words, he shouldn't
have allowed his surrogates to do it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is campaigning on the idea that the GOP would spread
economic prosperity to all levels of society, not conform to the
stereotype of Republicans serving only the upper class.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the downtown sports arena where the Democrats met,
political protesters carried out peaceful demonstrations under the
watch of hundreds of police officers equipped to suppress riot.
There were 45 arrests Tuesday _ mostly of animal-rights advocates,
who banged on windows and painted over signs at clothing stores
that sell fur. On Monday night, police and demonstrators clashed
violently at the end of a rock concert in the designated protest
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform, tracking Gore's agenda, calls for an
expansive federal role in education, a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, more health insurance programs for children and tax
credits for retirement savings and college savings.
</P>
<P>
   The ``targeted tax cuts'' and programs that would be funded with
the surplus contrast with Bush's call for across-the-board tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The platform supports affirmative action, gun control, a
stronger military defense and stronger enforcement of environmental
laws. It reaffirms support for abortion rights and says that
abortion opponents are welcome into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, told the convention that ``a
value at America's heart is threatened'' because Bush would appoint
Supreme Court judges who would outlaw abortion.

BRUINS LINEMAN GETTING KOSHER TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA can sell recruits on sunshine, Hollywood and
academics. Now the the Bruins have added a new sales pitch: We've
got kosher.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big reason why Eyoseph Efseaff, a freshman guard from
Porterville, chose UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Efseaff's family are Russian Molokans, who not only follow the
New Testament of the Bible like most Christians but also all tenets
of the Old Testament, as traditional Jews do. Hence, the kosher
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Efseaff, who said he was recruited by most Pac-10 schools, said
UCLA was one of the few schools he could attend. There are a
handful of small Molokan communities in the Southland, but a large
Jewish community on the Westside will make keeping a kosher diet
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher principals were formed as a way to maintain sanitary
eating conditions. Bottom-dwelling fish, for example, are thought
to be unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word unclean,'' Efseaff said. ``We can't eat pork
or shellfish or catfish (animals that are deemed unclean in the Old
Testament). It has to be prepared in a clean pan. It also has to be
killed a certain way. You have to cut the throat and bleed the
animal. You can't hit it over the head or shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has provided Efseaff with a list of restaurants that
prepare and/or deliver kosher food. At last week's beach barbecue
for incoming freshman, a box of kosher food was brought for
Efseaff.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Taylor, UCLA's Director of Football Operations, said the
team has had Muslims who wouldn't eat pork, but never had to
accommodate a kosher diet before
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't eat everything that's at the dorms,'' said Taylor.
``He's not real demanding _ he'd eat bagels all day _ but it's
important for him to maintain good nutrition to keep his weight up
(as an offensive lineman). It's our responsibility to take care of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Efseaff, his ethnic name notwithstanding, is a third-generation
American. His great-grandparents emigrated to the United States in
1902, at a time when the Cossacks were persecuting religious
minorities in Russia. About 2,500 Molokans _ who refused to join
the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1600s _ came to America at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a dozen Molokan families in Porterville. Efseaff
said the distinguishing characteristics are a strong elder system
and that all church business is conducted in Russian, a language he
hopes to be fluent in by the time he leaves college.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive line coach Mark Weber said Efseaff, who is 6-foot-3
and 282 pounds, has had little trouble distinguishing himself, both
on the field and off, where he carried a 3.9 GPA at Monache
(Calif.) High.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of things to learn,'' Weber said. ``But he's
got all the intangibles, he's smart and he plays hard. He's got a
lot of discipline. He's very business-like for an 18-year-old. He's
very committed to his goals, whether it's personal, in football or
spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   TOLEDO RESPONDS: Bob Toledo denied a claim by a USC freshman
that the UCLA head coach lied to him about the way the Trojans were
recruiting him.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Kenechi Udeze said in Tuesday's Daily News
that he chose USC because Toledo told him, ``I was no longer
(USC's) No.1 prospect. ... I knew it wasn't true. So I knew I
couldn't go there after he said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Toledo: ``I never said what he said. I don't lie and I
don't negative recruit. I have no idea if he was their first
recruit or their 10th. That comment really bothered me ... for
someone to call me a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said he wouldn't use the comment for motivation when UCLA
plays the Trojans in November because Udeze ``won't even be
playing.'' &QL;

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE HOPES TO IMPROVE LINE PLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The hope is that Cal State Northridge quarterback
Marcus Brady won't have to scramble so much this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors offensive line didn't offer much protection last
year. Three returning starters and a couple of newcomers have CSUN
coach Jeff Kearin hopeful this group will make marked improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big guys, they're more athletic, more agile and
definitely stronger and in better shape,'' Kearin said. ``It's
refreshing. Where we're weak is depth. We're two or three injuries
away from being desperate. If we lose two or three on either side
of the ball we could be in trouble. But our job as coaches is to
make sure that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Ortiz (6-foot-3, 285 pounds), Keith Kincaid (6-4, 285)
and Johnny Acosta (6-5, 300) were part of a line that allowed 37
sacks, an average of 3.4 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were young and inexperienced and we really didn't
connect,'' Ortiz said. ``There was no unity. Now we have unity. We
know how to play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it was a disaster last year. CSUN managed to average
450.3 yards per game, including 313.2 yards through the air. Even
though the starting running back position is open following the
graduation of Jaumal Bradley, Ortiz hopes CSUN will run more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year everybody was emphasizing the pass because our line
blocking wasn't that good,'' Ortiz said. ``This year we'll try to
run the ball more to catch them off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz _ a transfer from Fresno State _ walked on the team last
year but received a scholarship this season.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Jamar Ikpi out of Pomona High and freshman Tyrone
Tutogi of Hueneme Oxnard are expected to battle for starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING FOR A RUNNING BACK: Returning running back Alan Taylor,
Terrelus Wright _ a transfer from Arizona Western College _ and
redshirt freshman Bruce Molock are expected to compete for the
starting running back spot in the Matadors' one-back offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wide open,'' Kearin said. ``We have a lot of good
players, but we don't have a true speed guy. (Taylor) played some
last year and he ended the spring as the heir apparent. But he has
some big shoes to fill with Jaumal Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER GARDNER INJURY: Isaac Gardner _ who's moving from
linebacker to defensive back _ left Tuesday morning's practice with
a bruised right quadriceps muscle. Gardner iced the injury and is
expected to be OK. &QL;

TROJANS D-LINE GETS A BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ USC's depleted defensive line received a boost
when incoming freshman tackle Malcolm Woolridge decided to play for
the Trojans and was scheduled to arrive in training camp Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge (6-foot-2, 290 pounds) committed to USC two years ago
but did not academically qualify. He then committed to Miami but
ended up attending prep school in Virginia last year.
</P>
<P>
   He was cleared by the NCAA this week and accepted a scholarship
offer from the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about him, back then he was 340 (pounds) and
could move,'' defensive line coach Ed Orgeron said. ``He has great
feet. He has to come in and develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge was scheduled to fly in Tuesday from his hometown of
Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably redshirt, but his presence will help offset the
losses of freshman Sagan Atuatasi, who did not qualify
academically, and freshman Jamaal Williams, who is out four to six
weeks with a broken right leg.
</P>
<P>
   It will also mean the Trojans will not have to move another
player to defensive line for practice drills.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge's arrival is not a reaction to the failure of Atuatasi
to be admitted, because USC had offered Woolridge a scholarship
provided he meet the necessary requirements following prep school.
</P>
<P>
   PAPADAKIS OUT: Tailback Petros Papadakis will miss today's
closed scrimmage at Orange Coast College and probably be out two
days after his foot ``locked up'' and became stiff. He was wearing
a boot during Tuesday's afternoon practice and is still recovering
from last season's broken foot. He and offensive guard Trevor
Roberts (sprained foot) are the only players expected to be held
out.
</P>
<P>
   NO FULLBACK CONTROVERSY: There might some question as to who
will start at tailback, but senior Charlie Landrigan is the clear
choice at fullback, with sophomore Chad Pierson the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landrigan, he's a bulldog waiting to bite your head off,''
running backs coach Kennedy Pola said. ``He will be the starter.''
</P>
<P>
   KICKING CONCERNS: Today is a D-day of sorts for the kicking
game, as Hackett expects to narrow the kicking field from three to
two or possibly award the position to junior David Newbury, who is
the leader.
</P>
<P>
   How the kickers perform in today's scrimmage will play a large
role in who wins the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll make a decision,'' Hackett said. ``Last year, we
took the position to wait before the first game, and I don't think
it was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett would like to choose a kicker to allow more time for
holder Ife Ohalete and snapper Joe Boscovich of Westlake High to
become comfortable with whomever wins the job.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of today's scrimmage will be special teams and the
running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be a running team, and we have to stop the run,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the scrimmage will last around 100 plays, and he
will again take a long look at the freshmen and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really important is that the young guys have a chance
to show what they can do,'' Hackett said. ``And where they fit
in.''
</P>
<P>
   NO LONGER A WEAK SPOT: Strongside linebacker Kori Dickerson has
received positive reviews from Hackett in training camp and
continues to hold the starting position even though he was a
defensive end his first two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has improved as much as anyone on the defense,'' Hackett
said. ``Had we done this two years ago, there's no telling where he
could be. But we didn't. Thank goodness he has two years left.''
</P>
<P>
   KELLY REBOUNDS: Wide receiver Kareem Kelly (strained knee) has
resumed practicing and is scheduled to participate in today's
scrimmage. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Invoking the themes that her father offered here
40 years ago this summer, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg stepped out
of her guarded private life and onto the stage of the Democratic
convention on Tuesday night to lend the family name to Al Gore's
presidential campaign and to thank the nation for its support
through what was another difficult year for the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank all Americans for making me and John, and all of our
family, a part of your families _ for reaching out and sustaining
us through the good times, and the difficult ones, and for helping
us dream my father's dream,'' Schlossberg said. ``As I look across
this hall, and across this country, I know that my father's spirit
lives on, and I thank all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is our turn to prove that the New Frontier was not a
place in time, but a timeless call,'' she said, referring to the
signature phrase of her father's abbreviated years in office.
</P>
<P>
   It was a poignant moment for Schlossberg. Her simple agreement
to speak here on Tuesday night _ she has all but disappeared from
public view since her father's assassination in November of 1963
-was a reminder that she is now the only surviving member of the
Kennedy family that occupied the White House from 1961 through
1963. Schlossberg's brother, John Jr., who enjoyed public attention
almost as much as his sister shunned it, died in an airplane
accident last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg was one of four members of the extended Kennedy
family who spoke here on Tuesday, and her official task was to
introduce ``Uncle Teddy,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
She took the stage to the sound of the theme from ``Camelot,'' the
1960s musical that became identified with her father's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprisingly, her remarks were filled with mentions of
her father, who died when she was 6. They were a reminder of the
continuing sway that the Kennedy family in general, and John F.
Kennedy in particular, wields among Democrats, at a convention
where many of the delegates were not even born when Kennedy served
as president.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled her upbringing, saying, ``I was lucky enough to
grow up in a world where adults taught by example. They dreamed
impossible dreams, yet they fought hard each day to make those
dreams come true.''And she reminded the audience that her father,
40 years ago, wanted, ``not only to make better the world that
surrounds us but to dream of something more.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg delivered the speech in a city that is for the
Kennedys both a place of triumph, where Kennedy was nominated to
run for president, and of tragedy, because Robert F. Kennedy was
assassinated just blocks from where Schlossberg spoke on Tuesday
night, while campaigning for president in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she alluded to the losses that her family has suffered
through violence, saying, ``If we believe that we have seen enough
gun violence in our land and in our lifetimes - that guns should no
longer take the lives of those we love - then it is up to us. If we
believe in these things, then it is up to us to elect Al Gore and
Joe Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg was poised, but seemed _ not surprisingly _ a bit
nervous as she looked over a conventional hall crammed to the
ceiling with delegates, onlookers, and reporters. She then
proceeded to quote her father, suggesting that what Kennedy said in
Los Angeles when he was nominated for president was as relevant
today as it was then: ``Our call is to the young at heart,
regardless of age,'' he said. ``The whole world looks to see what
we will do. We cannot fail their trust; we cannot fail to try.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forty years after John F. Kennedy accepted the
Democratic nomination in this city, his daughter, brother, niece
and nephew sought to revive the liberal hearts of his party Tuesday
night by recalling the slain president's legacy and tying Vice
President Al Gore to it.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has offered himself as a president for a new century,
the Democrats, on the second night of their national convention,
staged a festival of the past. It was a carefully choreographed
program intended to reassure loyalists that despite Gore's
overtures to moderates, their party was not drifting from its
principles of inclusiveness and tending to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured a parade of liberal stalwarts, from Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, to former Sen. Bill
Bradley, Gore's vanquished foe. There were also speakers
representing important Democratic constituencies: union members,
abortion rights advocates and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The leftward tableau on stage was at odds with the platform that
the delegates approved Tuesday night, which was a decided play for
the middle, calling for a more potent military, expanded global
trade and for schools to be more accountable for student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If America is to secure prosperity, progress, peace and
security for all,'' the platform proclaimed, ``we cannot afford to
go back.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most stirring speeches were about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was here, in this City of Angels, on a warm summer night 40
years ago, that America first looked across the New Frontier,''
said Kennedy, the most prominent liberal in Congress, in his
prepared remarks. ``A New Frontier, as my brother said, where there
were `unsolved problems, unconquered pockets of ignorance and
prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his brother, Kennedy said, ``How proud he would be
of Al Gore and our party and the new barrier of bigotry we are
breaking down with the choice of Joe Lieberman as the next vice
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   With that comment, Lieberman, watching from the stands, leaped
to his feet and waved.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, the late president's daughter, who in her first
speaking appearance before a Democratic convention said she was
proud that Gore's running mate, Lieberman, had been inspired by her
father to enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as I look out across this hall and across the country,''
Kennedy said in her prepared remarks, ``I know that my father's
spirit lives on.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schlossberg took the stage, the band played the music that
has become emblematic of the Kennedy presidency: ``Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg's address was particularly poignant because she is
the sole survivor of the late president's immediate family. Her
mother Jacqueline, died in 1994, and her brother, John F. Kennedy
Jr., was killed in a plane crash last summer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sentimentality, the symbols of the party's liberal
wing were on stage to address one of Gore's most frustrating
political problems: He is not particularly popular with the base
voters of his party, and, according to surveys, is not nearly as
well liked in his party as Gov. George W. Bush is among
Republicans. Gore is counting on loyal Democrats to flock to the
polls in November. But the longer he has to worry about energizing
those voters, the less attention he can pay to the swing and
independent voters who are crucial for victory.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Democrats' drive to enliven the party, several
delivered intensely partisan speeches that repudiated Bush's
promise of compassion at the Republicans' convention in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the inclusion illusion,'' Jackson said. ``In
Philadelphia, diversity ended on that stage. They could not mention
the words `Africa,' `Appalachia,' or `AIDS' once. So it is good to
be in Los Angeles, to look over this great assembly and see the
real deal _ the quilt of many patches that is America.''
</P>
<P>
   After a riff in which he condemned the Bush clan, Jackson
repeated, ``America: Stay out of the Bushes. Stay out of the
Bushes. Stay out of the Bush,'' prompting the audience to respond
back with the same chant.
</P>
<P>
   The cavalcade of liberals was a decided contrast to the
Republican convention in Philadelphia, when conservative figures,
the most steadfast party loyalists, were largely kept off stage as
the party sought to broaden its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Republicans put Bush's primary opponent, Sen. John
McCain, on center stage, the Democrats on Tuesday night gave a
prime time spot to Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Offering some of his most lavish praise thus far for the vice
president, Bradley said: ``I learned that Al Gore is a man of
wide-ranging intellect, with a deep desire to serve, profound
preparation for the job, a strong sense of loyalty, and a life
infused with tolerance and roots in religious faith. What strikes
me is that what we share is so much more than what we disagree
on.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments were not as anticipated as McCain's had been,
perhaps because Bradley _ who did not win a single state in the
primaries _ is not viewed as much as a force in his party. And
Bradley devoted most of his speech to delivering a pitch for his
party and excoriating Republicans as impostors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't window-dress diversity, we're the party of
diversity,'' Bradley said. ``Don't read our lips. Watch what we do.
Watch what we have always done, what our party values have always
been.''
</P>
<P>
   In hewing to the old-guard theme of the evening, he went on,
``The convictions that Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon
Johnson stood for, that Jimmy Carter is living for even now, that
Bill Clinton still works for, the ideals that Jack and Bobby and
Martin died for.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of the past, the keynote speaker Tuesday night
was only 30 years old: Rep. Harold Ford Jr., from Gore's home state
of Tennessee. His father, Harold Ford Sr., was a longtime House
member who retired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said Ford was a perfect cap for the evening
not only because of his youth, and because he is an African
American who represents diversity, but also because he is a
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The evening was also an opportunity to several Democratic
constituencies to make their case.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, said, ``Because I am a woman,
because I am a mother and a grandmother, because I am an American,
and because I believe in the promise of this nation, I believe that
women must have the right to choose _ and so do Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees union, said, ``By electing Al Gore
and Joe Lieberman, we're standing up against the radical right wing
that would dismantle worker rights, civil rights and women's
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates said they appreciated the tilt of the
speakers. ``There is definitely a left-leaning message to young
people like me and Democrats with a more idealistic agenda,'' said
Allison Friedrich, 22, a delegate from Athens, Ohio. ``It says
they're still fighting for us and that our vote is still important
to Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   While the party put forth a largely united front, there were
some breaks in the Democratic facade. Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin, who has pressed for retooling the campaign finance
system, expressed ``concern and dismay that `soft money' fund
raising has become so much a part of this convention. It should not
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evening was devoted to speakers' tales of attending
the convention at the Los Angeles Sports Arena when John Kennedy
was nominated. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recalled that he was 6 years
old at the time and likened his uncle's New Frontier to Gore, who
he said ``will make history by validating our nation's legacy for
world leadership and environmental responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Jan Harman of California, recalled how, in an
experience that changed her life, she was an usher at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first Democratic convention was right here in 1960,'' said
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland.
``That year, as a young girl, I watched as my uncle, John Kennedy,
was nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of an American dream ``that my uncle and my father,
Robert Kennedy, shared, just as they share a love for the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not achieve that dream unless we have a leaders who
understands the forces at work in our world,'' Townsend said, ``and
works to extend the blessings of prosperity to every American. That
leader is Al Gore.''

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editors: subs 12th paragraph beginning ... But speeches by... 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democrats promoted their traditional cause of
social equality Tuesday, striving to unify liberals &UR;  &LR; behind
presidential candidate Al Gore and rekindle the inspiration of
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton off the national convention stage and
Gore yet to arrive, the podium bustled with the adoption of a
platform and speeches by four Kennedys, three labor union
presidents, abortion and gay rights activists, former Gore foe Bill
Bradley, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and a featured, young black
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In lockstep, they touted Gore as the standard bearer for the
Democratic mission of making sure that rights and riches spread
beyond the privileged few. It was a message that laid the
groundwork for Gore to tell middle-of-the-road voters that there is
a difference of vital substance between the Democratic and
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the day's energy was also spent on uniting the
party's left wing behind the relatively moderate message of Gore
and vice-presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman. National voter
surveys continued to indicate Tuesday that Republicans are more
solidly behind GOP nominee George W. Bush of Texas than Democrats
are behind the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman himself worked the unity message Tuesday. He met here
with black delegates and congressmen _ some of whom had blasted his
stances on affirmative action and school vouchers _ and earned
standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   At a Michigan campaign rally, Clinton, Gore and their wives
presented Gore as the key to continuing the country's economic
growth. It was a symbolic political handoff, with Gore making his
way to the convention and Clinton heading off to the final months
of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Ford Jr., a 30-year-old congressman from Gore's home
state of Tennessee, said in his keynote address that the Democratic
ticket ``believes the future is for everyone'' while Republicans
``would have us go back to a past where prosperity touches only the
well-off and well-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in
previous years, denounced Bush and his family's political record _
``Stay out of the Bushes,'' the civil rights leader chanted _ and
portrayed the White House contest as a stark economic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Infusing the convention with an indignation that few speakers
displayed at the GOP convention, Jackson said Bush and running mate
Dick Cheney would give most of the federal budget surplus ``to
those who are already doing just fine (while) the Gore-Lieberman
team says the money should be used to make America stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This contest is not about race or religion,'' Jackson
continued, ``but about resource distribution and budget
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who lost a bitter primary contest to Gore, delivered an
unrestrained endorsement of Gore and said he would work hard for a
Democratic victory. He urged the party to take up the cause of
campaign reform and said his differences with Gore were small
compared to their harmony on policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't read my lips _ watch what we do,'' the former senator
and basketball star said, arguing that the Democrats practice
diversity and quality while the Republicans only preach it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But speeches by U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy and his niece,
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, 42, provided the emotional center of
the convention's second day.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy _ brother of Edward and father of Schlossberg
_ was nominated for president at a Los Angeles convention in 1960.
Known as JFK, he was assassinated three years into his White House
term. His other child, John F. Kennedy Jr., died in a plane crash
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schlossberg, making her first speech to a Democratic convention,
invoked her father's policy agenda, called the New Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are the New Frontier,'' she said. `` ... As much as we
need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness
and decency'' that Gore would strive to install.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that my father's spirit lives on and I thank all of
you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kennedy said Gore, in contrast with the Republicans,
would expand health care benefits and related consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us not turn back to old policies and old ways that favor
the few at the expense of the many,'' the Massachusetts senator
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Lieberman entered the convention hall to hear
Schlossberg and the senator speak, the convention displayed a film
of JFK telling voters in 1960 that he should not be judged by his
religion. He was the first Roman Catholic president; Lieberman is
the first Jew on a major party presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and environmental
lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also spoke Tuesday. They are the
children of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Democrats stand not just for the success of the few, but
for opportunity for all,'' Townsend said, sounding the evening's
theme of economic equality.

   On-scene Republican officials criticized the Democratic
proceedings Tuesday, just as Democratic leaders slammed the GOP
gathering in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said the Democratic convention has not
seen Gore yet because there is an attempt to downplay Gore's
desire, as expressed in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' to
eliminate the internal combustion engine or tax fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the candidate? He's a shadowy figure in the background
that they seem to want to hide as long as they can,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer criticized Jackson's speech as
``old-style attack politics'' and said that if Gore ``was serious
about renouncing personal attacks and unkind words, he shouldn't
have allowed his surrogates to do it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is campaigning on the idea that the GOP would spread
economic prosperity to all levels of society, not conform to the
stereotype of Republicans serving only the upper class.

   Outside the downtown sports arena where the Democrats met,
political protesters carried out peaceful demonstrations under the
watch of hundreds of police officers equipped to suppress rioting.
There were 45 arrests Tuesday _ mostly of animal-rights advocates,
who banged on windows and painted over signs at clothing stores
that sell fur. On Monday night, police and demonstrators clashed
violently at the end of a rock concert in the designated protest
area.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic platform, tracking Gore's agenda, calls for an
expansive federal role in education, a Medicare prescription drug
benefit, more health insurance programs for children and tax
credits for retirement savings and college savings.
</P>
<P>
   The ``targeted tax cuts'' and programs that would be funded with
the surplus contrast with Bush's call for across-the-board tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The platform supports affirmative action, gun control, a
stronger military defense and stronger enforcement of environmental
laws. It reaffirms support for abortion rights and says that
abortion opponents are welcome into the party.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, told the convention that ``a
value at America's heart is threatened'' because Bush would appoint
Supreme Court judges who would outlaw abortion.
