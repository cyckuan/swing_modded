<HEADLINE> Estrella throws seven-inning perfect game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Syracuse's Leo Estrella threw a seven-inning
perfect game against Indianapolis on Saturday night in his Triple-A
debut.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second perfect game in the International League this
season and 13th in the 117-year history of the league.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Pawtucket's Tomo Ohka became the third pitcher in the
117-year history of the league to throw a nine-inning perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella, 25, needed just 64 pitches to retire the 21 batters in
the 5-0 victory. He struck out five, including the final two
batters of the game.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one hard hit ball in the game. With two outs in
the third inning, third baseman Ryan Freel made a diving catch of
Chad Green's line drive.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella went 5-5 with a 3.67 ERA at Tennessee, Toronto's
Double-A affiliate, before being promoted to Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella, 25, signed with the New York Mets in 1993 as an
undrafted free agent. He was traded to Toronto in 1998 for Tony
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   He went 14-7 with a 3.21 ERA last year at Class-A Dunedin.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe fought back by winning the second game in the double
header 5-4, scoring 5 runs in the third inning off of three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians and the SkyChiefs continue their four-game series on
Sunday at Victory Field.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A day after leaving his start against
Kansas City after just one batter, Oakland right-hander Omar
Olivares was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, (3-8, 6.64 ERA) strained a muscle in his pitching
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever Luis Vizcaino was recalled from Triple-A
Sacramento to take his spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino was 1-1 with a 7.20 ERA in Sacramento. This will be his
third stint with the A's this year. He is 0-1 with a 6.87 ERA in 10
relief appearances with the A's.

By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Even Jeremy Witten's trip to the 1996 College
World Series can't compare.
</P>
<P>
   Witten, a fifth-year senior, swore he would never be able to top
the emotion he felt when Louisiana State beat Miami for the 1996
title on Warren Morris' two-out, two-run home run in the bottom of
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if I'll ever be able to match this,'' Witten
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Cresse singled off Justin Wayne in the bottom of the ninth,
scoring Ryan Theriot from second as the Tigers beat Stanford 6-5
Saturday for their fifth CWS championship since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Theriot slid across home plate, jumped up and tossed his batting
helmet into the air. His teammates surrounded him, then seconds
later, they all made a beeline for Cresse, who was standing alone
between first and second.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration continued as family, friends and fans poured
onto the Rosenblatt Stadium field. The players donned championship
T-shirts, hats and -- in typical LSU style -- Mardi Gras beads.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always knew this was a national championship team and we
weren't going to let it work out any other way,'' Ray Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Barbier wouldn't let them.
</P>
<P>
   Barbier, the team captain, huddled the players together in the
dugout before the eighth inning. He had two questions for them:
''Can you believe? Do you believe?''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates answered him with three runs in the eighth and the
game-winner in the ninth, improving to 5-0 in championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Theriot started the ninth-inning rally with a single to left,
and Mike Fontenot followed with a walk, setting up Cresse's
heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, LSU's leading hitter this season, stepped to the plate
having gone 1-for-12 in the series with eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   He lined Wayne's 0-1 pitch over the infield, and Theriot easily
beat left fielder Andy Topham's throw home.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always want to go out winning the national championship,
and it came true,'' Cresse said. ''Last night, I dreamt about being
up at the plate with winning run on base. I dreamt of a home run,
but I'll take a single.''
</P>
<P>
   Trey Hodges (5-2) pitched four scoreless innings for his second
win of the tournament. He also picked up a save and was selected
the CWS' most outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could really care less who got the win or the MVP as long as
we got the ring,'' Hodges said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne (15-4) gave up four hits and four runs in relief of
starter Jason Young, Stanford's ace.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mark Marquess pulled Young after giving up four hits and
two runs in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The move backfired -- eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne started the fifth inning and seven of his first nine outs
were strikeouts, four of them looking.
</P>
<P>
   But LSU (52-17) tied it at 5 in the eighth inning with two home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We figured we would have to use both of them,'' Marquess said.
''I thought Jason was getting a little tired after two times
through the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this stage, I don't worry about the pitcher of record. I
felt Justin's slider was a good match for them. And it was. They
didn't get a hit until the eighth. But it was a tough decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbier, after fouling off three pitches to stay alive, reached
out and slapped Wayne's 2-2 changeup over the left-field fence to
make it 5-3. It was Barbier's ninth homer of season and third of
the CWS.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne walked Wally Pontiff, and with two outs, Witten lined a
two-run homer into left.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team has a lot of guts,'' said Witten, the only current
LSU player to win three championships. ''We score with two out and
we never give up. There's a lot of fight in this team. That's why
we love this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (50-16) had been undefeated in CWS championship games.
The Cardinal looked to make it 3-0 in title games and claim their
first championship since 1988 with an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Riordan and Topham hit back-to-back singles to start the
fourth. With one out, LSU starter Brian Tallet hit Damien Alvarado
to load the bases, setting up Craig Thompson's grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ripped Tallet's 2-1 pitch on a line over the left-field
fence for his 12 homer of the season. His second career grand slam
gave Stanford a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tallet allowed 11 hits and five runs in five-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''He battled them and left runners on base all day,'' LSU coach
Skip Bertman said. ''He gave us a chance to stay in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the Tigers had little going offensively.
</P>
<P>
   LSU scored two runs off Young in the second, but didn't get
another hit until Barbier's homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Pontiff doubled to lead off the inning and
Cedrick Harris followed with an RBI single. Harris scored three
batters later on Theriot's ground ball to second base.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal took a 5-2 lead in the sixth on John Gall's two-out
single, scoring Alvarado. They left the bases loaded, though, when
Barbier made a diving stab on O'Riordan's ground ball down the
third-base line and threw him out at first.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger defensive play came in the third when Wright
reached over the right-field fence and pulled back what would have
been a two-run homer of the bat of Edmund Muth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole game was up and down but we just kept pecking
away,'' Harris said. ''They had a lot of momentum, but fortunately
it swung back to us. And because of that, we're national
champions.''

<HEADLINE> Seven Die in Texas Car Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN HORN, Texas (AP) -- A car going the wrong way on a Texas
interstate collided head-on with another car, killing all seven
people in the two vehicles, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety said a 1998 Pontiac was
traveling westbound in the eastbound lanes of the Interstate 10,
into the path of a tractor-trailer and a 1994 Nissan that was
trying to pass the big rig.
</P>
<P>
   Public safety spokesman Mike Cox said the truck veered to the
shoulder to avoid the Pontiac, which then collided with the Nissan,
sending both cars spinning in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the Pontiac was identified as Lorenzo Sukis, 33,
of El Paso. Also in the vehicle were Ivana Sukis, 10, and Pablo
Sukis, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the Nissan were Fredo Fernandez, 46, and Maria
Escobar, 51, both of Los Angeles; Carlos Laugart, 45, of South
Gate, Calif.; and an unidentified Hispanic woman.
</P>
<P>
   All were wearing seat belts except for the 5-year-old victim,
who was thrown from the Pontiac, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred around 2 p.m. Cox said the weather was dry
and clear and troopers found evidence that drinking may have been
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Only a grassy median separates the eastbound and westbound lanes
of the four-lane highway, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Safety originally said they thought the
tractor-trailer was towing the Nissan, which was clipped as the
Pontiac tried to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn is about 120 miles east of El Paso.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Natalie Williams scored a season-high 30
points and had 13 rebounds to lead the Utah Starzz to a 70-67
victory over the Washington Mystics on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams added 13 rebounds for her seventh double-double in 10
games for the Starzz, who also got 14 points from Adrienne Goodson.
</P>
<P>
   Utah held a 14-point lead early in the second half and appeared
to be headed for an easy night until Nikki McCray helped Washington
make a game of it. She scored all of her team-leading 20 points in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics, who also got 19 points from Chamique Holdsclaw and
18 from Vicky Bullett, trimmed the Starzz's lead to two points
twice in the game's final 20 seconds -- at 67-65 and 69-67. But the
Starzz held on.
</P>
<P>
   Utah scored 21 points from the free-throw line, while Washington
made just 6-of-12. The Starzz, who led 31-22 at halftime, also
outrebounded the Mystics 35-27.

<HEADLINE> NL Umpire Bonin Sustains Concussion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Umpire Greg Bonin sustained a concussion when
a foul ball knocked his mask off in the eighth inning of Saturday
night's game between the Florida Marlins and Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin was removed from the field by ambulance after he was
placed in a neck brace, then put on a stretcher. He was taken to
nearby Allegheny General Hospital for tests, including a CAT scan.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Larry Young was headed to the hospital after the game
to check on Bonin. Young said that Mark Letendre, the umpires'
director of training, had been in telephone contact with the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin was working behind the plate when Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero
fouled a pitch from Braden Looper straight back. It struck Bonin
with enough force to knock off his mask and immediately force him
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It caught him right on the chin,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida manager John Boles said Bonin '' was out before he hit
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates physician Dr. Joseph Coroso said Bonin was unconscious
for ''just a second or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Young and Coroso said Bonin had sustained a concussion
earlier when he was hit by a bat.
</P>
<P>
   Coroso said that Bonin had a pinched nerve in his neck and that
the force of the ball hyperextended his neck and caused intense
momentary pain.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed 16 minutes while Bonin was attended to by
Pirates doctors, training personnel from both teams and paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin, who turned 45 on Thursday, became a regular member of the
NL umpiring staff in April of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The game was completed with three umpires.

with a 94-81 victory over the expansion Portland Fire on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With stars Lisa Leslie and DeLisha Milton in foul trouble, the

Dixon scored 24 points and Mabika added 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Crawley scored 17 points and Sophia Witherspoon and
Vanessa Nygaard each had 16 to lead the Fire, which lost its fifth
straight and fell to 1-6, the worst record in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who scored just five points in the first half after
picking up her third foul with 6:29 left, finished with 15 points.
Fellow Olympian Milton played just 17 minutes and had three points.

<P>
   The Fire took an early 9-8 lead, but Los Angeles went ahead for
good with an 18-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   Portland cut the lead to 61-60 on a driving layup by rookie
Stacey Thomas with 13:35 to go in the game, but the Fire couldn't
get closer than three the rest of the way.

   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- As residents shoveled ashes from their yards and sifted
through the rubble of their charred homes Saturday, firefighters worked in rain

Mountains. Both fires were about 70 percent contained by midday Saturday,
allowing officials to send some firefighters to work on blazes in California,

   VAN HORN, Texas (AP) -- A car going the wrong way on a Texas interstate
collided head-on with another car, killing all seven people in the two vehicles,
police said. The Texas Department of Public Safety said a 1998 Pontiac was
traveling westbound in the eastbound lanes of the Interstate 10, into the path
of a tractor-trailer and a 1994 Nissan that was trying to pass the big rig.
Public safety spokesman Mike Cox said the truck veered to the shoulder to avoid
the Pontiac, which then collided with the Nissan, sending both cars spinning in

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Tighter Bio Weapons Ban  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday renewed his
suggestion that a new global inspection system be created to detect
and deter cheating on international agreements that outlaw
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appeal came on the 75th anniversary of the
Geneva agreement that first banned chemical and biological weapons
from the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, one of the greatest threats to American and global
security is the danger that adversary nations or terrorist groups
will obtain or use chemical or biological weapons,'' the president
said in a statement. ''The international agreements we have reached
banning these weapons are a critical component of our effort to
protect against this threat.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 nations are parties to the ban, reached at Geneva,
Switzerland, on June 17, 1925. The pact, called the Geneva
Protocol, resulted from worldwide revulsion to the use of poison
gas during World War I and prohibited the use in warfare of
chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Later international agreements tightened the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention barred the development,
production and possession of biological or toxin weapons. The 1993
Chemical Weapons Convention did the same for chemical weapons. The
United States has ratified both agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton renewed his call, first made in his 1998 State of the
Union Address, to strengthen the biological weapons agreement
''with a new international inspection system to detect and deter
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ''significant progress'' has been made at talks in
Geneva toward achieving that goal and urged all participants ''to
work toward the earliest possible conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''On this 75th anniversary of the Geneva Protocol, I call on the
countries of the world who have not yet done so to join'' the
chemical and biological weapons agreements, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting the language of the Geneva agreement, he said it is more
urgent than ever that the ban be ''universally accepted, binding
alike the conscience and practice of nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1925 agreement prohibited ''the use in war of asphyxiating,
poisonous or other gases'' and all related liquids, materials and
devices.

<HEADLINE> Electoral Council Head Flees Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- The president of Haiti's electoral
council has fled his violence-prone country, fearing for his life
after he refused to sign elections results for last month's
contested balloting, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Manus sought asylum in an unidentified foreign mission
Friday afternoon and crossed the border of the neighboring
Dominican Republic Saturday en route to the United States, where
his children reside, two diplomats and a Haitian Cabinet minister
told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials had instructed the 78-year old
former appeals court judge to sign the final election results. When
he refused, they threatened him, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Manus told a friend that he had been told he would be killed if
he did not sign onto the results, which he felt were incorrect, the
friend told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million Haitians cast votes May 21 -- the largest
ever to vote in legislative elections in this county -- despite
threats of violence at the polls. The 60 percent turnout was
largely seen as a demand for the restoration of democracy in a
country long ruled by military and civilian dictatorships.
</P>
<P>
   But publication of the results has been delayed without
explanation, even though election official Luciano Pharaon
announced Tuesday he had sent the final results to the election
council.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, supporters of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide's party set tires aflame in downtown Port-au-Prince to
back their demands that results giving his Lavalas Family Party a
sweeping lead be published immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition charges the elections were set up to ensure a
massive win for Aristide, who is largely favored to sweep November
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Election Observers and the Organization
of American States Observation Mission said the elections were
acceptable despite numerous irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, both observer teams criticized the method used to
determine first-round winners -- calculating the required 50 percent
plus one vote on the basis of votes won by top contenders instead
of all contenders -- as not conforming with electoral law.
</P>
<P>
   That count method gave at least eight of 17 contested Senate
seats to Aristide candidates who otherwise would have to face a
second round of balloting June 25.
</P>
<P>
   In response, most opposition parties called for a boycott and
the resignation of the electoral council, charging mass fraud in
favor of Aristide candidates. On Thursday, two members of the
nine-person council who belong to the opposition resigned in
protest.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military, Coup Leader in Talks  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military rulers and coup leader George
Speight spent Sunday locked in talks, raising hopes of progress in
efforts to end a 31-day government hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations -- the latest round began early Sunday and continued
into the night -- are focusing on the makeup of an interim
government and the release of the hostages rather than restoring
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's meetings, held at a barracks in the capital, Suva,
marked the first time Speight has ventured outside parliament since
his car was sprayed with gunfire on June 12 by soldiers manning a
roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Failed businessman Speight and an armed gang claiming to be
fighting for the rights of Fiji's indigenous majority are holding
31 hostages in parliament including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and other members of his government.
</P>
<P>
   Speight seeks a new government that denies the ethnic Indian
minority political power. Resentment is high among Fijians against
the large Indian minority that dominates business.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the country's military rulers said Speight's group
would be represented on a committee being formed to redraw Fiji's
constitution -- a process aimed at stripping ethnic Indians of
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini also said a
number of people nominated by Speight to serve on an interim
civilian administration were ''acceptable'' to the military, which
seized control 10 days after Speight's May 19 coup.
</P>
<P>
   The military regime's plan is for the interim government to
oversee the recasting of the constitution, then hold a general
election. The process would take about two years.

</P>
<P>
   Yasukawa died Saturday night at a Tokyo hospital, his son
Youichi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yasukawa, who served as ambassador to Washington from July 1973
to January 1976, later became Tokyo's trade negotiator under the
1978-80 Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira Cabinet when Japan's trade
surplus with the United States was already large.
</P>
<P>
   Yasukawa entered the Foreign Ministry in 1939 and served as
director-general of the North American Affairs Bureau, ambassador
to the Philippines and deputy foreign minister before being
appointed U.S. ambassador.
</P>

   Yasukawa is survived by his son and two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Officer Killed in Sri Lanka Blast  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- A bomb exploded in a relatively
peaceful region in eastern Sri Lanka on Sunday killing a local
police chief and wounding two others, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was apparently planted on a roadside in the Ampara
district and was set off by remote control as the police chief
walked by, a police official in the region said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but police
blamed it on Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ampara has long been relatively free from the separatist
campaign launched by the Tamil guerrillas, which is centered in the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has fought Sri Lankan
government forces for 17 years to carve out a separate homeland for
the Tamils, a minority in Sinhala-dominated Sri Lanka. More than
62,000 people have been killed in the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   In a shift in policy on Sunday, the Tigers appealed to Sri
Lanka's Muslim minority to help them in their struggle for a
homeland -- despite past Tiger violence against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tamil Eelam belongs to the Muslim and Tamil people,'' the
rebels said in a statement. ''We urge your cooperation in working
toward strengthening the Tamil-Muslim relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamils, who form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.6 million people,
are mostly Hindus. Muslims, who share the same language as Tamils,
make up 7.1 percent of the population. The rest of the population
is Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Tamil Tigers have forced tens of thousands of
Muslims out of their homes in the northern Jaffna peninsula, and in
1990 guerrillas killed 205 Muslims in two separate massacres.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what prompted the rebels to issue
the appeal to win over the Muslims. The rebels, after a string of
military success, have faced stiff military resistance in the north
during the past four weeks after coming close to their former
capital of Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Japan PM Seeks Public Spending Boost  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A week ahead of parliamentary elections, Japan's
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said Sunday that more injections of
public spending are likely in a bid to boost the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mori said his administration plans to continue spending
aggressively until Japan recovers from its deepest slump in decades
-- a policy inherited from former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who
died of a stroke last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until there are signs of a more stable recovery, I plan to
follow the pace set by Mr. Obuchi,'' Mori said in an interview on
TV Asahi.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said he had told government officials to
prepare to compile a second budget for the fiscal year to pay for
more public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced earlier this month that the economy
grew in fiscal 1999 after two years of contractions, expanding a
modest 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Inflated by government spending on construction and other
projects, gross domestic product grew 2.4 percent between January
and March, its fastest quarterly expansion in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing voters he can keep up that momentum is one of Mori's
most urgent tasks as Japan prepares to go to the polls June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that Mori's Liberal Democratic Party, which has
governed Japan almost without interruption for the last 45 years,

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Stage Night Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels staged overnight
hit-and-run attacks on Russian police stations in the capital
Grozny and three Russian-held regions, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery and warplanes on Sunday continued to bombard
Chechen fighters' refuges in the southern mountains and in the key
Argun gorge near the border with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Two temporary police stations in Grozny and four police
checkpoints in the Nozhai-Yurt, Shelkovskaya and Urus-Martan
districts were fired on overnight, a spokesman for the regional
Russian Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the police did not suffer any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and artillery bombed mountain passes in the
Argun gorge near the Georgian border, aiming at suspected
concentrations of Chechen insurgents, the North Caucasus military
command's press service said.
</P>
<P>
   The Argun gorge is a key rebel refuge and supply route to
Georgia, the only foreign country bordering Chechnya. Russian
forces are trying to wipe out guerrilla bands hiding in the
mountains, using their massive advantage in firepower while
avoiding close combat.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Sharo-Argun, deep in the mountains, federal
troops carrying out a special operation found a rebel weapons cache
with 65 artillery shells, the command's press center said.
</P>
<P>
   As police swept the village searching for rebels, they seized
from the local population 42 firearms, 10,000 cartridges, 264
artillery shells, five grenade launchers and 88 pounds of dynamite,
the center's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained 54 villagers for various violations.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring village of Dekhesty, troops unearthed a rebel
hide-out and found medicine, civilian clothing and military
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were expelled from Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters. They re-entered the republic after Islamic
militants based there seized several villages in the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Hornsby fired as Yonkers schools superintendent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The city of Yonkers has fired its schools
superintendent after he battled the mayor's attempts to get the
city out from under a court order to desegregate its schools.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden firing Friday night of Andre J. Hornsby, the city's
first black superintendent, came just after he announced improved
test scores and the narrowing of a gap in achievement between black
and white students. He had served in the post since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby was pressuring Mayor John Spencer to provide more city
money to cover a deficit he estimated at $34 million. But the
dispute over money was inextricably tied to the fights over race
and schools in a city that has long been a prime battleground for
desegregation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court recently ruled that Yonkers, the state's
fourth-largest school district, was free of the vestiges of
segregation that prompted a 1986 desegregation order. Hornsby had
argued that remnants of racism remained in the system and that the
decision should be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Board members insisted they were not abandoning the goals of
desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   Hornsby left the meeting Friday without comment.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Sign Cease-Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire
agreement in their more than two-year-old border war on Sunday,
opening the way for negotiators to try to draw their bitterly
disputed frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, however, does not bring a definitive end to the 25
months of fighting between the African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, reached under the auspices of the Organization of
African Unity, calls for international peacekeepers to deploy in a
''security zone'' while the negotiators are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, whose country currently
presidents over the OAU, saluted ''the efforts of the OAU, the
African capitals, the United States, the European Union and the
United Nations for (their work toward) increased stability and a
global peace in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia insists it will not withdraw its troops from Eritrean
territory it has seized in the fighting until U.N. peacekeepers are
deployed in a buffer zone along the border.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent officials to Africa to
discuss plans for peacekeepers. Some diplomats have suggested a
force of about 2,000 troops, but others have said nearly double
that many may be required.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians are believed to have
been killed and wounded since war broke out between the two Horn of
Africa countries in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest round of fighting, Ethiopian forces steamrolled
into Eritrea on May 12, capturing land for beyond the disputed
border regions. Eritrea accepted the OAU cease-fire plan in May.
While Ethiopia agreed to it in principle on June 10, fighting had
continued on the ground.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- An avalanche thundered down on a rescue team
working on a snow-covered mountain in northwest Japan on Sunday,
killing four people and injuring five others.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche hit the 5,198-foot Mount Asakusa in Niigata
prefecture (state), while the 42-member rescue team was recovering
a body, said Hiromitsu Shinoda, an official of the Koide police
station in Niigata.
</P>
<P>
   The body was that of a local man who had gone missing Saturday
while gathering wild plants. He apparently fell in a valley and
died of a skull fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche claimed the lives of two policemen, one
firefighter and a volunteer, Shinoda said. Another five rescuers
were injured, two seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche struck near the village of Irihirose, about124
miles northwest of Tokyo. Snowfall on the mountain was
exceptionally heavy this winter.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Rebels Ready To Negotiate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Southern Sudanese rebels said Sunday they
were willing to return to negotiations after the United States and
Kenya began a push for new peace talks to end Sudan's 17-year civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Sudan People's Liberation Army decided to end
their suspension of negotiation, a spokesman said. They had walked
out of on May 8 to protest government airplanes' bombing of
civilian targets in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel our conditions for suspension have been met,'' Samson
Kwaje, the SPLA spokesman said. He said British, U.S. and Canadian
pressure had brought an end to the attacks, adding that the SPLA
was ''willing to come back any time they fix a date.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a protracted series of peace talks was to have
begun May 17 in Nairobi. The talks are mediated by the regional
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), funded by a
group of Western donor, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Harry Johnston, the U.S. special envoy for Sudan, met
with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi, and both agreed
to press for a resumption of talks, Moi's press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Kwaje also said five of 11 non-governmental aid agencies
operating in southern Sudan that had refused to accept rebel
conditions on delivering aid to the region would be allowed back in
after they agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding. He named
the agencies as Oxfam, CARE International, Save the Children-UK,
VSF-Germany and VSF-Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately possible to confirm the report with any
of the agencies on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million people have died, most of them in
war-related famines, since the civil war broke out in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who practice mainly Christianity or traditional
African religions, seek broad autonomy from the Arab, Muslim north.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir and the rebels have agreed in
principle that there should be a referendum on self-determination
in what was defined as southern Sudan at the time of independence.
</P>
<P>
   But the SPLA has proposed that other areas, including the Nuba
Mountains, also be included in the vote, something the government
has rejected.

   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- Government leaders are assessing damage to the

Monday. Rain and snow on the narrow mountain roads kept most firefighters from a

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Government Urges Calm  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Gunfire erupted in the capital,
killing at least one civilian, hospital officials said Sunday,
prompting the government to urge calm and insist security in Sierra
Leone was assured.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating the half-hour shooting on Saturday
night, a statement on state-run radio said, adding that the burst
of fire ''may have been sparked off by some indisciplined use of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   A male commuter was killed when his car was struck by bullets in
a residential neighborhood near downtown, hospital officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. On Sunday morning, the vehicle
lay was still parked by the road in a pool of blood and broken
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government militiamen who also asked to remain nameless said
there were unconfirmed reports that several of their colleagues
were seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government wishes to assure the public that the incident
was no threat to the security of the country,'' the government
statement on the radio said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was heaviest around the main prison, where members
of the rebel Revolutionary United Front have been incarcerated
since they reignited the country's eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeeping troops boosted regular patrols of the capital
Sunday morning and United Nations spokesman David Wimhurst said the
shooting may have been caused by factional rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I know is the events took place and we will get a report
from our people. It could be due to rivalry between various
factions,'' Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels signed a July peace accord but re-started the
conflict in early May when they seized about 500 U.N. hostages and
advanced toward the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages have since been released, and a ragtag alliance of
pro-government forces has been pushing the rebels away from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and
systematically maimed many more in a campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 200 U.N. troops remain surrounded in rebel-held
eastern Sierra Leone where a new group of 21 peacekeepers has also
been detained.

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A follower of the banned Falun Gong spiritual
movement died after his release from detention in a psychiatric
hospital, where he was injected with nerve-destroying drugs, a
human rights group said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Su Gang, a 32-year-old computer engineer, was in fine health
before he was sent to the hospital on May 23 but was weak, slow,
stiff-limbed and unable to eat when he was released eight days
later, the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said,
quoting Su's father, Su De'an.
</P>
<P>
   Su died of heart failure on June 10, less than two weeks after
his release, the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. While
detained in the hospital, Su was forcibly given daily injections of
nerve-damaging medicines, it said.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the petrochemical company in eastern Shandong
province where the Information Center said Su worked confirmed he
died about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the employee, who in a telephone interview gave only his
surname, Zhang, said that the company suppressed news of Su's death
and that he had no detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the psychiatric hospital where Su was held said
he was discharged earlier this month in good health. She refused to
give her name.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Center said at least 22 Falun Gong practitioners
have died of mistreatment and other reasons since the Chinese
government banned the group last July as a threat to public
well-being and to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.

more than two-thirds think the decision to have one must be left to a woman and

</P>
<P>
   The report was carried by the Korean Central News Agency, the
North's overseas news outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said Friday that it was too early to talk about
removing U.S. troops from South Korea, although the leaders of the
two Koreas signed an agreement in a historic summit Wednesday that
calls for peace and an eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit in Pyongyang, the North's capital, had an
immediate warming effect on the relations between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the summit deal, North Korea proposed a meeting of
Red Cross officials this month to discuss the reunion of millions
of separated families. The two Koreas also stopped propaganda
broadcasts across the Demilitarized Zone that separates the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some 10,000 southern veterans expressed support for
the summit as the first step toward the unification. The mood was a
stark contrast to past annual gatherings in which the veterans
strongly denounced the North for starting the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans, who gathered at Seoul's Chamsil Stadium a week
before the 50th anniversary of the June 25, 1950 breakout of the
three-year conflict, also sang ''Our Wish is Unification,'' a song
widely popular in both Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   During his talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung explained in detail why a continued
U.S. military presence in the South was necessary for regional
security, the president's office earlier said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not say how Kim Jong Il responded to the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has long accused the United States of preparing for
a war on the Korean peninsula and called U.S. troops in the South
the reason behind military tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States fought on the South Korean side during the
war, which ended without a peace treaty, leaving 5 million people
dead, injured or missing. Washington still keeps 37,000 troops in
the South under a defense treaty.

<P>
   RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities seized 80 pounds of
methamphetamine estimated to have a street value of $4.5 million
and arrested five people in a raid on a drug lab believed to be
producing commercial volumes for a Mexican cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The methamphetamine was found in powder, paste and liquid form
at three plots in Good Hope, an unincorporated area about 70 miles
southeast of Los Angeles, said Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt.
Steve Rinks.
</P>
<P>
   The lab was producing the illegal synthetic drug in a trailer
and two large wooden sheds, and had been in operation for about a
year, Rinks said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies who seized the drugs Saturday wore face masks and
protective suits because of the danger from explosive and toxic
chemicals used. Rinks said large amounts of chemical waste had been
dumped in several pits, and the cleanup is expected to cost about
$60,000.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Prime Minister Appointed  </HEADLINE>
By SHAFIKA MATTAR
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Abdullah II accepted the resignation
Sunday of the government and appointed a new prime minister who is
known as a keen supporter of economic reforms, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Abu Ragheb, 54, will replace Prime Minister Abdur-Ra'uf
Rawabdeh, whose resignation had been widely expected following
criticism of him in parliament. A petition signed by lawmakers in
April had urged Abdullah to dismiss Rawabdeh's government for
failing to deliver on promised political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ragheb was asked by the king to form a Cabinet, and he has
begun consultations with various officials and lawmakers, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Abu Ragheb is
expected to keep control the ministries of foreign affairs,
finance, trade and industry, tourism and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will comprise economists and technically
oriented experts to face Jordan's ''economic challenges,'' the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ragheb's pro-business attitude is expected to address
businessmen's displeasure with Jordan's strained ties with Iraq,
which has resulted in lower foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is known about Abu Ragheb's views on Israel, with
which Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994. Relations with Israel
are a sensitive issue in Jordan, where about 60 percent of its 5
million people are ethnic Palestinians. Abu Ragheb is of
Palestinian descent.
</P>
<P>
   The Amman-born Abu Ragheb graduated from Tennessee University in
the United States in 1967 with a degree in civil engineering. He
was industry and trade minister in 1991 and energy minister in
1995-1996. He was trade and industry minister again in 1996 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   He did not hold any post in Rawabdeh's government. That
government was the first appointed by Abdullah after he ascended
the throne in February 1999 following the death of his father, King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ragheb, who has been a lawmaker since 1993, was head of the
economic and financial committee in parliament and a member of the
Royal Economic Consultative Council.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Horn of Africa Pact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said the agreement by
Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities in their border war is a
''breakthrough'' and he hopes the two countries can ''realize their
potential in peace instead of squandering it in war.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord reached Sunday in Algeria after more than two weeks
of talks does not bring a definitive end to the 25 months of
fighting that has left thousands of dead in the Horn of Africa. It
does allow a reprieve while negotiators delineate the bitterly
disputed frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a breakthrough which can, and should end the tragic
conflict in the Horn of Africa,'' Clinton said in a statement
Sunday. ''It can, and should permit these two countries to realize
their potential in peace, instead of squandering it in war.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he hopes their agreement to end the fighting
''also signals their commitment to build the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea should use the next round of talks to
produce ''a final, comprehensive, lasting agreement, so they can
get on with the work of pursuing democracy and development for
their people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethiopia and Eritrea are America's friends. If they are ready
to take the next step, we and our partners in the international
community will walk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has asked his special envoy to the talks, former
national security adviser Anthony Lake, to return to Algiers to
work with the Organization of African Unity, which mediated the
accord, on the next round of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Police Urged Vs. Assad Kin Permit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish police urged the government last
year to deny the exiled brother of Syria's late president Hafez
Assad a residency permit on grounds that his bodyguards were
troublemakers, but officials gave him one anyway, a newspaper said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The government ruled that Rifaat Assad had not done anything
wrong himself, and granted him a one-year permit that expires in
November, El Pais said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also said Spain's government was irked last week when
Rifaat, living in the resort town of Marbella, declared himself the
rightful heir to Syria's presidency following his brother's death
and said he would challenge Bashar Assad, Hafez's son and
hand-picked successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not allow any foreigner residing in Spain to make
comments that might jeopardize the stability of a country with
which we maintain cordial relations,'' El Pais quoted a Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were not available Sunday to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rifaat Assad, 63, has been living in Marbella off and on for
more than a decade, and is said to have several businesses and
extensive real estate holdings there.
</P>
<P>
   Assad has a diplomatic passport because technically he remained
Syria's vice president even though he had been exiled after trying
to overthrow his brother in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   When Hafez Assad stripped him of that post in 1998, the passport
became invalid and Rifaat had to apply for residency in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish police unit that handles visas and immigration
issues urged Madrid not to grant Assad a residency permit, citing a
number of violent incidents involving his bodyguards, El Pais said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1990, Assad's head of security and three aides were
convicted of robbing a restaurant in Marbella. The judge said their
goal was to terrorize the owner into selling the restaurant to
Rifaat Assad.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1989, some of Assad's bodyguards pointed guns at
photographers trying to snap shots of Assad dining inside another
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, on September 2 of last year, six Syrians
including Assad's son Sirwan were arrested for hitting a policeman
during a scuffle. They also faced weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warning from police, Spain's Interior Ministry
granted Assad residency.
</P>
<P>
   All his papers were in order, he has financial means to support
himself and Assad himself had not run afoul of the law, a ministry
official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Syria's ruling Baath Party opened its first
conference in 15 years to elect Bashar Assad party leader and
declare his candidacy for president, putting him closer to
succeeding his father. The gathering was held a week after Hafez
Assad, who took power in a 1970 coup, died of a heart attack.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A majority of Americans believe abortion is murder, but
more than two-thirds think the decision to have one must be left to a woman and
her doctor, according to a Los Angeles Times poll released today. The poll is
full of responses that seem contradictory. Sixty-five percent of those
questioned oppose a constitutional amendment banning abortion but only 43
percent support the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. More than half of the 57
percent of respondents who think abortion is murder also believe women should
have the right to choose. The Times surveyed 2,071 Americans by telephone from

<HEADLINE> Albright Tries Resolving Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- The United States has stepped in to
resolve a dispute between Lebanon and the United Nations over
Israel's troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon, the government
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud several times until about 4 a.m., said a statement
issued by Lahoud's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has refused to accept the United Nations' verification
that Israel has completely withdrawn from the country. Lebanon says
Israel still occupies pockets of its territory. On Sunday, Lebanese
and U.N. cartographers set out on foot to inspect some of the
disputed points.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Lahoud denied press reports that the
government had accepted the U. N. certification following his
telephone conversations with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon insisted that it will not give its consent before the
(Israeli) withdrawal is first verified by its team and the U.N.
team,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's rejection of the U.N. verification is a setback for
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had hoped to discuss the
next steps to achieve peace in the Middle East during his trip to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon will consider the Israeli withdrawal to be incomplete
if the Israeli violations on its internationally recognized border
are not eliminated. It will not accept a fictitious line as a
substitute for the international border,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is expected to dominate Annan's meetings with
Lebanese leaders in Beirut on Monday. It has also delayed the
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli pullout May 24, Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas, who fought Israeli forces for 18 years, have moved into
the former occupied zone. On Saturday, Hezbollah warned it would
resume attacks on Israel's north if the Jewish state does not give
up tracts of land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, supported Lebanon's stand. Annan
and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali held talks in Tehran, where
Annan stopped on his way to Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council reached a tentative
agreement to endorse the U.N. verification of the Israeli
withdrawal. The council held a marathon 10-hour session Saturday,
including a conference call with Lahoud, Albright and others, U.N.
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of the south in
1985 to establish a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping
troops were charged with verifying the Israeli pullout. They are
also required to help the Lebanese army -- when it is eventually
deployed -- restore security and authority in the border zone.

<HEADLINE> White Man Begins Trial in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- When the first pipe bomb exploded,
students at Florida A&AMP;M University were startled, but not in fear.
No one was hurt and the damage was slight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sept. 1, the usual grind of a just-started year
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, another pipe bomb exploded on campus, this time
accompanied by a racist phone call to a local television station
warning: ''This is just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no injuries, news of the threat spread fear
across the predominantly black college campus. The school's once
idyllic city-on-a-hill atmosphere was transformed into a compound
of ID checks, police checkpoints and bomb sweeps of the buildings
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, FAMU President Frederick Humphries said the
12,000-student campus was trying hard not to adopt a siege
mentality. But as he surveyed a phalanx of police walking across
the quad just before a potentially frightening fall football
Saturday, he admitted: ''It's playing with the very life of our
university.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb scares ended in late October after the arrest of an
out-of-work former embalmer. On Monday, Lawrence Lombardi, 42,
faces a jury that will decide whether he is guilty of planting two
bombs in campus buildings and carrying out a hate crime. If
convicted, he could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The federal trial was moved about 200 miles west of the
university to Pensacola because U.S. District Judge Robert L.
Hinkle feared local jurors could be swayed by concerns about race
relations in Tallahassee
</P>
<P>
   But as prosecutors seek to convict Lombardi, a former Marine who
once had a snack delivery route that took him to the FAMU campus,
the fear among students has faded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard a conversation about the bombing in so long,''
said Derric Heck, a senior architecture major from Brunswick, Ga.,
and president of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as vice president, Heck spent days meeting with
college administrators about security concerns after the
explosions. But as his last year of college draws to a close, Heck
said he and his peers have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   For Humphries and others who have lived through racial violence
before say they will be watching as the justice system wrestles
once again with race-based hate.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people will be paying attention to this court case,''
Humphries said. ''People are paying attention with an eye toward:
When is this kind of stuff going to end? And when are we going to
respect each other?''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case has been kept secret and most of the
court file in the case is sealed. The federal judge in Tallahassee
who made that decision said some of the material is unlikely to be
admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will not comment on the case, and Lombardi's
attorney, Tim Jansen, also said last week he couldn't comment
before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi, whose only previous run-in with the law was a long-ago
DUI, has maintained his innocence. During a pretrial hearing,
Jansen said the government's case against his client was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence he in fact manufactured any item,'' Jansen
told the judge who ordered Lombardi held in prison until the trial.
''They can't prove he made the device, they can't even prove he was
at FAMU.''
</P>
<P>
   Police painted Lombardi as a racist whose former co-workers told
them he doesn't like black people and frequently used racial slurs.
Detectives said they were led to Lombardi after former co-workers
identified him from a photo taken at a home improvement store and
recognized his voice from a tape of the call to the TV station.

U.N. verification that Israel has completely withdrawn from the country. Lebanon
says Israel still occupies pockets of its territory. Lebanese and U.N.
cartographers set out on foot today to inspect some of the disputed points.

Clinton Praises Horn of Africa Deal

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today said the agreement by Ethiopia and
Eritrea to cease hostilities in their border war is a ''breakthrough'' and he
hopes the two countries can ''realize their potential in peace instead of
squandering it in war.'' ''This is a breakthrough which can, and should end the
tragic conflict in the Horn of Africa,'' Clinton said in a statement. The accord
reached today in Algeria does not bring a definitive end to the 25 months of
fighting that has left thousands of dead. It does allow a reprieve while
negotiators delineate the bitterly disputed frontier.

Poll Finds Abortion Views Conflicted

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A majority of Americans believe abortion is murder, but
more than two-thirds think the decision to have one must be left to a woman and
her doctor, according to a Los Angeles Times poll released today. The poll is
full of responses that seem contradictory. Sixty-five percent of those
questioned oppose a constitutional amendment banning abortion but only 43
percent support the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision. More than half of the 57
percent of respondents who think abortion is murder also believe women should
have the right to choose. The Times surveyed 2,071 Americans by telephone from
June 8 through Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Albright Presses Lebanon Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
pressed Lebanon on Sunday to accept the United Nations'
verification of Israel's troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Albright called Lebanese President Emile Lahoud several times
until about 4 a.m., said a statement issued by Lahoud's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has refused to accept U.N. verification that Israel has
completely withdrawn from the country. Lebanon says Israel still
occupies pockets of its territory. On Sunday, Lebanese and U.N.
cartographers set out on foot to inspect some of the disputed
points.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Lahoud denied press reports that the
government had accepted the U. N. certification following his
telephone conversations with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon insisted that it will not give its consent before the
(Israeli) withdrawal is first verified by its team and the U.N.
team,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's rejection of the U.N. verification is a setback for
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had hoped to discuss the
next steps to achieve peace in the Middle East during his trip to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon will consider the Israeli withdrawal to be incomplete
if the Israeli violations on its internationally recognized border
are not eliminated. It will not accept a fictitious line as a
substitute for the international border,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is expected to dominate Annan's meetings with
Lebanese leaders in Beirut on Monday. It has also delayed the
deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli pullout May 24, Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrillas, who fought Israeli forces for 18 years, have moved into
the former occupied zone. On Saturday, Hezbollah warned it would
resume attacks on Israel's north if the Jewish state does not give
up tracts of land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, supported Lebanon's stand. Annan
and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali held talks in Tehran, where
Annan stopped on his way to Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council reached a tentative
agreement to endorse the U.N. verification of the Israeli
withdrawal. The council held a marathon 10-hour session Saturday,
including a conference call with Lahoud, Albright and others, U.N.
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of the south in
1985 to establish a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping
troops were charged with verifying the Israeli pullout. They are
also required to help the Lebanese army -- when it is eventually
deployed -- restore security and authority in the border zone.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Ends Ottey Drug Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey,
facing a two-year ban after testing positive for the steroid
nandrolone, will learn her fate later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio Reineri, spokesman for the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, said Sunday no decision was expected quickly
on her arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, a former world 200-meter champion and one of the most
decorated athletes in the sport, tested positive at a meet in
Switzerland in July 1999. She denied taking the drug and was
cleared by her national federation.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF refused to accept the Jamaicans' ruling and sent her
case to its arbitration panel. Ottey appeared before the three-man
panel in a closed-door hearing Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone is a steroid that is easily detectable in standard
drug tests. But there has been a spate of positive nandrolone cases
around the world over the past year, prompting speculation that the
drug is contained in nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The debate (in the hearing) focused on some scientific data,
the ability of the body to produce nandrolone and some legal
arguments,'' Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel chairman, Christoph Vedder of Germany, has said the
case could be an important test for sports law regarding
nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey, winner of 34 individual medals in major international
championships, hopes to compete in the Sydney Olympics at 40.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the IAAF panel held a final hearing on Cuban high
jumper Javier Sotomayor's positive test for cocaine. That ruling
also is expected this week. Like Ottey, Sotomayor would face a
two-year suspension if found guilty.

<HEADLINE> 11 Arrested in East India Massacre  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Police have arrested 11 suspects in the
massacre of 34 low caste people in India's poorest and most lawless
state, a news report said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police raided hide-outs belonging to the banned Ranvir Sena, a
private militia financed by upper caste landlords, in Aurangabad
district, 95 miles southwest of state capital Patna, Press Trust of
India news agency quoted Inspector-General of Police Neelmani as
saying. Neelmani uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for Saturday's killings. But
police officials said the massacre, the third in less than two
weeks, was in retaliation for the killing of 12 upper caste people.
</P>
<P>
   Caste-related killings are quite common in Bihar state between
the Ranvir Sena and communist guerrillas belonging to the People's
War Group and the Maoist Communist Center.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police went on alert in the strongholds of communist
rebels who are expected to take revenge for the massacre by
attacking upper caste landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Police urged the federal government to send 400 soldiers to
strengthen security in vulnerable areas, United News of India news
agency quoted the state interior secretary, U.N. Panjiyar, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 black-garbed gunmen, suspected to be members of the
Ranvir Sena, stormed Miapur village early Saturday and executed a
young girl, seven boys, 19 women and seven old men, said M.V. Rao,
police superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers fought a gunbattle with several armed villagers
for 2&AMP;frac12; hours until the residents ran out of ammunition.

<HEADLINE> Docs Remove Iran Reformer's Bullet  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Doctors have removed a bullet from the neck
of a leading reformer who was shot and critically wounded last
March in an assassination attempt, a close aide said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian was discharged from the hospital after the
surgery Saturday and has returned home, said the aide, who
identified himself only as Tajik.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet had been lodged close to his spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is improving day by day but still cannot make a speech. He
can talk in the form of short sentences,'' Tajik told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, a city councilor and a close confident of reformist
President Mohammad Khatami, was shot in the head March 12. Saeed
Asghar, who police say fired the gun, was caught, tried and
sentenced to 15 years in jail. Four others received three to 10
year prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, who is considered the architect of Khatami's popular
reform program, is widely believed to have been the victim of an
intense power struggle between Khatami's reformist allies and
hard-liners desperate to cling to power despite their unpopularity.
</P>
<P>
   Many reformers have criticized the trial of the alleged
attackers, saying the court made no effort to uncover the
masterminds behind the shooting. They have accused the hard-liners
of ordering the attack on Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian's paper, Sobh-e-Emrooz, was one of 18 reformist
newspapers that were shut down over the past two months as part of
an unprecedented media crackdown by the hard-line judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Tajik said Saeed Mortazavi, the judge in charge of the hard-line
press court, has summoned Hajjarian to court to answer
press-related charges against him but said Hajjarian would ignore
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would certainly not attend the court because he is unable
to make a long speech,'' he said. He did not say when Hajjarian was
summoned to the court.

<HEADLINE> Goats bred with spider gene to live in old Air Force weapons buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - About 150 goats that have been bred
with a spider gene are to be housed on 60 acres of a former Air
Force base here.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal-based Nexia Biotechnologies, Inc., plans for the goats
to arrive Tuesday. The company said up to 1,500 genetically-altered
goats may eventually live there. Fifteen weapons-storage buildings
were converted - by adding light and feeding water lines - into
animal holding pens for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel the site ... is a real adequate site and is in a very
secure setting,'' Isabelle Trombley-Summers, Nexia site director of
agricultural affairs, told the Plattsburgh Press-Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The goats have been bred with a spider gene so their milk
provides a unique protein. The company then plans to extract the
protein from the milk to produce fibers - called BioSteel - for
bulletproof vests, aerospace and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Spider silk has a unique combination of strength and elasticity
with an ultra-lightweight fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Nexia obtained the exclusive right to patents
resulting from spider silk research at the University of Wyoming.
The agreement included an upfront payment for the university,
funding for research and development expenses plus royalties on the
sale of silk-based products.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Nexia announced the birth of two ''BioSteel goats.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Trombley-Summers said, Nexia will have a conventional
breeding facility at the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corp.
site, with bunkers housing both male and female goats. About five
people will be employed there.
</P>
<P>
   The goats will usually remain in pens and the building will be
fenced into separate areas that allow them to exercise and go
outside for light, Trombley-Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Trombley-Summers assured Plattsburgh's Town Planning Board that
they will maintain high environmental standards at the facility and
have spoken with the State Department of Environmental Conservation
about the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no problem with that,'' Codes Enforcement Officer
Donald Lee said of environmental and health standards.
</P>
<P>
   He said there's enough room to spread goat manure, and the goats
won't be near the Saranac River or any streams.
</P>
<P>
   State DEC officials did not return calls placed over the
weekend.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks Terror Advice From Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators wanted to know from the expert on
international terrorism if any of the seven countries the United
States accuses of exporting terror had improved its record. The
answer: Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That may have surprised those in Congress who insist on
preserving the four-decades-old trade embargo against the communist
country 90 miles from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the response from Paul Bremer, chairman of the National
Commission on Terrorism and the State Department's former top
counterterrorism official, at a hearing was not news to a small but
growing band of lawmakers seeking to normalize trade and other
relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal senators plan to consider Tuesday would establish a
commission that would, among other things, evaluate whether the
United States should continue to view Cuba as a military threat.
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of the amendment to a massive defense
authorization bill, the answer comes easily: No.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to face the reality when it comes to Cuba,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can do it in Vietnam, if we can do it in Korea, if we
can do it in China, places where we've had real hostility, we ought
to be able to do it in a country like Cuba,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd, and others hope
to translate new American interest in Cuba generated by the Elian
Gonzalez case into growing support in Congress for dismantling U.S.
barriers against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The push for closer ties with Cuba, however, runs right into the
political reality of an election year in which Congress and the
White House are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., gives a ''big thumbs
down'' to Dodd's proposed commission, Lott spokesman John
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, he doesn't want to take any steps which would lead
to increased trade with a despot in Cuba like Fidel Castro,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, D-Conn., recognizes the long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stunned, in a way, that even this idea has provoked the
kind of opposition it has,'' Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member commission would examine the military threat issue
and a range of other U.S.-Cuban topics and would make
recommendations to the next president in the spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest supporters will vote against it -- but only
because Sen. John Warner, R-Va., does not want the defense bill
cluttered with more amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has
advocated such a commission for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Does he believe Cuba is a military threat to the United States?
''I do not. I don't know that I ever did,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing positive about the whole Elian Gonzalez affair
is that the whole of America woke up to something -- that our policy
hasn't dislodged Castro,'' Warner said. ''Yet our whole
relationship with the hemisphere here is affected by this war of
words between the United States and Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Public sentiment is slowly changing and softening toward Cuba,
contends Craig Johnstone, head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's
international division.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Senate, even before the Elian case, demonstrated
it was ready to ease the embargo,'' Johnstone said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited last year's overwhelming Senate passage of a measure to
ease the embargo for food and medicine, which the House later
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee sought to revive the
food-and-medicine waiver earlier this year. Anti-Castro forces have
blocked a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   While Johnstone realizes the Dodd amendment may not pass, ''I
think the purpose of it is to highlight the fact that we still have
an embargo. As Al Gore found out, the more attention there is to
the Cuba issue, the more likely people will understand the embargo
isn't accomplishing what it was set up to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on disproportionate political clout of Florida's
Cuban-American community, Gore broke with President Clinton and
sided with Elian's Florida relatives and said a family court should
decide the boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The most outspoken critics of the Castro regime dismiss Dodd's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that this is a serious issue, but his proposal is so
transparently biased that it's silly,'' said Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla. ''It's so blatantly designed to determine a particular
outcome in a presidential election year that it's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd sees promoting close ties with Cuba as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''All over the globe people are making an effort in this new
millennium to reach out and find a new basis on which to have a
relationship, and it's long overdue that we tried the same thing in
this hemisphere, and specifically with regard to Cuba,'' Dodd said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Seats Likely To Shift by 2020  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By 2020, New York stands to lose five House
seats while California, already the largest state delegation with
52 members, would add nine if current Census Bureau population
projections hold true, a private statistical group predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 25 of the House's 435 seats could shift between now and
2020, with the South and West gaining at the expense of the
Northeast and Midwest, researchers at the Population Reference
Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a continuation of recent population trends,'' said Mark
Mather, an analyst at the nonprofit, Washington-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group forecast the size of states' House delegations based
on population projections for 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --California, already No. 1 with a population of 32.6 million,
could grow by 17 million over the next two decades. The state could
gain one seat after this year's census and nine seats by 2020,
increasing the delegation from the current 52 to 61.
</P>
<P>
   --New York's delegation stands to drop from 31 now to 26 in 2020,
even though statisticians estimate the state's population will have
grown from 7.6 percent between 1990 and 2020, from 17.9 million to
19.3 million. By comparison, California's predicted growth rate is
52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Also projected to lose seats by 2020 are Pennsylvania (four),
Michigan and Ohio (three each) and Illinois (two). Their current
size: Pennsylvania with 21 House members, Illinois with 20, Ohio
with 19 and Michigan with 16.
</P>
<P>
   --Forecast to add House members are Texas (five), Florida (three)
and Georgia and Arizona (two each). Their current size: Texas with
30 House members, Florida with 23, Georgia with 11 and Arizona with
six.
</P>
<P>
   --Montana, which has one at-large representative now, would gain
a second seat after this year's census and would keep the seat
through 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be careful we don't exaggerate the influence and
the corresponding lack of clout because a state loses numbers in a
congressional head count,'' said G. Terry Madonna, political
science professor at Millersville University in Millersville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''While more is better, I'm not convinced you'll have a small or
medium-sized state that doesn't have significance in national
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Brace of the Washington-based Election Data Services Inc.,
which projects House seats no more than 10 years ahead, said,
''Overall, this shows trends of what might be potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem you have in projecting way out to 20 years down
the road is that there's a lot of things that can happen in
between,'' he added. ''Long-term projections should be treated only
as potential change.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Brace's forecast of the 2000 reapportionment shows
Georgia keeping the House seat that Mather projects Montana would
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to look far enough in the future so that you have
some exciting change to look into, but not too far off so that it's
not beyond the lifetime of the people who are interested in it,''
said John Hagga, another analyst at the Population Reference
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brace's count is based on 2000 census population projections,
while Mather's forecast for 2000 is based on 1999 population
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a distribution of House seats as
fairly as possible among the states, based on census data, every 10
years. For many years, the House of Representatives has been fixed
by law at 435 members. That means that when one state gains a seat,
another must lose one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that this process -- known as
reapportionment -- must be based on actual, raw population figures,
instead of statistically adjusted data.
</P>
<P>
   Those raw figures from the 2000 census will be released by Dec.
31, and the House seats will be reapportioned soon after. Mather's
analysis projected reapportionment after this year and in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, eight seats could change states after this year's
count, and 25 by 2020, Mather predicted.

<HEADLINE> Cyclists Battle Highway Authorities  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To a worn-out or distracted driver veering off
a long, lonely road, a rumble strip is a life-saving wakeup alarm.
</P>
<P>
   To a bicycle rider, however, the ridges and gouges dug into the
highway's shoulder amount to a butt-wearying, teeth-rattling
annoyance. Worse, riders say, a rumble strip can trap a tire and
pitch the rider off the bike, possibly into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides are not ready to rumble over rumble
strips, highway officials want to install more strips while
cyclists want the expansion controlled and, in some cases,
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone is not paying attention because they are picking
the phone off the floor, that's driver error,'' said Susan
Notorangelo of Sharon, Wis., a veteran competitive women's distance
rider.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not an advocate of rumble strips at all -- not short ones
or long ones,'' Notorangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Notorangelo and her husband, Lon Haldeman, are record-setting
transcontinental cyclists who organize and lead cross-country bike
tours for highly trained cyclists. When possible, Notorangelo likes
to keep her riders on the shoulder, safe from motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   That's not always possible when rumble strips are cut into the
shoulder, because the strips were made wide to rattle the vehicles,
she said. Grooves can be 6 to 8 inches, but a bike tire typically
is only an inch wide, and deep grooves can catch a tire, she said:
''It's very, very hazardous to the riders.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, rumble strips use so much shoulder that the rider
has too little left to ride upon, and is forced into the traffic
lane, Notorangelo said. ''You can't ride on the rumble strips
because it's a hazard and you can't ride on the road because the
motorists are mad at you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when rumble strips don't hog the shoulder, they grab the
best part, said Paul Balaguer, tour director of The Denver Post's
annual weeklong Ride the Rockies expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The strips are placed close to the fog line, the white line that
separates the roadway from the shoulder. This is the part of the
shoulder that's most likely to be free of debris, because wind
generated by passing cars and trucks blows away the trash, Balaguer
said.
</P>
<P>
   With a rumble strip abutting the fog line, the cyclist is forced
to the part of the shoulder nearest to the edge of the road, even
though that's where pebbles, broken glass and other rubbish most
commonly are blown, Balaguer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumble strips save lives, said Rudy Umbs, chief of safety design
in the Federal Highway Administration. About 15,000 people die each
year in what are termed ''single vehicle running off the road''
accidents, he said. Where rumble strips are used, they can cut
deaths by 20 to 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rumble strip is one part of the solution, along with better
signage and highway design, and alert, well-rested drivers, Umbs
said. A typical location is on a straight, long road with little
traffic -- a highway on which it is easier for drivers to take their
eyes off the road, even to fall asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, highway safety officials want to be attentive
to cyclists' needs, Umbs said.
</P>
<P>
   The League of American Bicyclists, a riders' group, accepts
rumble strips, but wants highway officials to make the strips more
cyclist-friendly. It has the support of Rep. James L. Oberstar of
Minnesota, a cyclist and ranking Democrat on the House
Transportation Committee. Oberstar has asked the head of the
Federal Highway Administration, Kenneth R. Wykle, to look for
alternative designs and to see how the strips affect cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Several states are developing new designs that still rattle
motorists while not unduly shaking cyclists, Umbs said. California
highway officials recently presented data on a shallower design
that seemed to be acceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada also has been installing rumble strips, but cyclists have
complained that the strips are too deeply grooved. A spokesman for
the Nevada Department of Transportation, Scott Magruder, said the
agency will take their complaints under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   However, the department also has a duty to save the lives of
drivers and passengers -- and this includes cyclists, when they are
not on their bikes, Magruder said.

<HEADLINE> Football Player Now Health Crusader  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY NUSSBAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPPER ARLINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- Stefanie Spielman's husband gave
her a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Spielman, a former Ohio State All-American, had been
sidelined from the Buffalo Bills with a neck injury and was about
to announce he was taking a year off to be with his wife and two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   He asked her what he should say: family reasons, health
concerns?
</P>
<P>
   ''Immediately, I saw an opportunity to be a health advocate. I
said 'Tell them I have breast cancer,''' Stefanie, 32, said
recently while speaking at a forum on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two years later, a fund established by the Spielmans has
brought in almost $1.3 million, and the couple continue to speak
around the country raising awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've struck a chord with people in terms of their devotion
to each other and their willingness to share their experience
publicly in the hopes of helping others,'' said Mary Yerina,
associate director of development at The James Cancer Hospital and
Solove Research Institute in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Yerina solicits and administers donations to the Stefanie
Spielman Fund for Breast Cancer Research, of which 100 percent goes
for research at The James.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Stefanie was three months pregnant and detected a lump
during a self exam but figured it was pregnancy related. She later
miscarried and, in a follow-up exam, mentioned the lump to her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Months of treatments followed, with the public looking in. When
Stefanie shaved her head rather than wait for her hair to fall out,
Chris had his head shaved. Stefanie made public appearances smiling
beneath the brim of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement set off a rapid set of events. The advertising
agency for the Big Bear grocery store chain was among the first to
contact the Spielmans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought, like everyone, what a great story that was,'' said
Ron Foth Sr. of Ron Foth Advertising in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   On the Spielmans' suggestion, the fund was created in September
1998. Customers were invited to donate a dollar or more to get
their name on a paper football to be posted in about 65 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became an emotional display of support,'' Foth said. ''It
became almost like wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   A goal of raising $250,000 in one year was met in the first four
months. Soon others began donating, from peewee football players
who shaved their heads for pledges to schools organizing walks and
runs. The fund has come to represent donations from about 1,700
individuals and companies, Yerina said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spielmans held a luncheon in April to honor champions in the
lives of cancer survivors. That brought in $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteerism has been a way of life for her, Stefanie said. Her
late father was a doctor and her mother has been a lifelong
volunteer. Besides, Stefanie, a former television magazine show
host, enjoys taking on projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone handles health issues differently. In my case, I was
sick with breast cancer,'' she said. ''I was not ashamed, and if I
had any bit of time left in my life, I'd be damned if I was gonna
sit around and feel sorry for myself. I was going to go out and set
an example. Most importantly, set a good example for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, the Spielmans faced yet another life-changing
event when Chris suffered a violent hit in an exhibition game while
playing for the Cleveland Browns. Two days later, he announced he
would no longer play.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 years in the NFL, Spielman finds himself being more
recognized now that he devotes time as an advocate for cancer
research and awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been really rewarding, so you almost feel you have a
calling to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spielman also works as a studio analyst for Fox Sports Net's NFL
pregame show, and spends a lot of time working out, golfing and
playing with their children, Madison, 6, and Noah, 4.
</P>
<P>
   Stefanie helped form a support group for women ages 25 to 40 and
also answers questions on her experience through a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hoyt, owner of Over My Head, a store in the Columbus
suburb of Upper Arlington that caters to cancer patients and where
the support group meets, said Stefanie has helped educate younger
women who might not have seen themselves as candidates for breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Among those women is Mindy Long, 29, of Dublin. Long had been
nursing her daughter and detected a lump after becoming pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really wasn't like what you would think of a lump, it was
more of a thickness,'' she said. She dismissed it as a consequence
of nursing and being pregnant until she miscarried in September
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience sounded much like Stefanie's.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of her mother, who had read an article about
Stefanie, Long went to the doctor and was diagnosed with breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have gone in, but probably not as early as I did,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse practitioner Joanne Lester, who works for Stefanie's
doctor, said she continually hears from people who have been
touched by the Spielmans' story.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you hear her talk, she just goes right to your soul,''
Lester said. ''They're genuine people who have a passion for a
cause here and they're in a good position to try and turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefanie is in remission and continues regular checkups. The
fund could eventually expand to screening and other areas, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see it has great potential to reach out even more,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Aimed at Stormwater Runoff  </HEADLINE>
By LEON DROUIN KEITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Water quality officials want cleaner
California beaches to begin at home -- and at gas stations,
restaurants and ''big box'' stores.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed rules in the Los Angeles area could require owners of
many new and renovated structures in Southern California to take
measures to keep rainwater out of storm drains or treat the water
before it enters the system.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the state, the rules would apply to hillside
houses as well as developments of 10 homes or more. The rules could
affect thousands of developments a year, forcing improvements like
detention ponds that could add thousands of dollars to construction
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect has angered some residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't even imagine where I would put something like that,''
said James Martin, a retired university professor who owns a
two-bedroom hillside home in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won't have to follow the rules because he doesn't intend
to make major changes to his property. But when he sells, he said,
he expects the buyers will follow the neighborhood trend and expand
the house, which is perched in the San Gabriel Mountains with views
of the Los Angeles basin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all want as pure an ocean as we can, but this approach
seems extremely burdensome for the individual,'' Martin said,
adding that cities ought to handle the problem by building holding
ponds that can meet the cumulative needs of several properties.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 Santa Monica Bay study found that 4 percent of people who
swim within 100 yards of a storm drain will suffer at least one
symptom -- cough, ear ailment, sore throat, fever, chills or some
gastrointestinal disorder. The long-term effects of such exposure
have not been thoroughly studied.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, approved by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board, are intended to keep runoff tainted with gasoline,
motor oil, pesticides and human and animal waste from polluting
beaches. More than 30 Los Angeles-area communities are opposed. The
State Water Resources Control Board has final say, but no date had
been set for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Montevideo, a lawyer representing two builders' groups
and cities opposed to the rules, said his clients aren't against
cleaner oceans; they just want an approach that doesn't burden
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The rules require the diversion of three-quarters of an inch of
rainwater. Someone with an acre of paved property will have to
figure out what to do with 27,000 gallons of runoff, Montevideo
said. He added that a detention basin for an apartment complex
could wind up costing more than $8,000 a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates are lower. Dennis Dickinson, executive officer
of the Los Angeles water quality board, said the changes will add
about 1 percent to the cost of a development -- or $5,000 to a
$500,000 home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is, are we going to leave a legacy to future
generations of inherently polluting design, or do we start dealing
with that now and trying to avoid it?'' Dickinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some actually see savings in the rules, which could affect more
than 16,000 new homes a year in Venture and Los Angeles counties.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Cornet and her husband created a 69-acre development in
Davis, known as Village Homes, that allows rainwater to percolate
into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Narrow streets, graded land, channels and ponds encourage the
soil to absorb rainwater at the 220-house, 40-apartment
development. Its success has earned praise from groups as varied as
the Natural Resources Defense Council and the National Association
of Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
   The system cost $700 a unit less than conventional storm drain
systems and proved to be more effective when a flood hit after the
development was completed in 1981. Not only did the development not
flood when neighboring areas were inundated, it soaked in other
communities' runoff, she said. Cornet, now the executive director
of the nonprofit Local Government Commission in Davis, said Village
Homes' example has not drawn many imitators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to get developers and city planners to think of
doing anything other than what they've always done,'' she said.
''It must just be the fear of the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules affect more than housing developments and
hillside homes. Also included are car repair shops, gas stations,
restaurants and parking lots with 25 or more spaces. Any
development next to or that discharges stormwater directly into
environmentally sensitive areas also would be subject to the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rules focus on new development, it will take a while
for them to significantly reduce coastal pollution, said Michael
Stenstrom, director of the University of California-Los Angeles'
Institute of the Environment. The changes, he said, are ''little
steps for little feet.''

<HEADLINE> Mobile Ads To Hit the Streets Soon  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The advertising industry's latest vehicles may
soon be passing you on Main Street and parking outside your
neighbor's house at night.
</P>
<P>
   Several California-based companies are paying drivers to wrap
their personal cars in ads touting products like ice cream, juice
bars and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's job is simple: Drive to and from work, pick up the
kids, run errands -- and be willing to be a traveling billboard.
Some companies are offering free use of a new ad-wrapped car,
others are paying $300 to $400 a month to allow the wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call it another example of creeping -- and creepy --
commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's next -- to pay people to have ads tattooed on their
foreheads?'' asked Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media
ecology at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say they are giving average folks a chance to
express themselves and cash in on advertisers' mad scramble to draw
attention to their brands amid a crush of competing messages on
billboards and buses as well as radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason a person shouldn't be able to advertise for
a product they like,'' said Keith Powers, who founded San
Francisco-based Myfreecar.com in October.
</P>
<P>
   He has matched advertisers with about two dozen drivers in
California and plans to branch out to other major markets. The
company has ads printed on adhesive vinyl that is applied to a car
from bumper to bumper.
</P>
<P>
   Take Linda Morrison's yellow 1999 Volkswagen Beetle, for
example. It's been wrapped since mid-April in advertising for
Mobile Engines, a San Jose, Calif., company that provides services
like movie schedules and reviews for customers of wireless Web
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, 59, said she avoids wearing commercial names on her
clothes but she likes the attention she gets on her daily drive
down Sunset Boulevard and through Beverly Hills to her job as a
college administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ''My car was cute as the dickens before, and the advertising
just makes it cuter,'' she said. The money she gets for having her
car wear the ad covers her monthly auto loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Boyle, chief executive of Mobile Engines, said cars like
Morrison's are inexpensive alternatives to billboards, which can be
hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fernandez, another VW Beetle driver, has spent the past
eight months driving ads for Jamba Juice Co. around Los Angeles,
from the post-production studio where he works to the coffee houses
and comedy clubs where he performs at night.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old said he's quit honking or yelling at other
drivers since his car took on the San Francisco juice bar company's
ad because he knows anyone who wants to retaliate will have no
trouble finding him.
</P>
<P>
   Three other companies have wrapped cars on the road or are
planning to start soon.
</P>
<P>
   Autowraps Inc., a five-month-old company from San Francisco, has
about 125 cars on the road in New York, Minneapolis and several
California markets, founder and president Dan Shifrin said.
Advertisers include the insurance site Lowestpremium.com and
Dreyers Grand Ice Cream Inc., which also sells ice cream under the
brand name Edy's.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Drivead.com and Los Angeles-based
FreeCar.com are also lining up advertisers and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said about 15,000 drivers have applied to Myfreecar.com
since May, while Shifrin said Autowraps has more than 17,500
drivers in its database.
</P>
<P>
   The companies look for drivers whose normal commute takes them
through areas where a sizable number of people see their cars every
day. They check driving records, job history and the car's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Powers also looks for people with the personality to represent
an advertiser. That includes regularly meeting minimum mileage
requirements and keeping the car clean.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said advertisers pay $1,000 to $1,500 a month per car
depending on where the car is being driven, the car model and the
length of the contract. The cars are equipped with a tracking
device to show where and how far they are traveling so advertisers
can be assured they are getting their money's worth.

<P>
   But Leslie Savan, a longtime ad critic for The Village Voice,
said she found it depressing that people were willing to convert
their cars into ad vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sort of sad that we can't draw any lines anymore between
having a private life and a life that is up for sale,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Rep. To Seek Slavery Apology  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bulging mailbags filled with letters laced
with foul language and vitriol arrived at Rep. Tony Hall's office
after he suggested three years ago that Congress apologize to black
Americans for 200 years of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by the onslaught, the Ohio Democrat is reintroducing
Monday his resolution to put a congressional apology on record,
expanded to include a national slavery museum and other activities
related to the study of the pre-Civil War America practice.
</P>
<P>
   The national climate has improved since 1997, said Hall, whose
hate mail came not only from outraged whites but from angry blacks
who said words alone would be a hollow gesture. Hall believes even
if the resolution fails, the discussion it will produce will move
the United States closer to racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six million people were torn out of a continent; separated
from their families; in some cases killed; oftentimes tortured, put
into bondage and families split up; described in our Constitution
as three-fifths of a person,'' Hall, who is white, said in an
interview. ''That whole thing has never had a reconciliation. The
wound is still open.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to do the first thing,'' he said. ''I always felt the
first thing was apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall did not coordinate with black leaders in 1997, and his
effort did nothing but produce significant discussion. President
Clinton was asked about it for months, especially during a tour of
Africa that included a visit to a house where kidnapped Africans
were processed for the journey to America's plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appointed a board to look at racial issues. It
recommended that no apology be given, writing in its final report:
''The apology we must all make cannot be adequately expressed in
words but in actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall is undertaking his latest effort after soliciting ideas
from black religious leaders and discussing it with black
colleagues in Congress. He also selected a kickoff date -- June 19
--that is significant to black Americans. Called ''Juneteenth,'' it
marks the anniversary of the day in 1865 when the last American
slaves were freed.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of a Juneteenth commemoration in Washington are
incorporating into their march and rally the news conference where
Hall will disclose his resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to an apology, the resolution calls for the
government to appoint a commission to examine slavery's legacy;
issue a public school curriculum about slavery; and consider
setting up a scholarship fund. It also proposes a national slavery
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't stop at apology,'' Hall said. ''It gives hope that
there should be something after apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he's convinced the time is right to renew a national
discussion of slavery's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lots happened in three years,'' he said. Examples: the movie
''Amistad,'' about a rebellion aboard a slave ship, a little-known
chapter of American slavery; an Oklahoma commission's
recommendation that survivors of a 1921 race riot in Tulsa be
compensated; and, in Africa, Benin President Mathieu Kerekou's
apologies for his country's participation in the slave trade in the
17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said part of his motivation came from participating in a
December reconciliation ceremony in Benin, which included walking
the route used by African slave traders.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was an eye-opening experience for me to see that,'' Hall
said. ''It was very, very moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's personal immersion in hate came after he introduced the
1997 resolution. Letter-writers called him a communist, socialist
and ''as damn stupid as a bunch of rocks.'' One man calculated $135
million was due him as the descendent of a Texas slave-holder for
loss of property.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never realized how alive and strong this issue was,'' Hall
said. ''I may not still be in Congress to see it, but we'll do this
someday. We will apologize and we will start to heal.''

<HEADLINE> Fire destroys nine row houses, leaves seven families homeless  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Police are investigating a suspicious fire
that damaged nine row houses here, leaving seven families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of one of the homes, who was arrested Saturday
afternoon as he visited the fire scene and accused of assaulting
his girlfriend Friday night, was being questioned about the fire,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began inside the residence of Diane Cribb around 3:50
a.m. Saturday, just 10 hours after her boyfriend, identified as
James Tyrone Hardy, 34, fled after allegedly assaulting her, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cribb and her six children were staying elsewhere when the fire
broke out in their home, which is located in the middle of the row
of nine two-story houses, said Trenton police Detective Dave
Maldonado. Seven of the nine houses were occupied.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported in the two-alarm fire, which spread
quickly through a common attic space running the length of the row,
according to Battalion Chief William Paradiso. But about 30 people
from seven families were left homeless.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformers Urge Rights Respect  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's new reformist legislature warned the
hard-line judiciary Sunday that its ''illegal behavior'' toward the
press has damaged the country's international image, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   A letter signed by 151 lawmakers called on the head of the
judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, to ''put an end to
illegal and politically motivated closure of newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, parliament agreed to discuss a bill to amend the
press law and lift press freedom restrictions imposed by their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   No date has been set for introducing the bill, which was drawn
up last week. The bill will be the first legislative show of
commitment to change by the reformers, who swept the Feb. 18
elections and ousted hard-liners from parliament after 20 years of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was the new parliament's first strong attack on the
judiciary, which has closed down 18 reformist publications, most of
them popular newspapers, over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have promised to give priority to press and political
reforms in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''Illegal behavior of the Tehran Justice Administration toward
the press has not only damaged the judiciary's credibility in the
eyes of the public, but it has also tarnished Iran's international
image,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also expressed ''deep concern'' over the detention of
individuals without meeting the legal requirements and called on
the judiciary to respect the legal rights of detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line judiciary has arrested and jailed several
pro-reform writers and political activists in the past two months
as part of an intense power struggle between reformers, supported
by President Mohammad Khatami, and hard-liners, favored by Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are calling for fundamental reforms in the judiciary so
that the rights of suspects are respected and politically motivated
practices are not applied to individuals,'' lawmaker Ali-Reza Nouri
told The Associated Press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want the judiciary to fulfill its constitutional
responsibilities and respect the rights of citizens,'' said Nouri,
who signed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the laws that have been in place since the 1979 Islamic
revolution are unpopular for restricting personal freedoms, and the
reformist victory in parliament has raised hopes that such laws
will be eased.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their majority in parliament, it will not be easy for
the reformers to get their way. Khamenei is the final authority in
Iran, and all bills passed by the legislature must be approved by
the Guardian Council, a hard-line watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Since his 1997 election, Khatami has eased many social,
political and cultural restrictions that the clerical establishment
seeks to maintain.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Gov't Should Track Hazards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nine in 10 Americans say the government should
make it a priority to reduce diseases caused by the environment and
would support a national program to track and treat them, a survey
finds.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Sunday also found that 90 percent of
Americans consider environmental factors such as pollution, waste
and chemicals important contributors to disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''These numbers tell a very clear story,'' said Jim O'Hara,
executive director of Health-Track, a nonprofit public health
organization that sponsored the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are concerned about environmental causes of chronic
disease and believe their elected officials should do more to track
chronic diseases and their links to environmental hazards.''
</P>
<P>
   Health-Track advocates a comprehensive national approach to
tracking and monitoring links between the environment and health as
a way to prevent chronic disease. It says 100 million Americans
suffer some form of chronic disease at a cost to the nation of an
estimated $325 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates,
found that 40 percent of Americans believe the government routinely
tracks asthma, childhood cancer and birth defects and their links
to the environmental hazards, while 28 percent are not sure.
</P>
<P>
   When told that no such tracking mechanism exists, 84 percent of
the respondents expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 49 percent strongly supported the idea of a ''national
system for tracking, monitoring and responding to'' health threats
caused by environmental factors. Forty percent said they would
''somewhat support'' the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide survey of 1,565 registered voters was conducted
April 20-30. The margin of error for the full sample was plus or
minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Health-Track was established with a grant to Georgetown
University from The Pew Charitable Trusts, a foundation that
emphasizes improvements in the health and the environment.

<HEADLINE> Small city drops recycling, ruse of national commitment  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, N.Y. (AP) - Deborah Cohen hates the high taxes she
pays on her hairdresser's wages. But when her city stood alone and
dropped its costly recycling program in defiance of a state
lawsuit, she knew something much more valuable was at stake: the
future of her 10-year-old daughter, India.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was shocked,'' Cohen said. ''I'm concerned for her future
and her environment.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Michael Jeffers, a college student, hiker and camper who
revels in nature, say they carefully separated and sorted bottles,
cans and newspapers, never suspecting their struggling Rust Belt
city would trash recycling.
</P>
<P>
   But what's happening in Amsterdam, N.Y., like the nation's
commitment to recycling, may be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumblings for years against mandatory curbside
sorting from cash-strapped cities like this one to Los Angeles. The
reasons include rising costs while market prices drop and a growing
concern that recyclables are being dumped in landfills and
incinerators like trash. Yet Amsterdam is the first to drop the
effort that has changed the habits of most Americans since the
first Earth Day three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amsterdam is the only municipality that turned its back on
recycling,'' said Marc Violette, spokesman for state Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer. That office is suing Amsterdam not to exact
fines, but to restore recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with the Amsterdam situation very seriously,''
Violette said ''We don't want other municipalities to violate the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not against recycling as long as it's recycling,''
countered Amsterdam Mayor John M. Duchessi Jr., a Democrat, former
VISTA volunteer and a lifetime firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that dropping the $180,000 recycling program
wasn't, as the state contends, to cut costs. Duchessi said the city
was simply admitting reality - that recyclables were being dumped
in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ''People don't like to wash and sort their recyclables only to
see them dumped in the garbage truck,'' Duchessi said. ''My fear is
that people would develop a disdain for recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a quiet landfilling of recyclable materials,'' said
Jerry Taylor, director of natural resource studies for the Cato
Institute, a Libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''That problem has increased in recent years - reports of it,''
said Brian Taylor, editor of the industry magazine Recycling Today.
He said no one knows what part of recyclable material is
landfilled, but he believes it's a small percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Feldman of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a
Washington, D.C., think tank, said Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
Washington and other cities have seriously considered cutting back
recycling. Public backlashes, however, quickly restored them.
</P>
<P>
   Even the attorney general agrees recyclables are often carefully
cleaned, bundled and sorted only to be mixed with garbage. Spitzer
has introduced legislation that would change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are numerous complaints,'' said Spitzer spokesman
Violette. ''In many cases, those allegations are confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's office is investigating these allegations
statewide. A state survey found 68 percent of municipalities
received complaints that recyclables were trashed.
</P>
<P>
   So why don't more officials follow Amsterdam's lead?
</P>
<P>
   Most often the cost of recycling, which has broad public
support, is buried in municipal budgets, said Jerry Taylor of the
Cato Institute. ''You don't get much at the ballot box to say
you're dismantling recycling and it doesn't matter if it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Enck, an environmental director with the state Attorney
General's Office, said a resident called her office because he saw
the recycling hauler dump sorted material into the garbage truck.
He said he couldn't get his town supervisor or a state agency to
even a call the hauler.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear to us there's widespread public support (in
households) for recycling. It's just become second nature,'' she
said. ''We concede that communities often don't make money (from
recycling), but there are other economic benefits and, besides,
it's the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the problems with this local government recycling
malaise is that in the early and mid-1990s there was a lot of money
for recycling,'' Enck said. But a demand for recycled paper and
cardboard in the Pacific has eased, and other prices have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   However, she insists that when governments consider the cost of
precious landfill space, recycling pays.
</P>
<P>
   State figures that show a steady rise in recycling, which Enck
said appears to be leveling off, are also suspect. When mandatory
recycling began in New York in 1988, local governments did most of
the collecting. Now the work is often contracted and those figures
can reflect what is left at the curbs, not what is left at
recycling plants for reuse. Recycling in New York increased from
claiming 3 percent of the waste stream in 1987 to 42 percent, which
would be one of the best marks nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are also disappointed with local government's
lax enforcement of recycling, either because of a lack of staffing
or because recyclables help meet the needs of an incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   In Amsterdam, the mayor insists his city's stand isn't about
money. He said he expects to reinstate recycling. But the city that
operates on a $17.05 million budget already rejected a low bid of
$188,000 in March. That would have cost each household $20 a year.
This month, city council tabled action on a bid because it was
$70,000 more than the city's $100,000 recycling budget. The
Attorney General's Office promptly filed suit after spending six
months to help the city return to recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thrust really isn't financial,'' he said. ''It was that we
were wasting time and energy to recycle ... We're willing to spend
the money, but not to dump it in the landfill.''

<HEADLINE> Militaries Challenge Civilian Rule  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Army officers overthrow Ecuador's
elected government in South America's first successful coup in more
than a decade. Paraguayan troops fire at the legislative palace
with automatic weapons before surrendering amid a state of siege.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, the armed forces are accused of intimidating opposition
candidates in the presidential election. And Venezuela's populist
president, who once led a failed coup, appoints generals to top
government posts and vastly increases the military's role in
society.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of widespread corruption, soaring crime and the
world's most unequal distribution of wealth, some Latin American
armies are flexing their muscles again amid a perceived failure by
civilian governments to provide justice and a decent quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Latin American militaries are stirring. Other countries
have continued a trend in the 1990s of moving away from the brutal
military dictatorships that dominated most of the last century.
Argentina and Chile, once home to some of the region's worst
military repression, appear to be keeping their armies safely in
check.
</P>
<P>
   But with military rumblings challenging the principle of
civilian rule in at least a half dozen countries, it's becoming
clear the region hasn't yet closed the darkest chapters of its
history.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Latin American landscape, the military is the
institution that people turn to because there is no other: Parties
have been discredited, congress doesn't work and there's widespread
corruption,'' said Michael Shifter, a Latin America specialist at
the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that much of the concern about the military
is concentrated in the Andean region, which has been plagued by
economic slumps, drug-related corruption, electoral irregularities,
a backlash against free-market reforms and, in the case of
Colombia, a guerrilla insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   In Ecuador, military officers overthrew President Jamil Mahuad
in January before being pressured by the United States to return
power to the civilian vice president.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter election campaign in Venezuela is reportedly costing
President Hugo Chavez support in the military and stirring
speculation of a possible coup by officers opposed to Chavez's
perceived attempts to politicize the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Colombia, where the army has a long history of staying
out of civilian affairs, many see the military's role and power
growing dangerously as it is called on to defend democracy against
the rising rebel threat.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, where President Alberto Fujimori last month won an
unprecedented third five-year term in elections widely denounced as
unfair, a once professional army has become increasingly answerable
to Fujimori's shadowy spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''The case of Peru I think is illustrative of what is perhaps
the most difficult civilian-military dynamic that we have in Latin
America today,'' said David Scott Palmer, a Latin America
specialist at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups observing Peru's election accused soldiers
in the southern Ayacucho region of threatening peasants into voting
for Fujimori, whose power rests largely on a cozy relationship with
the army.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Andean region, military stirrings are most apparent
in Paraguay -- a struggling democracy that quelled a coup attempt
last month -- and in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, where some 200,000 people died in a 36-year civil
war that ended in 1996, some military officers are still reluctant
to accept the inclusion of the left in the political process. And
there is continued tension in Nicaragua between an army controlled
by former Sandinista revolutionaries and the non-Sandinista
government.
</P>
<P>
   As Latin America's most troubled lands experience grumbling in
the barracks, some nations with improving economies are showing
real progress in taming once-restive generals. Among them are
Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's military made an extraordinary gesture of conciliation
last Tuesday when it promised to help determine the fate of more
than 1,000 dissidents who vanished after being arrested under the
dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine armed forces, discredited by a murderous 1976-83
dictatorship and a humiliating loss to Britain in the 1982
Falklands war, have also shown great deference to civilian rule in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's Democracy Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- It was a throwback to South America's
military past: Tanks sped through the capital amid bursts of
chattering gunfire. Armed men crept in the shadows. A tank cannon
blasted a gaping hole in the pink facade of the Legislative Palace.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four years, Paraguay's fragile democracy
was under fire -- a coup attempt by mutinous soldiers and police
bent on toppling current President Luis Gonzalo Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   But, threatened with air strikes by forces loyal to the
president, the renegade tank commanders fled on foot after just
four hours. The May 19 coup fizzled, and dozens were detained.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since the Paraguayan military toppled
dictator Alfredo Stroessner, whose 34-year reign was South
America's longest in the 20th century. The shaky democracy that
followed has hobbled from one crisis to another.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is widespread, and poverty is worsening. Gasoline
prices are up, as are fares for public transportation and food
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most Paraguayans view government leaders as ineffective and say
the unsettled conditions make the country vulnerable to political
infighting and coup plots.
</P>
<P>
   Walking amid rifle-toting soldiers during the state of emergency
imposed after the failed coup, Valeria Schussmuller, 21, talked of
her fears her country will never find its way out of the muddle
between dictatorship and democracy: ''Here we are in 2000 and this
is something out of the 1800s.''
</P>
<P>
   With per capita income just above $1,600 a year, some 22 percent
of Paraguay's 5.4 million people live in poverty. The unemployment
rate hovers near 16 percent. Some 300,000 peasants in the
countryside are clamoring for land and many people still depend on
cash-strapped state enterprises for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Paraguay, where half the population lives amid
rolling farm fields filled with corn, beans and cabbage, many are
desperate -- and fed up with the unkept promises of civilian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The peasants work practically for free these days. No
government helps us,'' said Sitto Cabrera, stopping his oxcart
outside Caaguazu, a city 100 miles east of Asuncion. He said he
barely makes ends meet ferrying corn and beans to market.
</P>
<P>
   Some even speak wistfully of the Stroessner days, like cabbage
farmer Efraim Espinola, sitting in his one-story wooden home,
chickens clucking out back on his 3&AMP;frac12; acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am 56 years old and in the Stroessner years we never heard
all this talk of corruption,'' he said. ''Under Stroessner we lived
better. I raised 10 children and always had money in my pocket
after I sold my produce. That would be impossible now.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Call it a political marriage of convenience.
Maryanne Connelly, a candidate for a key seat in the House, and the
Democratic establishment that endorsed her opponent in the June 6
primary say they have made up and are united for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's paper-thin victory over Union County Manager Michael
Lapolla gave her a starring role in the Democratic Party's strategy
to take back the House - even though she was not originally part of
the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leaders of Union County and leading state
Democrats including U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli had lined up behind
Lapolla. And in an unusual move, the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee - the election arm of House Democrats - jumped
into the primary and also backed Lapolla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very disappointed that they got involved in a primary
and felt they should have stayed out of it,'' Connelly said last
week. ''But that's in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   DCCC spokesman Erik Smith said his group was attracted to
Lapolla because of his strong fund raising and because he had the
backing of key Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''What Maryanne Connelly accomplished was
extraordinary. I mean, overcoming the party support and (favored)
ballot position that Mike Lapolla had says a lot more about the
strength of her candidacy than anything else. She certainly
exceeded everyone's expectations. We give her credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee called Lapolla's
defeat ''embarrassing'' for its counterpart group, the DCCC, and
predicted the Democrats would suffer from ''a bitterly divided
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapolla conceded the 7th congressional district contest last
Monday, six days after the election, once the state had certified
the results. Connelly's margin of victory was 295 votes, less than
1 percent of the 32,850 votes cast.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Lapolla congratulated Connelly and pledged to
work for a Democratic victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, there was no love lost among Democrats.
Connelly took umbrage at a Lapolla radio ad portraying her as
flighty and indecisive, enlisting women's groups to call the ad
sexist. And Connelly accused prominent New Jersey Democrats of
pressuring her to leave the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Connelly said last week she is looking to the future, not
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, had a divisive primary in the 7th district,
especially over the involvement of a mysterious outside group that
ran attack ads seemingly designed to help the Republican who ended
up winning, Mike Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates targeted by ''Council for Responsible
Government,'' Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, spoke of ''rumors run
rampant'' that Ferguson campaign consultants were involved with the
group, something Ferguson has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Patrick Morrisey, criticized Ferguson for
''sleazy campaign tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kean Jr., who came in second behind Ferguson, filed a
complaint with the Federal Election Commission against the Council
for Responsible Government, saying the group acted like a political
action committee rather than a nonprofit group because it
''specifically advocated my defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said last week he is confident he has the support of
all three of his vanquished rivals. Kean noted the complaint he
filed has ''nothing to do with Mike'' and he pledged his support
for Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I imagine from what I've heard that they're having a tougher
time unifying the party on their side than on our side,'' Ferguson
said in an interview. ''We're having everybody come together very
nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connelly-Ferguson race is already under a national spotlight
because they are competing for an open seat in a competitive
district. The seat became open when Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley
Heights, decided to run for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   They offer clear distinctions on some major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, an education consultant, favors experiments with
school vouchers, opposes abortion and would consider diverting a
portion of Social Security payroll taxes to privately-run accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, the former mayor of Fanwood, opposes school vouchers,
supports abortion rights and opposes any steps toward privatizing
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson also said his general campaign will include a
gun-control component at odds with many in his party. He said he
supports universal registration and licensing of ''all guns'' and
will detail his proposal later in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Unit Marks 10th Year  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. (AP) -- They've flown helicopters behind
enemy lines to rescue downed pilots, and their members have paid
with their lives on missions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the Air Force Special Operations Command
has specialized in combat rescue, anti-terrorism and psychological
warfare, the kinds of missions that have been on the increase in
the post-Cold War era. And while most of the military has been
downsized in recent years, its numbers have grown.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the kind of people if you're in trouble you'll want to
come and get you. They don't know 'can't' or 'won't,''' said
Herbert Mason, the command historian.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Special Operations Command, based at Hurlburt, is
celebrating its 10th year.
</P>
<P>
   It now has 11,500 active duty, National Guard and Reserve
members at six bases around the world, including Britain, Japan and
South Korea, and a fleet of about 160 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And its people tend to stick around, staying in the military at
rates higher than the rest of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that makes them stay in is that they feel
like they have worthy work,'' said Lt. Gen. Maxwell C. Bailey, the
commander of Air Force Special Operations.
</P>
<P>
   During last year's Kosovo conflict, Special Operations
helicopters dodged heavy gunfire to rescue the only two American
pilots downed behind enemy lines in Yugoslavia. Its transports
dropped 101 million NATO propaganda leaflets, and flying broadcast
stations from a Special Operations Air National Guard unit in
Pennsylvania aired radio and television programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, a year after the command was formed, its helicopters
led the opening assault on Iraqi radar installations in the Persian
Gulf War. They also rescued downed pilots, but lost 14 of their own
crew members when a gunships was shot down over Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Another gunship went down at sea off the coast of Kenya in 1994
in an accidental explosion, killing eight of 14 crew members. The
plane had just taken off from Mombasa, Kenya, for a surveillance
flight over the capital of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Although they did not reach command status until 1990, the air
commandos date to World War II, when specially trained pilots
dropped spies, supplies and leaflets over Nazi-held Europe.
</P>
<P>
   They worked in the Tactical Air Command and the Military Air
Lift Command but their skills didn't become a top priority until
1980, when five airmen and three Marines died in a crash on a
failed mission to rescue American hostages from the U.S. embassy in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The failure prompted efforts to improve special forces --
including the creation of the joint U.S. Special Operations Command
in 1986. The Air Force special operators received command status
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   The command plans to add to its helicopters and planes the new
tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey. The aircraft is innovative, it flies like
an airplane but lands and takes off like a helicopter, but it has
been caught in controversy since a training crash April 8 killed 19
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll give us the ability to go twice as far and twice as fast
as our current helicopter does over a single period of darkness,''
Bailey said. ''And we really prefer to operate in the dark because
we feel like that's where we have advantages over any potential
adversary.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Arrested in Fatal Ohio Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A 17-year-old boy told police he threw a
firework into the duplex where an early morning fire Saturday
killed three children and critically injured their mother,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Sexton Jr. was arrested Saturday night and charged with
three counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of felonious
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''He admitted to us he threw a firework into the house,''
homicide detective Robert Viduya said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Campbell, 38, remained in critical condition Sunday with
second-degree burns over half her body, an Ohio State University
Medical Center spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   She escaped by jumping from an upstairs window. Her children,
ages 4, 2 and 11 months, were trapped inside and died of smoke
inhalation, officials said. Their father was gone from the house
when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors told police Sexton was upset with someone who had been
staying at the house and had threatened to set it on fire.

<HEADLINE> Minerals Bring Little to S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Every day, men carrying tiny
stones walk into unmarked offices across this city of crumbling
concrete buildings and rotting clapboard homes. A safe often squats
in one corner of the room, and a small electronic scale sits on the
desk.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple transaction, a diamond exchanged for a wad of
bills, yet it's the grease that keeps the wreckage of this West
African nation's economy grinding along.
</P>
<P>
   More crucially, the enormous wealth buried in the dirt is the
fuel driving a horrific civil war that has killed and maimed tens
of thousands of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diamonds have been a curse, really,'' Christopher Johns, a
longtime Freetown diamond valuer and consultant, said as a teen-age
militiaman toting a rocket launcher patrolled Johns' street.
''Instead of being a blessing, they're a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that curse can be seen nearly everywhere in Sierra
Leone, from its long history of coups to the mosquito-ridden mining
camps where diggers living on $1 a day and a handful of rice shovel
and sift for their fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you nearly starve and sometimes things are better,''
said John Mariba, who at 45 has spent a third of his life working
the diamond-laced silt near the southern town of Bo, the main
diamond-producing region still in government hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly the curse can be seen in the effects of its eight-year
war: in hundreds of villages burned to the ground, in Freetown
neighborhoods reduced to rubble, in refugee camps filled with
civilians whose limbs were hacked off in rebel terror campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diamonds are what have been fueling the war machine,'' said
Foreign Minister Sama Banya. ''The profits have all been going out
of the country while the rebels have been using the money to fuel
their atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond-financed conflicts are nothing new in Africa. Angola's
decades-old civil war has been powered by its gems, which allow the
UNITA rebel movement to evade an international arms embargo. Congo
is moving toward the second anniversary of its own civil war, a
fight where many of the players -- the government, the rebels and
the foreign armies fighting for both sides -- are deeply involved in
the diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diamonds are a guerrilla's best friend,'' said Paul Collier,
author of a new World Bank study on the role of diamonds and other
commodities in financing conflict. ''Rebel groups need to meet a
payroll without producing anything, so they prey on an economic
activity that won't collapse under the weight of their predatory
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Nourished by Sierra Leone's mineral wealth, the rebel
Revolutionary United Front has seized nearly half the country
despite having almost no popular support. In May, less than a year
after a peace accord was signed, fighting flared again, triggered
in part by the decision of U.N. peacekeepers to move into
rebel-held diamond areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have been propped up for years by Charles Taylor, the
warlord who became president of neighboring Liberia, diplomats and
international observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone is far richer in diamonds than Liberia, yet Liberia
exported almost $300 million worth of the gems last year, compared
to barely $30 million for Sierra Leone, according to the Diamonds
High Council in Antwerp, Belgium. Many of Liberia's diamonds came
from rebel-controlled Sierra Leone, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds have become increasingly important in keeping what
remains of the economy afloat. Even the gems that are smuggled out
-- officials say more than three-quarters leave the country that way
-- are part of an informal hard currency that allows the country to
import food, fuel and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Few dealers take much notice of whether the diamonds they trade
come from government areas or rebel-held regions, which produce the
vast majority of the country's gems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' said one underground dealer, who asked to be
identified only as Mohammed. He snorted at the idea that he would
care.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one comes from rebels, this one from government mines,''
he said sarcastically in his dingy office, waving at a pair of
small stones on his desk. Outside his door, nearly a dozen men
waited to sell him more gems.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the outside world has begun paying attention
to the role of diamonds in Africa's wars. The United Nations is
investigating, and numerous countries are looking at ways to curb
the trade in gems from conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's former colonial ruler, Britain, formally proposed
in early June that an embargo be imposed on the sale of the
country's diamonds. The embargo would make it illegal to buy Sierra
Leonean diamonds, except those with a certificate of origin from
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond exchange in Israel, a major center for expert
cutting and polishing of medium and large gems, announced Wednesday
that it would expel any member who deals in diamonds mined in war
zones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We as the Israeli diamond industry, as part of the
international diamond trade, are not prepared to lend a hand to
subsidizing these wars,'' said Shmuel Schnitzer, head of the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Among Freetown's dealers, few believe a certification plan would
work. The enormous profits that can be made from diamonds mean
there are plenty of people willing to break the rules, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, the Sierra Leonean dealer, produces a pair of uncut
stones from a slip of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes people crazy, always talking 'diamond, diamond,
diamond, diamond,''' he said, smiling. ''That is money.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Ashby Placed on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Right-hander Andy Ashby was placed on the
15-day disabled list by the Philadelphia Phillies Sunday with an
infected blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies recalled Paul Byrd from Triple-A Scranton. Byrd,
who made three starts in the minors and was 2-0 with a 1.73 ERA, is
scheduled to pitch Tuesday at New York. Byrd was 1-5 with a 7.86
ERA with the Phillies before his demotion.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to the disabled list was another setback for Ashby. In
13 starts, the two-time All-Star was 2-7 with a 6.16 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can't get any more frustrating than this,'' Ashby said. ''I
was hoping it didn't come to (being put on the disabled list). I
think it could be something that could clear up quickly but the
doctors don't want to take a chance in (the finger) getting
infected again. This route, I'll be back and won't have the problem
again.''

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Rips Britain Over Thugs  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- While shopkeepers in Belgium
repaired broken windows and English fans cooled off in jail,
organizers of the European Championships assailed the British
government on Sunday for allowing soccer hooligans to travel to the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer's European governing body called an emergency meeting of
its executive committee following Saturday's turbulent
England-Germany game in Charleroi, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   There were some 850 detentions and 56 injuries. Police reported
that most of the injuries were minor, but one English fan was
stabbed in the back and is in hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all those detained were English although some of the
fighting in Charleroi involved German fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fans smashed up bars and shops and damaged cars during battles
with police and citizens in Brussels on the eve of the game. In
Charleroi, police fired water cannons at brawling English and
German fans. Some of the English celebrated the 1-0 victory by
breaking store windows and trashing a McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to see tougher measures with regard to traveling
restrictions for those with football-related convictions,'' British
Home Office Minister Lord Bassam said.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament director Alain Courtois and Brussels Mayor
Francois-Xavier de Donnea wondered why that wasn't done sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody did what he had to do,'' Courtois said. ''But what
has the British government done?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Too many dangerous hooligans reached Belgium,'' de Donnea
added. ''Screening in Britain was not what we expected it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   David Davies, executive director of the English Football
Association, said he supported the zero tolerance policy of the
Belgian police in dealing with hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret any incident,'' he said. ''One is one too many as
far as we are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the zero tolerance policy that is being followed here
and we support it. It is too early for an evaluation, but as far as
any inquiry is concerned we will play our full part.''
</P>
<P>
   British Home Secretary Jack Straw, whose department covers law
and order, said Sunday the problem was wider than
''football-related hooliganism,'' adding that more than drunken
teens and unemployed laborers were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have just been told ... that some of those who have been
sent back are people including barristers and engineers. ... They
go abroad and they cause this kind of mayhem.''
</P>
<P>
   Former sports minister Tony Banks, leading England's bid to land
the 2006 World Cup, urged ''draconian'' measures to stem the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have got to now think in terms of whether we give the
police the power to take away the passports of suspected hooligans,
people we fear will cause trouble and arrest them.'' Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mirror, like every Sunday newspaper in Britain, displayed
photos of men heaving chairs, blood flowing from a man's bandaged
head, police pinning fans to the ground, mounted police charging
fans and water cannons blasting a Charleroi plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph wrote in an editorial that the hooligans
have ''inspired disgust and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The spectacle of baying England hooligans, rampaging yesterday
through the streets of Brussels and Charleroi, is a source of
national shame,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   	   The Sunday Times described how English fans in Charleroi
attempted to burn German flags.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported police saying eight of 10 English soccer
hooligans were on drugs and said ''generals'' who organize the
violence were involved in ''drug trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the nonviolent fans was Kevin Miles, coordinator of
the Football Supporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be few methods of policing less precise than firing
tear gas into a crowded pub and arresting everyone who emerges,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that dozens, if not hundreds, of entirely innocent
English supporters have been arrested and even deported merely
because of where they were.''

<HEADLINE> E-ZPass to replace some toll booths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - The hated tollbooths may soon come down
near the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Toll booths will be removed in the E-ZPass-only lanes at the
George Washington Bridge's lower level and at the toll plaza
leading to the bridge from the Palisades Interstate Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it's a first
step toward eventually allowing users of the electronic toll
collection system speed through toll checkpoints at highway speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at it right now,'' Ken Philmus, the agency's
director of tunnels, bridges and terminals told The Record of
Hackensack for Sunday's editions. ''We have people looking as to
what kinds of issues there would be and how it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   The system would use overhead frames to mount toll-scanning
equipment that could identify a vehicle's E-ZPass tag and deduct
the proper toll from a prepaid account.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system would allow E-ZPass users to drive through the
toll collection area without slowing to 5 mph, as they have to now.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem is the merges at bridge and tunnel
entrances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's infinitely easier to do this on a parkway or turnpike
than on a bridge approach,'' Philmus said. ''We have a lot of local
entrances to our toll plazas, like Fort Lee, and many highways
coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's being done successfully on roads like Highway 407 in
Toronto, and at Biddle's Corner on Route 1 in Delaware, between
Odessa and Wilmington. That's the first place on the East Coast to
use the technology, Delaware officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People absolutely love it,'' said P.J. Wilkins, operations
manager for the Delaware Department of Transportation's toll roads.
''We want all of our plazas to have it. We have people from all
around the world looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the Port Authority expects to award a
contract to remove four toll booths each in E-ZPass lanes at the
George Washington Bridge's lower level and the Palisades toll
plaza. Drivers using E-ZPass would still have to slow to 5 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that could prevent accidents because the toll
lanes will seem more open once the booths are removed.
</P>
<P>
   The work would cost from $2.5 million to $3.5 million, and would
include replacing some 40-year-old toll booths.

<HEADLINE> Report: schools, governments flouting public records law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Municipal governments and school
boards in southern New Jersey are routinely flouting New Jersey's
public records law by failing to release minutes of private
meetings, or keeping such poor notes it was impossible to explain
the need for secrecy in the first place, according to a newspaper
report.
</P>
<P>
   The Press of Atlantic City reported in Sunday's editions that 10
school boards or local governments were unwilling or unable to
produce minutes of their closed-session meetings, while another 33
provided minutes with so little detail that it was impossible to
know what was being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   State law permits schools and local governments to discuss
certain topics in secrecy, such as litigation and personnel
matters. But it also requires them to keep minutes of those
discussions and release them to the public once the need for
secrecy no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we know for sure what is going on, there's no way of
knowing that everything is aboveboard,'' said Harry Pozycki,
chairman of the New Jersey chapter of Common Cause, a citizen
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that some public bodies take a year or
more to release closed-session minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the city of Ocean City and the school board in
Galloway Township, refuse to release anything from a closed session
meeting if one issue from that meeting is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   From reading meeting minutes, Ocean City taxpayers would never
know that it cost them $24,000 to settle a lawsuit against the
school board brought by a guidance counselor who claimed he wasn't
hired because he's white.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes of the April 22, 1998, meeting at which the
settlement was approved refer only to ''litigation,'' and a
''settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that the Avalon Board of Education has
not kept minutes of closed-session meetings since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general ruled in 1998 that closed-session
minutes must contain enough detail for the public to understand
''the reasonableness'' of actions taken by a public agency.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was based on a state Supreme Court decision that
allowed The Press of Atlantic City access to closed-session minutes
concerning the resignation of the executive director of the
Atlantic City Expressway.

<HEADLINE> Russia Delays U.N. on Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Lebanon insisting that Israel still
occupies part of its territory, Russia was delaying a formal
Security Council endorsement Sunday of the U.N. verification of
Israel's pullout from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The council reached tentative agreement on an endorsement
Saturday night after a marathon 10-hour session that included a
conference call with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, diplomats said Russia -- which has close ties to Syria,
the main power in Lebanon -- was under instructions to reject any
text that did not satisfy the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   When a formal open council meeting started Sunday morning to
endorse the U.N. verification, Russia's senior counselor Vladimir
Sergeev asked for closed-door consultations, saying there were some
issues that still needed clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's deputy ambassador Stewart Eldon expressed hope that
the formal meeting would be able to resume extremely quickly,
saying ''the matter is urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is in the Middle East, heading
for Beirut on Monday, and wants the Security Council endorsement so
he can start discussing the next steps toward peace in Lebanon.
These include deploying U.N. peacekeepers and -- most critically --
the Lebanese army to southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, Lahoud called press reports that Lebanon
had accepted the U.N. certification as ''totally untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Lebanon insisted that it will not give its consent before the
(Israeli) withdrawal is first verified by its team and the U.N.
team,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lebanese and U.N. cartographers set out on foot to
inspect some of the disputed points.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss rejected the U.N.
verification of Israel's pullout shortly after Annan announced
Friday that Israel had completely withdrawn from Lebanon. Hoss
repeated his rejection on Saturday, saying Lebanon ''insists on
recovering every inch of its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council endorsement of Israel's withdrawal would put
its political weight behind the United Nations' position, rather
than Lebanon's.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping
troops were charged with verifying any Israeli pullout. They are
then charged with helping the Lebanese army restore security and
authority in the border zone.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's deputy U.N. ambassador, Michel Duval, said the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Lebanon had rechecked five or six positions
and installations Saturday that the Lebanese government raised
questions about ''and has confirmed the withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations wants the Lebanese army deployed to the south
as quickly as possible because Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas,
who fought the Israeli troops for years, have moved into the former
occupied zone and taken de facto control.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla presence in the zone right across from Israel's
border is especially a concern for residents of northern Israeli
towns, who fear guerrilla attacks. On Saturday, Hezbollah warned it
would resume attacks on Israel's north if the Jewish state does not
give up tracts of land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations should be dealt with ... otherwise we consider
the mission of liberating Lebanese territory to be incomplete and
resistance remains our choice to liberate the last inch of our
occupied land,'' Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office welcomed Annan's
declaration, saying in a statement Saturday that it expected the
United Nations to act to ''help restore law and order in the
area.''

<HEADLINE> Western, Southern states forecast to gain House seats in 2020  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - By 2020, New York stands to lose five House
seats while California, already the largest state delegation with
52 members, would add nine if current Census Bureau population
projections hold true, a private statistical group predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 25 of the House's 435 seats could shift between now and
2020, with the South and West gaining at the expense of the
Northeast and Midwest, researchers at the Population Reference
Bureau report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a continuation of recent population trends,'' said Mark
Mather, an analyst at the nonprofit, Washington-based organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group forecast the size of states' House delegations based
on population projections for 2020.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   -California, already No. 1 with a population of 32.6 million,
could grow by 17 million over the next two decades. The state could
gain one seat after this year's census and nine seats by 2020,
increasing the delegation from the current 52 to 61.
</P>
<P>
   -New York's delegation stands to drop from 31 now to 26 in 2020,
even though statisticians estimate the state's population will have
grown from 7.6 percent between 1990 and 2020, from 17.9 million to
19.3 million. By comparison, California's predicted growth rate is
52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -Also projected to lose seats by 2020 are Pennsylvania (four),
Michigan and Ohio (three each) and Illinois (two). Their current
size: Pennsylvania with 21 House members, Illinois with 20, Ohio
with 19 and Michigan with 16.
</P>
<P>
   -Forecast to add House members are Texas (five), Florida (three)
and Georgia and Arizona (two each). Their current size: Texas with
30 House members, Florida with 23, Georgia with 11 and Arizona with
six.
</P>
<P>
   -Montana, which has one at-large representative now, would gain
a second seat after this year's census and would keep the seat
through 2020.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be careful we don't exaggerate the influence and
the corresponding lack of clout because a state loses numbers in a
congressional head count,'' said G. Terry Madonna, political
science professor at Millersville University in Millersville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''While more is better, I'm not convinced you'll have a small or
medium-sized state that doesn't have significance in national
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Brace of the Washington-based Election Data Services Inc.,
which projects House seats no more than 10 years ahead, said,
''Overall, this shows trends of what might be potential.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem you have in projecting way out to 20 years down
the road is that there's a lot of things that can happen in
between,'' he added. ''Long-term projections should be treated only
as potential change.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Brace's forecast of the 2000 reapportionment shows
Georgia keeping the House seat that Mather projects Montana would
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to look far enough in the future so that you have
some exciting change to look into, but not too far off so that it's
not beyond the lifetime of the people who are interested in it,''
said John Hagga, another analyst at the Population Reference
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Brace's count is based on 2000 census population projections,
while Mather's forecast for 2000 is based on 1999 population
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution requires a distribution of House seats as
fairly as possible among the states, based on census data, every 10
years. For many years, the House of Representatives has been fixed
by law at 435 members. That means that when one state gains a seat,
another must lose one.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that this process - known as
reapportionment - must be based on actual, raw population figures,
instead of statistically adjusted data.
</P>
<P>
   Those raw figures from the 2000 census will be released by Dec.
31, and the House seats will be reapportioned soon after. Mather's
analysis projected reapportionment after this year and in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, eight seats could change states after this year's
count, and 25 by 2020, Mather predicted.

<HEADLINE> Lakewood man drowns in Lake Carasaljo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAKEWOOD, N.J., (AP) - A 22-year-old man trying to beat the heat
drowned when he apparently became exhausted swimming across Lake
Carasaljo, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Ramirez, of Lakewood, was swimming with two friends
about 3:20 p.m. on Saturday when he began struggling and slipped
beneath the surface of the large lake.
</P>
<P>
   They were swimming from a beach to a spot on the other side of
the lake where there are no lifeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ''My best guess is - and that's what this is - is that he
probably exhausted himself and couldn't go any farther,'' Lt. John
Garruto said.
</P>
<P>
   When the victim's two friends reached the other side of the
lake, they looked back and saw Ramirez struggling in the water. One
of them swam back to Ramirez, but had to let go because Ramirez was
pulling him under the water.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez' body was recovered about an hour later. An autopsy was
to be performed Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Md. Man Charged With Killing Priest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- A Maryland laborer with a history of
burglary arrests was charged with beating and stabbing to death a
priest who surprised an intruder in the rectory of his church.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Robert Paul Lucas, 25, on a charge of
first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited, proud to have this case closed, but on the
other hand we remain very sad,'' Chief Charles Moose of the
Montgomery County Police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Lucas attacked Monsignor Thomas M. Wells, 56,
after Wells caught him June 8 burglarizing the rectory, where the
priest lived, next to Mother Seton Catholic Church in Germantown,
Md., a suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they are building a strong case against Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a confession from the perpetrator as well as
scientific and forensic evidence,'' said the county's state's
attorney, Douglas Gansler.
</P>
<P>
   He said police found items from the rectory in Lucas'
possession. A boot Lucas was wearing matched a print found at the
murder scene, Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a lawyer called his office Thursday and informed
prosecutors that a former client had named Lucas as the priest's
killer. Police followed and watched Lucas, then arrested him
Saturday in the van where he lived.

<HEADLINE> Richardson Rejects Calls To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting GOP calls he resign over security
lapses, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday there is no
evidence two computer drives with nuclear secrets ever left the Los
Alamos lab or that espionage was involved in their disappearance.
He suggested panicked scientists may have misplaced the devices,
triggering a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The two tapes, found Friday behind a copying machine, were flown
to Washington from the weapons lab in New Mexico. They were being
examined electronically to determine with more certainty if they
had been tampered with or the data compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there's been no espionage. It doesn't appear (the
tapes) left the X Division,'' Richardson said on NBC's ''Meet the
Press,'' referring to the highly secure area of the Los Alamos lab
where nuclear designers work. The two hard drives disappeared from
a vault in the X Division sometime before May 7 and mysteriously
reappeared behind a copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said the investigation was focusing
on ''several'' members of a nuclear emergency response team that
had free access to the vault holding the devices. These individuals
have made ''contradictory statements'' and given ''suspicious''
answers during polygraph tests, said Edward Curran, the Energy
Department's director of counterintelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said all 26 individuals with access to the vault have
had polygraph exams and he pledged that those involved in the
disappearance would face discipline. He declined to rule out
replacing the University of California, which has managed the Los
Alamos lab for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, ''We will know what happened,'' Richardson
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary decried the security breakdown but strongly
defending his attempts over the past year to improve security in
his department's nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   But key congressional intelligence committee members said there
is no assurance the information has not been compromised. Even
though espionage might not have been involved, they said the
incident was an inexcusable breach of security for which Richardson
should be held personally accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Richardson's explanations and defenses were ''fluff
and rhetoric'' and he should step down. ''He's not the man for the
job,'' Shelby said on CBS' Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think ... he's measured up,'' said Rep. Porter Goss,
R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on NBC,
adding that Richardson should consider quitting. Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., also on the intelligence panel, said Richardson should
leave.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did not respond Sunday when he was asked by
reporters as he entered and left church services if he continues to
have confidence in Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Clinton expressed confidence in Richardson, but also
dismay over the latest security flap at Los Alamos. Security
already was a focus for most of 1999 because of former lab
scientist Wen Ho Lee, who was accused of illegally copying secret
files and is in jail awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's frustration was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't get into human heads,'' he said on NBC, criticizing --
as he had often last year -- a ''lab culture'' of not taking
security seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   The two hard drives, each about the size of a deck of cards,
were found missing from the Los Alamos vault on May 7 when two
scientists sought to make sure they were protected from a wildfire
that threatened the lab. The next day the lab was evacuated because
of the fire threat, but no one reported the devices missing until
May 31, prompting an intense investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that while one scientist reported seeing the
drives in the vault on April 7, it remained unclear when they were
last inventoried; they could have been missing longer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the computer drives were found behind a copying
machine down the hall from the vault, officials said. The FBI is
conducting a criminal investigation on the disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Six Los Alamos managers, including the head of the nuclear
weapons program, are now on paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation was focusing on several members of the
Nuclear Emergency Response Team, or NEST, a group of scientists
whose job it is to rush within hours to the scene of a nuclear
accident or terrorist act, find and dismantle a nuclear device. The
drives were part of a response ''kit'' giving detailed technical
information about both U.S. and foreign nuclear devices, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The area where the drives were found had been searched before,
according to DOE officials, prompting suspicion the devices may
have been dropped there on purpose after being kept elsewhere.
Richardson speculated some scientists may have misplaced the
drives, panicked and tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Classified as ''secret'' -- as opposed to ''top secret'' -- the
computer drives did not have to be signed in or out when used,
making it more difficult to determine who might have had them last,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of such tracking brought was criticized by Republican
lawmakers at hearings last week, although the security requirements
for secret information were eased by President Bush two weeks
before he left office in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued that policy of no longer requiring a running
inventory possession of data classified as secret. Richardson said
Sunday that checkout procedures were now in effect at Los Alamos
for such information.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also have questioned why the information on the hard
drives used by the rapid response team had not been upgraded to top
secret.

<HEADLINE> Albright Addresses Graduates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- America must play a leading role to protect the
rights of women and workers around the world, Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright told graduates at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the school's 98th commencement Saturday, Albright
said she was proud of American foreign policy accomplishments in
the Middle East, the Korean peninsula and Northern Ireland. But she
said more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   Albright focused on suffering endured by women, including
domestic violence, mutilation and killings over dowry disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say this is all cultural and there's nothing we can do
about it. I say it's criminal and we each have an obligation to
stop it,'' Albright told the 1,800 graduates.
</P>
<P>
   In recalling her experience as secretary of state, Albright said
she will most remember not heads of state but people victimized by
violence and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been called the world's most powerful woman, but when a
mother dying of AIDS in Africa asked me to be sure her children
were cared for -- I lacked even the power of speech, because I did
not know what I could honestly say,'' Albright said.

<HEADLINE> Activists: Regis in Sweatshop Flap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- First it was Kathie Lee Gifford and sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Now labor activists have accused her morning show co-host Regis
Philbin of attaching his name to a clothing line made by a company
with a history of production at abusive foreign factories.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin appeared at Macy's earlier this week to introduce a
shirt and tie line called ''Regis by the Van Heusen Company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, members of the UNITE garment workers' union
demonstrated inside Macy's near a display of the cotton shirt and
satin tie ensembles that have become Philbin's trademark attire on
his quiz show, ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're giving him a chance not to put his name on clothing made
by a company with ties to labor abuses,'' said UNITE spokeswoman
Jo-Ann Mort.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Phillips-Van Heusen offices in New York was not
returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company was named in a class-action lawsuit
claiming that workers on the Pacific island of Saipan worked in
sweatshop conditions. Phillips-Van Heusen, and other garment
makers, promised to establish a fund to finance an independent
monitoring program and provide money to the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, in response to accusations that her clothing line is
produced in sweatshops, has hired monitors and joined a national
task force that acts as a watchdog for labor conditions.

<HEADLINE> Carrey Exposes Two Sides at Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Carrey showed both sides of his real-life
character at the premiere of his new split-personality comedy ''Me,
Myself &AMP; Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Carrey plays a man whose split personalities -- one
good, the other evil -- fall in love with the same woman.
</P>
<P>
   The rubberfaced comedian displayed his real-life manic side by
clowning outside the Westwood theater before the movie, cavorting
with hundreds of fans for nearly an hour, the Los Angeles Times
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the after-party, which echoed the movie's theme by offering
both ''good'' and ''evil'' attractions, Carrey spent most of the
evening in the ''good'' area with the film's co-writers and
directors, Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the brothers behind ''There's
Something About Mary'' and ''Dumb &AMP; Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''good'' side featured a wholesome array of picnic tables,
barbecues and an ice cream truck. The ''bad'' side came complete
with Las Vegas-style go-go dancers, pounding music and booze.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Sign Accord  </HEADLINE>
By HASSANE MEFTAHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ethiopia and Eritrea agreed Sunday to
cease hostilities immediately in their 2-year-old border war that
has killed, wounded and displaced multitudes, signaling a new
African mission for U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, signed after weeks of tense negotiations in the
Algerian capital punctuated by fighting at home in the Horn of
Africa, opens the way to a definitive peace, allowing for a
reprieve while negotiators delineate the bitterly disputed
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is to redeploy troops inside Eritrea, its much smaller
neighbor, and an international peacekeeping mission is to patrol a
buffer zone on Eritrean territory between the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This accord marks the beginning of the end of two years of
conflict,'' Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Eritrean Foreign
Minister Haile Woldansae said. It is ''the first concrete step
toward peace between the two countries after a useless war.''
</P>
<P>
   Woldansae and his Ethiopian counterpart, Seyoum Mesfin, shook
hands after signing the agreement, reached under the auspices of
the Organization of African Unity, currently headed by Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   The ''cessation of hostilities'' accord falls short of a full,
unconditional cease-fire, which would place severe limits even on
acting in self defense and carry stiff sanctions for any violation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has all along reserved the right to respond to any
Eritrean provocations under a cessation of hostilities agreement,
which places no limits on responding to low-level harassing fire
that often takes place along the front lines even after an
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope is that the adverse party respects the accord,'' said
Mesfin, the Ethiopian foreign minister. He vowed to ''fully take
part in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called the accord a
''breakthrough which ... can and should permit these two countries
to realize their potential in peace, instead of squandering it in
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's special envoy Anthony Lake was present at the signing,
along with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim and EU
representative Rino Seri of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 15-point agreement, the two countries ''will cease all
hostile activity on land and in the air immediately after the
signature of the accord, guarantee freedom of movement and access
to the peacekeeping mission and the respect for and protection of
the members of this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord calls for Ethiopia to redeploy its troops in the two
weeks following the peacekeepers' deployment. However, it set no
date for the start of the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia is to redeploy troops from positions captured after
Feb. 6, 1999, the start of a major offensive, and from
''territories not under its administration before May 6, 1998'' --
the start of the war over the 620 mile border.
</P>
<P>
   However, the accord said ''the redeployment of Ethiopian forces
will not prejudge the final status of contested territories'' -- an
apparent reference to Ethiopia's contention that changes on the
ground should be reflected in a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika called the agreement ''a
source of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   With it, ''Africa has the right to believe in the possibility of
resolving in the same peaceful manner other complex tragedies still
shaking'' the continent, Bouteflika said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday dispatched a team of
experts to Algiers to discuss the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have suggested a force of 2,000 troops, but
others have said nearly double that may be required. U.N.
peacekeepers already are deployed in places like Sierra Leone and
East Timor with a planned Congo mission.
</P>
<P>
   The war has left tens of thousands of people dead and displaced
tens of thousands of Eritreans, with some 80,000 fleeing to Sudan.
The economic costs are equally steep. Military analysts say the two
impoverished countries have spent more than $1 billion on arms.

<HEADLINE> Wall Streeters find boxing is new adrenalin rush  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Every month, well-dressed men like John Oden
leave their climate-controlled offices on Wall Street for a short
limo ride to a lonely Brooklyn warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing suspicious here - they're just searching for new
ways to beat someone at yet another game.
</P>
<P>
   They climb winding concrete stairs and emerge into a cavernous
room. Shouting voices blend with the sounds of fists striking
bodies and punching bags, and the air is thick with sweat. They
peal off silk ties, starched shirts and pressed pants, and change
into nylon shirts and shorts. Assistants tape their hands, strap on
14-ounce or 16-ounce gloves the color of fresh-spilled blood and
attach their headgear.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they slip under a thick rope, and a bell announces it's
''White Collar Sparring Night.'' These men and a growing number of
women, some who compete for deals worth millions or billions in
their day jobs, have found a new form of combat at historic
Gleason's Gym.
</P>
<P>
   ''Boxing is the ultimate sport: It's one-on-one, a mano-a-mano
face off,'' said Oden, a money manager for a billion-dollar firm
who refused to give his age, saying only that he is in his 50s.
''When I am in the ring, I am not even remotely thinking of what
went on in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Oden, a transplanted Texan with the twang to match, took up
boxing eight years ago when jogging and tennis became boring and
the 6-foot-4 executive noticed his stomach beginning to bulge.
Almost instantly, he fell in love with the exhilaration of hitting
- and the anxiety of being hit.
</P>
<P>
   For about a decade, a handful of places like Gleason's have
opened their doors to investment bankers, real estate developers,
doctors, even a New York state judge. Most are people with money to
burn and egos to be stoked.
</P>
<P>
   Gleason's was perfect. The gym opened in 1937 in the Bronx, then
moved to midtown Manhattan before crossing the river to its present
setting in a nondescript warehouse under the Brooklyn Bridge. Jake
LaMotta, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson are just a few of the greats
to break a sweat there.
</P>
<P>
   About 850 fighters now work out at Gleason's, and it still has
its seasoned pros like IBF welterweight champ Zab ''Super'' Judah.
There's a cache of retired fighters, such as Edwin Viruet, who
twice took famed KO artist Roberto Duran the distance, and Olympic
boxer Nikos Michalis Spanakos, who roomed with Ali, then named
Cassius Clay, at the 1960 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bruce Silverglade said the white-collar ''professionals''
are welcomed, even encouraged by the ring pros. In boxing, people
say, fighters share a common trait: Terror.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all go in there with fear,'' Silverglade said. ''There's
not a professional who won't go in their without some level of
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Prefight jitters aren't like the butterflies of other sports.
Oden recalled hyperventilating in his first fight. Some with years
of experience admit still having anxious starts. In most cases,
fear dissipates after the first blow. Not just a glancing shot,
though; it needs a solid shot to the nose - the kind that leaves an
unpleasant flavor in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It becomes fun once you get over that hump,'' said Charlie
Miller, an artist and writer. ''I don't like getting hit, but it
teaches you things.''
</P>
<P>
   On this night, there is all sorts of hitting between Oden and
his opponent, Mark Settembre. Three weeks earlier at another gym,
they were paired in Settembre's first bout. Oden won, and the
48-year-old Settembre trained hard for the rematch because his neck
was stiff for three days - and he wanted some payback.
</P>
<P>
   Settembre, a real estate developer, listened attentively to Tom
Patti, his friend and trainer. Like a majority of the white-collar
fighters, Settembre works outs several times a week, punching bags
until his arms ache and his legs wobble.
</P>
<P>
   Patti, who befriended Mike Tyson at a reform school years ago
and recently trained the disturbed champion for about a year, told
Settembre to duck Oden's left jab and counter with a stiff left.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, and at times awkwardly, the two fighters came at
each other with angry fists. When the bell rang after the third and
final two-minute round, both fighters hugged and held up trophies.
That's right, there's two winners at Gleason's. The gym doesn't
have judges - the $20 entry fee essentially covers the cost of the
gold-tinted keepsake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I abandoned (judging) because it's supposed to be a fun
event,'' Silverglade said. ''When there were winners and losers,
there were zillionaires from Wall Street who would lose and go home
and be really upset about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It might seem strange that Settembre has a trainer, but given
the bank accounts of many of these guys, it only makes sense. So
does the plan to take a handful to London in July, where they will
fight rich British boxers.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone who fights is loaded. Take Tony Pellegrino, a
58-year-old electrician who took up the sport ''because boxing is
in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My father was a contend-ah,'' Pellegrino said. ''He taught me
when I was a little kid, but he never wanted me to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrino began boxing 15 years ago. He fights a dozen times
per year, much to the chagrin of his wife, Carmel, who sits
ringside with 30 or 40 other fans for every bout.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he first told me, I said, 'No, you're crazy, what are you
thinking about?''' she said, grimacing when her husband took a
punch to the gut. ''But he was always a man who worked very hard,
He never did anything for himself and he's made a lot of friends
doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pellegrino could have sustained a severe injury from his
opponent, 34-year-old financial analyst Edwin Calderon. The
younger, stronger and more dexterous Calderon started the fight
with a flurry of punches, but slowed and lessened their effect
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It was an example of most fights. While a few get out of hand,
forcing a referee to step in before anyone gets mauled, most of the
fighters know each other. The gym creates a sense of community, and
civility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just do it to get in shape,'' said Calderon. ''I don't
intend to hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, boxers can get hurt. Broken noses or jaws are always
possibilities, despite the presence of headgear. But the protective
gear generally prevents the face from bruising, and dress shirts
cover up body bruises. A hefty bank roll goes a long way, too, in
easing pain with massage and physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Along with not being rich, not all the fighters are male either.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Mendola just made her debut and complained it had been
against a man. ''I would have liked to have fought a girl,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendola, who as a Long Island nurse usually helps people,
not hurts them, then added: ''I'm coming back for the next one,
though. It's great - it's like a rush.''

<HEADLINE> Blige Wows Crowd at Radio City  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As she opened her three-concert stand at Radio
City Music Hall, Mary J. Blige insisted she was ''just plain' old
Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a little hard to grasp given her glammed-up attire, a
rhinestone bra and hip-hugging pants that showed off her toned
body.
</P>
<P>
   But what made the line from her hit ''Deep Inside'' even more
hard to believe was her dynamic performance, in which she not only
lived up to her moniker as the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul but proved
herself unique in today's R&AMP;B world: a gritty performer who not
only duplicates the vocals on her albums, but greatly exceeds them.
</P>
<P>
   Blige improvised on just about every song, even sounding a
little like a skilled jazz singer as she scatted and freestyled on
numbers like ''All That I Can Say.'' Her voice had its typical
scratchy edge, yet at the same time sounded sweet and enticing.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's sold-out concert, one of the first in her nationwide
summer tour, proved to be a homecoming of sorts for Blige, a
Yonkers, N.Y., native, and the adoring crowding showered her with
love as if she was a long-lost relative. They cheered, sang along
with just about every song, and chanted ''Go Mary, Go Mary,'' as
Blige strolled across the stage like a B-boy rapper.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Blige showed no signs of fatigue as she gyrated while
singing earlier hits like ''Mary Jane (All Night Long),'' and
''Love No Limit.'' She took only a brief respite, leaving the stage
to showcase her four male backup dancers after rapping with Grand
Pupa of Brand Nubian fame on ''What's the 411,'' the title track of
her first album.
</P>
<P>
   She returned in a new outfit -- and wig, changing to blond from
an auburn feather style she had worn at the beginning of the
concert. Her vocal stylings, however, remained the same while she
brought the tempo down to sing some heartfelt ballads. The crowd
was so into the concert at that point that she barely sang ''I'm
Goin' Down,'' letting the ladies in the audience sing much of the
song's lyrics as she shook her head in awe of the crowd
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Blige really brought the house down when she sang songs about
betrayal and hurt, like with ''Your Child,'' about a man who cheats
and has a child with another woman. She sang with all the
appropriate drama, holding her head in her hands, shooting
accusatory glances at the audience and shaking her finger while
singing angrily, ''She said it's your child!'' By the time Blige
finished the set, she was doling out advice to the women in the
audience, urging them to bolt a bad relationship: ''You don't have
to take that,'' she told them, recalling some of her own pain.
</P>
<P>
   But she made sure to go out on a high note, a disco-flavored
''Let No Man Put Asunder'' and the dreamy ''Everything'' as an
encore, during which she professed her love for audience. And at
that point, it was clear the feeling was mutual.

<HEADLINE> Singer Surrenders on Drug Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Christian music singer Michael English
surrendered to authorities on drug charges Friday, three days after
he was indicted, and was immediately released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old singer is facing 12 counts of fraudulently
obtaining the prescription drug hydrocodone, a sedative similar to
codeine. He has said he got addicted to hydrocodone after it was
prescribed to him as pain medication for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Police raided English's Nashville apartment in February after an
investigation showed he and a friend were having numerous
prescriptions filled by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   After the raid, English's manager said he was being treated for
drug addiction and depression.
</P>
<P>
   English shocked the Christian music industry in 1993 when he
returned six Gospel Music Association Awards and acknowledged an
adulterous affair with a backup singer that resulted in her
pregnancy.

<HEADLINE> Director Altman Satisfied With Rep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Altman isn't known for blockbusters
but the 75-year-old director of such freewheeling epics as
''Nashville,'' ''MASH'' and ''The Player'' said that reputation
suits him fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't any filmmaker who ever lived who has had a better
shake than I did,'' Altman said. ''I have never been without a
project of my own. I have never been out of work, and the only
thing I haven't made are these big, popular films. I have never
wanted to and I never will.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, ''Nashville'' kicks off an 18-film retrospective of
Altman's films sponsored by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Most major studios would balk at making 1970's ''MASH'' or
1975's ''Nashville'' today, he said, because of the films'
sprawling narratives, huge casts and satiric treatment of human
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Altman says Hollywood is now more interested in ''toy films''
than adult-oriented fare.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are appealing to the 13-year-olds straight across. And
they don't even do them well. There is no reason why this recent
Tom Cruise film, 'Mission: Impossible 2,' can't be good as well as
have all the action they need,'' Altman said. ''They are making
stuff that won't endure.''

<HEADLINE> Missile Deployment Goal in Doubt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Problems with a booster rocket and other
elements of a national missile defense system seriously threaten
the project's 2005 deployment target date, a Pentagon panel
reportedly has advised Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have been saying privately for months that
the target date, already postponed from 2003, is overly ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   The latest confidential study, reported Sunday by The Washington
Post, warns of a ''substantial schedule risk, but not particularly
high technical risk,'' of a fundamental engineering or scientific
flaw in the system, which is now being tested.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quotes an unidentified senior officer familiar
with the report as saying, ''It is like remodeling a kitchen: It
may not get done by (the date the builder promised), but it will
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   As visualized by Clinton administration planners, the system of
targeting radars, interceptor missiles and high-speed computers
would have 120 missiles in place by 2007 to protect all 50 states
against primitive missiles fired by countries newly armed with
nuclear and missile technology. North Korea or Iran are often
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by retired Gen. Larry Welch, former chief of
staff for the Air Force, gave missile defense developers a ''B-plus
grade for work done thus far'' but reported one apparent shortfall
not previously public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report notes engineering problems in the construction of
the high-speed interceptor missile that is supposed to boost the
kill vehicle into space,'' the Post quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initial testing of the booster has been delayed repeatedly
this year and is now scheduled for September, and yet it is
supposed to be ready for a flight test of the entire system by
early next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Interceptor tests so far have had patchy results. The next
interception is scheduled for July 7. The panel of prominent
scientists and former top defense officials said that test is vital
to the program's next step, President Clinton's decision this fall
whether to start construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all goes perfectly or, on the contrary, if the test is a
complete disaster, the Pentagon should be able to present Clinton
with a clear judgment on the status of the system,'' the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But in the more likely event that some elements of the system
work well and others encounter problems, Pentagon analysts may not
be able to evaluate the test data in time.''

<HEADLINE> Ziggy Marley Denies Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Reggae star Ziggy Marley on Sunday
denied that his band had canceled a concert in Austria this week
because of the European country's government links to far-right
faction leader Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had already told my management that we just wanted a small
tour,'' Marley told The Associated Press. ''I had heard something
about Haider and some Nazi connection, but that's not the main
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Marley is the leader of the Melody Makers, which has won three
Grammy Awards. The band, which includes four of Bob Marley's
children, opens its European tour Tuesday in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The band was booked to perform Saturday at the annual Spring
Vibration Festival in Wiesen, Austria. But last month festival
organizers announced Marley would not perform because he ''does not
want to play in a country with a Nazi in the government,'' festival
spokeswoman Alexander Swoboda said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other musicians and performers have canceled
participation in Austrian events to show their opposition to
Haider, to his praise of the Nazi era and to the anti-immigration
and anti-foreigner stance espoused by the Freedom Party, which
Haider used to lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Marley said that, while he had taken Haider's position into
consideration, it was the group's hectic schedule that forced it to
bypass Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Haider is governor of southern Carinthia province, but holds no
federal post. The Freedom Party joined the government in February,
prompting European Union member countries to impose diplomatic
sanctions against fellow-member Austria.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Celebrates Father's Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- His daughter, Chelsea, at his side, President
Clinton began Father's Day at church. The sermon: The parable of
the prodigal son, who squanders his inheritance but is welcomed
home by a forgiving father.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wearing a navy blue tie, ignored shouted questions
about security breaches at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico. On her way out of Foundry United Methodist Church, Chelsea
waved to reporters and cameramen and exclaimed ''Happy Father's
Day'' before climbing into a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the White House, Clinton, first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Chelsea and several other friends spent a quiet afternoon
together. In the evening, the president hastily called his
entourage together for a trip to a suburban golf course with
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley. Daley was named Vice President
Gore's new campaign chief earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Their game lasted only one hour and five holes after rain cut it
short.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton called golfer Tiger Woods from the White House to
congratulate him on his victory Sunday at the U.S. Open, said
deputy press secretary Jim Kennedy. Kennedy did not know details of
the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to finish the day with his family at a
White House screening of ''The Patriot,'' a soon-to-be-released
movie starring Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the president played golf with his stepfather, Dick
Kelley, and several others willing to brave dark storm clouds and
venture out to a course in Fairfax, Va. In between shots, Clinton
draped his arm around his stepfather's shoulder. Rain cut that game
short, too.
