UNLIKELY ROOKIE PURSUES IMPROBABLE DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Isaiah Kacyvenski has a great story to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It goes beyond the hyperactive linebacker being the
highest-round draft choice ever from Harvard. It goes much deeper
than what a storybook ending it would be if the Seahawks'
fourth-round pick can become the run-stuffing middle linebacker the
team seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a wonderful story,'' coach and general manager Mike
Holmgren said Sunday after the final practice of Seattle's
three-day minicamp. ``It is absolutely wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   But where to begin this saga of a kid from Endicott, N.Y., who
has overcome being the youngest of five children of an alcoholic
father and a mother who died during his senior year in high school?
Who settled on Harvard as a third option? Who became a fourth-round
draft choice despite not even being invited to the NFL scouting
combine? Who unleashed the nervous energy that had built within him
like a mushroom cloud while sitting through the first 118
selections of the draft by running around the block after Seattle
finally selected him?
</P>
<P>
   The best place to start is where Kacyvenski's dream of playing
in the NFL began.
</P>
<P>
   He was 8, and remembers listening to the Chicago Bears' Super
Bowl XX victory over the New England Patriots on the radio because
his father's drinking left no money for a TV _ or, at times, even
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, I went to school and my friends and I started
playing `Kill the man with the ball,' where you throw the ball up
and everyone jumps on the guy who catches it,'' Kacyvenski said
during a break at minicamp, the late-afternoon sun glistening in
the sweat beaded on his shaved head. ``Every day, I'd come home
with torn clothes and grass-stained clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But listening to that game on the radio was the start of the
dream,'' he said. ``This is the dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Kacyvenski's dream will be interrupted while he returns to
Harvard, where he has papers due this week in each of his four
classes _ the making of American governmental policy; historical
studies; linguistics; and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of boring classes,'' he said. ``Usually you get
electives, where you get to take fun stuff. But I used all my
electives to take pre-med requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   He has waited this long, and endured so much:
</P>
<P>
   -- Family life. His father David has been sober for nine years.
But these better times were preceded by turbulent times _ years
when Isaiah was shielded from much of the harsh reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was happening, but I kind of got sheltered from it
by my brothers and sisters. And then I got so much love from my
mother as a kid,'' Kacyvenski said. ``But my dad has turned his
life around. I never get embarrassed. I'm proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah is not his family's lone success story. His sisters are
teachers. One of his brothers is an artist; the other just got out
of the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're my rocks _ my brothers and sisters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- His mother's son. Margaret Kacyvenski died in a car accident
Nov. 10, 1995. The next day, Isaiah played in a state high school
quarterfinal at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' he said. ``Some people might have thought I
was weird, playing in that game. But football has always been
something I could lose myself in. So I played.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened the following year was really weird. While going
through his mother's possessions, Kacyvenski found her Bible, which
included a highlighted passage from Isaiah 49 _ a hymn about a
mother never forgetting her child.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Harvard, Kacyvenski was issued No. 49, making
him Isaiah 49. The Biblical passage still hangs in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   -- The unwanted. The star of this real-life, Rudy-esque tale
wanted to attend the same school as the character who inspired the
movie ``Rudy.'' But when Notre Dame did not have a spot for
Kacyvenski, he committed to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   So how did he end up at Harvard? There are times when Kacyvenski
wonders how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't go to Notre Dame, I wanted to go to a huge
Division I program,'' he said. ``I wanted to go somewhere where
football was pretty important and the players made it their life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got to Harvard, I met guys who were playing football
because they loved it, not necessarily because they had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kacyvenski is one of the square pegs who has found his
niche in the round hole that is Harvard. He will graduate with a
3.2 GPA and has fulfilled his pre-med requirements. Medical school
and becoming a pediatrician are in his future, but only after he
has given football everything he has.
</P>
<P>
   -- The uninvited. When Kacyvenski was not invited to the
combine, he started preparing for his private workout by working
out with a personal trainer _ Mike Boyle, who helped Mike Mamula
prepare for his pre-draft workouts before the Philadelphia Eagles
made the undersized defensive end from Boston College the seventh
pick overall in the 1995 draft.
</P>
<P>
   One problem. It took, and still takes, a four-hour bite from the
middle of Kacyvenski's day to get to Boyle, complete the workout
and return to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But it's time well spent. The 252-pound Kacyvenski wowed scouts
by running 40 yards in 4.52 seconds, doing 30 bench-presses with
225 pounds and popping a 33{-inch vertical jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm truly thankful for everything that's happened to me,'' he
said. ``And I can't stop thinking about what a great opportunity
this is.''

INDIANS' ANGER HITS MARTINEZ WRONG WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ There are some smart men who coach and play for the
Cleveland Indians. I am sure of that. What I'm not sure of is this:
Why did those intelligent people appear to be so ignorant and
thickheaded Sunday at Jacobs Field?
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the Indians' explanation for being angry with
Pedro Martinez, I was embarrassed for all of them. And after
realizing that their logic is not in the minority in the major
leagues, I was embarrassed for all of baseball. The cliche is that
the shrinking strike zone is one of the problems in the game.
That's not true. A major issue is the shrinking mental zone by some
of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Indians and Red Sox cleared their benches twice
during the finale of a spectacular three-game series. The Sox
avoided a sweep with a 2-1 win, and Martinez extended his scoreless
streak against the Indians to 20 innings. But what really upset
catcher Einar Diaz and the rest of his Cleveland teammates was the
behavior of Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't like the way Martinez ``almost'' hit Diaz in the
head in the seventh inning. They didn't like the way Martinez
stared at Diaz in the same inning after striking him out with an
inside fastball. They didn't like it when, during the first bench
clearing, Martinez sat in the dugout. He was eventually invited to
come outside by Scott Kamieniecki and he obliged. He was
accompanied by hitting coach Jim Rice, a man who probably could
transform the 6-foot, 200-pound Kamieniecki into the size of a
wallet in 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, there was a lot of yelling and
finger-pointing from the Indians. They talked and talked, even
though they should have sat down and kept quiet. They also should
have reviewed a copy of the Essential Pedro Profile, a piece of
literature that every team should have on its bookshelf.
Apparently, the Indians don't have a copy. Let's give them some
help:
</P>
<P>
   Martinez loses all humility when he is on the mound. He'll stare
at you when he strikes you out. He'll plunk you when you play games
with him in the batter's box. He is territorial. Inside of the
plate? His. Close calls? Should be his. Sunday he cursed plate
umpire Tim Tschida _ he later apologized _ when he didn't get the
calls he wanted. Or, from his Mound View, the calls he deserved. He
is Pedro Martinez, you are not, and you had better get used to it.
He is bright and thoughtful away from the diamond, but he ain't
trying to be a humanitarian when you are 60 feet 6 inches away.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians still don't understand this. They don't have to like
it, but they should at least understand it. They don't.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Omar Vizquel said it was ``horse (expletive)'' that
Martinez threw at Diaz. Vizquel reasoned that Martinez was trying
to big-time the second-year catcher because he was upset by the two
doubles Diaz hit. I was waiting for him to get to the point, the
point that would make me gasp, but it never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the way he stared at Einar after striking him
out,'' second baseman Robbie Alomar said. ``That was disrespectful.
We have always shown the Red Sox respect, so we didn't think that
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   I was tempted to cut out the lights in the Cleveland clubhouse
and show a movie featuring Bob Gibson and Sandy Koufax. Too many
players in baseball don't comprehend the art of intimidation. They
also don't grasp the psychology of claiming the inside of the
plate, a nebulous area that truly doesn't belong to anyone _ sort
of like the armrest between you and your neighbor on an airplane _
but is often claimed by pitchers. There was a time when brushbacks
and near misses did not inspire complaining and a charge to the
mound. But the truth is that some of today's players, with all
their elbow pads and sense of offensive entitlement, have lost
historical perspective and gone soft.
</P>
<P>
   And some pitchers have lost their minds. Kamieniecki, who made
the Big Ten's all-academic team at Michigan, proved that Sunday. He
said Martinez ``hid'' behind Rice. Is this guy serious? Rice
protecting Martinez doesn't illustrate the pitcher's cowardice; it
proves the coach's intelligence. Why would the Sox allow Martinez
to fight and risk an injury that would end his season? Teams in the
NHL have perfected this logic, by bringing in bodyguards on ice to
protect high-scoring forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only guy talking trash out there was Kamieniecki,''
Martinez said. ``He told me to come out, I came out, and he didn't
do anything.'' Later, Martinez said, ``I don't think Kamieniecki
will be one of the guys that will intimidate me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland silliness affected the Sox in the eighth inning.
In an obvious retaliation for Martinez's near miss, Charles Nagy
hit Jose Offerman in the ribs. Offerman, who is hitting .175,
should have blown a kiss to Nagy and thanked the pitcher for
putting him in a rare place _ on base. Instead, he made a move for
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the eighth, when Martinez hit Alomar in the
thigh and was ejected, the reasoning ability of the 42,065 fans was
altered as well. A chant of ``Pedro Sucks'' began. Martinez should
be proud of this because he now joins the gallery of legendary
athletes (Michael Jordan, John Elway) who have seared themselves
into the memories of northeastern Ohioans.
</P>
<P>
   If Diaz had been hit in the head, this would be a different
story. I don't think anyone can defend throwing at someone and
hitting him in the head. But Diaz was not hit, and didn't come as
close to being hit as he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone throws a 96-mile-per-hour pitch close to you, I'll
bet you'll be a little mad,'' Sox reliever Derek Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is right. A pitch under your chin will anger you, although
several players in baseball history have been angered and not
attempted to pick a fight.

MARTINEZ EJECTED BUT BEATS CLEVELAND AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ To an outsider _ or someone in a Cleveland Indians
uniform _ it might have seemed rash, foolhardy, shortsighted, or
just plain dumb when Pedro Martinez hit Robbie Alomar with the
first pitch of the eighth inning Sunday afternoon, even though
Martinez knew he would be ejected from a game the Sox had to win to
avert a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the Sox clubhouse, where Sunday's 2-1 win over the
Indians was almost secondary to the issues raised by Martinez's
obvious act of retaliation for Indians pitcher Charles Nagy hitting
Jose Offerman in the hip with his first pitch of the top of the
inning, they spoke with one voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a closeness,'' said Mike Stanley, whose seventh-inning
home run ultimately proved the difference in the weekend's third
one-run game between these foes, allowing the Sox to survive Richie
Sexson's home run in the ninth off Derek Lowe. ``We do so much
together. It is like a family, we spend so much stinking time
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live and die for one another. And if we have to fight for
one another, we fight for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no punches thrown by either side, though benches
emptied twice, the first time after Offerman took a couple of steps
toward Nagy, and again when Martinez struck Alomar in the backside
with a fastball. Given the record penalties handed down in the
aftermath of last weekend's brawl between the White Sox and Tigers,
which led to the suspensions of 16 managers, coaches, and players
for a total of 82 games, further hostilities surely would have
invited some unscheduled vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any fighting,'' said manager Jimy Williams, who
also was automatically ejected by plate umpire Tim Tschida because
both sides had been warned after Offerman was plunked that any
further incidents would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether those decisions that came down before crossed
anybody's mind at the time, I don't know,'' Williams said, ``but
there wasn't any fighting. I don't know what will happen, being
that there weren't any fights. Nobody got hurt. A couple of players
got hit in the leg. That's pitching aggressively inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy hit Offerman an inning after Martinez threw a 1-and-1,
noggin-level fastball that spun Indians catcher Einar Diaz to the
ground. Diaz had doubled in each of his previous two at-bats
against Martinez, the first a three-hopper into the hole that
bounced off Nomar Garciaparra's glove and went into short left
field, the second a line drive to the base of the wall in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the pants off him,'' Sox catcher Jason Varitek said.
``He thought it came really close to hitting him in the head. It
was close, but it didn't hit him. For everybody's sake, you never
want to see anyone get hit in the head. But (the Indians) felt it
was too close.''
</P>
<P>
   After the dustoff, Martinez struck out Diaz, then stared at him
as he walked away from the plate, prompting Diaz to bark back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was staring at me after he struck me out,'' Diaz said. ``I
said, `What are you looking at? You already got what you wanted.'
That pitch was pretty close to my face. I don't think that's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox pitcher, who escaped a no-out, second-and-third jam in
the third, struck out 10 in all, and has pitched 20 straight
scoreless innings against the Tribe, including the playoffs, was
unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not allowed to pitch inside?'' he said. ``I pitched plenty
of good games against Cleveland and I never had an incident like
this happen. I don't know why they would get upset for just one
pitch, going up and in on somebody, especially when the guy goes
diving into the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Indians, Martinez was the agent provocateur of all that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he was throwing at Einar,'' said Indians shortstop
Omar Vizquel, who was hitless in four at-bats against Martinez,
striking out in the third with runners on second and third, after
which Troy O'Leary made a terrific running catch on Alomar after
turning the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a cheap shot and stupid thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Given what passes for baseball protocol in the last 20 years, it
was hardly surprising that Nagy greeted Offerman the way he did.
But Offerman, when asked if he expected to be hit, said, ``Not
really.'' And he rejected any suggestion that he charged the mound,
though he took a couple of steps in that direction until being
wrapped up by Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to charge the mound,'' he said, ``I wouldn't
have taken that long.''
</P>
<P>
   The dugouts and bullpens emptied, but the only potential
flare-up came when Indians reliever Scott Kamieniecki pointed in
the Sox dugout, where Martinez was still sitting. That provoked the
ire of Sox first baseman Brian Daubach, still sore at Kamieniecki
for throwing behind O'Leary on the last weekend of the season in
Baltimore, a game in which Kamieniecki was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get Pedro's attention,'' Kamieniecki said. ``I
was wondering why there were only 49 of us out there. We had a
25-to-24 advantage. I didn't want to get the wrong impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez finally ambled out of the dugout, but when he did, the
imposing figure of coach Jim Rice was beside him.
</P>
<P>
   What was said to Martinez on the bench after that, Williams
wasn't saying. ``What I said or didn't say stays in the clubhouse,
it stays within the team,'' Williams said. But it was pretty clear
he had no problem with what Martinez did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take care of our own the best we can,'' he said.
``That's all I can tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   He clasped his fingers together. ``This,'' he said, ``is so
important. That's a team. That's what's important. It's a marathon.
That doesn't mean we're a great team, but we're going to try. And
as long as we try, that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he did what had to be done when he hit Alomar.
``Baseball has been like that forever,'' he said. ``We play as a
team, fight as a team, go down as a team, win as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie said he didn't expect me to hit him. But you go home,
he'll understand that he was the last person I wanted to hit,
because I have so much respect for him. But it's part of the game.
I have a job to do. I hope he understands.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe stranded two Indians in the eighth when he struck out Jim
Thome looking and Travis Fryman grounded to third. Sexson led off
the ninth by golfing a low pitch into the seats, ending the
Indians' 0-for-32 streak against Lowe. Pinch hitter Mark Whiten
then drew a walk and wound up on third when Garciaparra threw
wildly trying to double him off after catching Vizquel's liner.
But, with the crowd of 42,065 in a frenzy, Alomar tapped to
Garciaparra to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something you expect out of these teams,'' said
Stanley, who also homered Saturday. ``Both teams have a legitimate
chance coming out of spring training every year to be in the
playoffs. These teams know they may have to play each other in
October. I have a great deal of respect for all of their players.
This is growing into a pretty intense rivalry.''

KENTUCKY DERBY AN AMERICAN SPECTACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The words from Kentucky brought forth an instant image. The
favorite for the Kentucky Derby was standing on his hind legs at 6
a.m. last Thursday, straight up, for so long that his rider was
tossed and the horse eventually fell over on his hindquarters.
</P>
<P>
   This is the noble pose for a horse.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ultimate bucking bronco, the image of the huge white
bronco statue at Mile High Stadium in Denver, posing in the noblest
stance of all.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, bucking broncos don't win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   So the madness and mayhem and merriment of the Kentucky Derby
begins with Fusaichi Pegasus, who cost $4 million as a yearling,
cast in the unhappy role as favorite, and a strong favorite at that
(9-5 or so). Derby denizens realize that no favorite has won the
race in 21 20 years, since Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby can be appreciated on so many levels. It is one of
America's four true athletic spectacles, along with the World
Series, Super Bowl, and Indianapolis 500, uniquely American. But
the Derby, unlike the other events, attracts all levels of society,
from the ragamuffins to the rich, from Midwestern college students
to celebrities (real and self-anointed). The 130,000 or so fans in
Churchill Downs on Derby Day reflect all of America.
</P>
<P>
   When the horses, perhaps as many as 20, step onto the track
Saturday afternoon, a college band will strike up ``My Old Kentucky
Home'' and no other sports event in America has such a moving
entrance hymn. Eyes get misty.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is reminiscent of what racetracks used to be like. It
is spectacular. For one day a year _ the only day _ the Kentucky
Derby vaults horse racing from its narrow circle into the wide
circus that is American sports in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, the Kentucky Derby has a visceral attraction for
millions. Close to $100 million will be wagered legally on the
Derby and millions more illegally. And, for millions of fans, it is
as much a point of pride as it is winning money to be able to
select the winner of the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to last Thursday morning and Fusaichi
Pegasus posing as the noble steed. Some trainers claim Fusaichi
Pegasus is a basket case but his trainer, Neil Drysdale, insists he
is merely a playful teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who consider picking a Derby winner an intellectual
challenge must first come to a fundamental decision. If the Derby
favorite acts up at dawn before a few hundred people, how will he
act on a Saturday afternoon before 130,000 fans?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems obvious, but Fusaichi Pegasus's antics will be
chronicled and analyzed all week.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Haskin, who compiles a daily Derby Report on the Internet,
made a keen observation: Fusaichi Pegasus went vertical and goofy
after spotting an ambulance. He also went goofy after winning the
Wood Memorial two weeks ago at Aqueduct after spotting an ambulance
on the track.
</P>
<P>
   There was another telling moment after Fusaichi Pegasus's recent
antics, as the horse was returning to his barn. While Fusaichi
Pegasus passed the stall of The Deputy, who may well be the second
choice in the Derby, trainer Jenine Sahadi was unwrapping a mint to
give to her horse. Fusaichi Pegasus heard the pleasant noise,
stopped in his tracks, and headed over to Sahadi. Sahadi offered
the mint to her rival but Drysdale declined, saying his horse eats
only healthy foods like carrots.
</P>
<P>
   The point, said Haskin, is that Fusaichi Pegasus is extremely
sensitive to sights and sounds. Ordinarily, this would be a
blessing, but what will the Derby's festivities _ a clash of
mesmerizing sights and sounds _ do to a 3-year-old colt?
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi, of course, will be a fascinating story all week. She
once worked in the publicity office at Hollywood Park but took out
a trainer's license and won a Breeders' Cup Sprint race in 1996
with Lit de Justice. Wisecracking trainer Bob Baffert said Sahadi's
success with The Deputy might be due to her husband, also a
trainer. Sahadi took umbrage and stomped out of a press conference.
So horse racing, which is usually behind the times, has a furor
over a successful woman clashing with The Old Ways.
</P>
<P>
   And fans will be fascinated by this Kentucky Derby for another
reason: bloodlines. Specifically, certain horses have bloodlines
that don't allow them to do what other horses can do. Many believe,
after years of study, that pedigree allows horses to run a certain
distance and no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Which, once again, brings us back to Fusaichi Pegasus, the
favorite. Fusaichi Pegasus was sired by Mr. Prospector, America's
top sire of the last quarter-century. Many students of heredity
believe that Mr. Prospector sires sons and daughters who are
brilliant sprinters and great milers but can't go farther than 1
1/8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby, alas, is run at 1 1/4 miles. When a horse
``tires in the stretch,'' it often is because of heredity as much
as not being ready.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the men and women who spend millions to find a horse
good enough to run in the Derby _ and win it _ will be there.
Others have money to burn and merely love the thrill and celebrity;
others have made a science of breeding. A few, such as Sheik
Mohammed al-Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, do both.
</P>
<P>
   And the piece de resistance is that the Derby will be run in
Kentucky, the one state where the horse is king.
</P>
<P>
   Anything seems to go with racing in Kentucky, and sinister
rumors persist of the fates that have befallen favorites. Jimmy
Croll, for instance, insisted for years that someone got to his
Holy Bull, who ran the poorest race of his life in the Derby,
finishing 12th in 1994. And the late Sonny Hine hired a private
security force to guard Skip Away, who finished 12th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At so many levels, the Kentucky Derby is a uniquely fascinating
event.

LAKERS LOSE BENCH BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - Shaquille O'Neal's statistical line Sunday read
like a desperate cry for help: 22 shots, 8 made. His call went
largely unanswered in the Lakers' Game 3 loss to the Sacramento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant tried, with 35 points. But Glen Rice came up short,
with 13 points, and the Lakers' bench combined for just 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, it didn't seem like our energy level was
really high,'' said reserve guard Brian Shaw, who finished with
three points. ``There were times when they needed us to come in and
kind of give us a push, and we weren't able to get it done today
for whatever reason. We just have to regroup and come out, play
with more intensity on Tuesday (in Game 4).''
</P>
<P>
   No Laker reserve scored more than four points, and that came
from rookie Devean George. The usual sparks were missing - Robert
Horry scoring just two points, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher going
scoreless in a combined 0-for-6 effort.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Kings' ``Bench Mob'' sprung to life, with
19 points from Peja Stojakovic to lead a 34-point effort from the
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (the Kings) identified well, they did a good job on
some of our people,'' coach Phil Jackson said. ``Our bench
obviously wasn't as productive as theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither were the Lakers' other role players - Ron Harper (7
points), A.C. Green (4 points) and Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had good shots,'' Rice said. ``I was able to get into the
lane a little bit, the ball just didn't go in. I've just got to
remain confident, and I'm sure the next game I can get the same
shots, and hopefully they'll go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, baby: Fox played an ineffective five minutes, and it was
understandable if his mind was elsewhere. Wife Vanessa Williams,
pregnant with their first child, was expected to go into labor at
any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Fox left for New York immediately after the game to join her. A
Lakers spokesman said doctors hope to induce labor today and that
Fox should be back in time for Tuesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has to do what's important for his personal life,''
Jackson said, ``because that takes precedence over your
professional life, and attentiveness, taking care of that and
responsibility is where our energies will go towards him. Rick's a
very responsible person, so we don't have any problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Lakers had hoped to complete the sweep Sunday,
making Fox's absence immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked about it being between series,'' Jackson said.
``You're talking about bringing a baby to full term, which is
probably the most important thing, is the child itself and how that
fits in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Jackson added with a smile, ``it's important for
each child to be born under the sign and the moment, so
astrologically these children have a chance to evolve the way
they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Recovering: Kings assistant coach Pete Carril, who suffered a
minor heart attack Saturday night, is in stable condition and could
be released from the hospital in the next few days, the team
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Carril had recovered sufficiently Sunday to talk his doctors
into letting him watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kings forward Tyrone Corbin suffered a strained
left knee in a collision with teammate Jon Barry, and his status
for Game 4 is uncertain.

PIPPIG BEGINS HER COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEDHAM, Mass. _ Clenching her fists and glancing heavenward, a
radiant Uta Pippig crossed the finish line of Sunday's James Joyce
Ramble 10K in 34 minutes 33 seconds. Barely allowed to catch her
breath, the beaming three-time winner and darling of the Boston
Marathon was besieged by TV reporters, autograph seekers, and
requests to pose for a photo with every runner who ever owned an
Instamatic.
</P>
<P>
   Not the usual reaction to finishing a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 34-year-old Pippig and the thousands of fans who
lined the 6.2-mile course, the only place that mattered Sunday was
the place they held in each other's hearts, as Pippig chose Dedham
for her long-awaited comeback. A two-year ban on competition
imposed by the German Athletic Federation after testing positive
for performance-enhancing drugs expired April 23, and for Pippig _
who has vehemently denied taking illegal drugs _ it was natural to
make her return in front of a loving Boston-area crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on Cloud 9,'' said Pippig after the race. ``I am so happy
to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, she said, no disappointment in not winning. Suspended
in October 1998 after a test taken the previous April 23 came up
positive, Pippig hadn't competed since the Falmouth Road Race in
August of that year and, lacking race sharpness, was aiming to
finish in 34:30 regardless of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the whole way good,'' she said. ``I didn't push to the
limit. I wanted to enjoy every moment of this race.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the competition was fierce, with a lineup that
could put the popular 17-year-old Ramble, which features costumed
readers of Joyce along the route, on the map as an elite event.
Pippig's time would have been good enough to win here the past two
years, but Sunday Kenyans Teresa Wanjiku and Pauline Konga raced
shoulder-to-shoulder for more than 4 miles before Konga pulled
ahead to win in 33:10, trouncing the course record of 33:37 set in
1987 by Lorraine Moller, an Olympic bronze medalist in the marathon
from New Zealand. For her victory, Konga, 1996 Olympic silver
medalist at 5,000 meters, earned a $1,000 record bonus on top of
the $3,000 first prize. Wanjiku's 33:28 also broke the previous
record.
</P>
<P>
   The men's winner was 40-year-old Simon Karori, also of Kenya, in
30:22.
</P>
<P>
   The day, however, belonged to Pippig. ``This is fun!'' she
shouted midway through the race, laughing as a reporter pulled up
in a motorcycle sidecar, waving at every ``Go Uta!'' sign, greeting
friends waiting in Dedham Square, and smiling every step of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling together with the runners, being with the crowd, it
was so cool,'' she said. ``I love it here.'' Blowing kisses from
the awards platform, she thanked the record field of 2,892 entrants
for their support and the crowd thanked her back.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig plans a few more low-key races around Longmont, Colo.,
where she and her coach/companion, Dieter Hogen, have lived for the
past eight years, before gearing up for a still-unspecified fall
marathon. If all goes well, she could be back in Boston next April
to try for her fourth win.
</P>
<P>
   But she won't be at the Sydney Olympics. Having renounced any
connection to the German federation to protest what she considers
unfair treatment during the drug investigation, Pippig will have to
wait until she gets US citizenship before trying to make her third
Olympic team in 2004, when she will be 38. In 1992, she was seventh
at 10,000 meters, and in 1996, she led the marathon for about 10
miles before dropping out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful even Sydney could have surpassed the emotions of
Sunday. After hours of dancing eyes and delighted laughter, Pippig
abruptly burst into tears, shaking with relief and joy.
</P>
<P>
   The sobs stopped as suddenly as they had begun. ``I shouldn't
cry,'' she whispered, banishing the last tear. ``I wasn't sure if I
could still do it. Sometimes you wonder. But I can do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she smiled.

LEWIS STRIKES BLOW FOR HIS DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't pretty to watch, but then few assaults are.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly six minutes Saturday night, heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis bludgeoned overmatched Michael Grant. Nearly every
time Lewis slammed rights into Grant's face, the challenger fell to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   And Grant kept getting up.
</P>
<P>
   At least he did until a final right uppercut came whistling into
the middle of his face late in the second round and dropped him for
the third time. After lying on the floor for several seconds, Grant
struggled to his feet but couldn't beat the count of referee Arthur
Mercante Jr., who waved the heavyweight title challenge to a close
at 2:53 of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mercante could have done that any time after midway
through the first, which was the first time a Lewis uppercut sent
Grant to the floor. Although Grant got up at eight, he was never
the same after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with an equilibrium shot,'' Grant (31-1) said.
``That pretty much affected me for the rest of the knockdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had promised to attack Lewis from the outset, few
expected the untested 28-year-old challenger to follow through.
That he appeared nervous and unfocused all week furthered those
doubts, but when the opening bell sounded, Grant attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' Lewis (36-1-1) said. ``I didn't think he
was that aggressive, but he did come and throw some punches. Most
of the time I could see it when he was winding up. I just held my
position so I could get a good shot. I said if he came out
aggressive it would be over early. His style was perfect for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was, because Grant was imperfect in every way.
Although mistakenly considered the world's top heavyweight
contender, the fact is there was little on Grant's resume to back
that contention. World Boxing Association No. 1 contender John Ruiz
has been criticized because Lewis's refusal to fight him before
Grant cost the champion the WBA belt, but there is no more on
Grant's resume than is on Ruiz's.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that Ruiz necessarily has fought the toughest
men in the division but that Grant had not either.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters seldom are thrown in with the best competition in the
hopes they will learn from the experience today. They are carefully
cultivated to get to the point Grant did Saturday &UR;  &LR; night _ a $4
million payday to take a shot with Lewis. That Grant was
ill-prepared for such a moment was beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed a lot of heart to keep getting up,'' Lewis said.
``Especially after the third knockdown. I was surprised his corner
sent him back out.''
</P>
<P>
   That third knockdown was actually the second because there was a
standing 8-count in the first. But when Lewis unloaded four
streaming right hands and a left late in that round, Grant
collapsed to the floor a second time with only seconds left before
the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Grant struggled up with two seconds remaining, but the better
man was Lewis. While he looked amateurish at times, he still
destroyed his challenger in fewer than six minutes, so what point
is there to debate between them?
</P>
<P>
   What was obvious was that Lewis never will look like a classic
puncher. His are not crisply thrown shots. They are blows with a
tire iron, punches that do not knock someone down because of their
snap and precision but because they land with the force of a
wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing artistic about that, but the building falls
soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I hit him he went down, so I just kept hitting
him,'' Lewis said. ``I didn't know how hurt he was but I realized
he wouldn't be able to take too many of those punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant learned that quickly, just as he learned his plan of
attacking Lewis wildly was a fool's approach because it allowed the
more experienced 34-year-old champion to lure him in and then knock
him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging him was stupidity on my part,'' Grant said. ``I was
just too anxious. I didn't execute the things I needed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't nervous. I was prepared but I took the wrong
mentality into it. I leaned on a selfish issue. I should have used
my speed instead of taking it like a grudge match from the
(opening) door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is very smart. He put his hands down and showed me
openings and I tried to knock his head off. He knew I'd open myself
up and he took a half step back and did what was necessary to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did that for himself and for boxing. If there was one
thing the sport desperately needed Saturday night it was a clear
and devastating winner. If there was one thing Lewis needed to
erase his image as the Hamlet of boxing it was a clear and
devastating win.
</P>
<P>
   Both the sport and its champion got what they needed at Madison
Square Garden. What Grant got was what a lot of people get on
Eighth Avenue and 33d late at night: He got mugged.

LOOKING BACK ON BELICHICK'S FIRST MINICAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Odds and ends from Patriots minicamp:
</P>
<P>
   --Coach Bill Belichick and his staff weren't real impressed with
the conditioning of his 36 rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a bit was asked of them, but I told them as a group I
didn't think they were in real good condition,'' he said. ``I don't
think they're ready to play football the way it needs to be played
at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our veterans are ahead because they've been working
hard in March and April. What happens to rookie players right
through March when teams are working them out . . . I think a lot
of these guys haven't done a whole lot since then. We all know how
quickly conditioning can leave us. They've seen in these last three
practices they have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriots' signing of 26 rookie free agents was the most of
any team in the NFL. Buffalo came close with 23. The reason? This
is Belichick's modus operandi. He's had success bringing along free
agents in the past, particularly offensive linemen such as Orlando
Brown in his Cleveland days.
</P>
<P>
   --The rookies were oriented on how to be a pro football player
for the New England Patriots at one of their evening sessions.
Belichick covered things such as eating habits, living in the
Boston area, security issues, living on their own, time management,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick didn't say he would ban certain nightspots where
players have run into difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are things we talk to them about, maybe not so much the
specific places, but we emphasize they're on their own, it's a
different situation than college. Now they have some money and that
brings different opportunities and temptations. We can't baby-sit
them 24 hours a day, but we can provide them with information so
their careers won't get derailed,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said other than the football, the biggest difference
between college and the professional level is time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more time and more money. How they deal with those
factors is hard to predict,'' Belichick said. ``You think you know
what a guy might be like with more time and more money, but
sometimes you're surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   --J.R Redmond's father, Joseph, speaking on his son's
versatility, said, ``His best position is defense. He should have
played defense (safety or corner) at Arizona State, but the coach
wanted him to be a running back.'' Redmond fractured his right
pinkie during Sunday's workout.
</P>
<P>
   --Belichick on discipline: ``I don't think discipline is short
hair. What it really means is being able to perform under pressure.
In the fourth quarter when the game is on the line, not to jump
offside. If we call for a no-huddle field goal team, that 11 guys
run out there, line up before the gun goes off, and kick the field
goal. Everybody on the team, the coaches, and the staff have to
operate as a unit. You can't segment those situations; you have to
be able to react to them in a disciplined fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   --Clubhouse manager Don Brocher understands class and dignity.
On a team that will have more than 90 players on its roster, he
didn't give out Nos. 87 (Ben Coates) and 78 (Bruce Armstrong).
</P>
<P>
   --Seventh-round pick Patrick Pass, a running back out of
Georgia, insists playing four years in the Florida Marlins system
didn't hurt his football progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it set me back at all,'' said Pass. ``It
was a great experience for me. If I had to do it all over again,
I'd make the same decision. Right now, I'm going to concentrate on
football.'' But Pass seemed to leave the door open to a return with
the Marlins as an outfield prospect if things didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thing for Pass is to stay healthy. A few nagging
injuries limited his playing time at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   --The Patriots are still considering a number of veteran free
agents, including wide receiver Leslie Shepherd, linebacker Chad
Cascadden, center Steve Everitt, and defensive linemen Nolan
Harrison, Ferric Collons, Anthony Pleasant, and Mike Frederick.
They'll also scan the June 1 cuts. They must also make some tough
decisions on cuts soon. As they sign their draft picks they'll have
to begin cutting players. Those in jeopardy: fullback Tony Carter,
free safety Chris Carter, safety Larry Whigham, receiver Vincent
Brisby, and perhaps one of the higher-priced offensive linemen _
Todd Rucci and Max Lane. Both players have workout bonuses of more
than $200,000 payable if they complete their program by early June.
</P>
<P>
   --The player showing the most burst, speed, and hustle:
fifth-round pick Melvin Harris, a defensive back from Virginia.
Harris was very impressive on his kick return drills, even more so
than Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   --The most interesting hairdo: Maugaula Tuitele, a linebacker
from Colorado State, who sported a ponytail. And Gil Santos, radio
voice of the Patriots, already was practicing pronunciation of
Tuitele's name.

CLAVIJO PERTURBED BY REFEREES' NONCALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Fernando Clavijo retained his composure a
day after the great non-call that likely cost the Revolution a
chance to defeat Miami Saturday night. Actually, Clavijo displayed
an admirable balance between anger and tranquility after the game,
which concluded in a 1-1 tie after referee Noel Kenny failed to
detect the yank-down of the Revolution's Johnny Torres.
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo declined to discuss the play publicly Sunday but said he
will take legal action if Major League Soccer imposes a fine on him
for his postgame protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible that we have had two obvious penalties not
called in the last three games at home,'' Clavijo said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the 13,172 in attendance seemed to have seen the
Fusion's Francis Okaroh pull Torres from behind as the striker
closed in on the goal in the 100th minute of a chaotic, physical
match.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, Okaroh received the benefit of the doubt from Kenny
and linesman Roger Itaya for his guile and reputation. Kenny said
he could not see the play and Itaya simply said he viewed two
players running side by side. But the non-call, combined with an
unwarranted earlier caution of the Revolution's William Sunsing,
sent a message that will do little to promote the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, defenders were rewarded instead of punished for
fouls. And offensive play either was viewed skeptically or
downright discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Torres clearly had beaten Okaroh in a race for the ball and was
accelerating for the goal. Torres went to the ground as he was
about to unleash a shot, and the officials must have believed he
tripped himself, a highly unlikely occurrence for a young, highly
motivated athlete who was about to complete a glorious play. If,
however, the officials suspected Torres of diving, they should have
cautioned him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunsing was cautioned in the 98th minute after he had succeeded
in one of his many fakes to evade a defender, and went to the
ground near the Miami penalty area. Sunsing was cautioned,
apparently for embellishing the foul, though the official
scoresheet listed the reason as ``dangerous play.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sunsing was grabbed and tripped by a defender who had
no intention of playing the ball. Sunsing's sways and dribbles
sometimes cause him to be in a vulnerable position, in which even
slight contact can throw him off balance. But that is just the part
of the game MLS referees seem unable to comprehend. So, one of the
league's bright young talents was penalized simply because a
referee failed to understand not only what Sunsing was doing, but
what the crowd seemed to be enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   This game was an example of the MLS shooting itself in the foot
with an ill-advised mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   A chance was squandered for a dramatic conclusion, just what the
league had hoped for by canning the postmatch shootout and
installing 10 minutes of golden-goal overtime. Certainly, Torres's
move would have become a theme for the week and a rallying point
for the Revolution, or for the Fusion if goalkeeper Jeff Cassar
would have stopped the penalty kick.

   Brian Dunseth and Rusty Pierce are expected to return to
practice Wednesday, according to Clavijo. Dunseth suffered a
concussion and Pierce had a concussion and a 10-stitch cut in his
forehead after they collided in the 84th minute. The Revolution
played the overtime period with 10 players after having reached the
limit of three substitutes . . . Striker Eduardo Hurtado's
suspension by the MLS has been lifted and he will join the
Revolution for practice Monday. ``I don't anticipate any problems
with Eduardo,'' Clavijo said. ``My conversation with him was good.
Now he has to show the team he wants to come back. It's crucial
because we need everybody physically and mentally ready to go. We
are a team of professional players, not a children's playground
team. He is a member of the team and we all have to accept each
other. But we can talk all day, but everyone has to go out and show
what they can do.''

   COLOMBIA-CROPDUSTING (Rioblanco de Sotara, Colombia) _ Over a
two-week period, a fleet of crop-dusting counternarcotics planes
taking part in a U.S.-sponsored program to eradicate heroin poppy
cultivation have returned here repeatedly. Time and time again,
residents charge, the planes also sprayed buildings and fields that

real pride and patriotism Sunday in a nation that has shrugged off
centuries of foreign domination and is determined now to carve its

   NUCLEAR-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Proposed U.S. plans to change a

Broad.

<P>
   IRAQ-EMBARGO (United Nations) _ The first American member of
Congress to go to Iraq to assess the impact of economic sanctions
on the population has concluded that while some of the suffering he

imposed by the United Nations after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   KENYA-LAND (Kagoshi, Kenya) _ As in Zimbabwe, Kenya has a
problem with land distribution and with the many angry people who
do not have any. As in Zimbabwe, there is no question that British
colonialists set the stage for a serious land crisis in Kenya. But
37 years after independence, the source of the problem is not so
clear. There are still white farmers, but most have sold out or
gone into business with Africans. Many of their partners have ties
to President Daniel arap Moi. And Moi himself is one of the
nation's largest landowners. By Ian Fisher.

   BRITAIN-PUBS (Manchester, England) _ Since World War I, when it
restricted pub hours to prevent munitions workers from getting
drunk and using poor judgment on the assembly line, Parliament has
kept tight control of its citizens' drinking. The regulations are
complicated, but the best known and most reviled is the law that
requires the country's 60,000 pubs to close at 11 p.m. six days a
week, and at 10:30 on Sunday. Now, more than 80 years later, it

   MICROSOFT-SEATTLE (Seattle) _ People of the Seattle region are
not too concerned about the possible breakup of Microsoft. Local
economists say they know of no projects that have been scuttled
because of concern about the company, although one man decided not
to buy a house because he couldn't bare to part with his Microsoft

   MICROSOFT-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ As stock analysts pored over

banker Robert F. Greenhill, which defended the feasibility of such
a task, said the affidavit falls short of justifying why a breakup
would be good for Microsoft shareholders. By Laura M. Holson.

old wrinkle for the new economy. As more and more electronic
marketplaces crowd onto the internet, selling goods and services
has seemed to be turning into a youngster's game, a forum in which
tech-savvy entrepreneurial types in their 20s are running the show.
But when it comes to dealing with the would-be clients, the b-to-b
dot.coms are looking over steel mills, auto parts companies, indeed
all of the basic industries. They're looking for people who can
talk the talk of the customer base, and persuade their generational

   ECOMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: Since the
stocks of e-tailers have fallen from favor on Wall Street, the
companies have had to think about marketing budgets that actually
serve the purpose of attracting customers, not investors. So portal
deals have been the second line item on the budget, after
television ads, to come under the microscope of e-tailing
executives who are no longer willing to pay hundreds of dollars to

   GERMANY-TV-MEDIA (Frankfurt) _ A prominent television news
anchor is suspended from ZDF, one of the German national networks,
because of evidence he had been working with a PR agency on the
side. The PR agency sent him a fax that alluded to great things he
had done for them and suggested a number of story possibilities he
should pursue. The anchor, Alexander Niemetz, has denied any
wrongdoing, but the real point is that German journalists often
make money on the side through advertising and promotional work. By

SHARKS AWAIT FRIENDLY TANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Sharks have a library of feel-good films to choose
from on their flight back to San Jose:
</P>
<P>
   Sharks vs. Stars, Game 3, 1998
</P>
<P>
   Sharks vs. Avalanche, Game 3, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Sharks vs. Blues, Game 3, 2000
</P>
<P>
   They hope to add:
</P>
<P>
   Stars vs. Oilers, Game 3, 2000
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks own an impressive and resilient record in Game 3s
over the past three seasons. They trailed the Stars 2-0 in 1998,
went home and tied the series. A year later, down 2-0 to the
Colorado Avalanche, the Sharks returned home and tied the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Game 3 is pivotal for us,'' center Mike Ricci said. ``We've
got to come out with our best game. I believe in our team, and I
believe our team is going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the Sharks tormented the St. Louis Blues with
home wins in Games 3 and 4 to fuel their first-round upset. They're
2-1 at home in the playoffs this season but have been outscored
9-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're going in the Shark Tank, and the fans are a big part
of things,'' said Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor, with a 5-2 Game 3
loss in Edmonton still fresh in his mind. ``We have to go out there
and take the life out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks coach Darryl Sutter applauded the way his Sharks rallied
last night in a 1-0 loss full of missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter was so confident that the Sharks will bite back inside
the noisy San Jose Arena, he said farewell to Reunion Arena with
these parting words: ``See ya in Game 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks have reason to be optimistic. Although they became
only the fourth team in 31 years to start a playoff series by being
shut out in consecutive games, they finally put pressure on Stars
goalie Ed Belfour and kept the score within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about the effort, but not about the result,''
center Vincent Damphousse said. ``Both sides, it was a very, very
tight game, and that's the way we have to play to beat them. I
think we showed tonight we can beat them. Tonight we played a
stronger game and played the way we beat St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory was a Mike Modano rebound shot off a Brett
Hull slap shot that bolted off Sharks goalie Steve Shields' pad,
and a bevy of Sharks chances gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks managed 19 shots, but missed the net 20 times, 31
times in the two games. Ricci misfired on a two-on-one early in the
first period. Marco Sturm couldn't poke in a puck that hit off
Sydor and dropped in front of Belfour at the left goal post. Jeff
Friesen and Patrick Marleau couldn't handle cross-slot passes on
odd-man rushes in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks went 0-for-5 on the power play _ 0-for-11 in two
games _ including one in the final minute of play. With Shields on
the bench, the Sharks attacked with a two-man advantage. Belfour
stoned slap shots from Gary Suter and Friesen, a poke check by
Ricci and finally a rifle from the point from Brad Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave ourselves a chance to win,'' Friesen said. ``We have
to go home and get the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of footage to flame Game 3 emotions.

AS USUAL, MODANO SPRINGS INTO THE SPOTLIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Modano knows how to play the part of star better
than anyone on the Stars. Despite goalie Ed Belfour's third playoff
shutout this season, and the Stars' special teams, which killed the
final minute when the San Jose Sharks had a two-man advantage,
without Modano, the Stars might still be playing Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored the only goal in the Stars' 1-0 victory against
the Sharks last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played great tonight,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher
said. ``I think he was one of the few players besides Eddie who
really looked good. He was flying out there, and he's been flying.
A player of his caliber, when he's skating like that, it's tough to
get a hold of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks have yet to tame the Stars' center. Modano has four
goals in the playoffs, including two against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   He got the game-winner out of the way early last night.
</P>
<P>
   A Brenden Morrow pass to Brett Hull set up a breakaway for Hull.
Sharks goalie Steve Shields deflected Hull's shot wide to Modano at
the top of the left circle. Modano sent the puck between two
defenders and underneath the diving Shields at 7:26 of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came out pretty high, but it was right on my stick,''
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano has become a broken record. It was his 36th career
playoff goal, breaking the franchise record he had shared with
Steve Payne since Friday night. In the first-round series against
the Edmonton Oilers, he had become the Stars' all-time postseason
scoring leader when he recorded his 84th point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just seem to accumulate,'' Modano said. ``Good things
happen when your team is consistent and in the playoffs this
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano is accumulating frequent-flyer points at a
businessman-like pace. He now has scored a point in six consecutive
games, which matches a personal best he set during last season's
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our line is getting four or five good opportunities a game,''
Modano said. ``As long as those keep happening, we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who was first on the Stars in points (81), goals (38),
assists (43) and game-winning goals (8) during the regular season,
is feeling good. That has the Sharks down in the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``My legs felt real good, just skating and feeling like I have
some jump,'' Modano said. ``When I'm feeling that way, good things
seem to happen. The puck seems to follow me around, and it seems
like I'm in good position all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Modano who has the Stars in position for a Stanley Cup
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous player. There's no doubt about that,'' Stars
forward Blake Sloan said. ``He pretty much does everything that's
asked for in any hockey player. He plays defensive-style hockey. He
plays offensive-style hockey. He plays with tenacity in the
corners, and he's got tremendous speed, too, which makes him that
much more difficult to stop. That's not to mention that he can
shoot the puck as well as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the whole package. Sometimes I find myself just
watching him. He puts you in awe.''

HITCHCOCK IN A HUFF OVER STARS' POOR EFFORT UP FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Only the Reunion Arena scoreboard correctly identified
last night's Game 2 winner. Certainly the mood of the opposing
coaches provided zero clues.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sutter was relaxed, smiling and cracking a few
one-liners. If his San Jose Sharks ever score a goal in this
series, a gleeful Sutter might add a song-and-dance routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you in Game 5,'' he added when departing the media-room
podium. Sutter's grin was one of those ``hey-I'm-serious'' kind of
things.
</P>
<P>
   For a total contrast, Ken Hitchcock's red face obviously matched
the color scheme of his posterior-area. Usually a media-room
orator, Hitch was in a huff. His comments were short, not so sweet,
and his mood was basically summed up by this dart aimed in the
direction of the Stars' locker room:
</P>
<P>
   ``They had more players play well than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a quick walk toward the coaching quarters at Reunion,
it was mentioned to Hitchcock how he seemed sour. What's this? Not
even a 1-0 victory, back-to-back shutouts, a 2-0 series lead, and a
tense final 60 seconds when The Eagle of old _ meaning the playoffs
a year ago _ suddenly saved the evening, could cheer up Hitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' he replied. ``Not enough players were on board. To
beat this team, more players than tonight will have to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant tomorrow night in San Jose. But before then, it would
be best to do some re-evaluation about the direction of this
series. And try to figure out why the expected nasty stuff was
suddenly replaced last night by a style of hockey that might as
well have been Sweden vs. Norway in some European Cup sectional
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks were humiliated in the opener and took the blows
instead of delivering them, a distant contrast from what served
them so well in the upset of St. Louis in the first round.
Forty-eight hours later, San Jose showed up without top scoring
threat Owen Nolan, which also removed a physical presence. He was a
scratch due to injuries that were a carryover from the Blues
series, but the Stars added to his pain in the opener when Nolan
was a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter threw a curve ball by also scratching a bruiser like
Ronnie Stern, then going with a speed lineup. No way San Jose wins
this series, or even a game in this series, by trying that finesse
stuff on the Stars _ right, right, right? Where's the usual bite,
Darryl? Bryan Marchment is just not cut out for the Ice Capades.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Sharks didn't win with this style, but as Hitch's
demeanor showed, they did everything they needed to do to steal a
critical game. Except actually steal it.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, without your best player in uniform, then try to
hang around, keep it a 1-goal affair, hope for the break that gets
you to overtime, and then, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose game plan reached a point of perfection when Derian
Hatcher was whistled down for cross-checking with exactly 60
seconds remaining, gifting the goalie-less Sharks with a 6-on-4
advantage. Then they won the initial faceoff in the Stars' zone,
another huge plus.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who had faced minimal pressure most of the evening, was
on the spot. Eddie, however, answered like this was 1999 all over
again. Three quality chances by the Sharks resulted in nothing
except thunderous cheers for Belfour from a Reunion sellout that
like the goalie, had to quickly come to life after 59 minutes of
rather mundane hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask much more from our team than they did
tonight,'' said Sutter, who explained the final minute this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three good chances. You approach that situation hoping
to get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Only three other teams in NHL history have opened a playoff
series with back-to-back shutouts, and for what's it worth, two of
them (the Devils and Rangers in the '90s), went on to win the
Stanley Cup. In his overall displeasure, Hitchcock did toss
compliments the way of his defensemen (all six of them, and
particularly Dave Manson), and, of course, Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we had people up front tonight who didn't play well at
all. That will have to be addressed,'' Hitchcock added.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreement with the coach is not unusual around here, but
publicly, at least, there was no rebuttal to Hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we did get kind of lucky tonight,'' defenseman Darryl
Sydor said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Hatcher: ``Our effort really wasn't what we wanted it to
be. But we did what we had to do to win the game, thanks to Eddie.
When you don't play well, and you still win, that can be a good
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't see it that way, and will spend the next 48
hours stressing just that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Even with the Sharks having a six-on-four in the final
minute of the game, Jamie Langenbrunner, for one, felt good about
the Stars' chances of winning faceoffs in their own zone.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Guy Carbonneau _ an 18-year veteran and one of the
league's best at winning faceoffs _ took two key defensive draws in
that minute to help seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys on the ice then who have played in a lot
of games like that,'' Langenbrunner said. ``Seeing a veteran guy
like him taking those key faceoffs, you can't ask for much more.''
\Nsubheds:Getting even better The Stars were impressive enough on
the penalty kill in the regularson, setting an NHL record by
killing off 89.3 percent of opponents' power plays.
</P>
<P>
   They've been even better in the postseason, especially in two
games against the Sharks. After going 0-for-5 with a man advantage
last night, San Jose is now 0-for-11 in the series with a man
advantage. And, during one second-period power play last night, the
Sharks allowed the Stars to spend 40 seconds in the Sharks' zone,
getting off two shots during that sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you shut a team out two games in a row you're doing
something right defensively,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
\Nsubheds:Very careful The Sharks might have been concerned about
the loss of Owen Nolan in Game 2, but no doubt it weighed on the
Stars' minds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Stars captain Derian Hatcher said the loss of an opponent's best
player can sometimes force a team to make the fatal mistake of
relaxing _ something the Stars didn't do last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the board and see their best player's not
playing, sometimes you tend to let down,'' Hatcher said. ``We
talked about trying not to let down. It's just like if they saw
\RMike\S Modano wasn't playing, they might let down. You can fall
into that trap easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan isn't expected to be on the ice tomorrow night in San Jose
and might not return this series. \Nsubheds:Grateful for trade Had
Stars center Scott Thornton remained with the Montreal Canadiens,
he would be doing ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what,'' he said. ``Whatever I would have been
doing it wouldn't have been as fun what I am doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who was acquired from the Canadiens on Jan. 22 in
exchange for Juha Lind, is playing in the fourth playoffs in his
10-year NHL career. By this time most springs, Thornton wasn't
playing, or watching, much hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would turn it on periodically,'' Thornton said. ``It's a
sore spot when you're not playing. It's not a lot of fun. It feels
like your season is really incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, the most playoff games Thornton played in
any one season was 1998 with Montreal, where he played in nine
games; the Canadiens failed to reach the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things I've seen it happen to other guys _
guys who get traded and they end up going far in the playoffs,''
Thornton said. ``It's something that I always hoped would happen to
me. It's been a good move for me to play with a team with this much
talent after 10 years of struggling.'' \Nsubheds:Lehtinen progress
Stars winger Jere Lehtinen practiced at yesterday's morning skate
but was again a scratch for the game. He will, however, travel to
San Jose, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best it's felt since I played against Phoenix,'' said
Lehtinen, whose last game was against the Coyotes on the last day
of the regular season. ``It was better today; I skated harder. I
have to see how it feels tonight and tomorrow morning. We haven't
had a set back so that's the main thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Lehtinen and Hitchcock said that Lehtinen's right ankle has
not suffered any increased swelling and there has been no major
regression. Hitchcock has said that when Lehtinen returns to
practice, that would mean he was a few days away from playing. Does
that mean that his return is imminent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can play this game, but it's tough to say,'' said
Lehtinen, who missed 65 games this season due to the injury. ``I
don't want to put a timetable because I don't really know; it's
been so long. It's better to go day-to-day basically and see how it
feels better.'' \Nsubheds:Feeling good Despite being down two games
to none, at least one person in the Sharks' organization doesn't
expect to see his team get swept at home.
</P>
<P>
   It's San Jose coach Darryl Sutter, who told reporters when
leaving the interview room, ``We'll see you at Game 5.''

SECOND SHUTOUT PUTS STARS GOALIE IN ELITE COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS_ Three times in the past 30 years has an NHL team started
a series with consecutive shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Must be goalies like Patrick Roy, Curtis Joseph or Dominik
Hasek, right? They wish.
</P>
<P>
   With his third shutout in the 2000 playoffs, Stars goaltender Ed
Belfour became the fourth goalie to join that elite company by
shutting out the San Jose Sharks, 1-0, for the second consecutive
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said, ``the biggest
reason we won was Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Shielded by a defense that continues to be stronger than
two-month-old milk, Belfour maintained his domination of the Sharks
by posting the first back-to-back playoff shutouts of his career.
</P>
<P>
   This comes amid remarks from some hockey analysts, who said
Belfour isn't in his 1999 Stanley Cup-winning form. They're right.
</P>
<P>
   He's in 2000 Stanley Cup shape ... which could be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure there are a lot more critics out there right now
trying not to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he's been real
solid,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   How solid?
</P>
<P>
   Last night he stopped 19 shots, including three in the final,
frantic minute with the Sharks on the power play and goalie Steve
Shields on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has allowed 11 goals in the playoffs, five in the Stars'
one loss and a total of six in their six victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he wasn't satisifed by his play in the first round,''
Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``But we still got through it
and he got another chance to be big and that's exactly what he
was.''
</P>
<P>
   How big?
</P>
<P>
   He has allowed three goals in five home playoff games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   He has stopped 37 shots in the series and hasn't allowed a goal
since Edmonton's Jim Dowd scored at the 1:07 mark of the third
period in Game 5 of Round 1, pushing Belfour's personal
record-streak of scoreless minutes to 138:53 and counting.
</P>
<P>
   He is 7-0 in the past seven home playoff games, with four
shutouts running his career total to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three seasons, he leads all NHL goalies in playoff
victories (32) and shutouts (7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel strong and focused,'' Belfour said. ``That's key for me
is when I am feeling that way. I am seeing the puck real well.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Sharks see it, that's part of the problem. With the
Stars' defense limiting the number of opportunities on even
strength or the power play, Belfour has been perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him and when's he is in that zone, there is not much
for rebounds,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said. ``You have to get
something he doesn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is seeing everything. The problem is for a goalie such
as Belfour who has said he would rather see more shots to stay in
rhythm, he isn't seeing much.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing just 18 shots in Game 1, he saw 19 last night,
including just one in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he doesn't see a shot for 10 or 12 minutes and he
still comes up with the big save,'' Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner said.
</P>
<P>
   He almost always does. He has the Cup to prove it.

LAKERS CAN'T CLOSE IT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - All the right pieces were tucked in all the right
places, tightly, neatly and in orderly fashion, as the Lakers
pushed the Sacramento Kings across the floor and to the edge of
playoff elimination Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant was soaring high enough, often enough to rack up
frequent-flier miles. The Lakers had most of the rebounds. Most of
the loose balls. Plenty of defense. All the momentum. And a
10-point lead midway through the third quarter. ...
</P>
<P>
   Everything they needed, packed in a cardboard box and ready to
be mothballed, along with the Kings, for a nice, hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Arco Arena rafters started to shake, the Kings started
to rumble, the decibel meter red-zoned, and it all came crashing
down, like fine china on the San Andreas fault.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, extended stay in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   With a late collapse and a 99-91 loss, the Lakers gave the Kings
their first sign of hope as they extended this best-of-five series
to Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ticked off, very ticked off,'' Bryant said. ``I thought we
had the game in our hands and let it slip away real fast. We wanted
to close this thing out.''
</P>
<P>
   They failed, despite 35 points from Bryant, who recorded a
career playoff high for the second straight game. They failed,
despite denying Sacramento the lead until early in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then it all unraveled in a blur of missed Shaquille O'Neal free
throws, offensive rebounds from tiny Tony Delk and a flurry of
baskets by Peja Stojakovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought energy from the crowd kept the (Kings) playing,''
Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``A few things went wrong for us,
and the game got out of hand real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   When it all ended, the Kings had strung together a 21-4 run that
turned a Laker lead into a 94-82 deficit with 2:32 left to play.
Down on the scoreboard and then just down, period, after failing to
complete the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to be down,'' Jackson said. ``They should be
embarrassed by the way they played today. This is not a good
performance from our team. We have to come back and play better. So
we should lick our wounds tonight, come back (today) and be ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   A case of overconfidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that way at all,'' Glen Rice said. ``We realized
what we had to do coming in here we tried to take the life out of
them, and it just didn't happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they controlled the game for most of three quarters, this
never looked like a vintage Lakers performance. O'Neal struggled
from the field (8 for 22) and from the line (5 for 14), settling
for 21 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Lakers went 16 for 32 from the line - ``That's the
ballgame right there,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, Bryant's theatrics and team defense balanced O'Neal's
low production. Not this time. Rice scored just 13 points on
5-of-13 shooting, and the defense disappeared as the Kings scored
33 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored 16 points in the final frame, but O'Neal went 1
for 4 and no one else made a dent. Stojakovic, a non-factor until
Sunday, scored all 19 of his points in the second half. Delk got
nine points in the fourth, but it was his four offensive rebounds
that hurt most.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber did the rest, with 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their interior defense stiffened, and we weren't able to make
the adjustments necessary at that time in the game,'' Jackson said.
``They were denying Shaq access to the lane, and they did a good
job powering against him. And our adjustments weren't good. ... Our
defense came undone.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unfamiliar sight, the NBA's most dominant team this
season frittering away a late lead in a big game. To find the
Lakers' last meaningful loss, you have to trace through the
schedule to perhaps a mid-March defeat at Washington that snapped
the 19-game winning streak. Or maybe back to early February, when
they were routed at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   So where did that air of invincibility go?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we still have that air,'' veteran Ron Harper said. ``I
don't think I'm going to allow us to be down as a basketball team.
The guys know what kind of attitude that I have. The one thing I
told the guys is we let this slip through our hands, it's our
fault. We can't blame it on one guy, we've got to blame it on what
we did. We missed foul shots and did things that we just don't
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing they don't do: close out a series well. The Lakers
of Kobe and Shaq have never had a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically wanted a sweep because I've never done it before.
Something new,'' Bryant said, then let a hint of swagger slip out:
``But there's always next series.''
</P>
<P>
   And amid the anger and frustration, Harper offered this don't-
worry-be-happy final thought: ``Put it this way. The sun will shine
tomorrow, right?'' he said. ``So we should be OK.''

SHAQ ISN'T WHOLE FOR A HALF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - These things don't happen. For all of Shaquille
O'Neal's amazing ability, not even he can make 7-foot-1 and 330
pounds of center fade into the background.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a single half.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by his standards - and we're talking otherworldy here -
O'Neal was just another player in the second half of the Lakers'
99-91 Game 3 playoff loss to the Kings on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At the break, he was again the indomitable force the Lakers have
grown to expect and the Kings to dread.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidently, the Lakers led by five.
</P>
<P>
   But this was less a tale of two cities than two halves.
</P>
<P>
   And in the second half, O'Neal scored just six points. His game
seemed to fade the longer it went.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, he was just 1 for 4 from the field, with
no rebounds and no assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was, if he didn't have that pop in his
shot or else a lot of body on him, and he just couldn't get off the
floor with a body on him,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``But
he had a real struggle in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal blamed no one, nor handed out any particular credit. The
Kings sent a second defender, usually a guard, each time he caught
the ball, but coming at him aggressively is hardly some new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I just missed some chippies that I usually don't miss,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was hounded by ex-Laker Vlade Divac and designated
hack-a-Shaq defender Scot Pollard (total fouls: 11). Then some
little guard would come darting in each time he took a pass down
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought in the second half we did a better job of when he
shot the ball, not allowing him to get it back,'' said Kings coach
Rick Adelman. ``That's what we talked to Vlade about, when he
shoots it, you just keep guarding him. Don't try and find the ball.
That's really important, because he is so quick to the ball that
you just have to give his guy help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had another theory on why O'Neal's production faded in the
second half. Somebody else's was taking off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe (Bryant) really took a lot of shots, and that came out of
him,'' Kings guard Tony Delk said. ``It's better for us. We can
give Kobe his points, we can't let Shaq get 30-to-40.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 21 points on 8-of-22 shooting, 17 rebounds,
three assists and a blocked shots. All very good numbers, of
course, just not the kind O'Neal is used to posting.
</P>
<P>
   This is the guy who scored 46 in the Lakers' Game 1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, when O'Neal was taking only four shots,
Bryantwas taking 10 and making half of them. He finished with 35
points.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even by the time Bryant started firing aggressively in the
fourth quarter, the Kings had built a 12-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to be just a little more hungry on Tuesday,''
O'Neal said. ``We're kind of upset. We'll look at film (today) and
see how poorly we played. We just have to pick it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   For all those ready to unfurl a championship banner at Staples,
and for any Lakers who might have gotten a little carried away by
their recent success, O'Neal figured a lesson might have been
learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was,'' he said. ``We didn't play well at all, all
day. Even though they played the best ball they can play, we still
had a couple opportunities to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Neal's atypical performance in the second half, Divac
went for the simple explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he missed a lot of shots.''

   THE WOODLANDS _ If this keeps up, they can change the Shell
Houston Open trophy to a Foster's can topped with a kangaroo
throwing a boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   Either that or it can be a statue of a burly, goateed guy
missing a putt.
</P>
<P>
   Both would be appropriate after Australian Robert Allenby
survived in a sudden-death playoff only because Craig Stadler
bricked three putts inside 10 feet, then stuck a 10-footer of his
own on the fourth extra hole for the victory at the Tournament
Players Course.

   The SHO. It's Australian for golf. There's no other way to
explain how two fast friends from Melbourne can take back-to-back
victories at the Tournament Players Course. Last year, it was
Stuart Appleby. This time, his closest buddy did a great Crocodile
Dundee imitation, except that it was a Walrus he was wrestling with
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On a blustery day that kept scores higher than they had been all
week, Allenby fired a 72 _ the highest final-round score by a
Houston winner in 23 years. He then put a ball in the water on the
first playoff hole and still found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Appleby, who had missed the cut Friday in his
title defense, was watching his mate come up big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was pretty emotional, watching Stuey win,'' Allenby
said. ``And for him to come out and be here, we got a bit
teary-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Appleby won the '99 SHO, it was his first victory since his
wife, Renay, died in a traffic accident. In the scoring tent after
the tournament, Allenby's wife, Sandy, was the first person to give
Appleby a victory hug.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's finish made it two years in a row that she has been the
first to give the victor a squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to have my first U.S. tour win,'' said Allenby,
who matched Stadler's 13-under 275 total, a stroke better than
Loren Roberts and Joel Edwards. ``It's also nice to have Stuart
Appleby's name right above mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby seemed almost as stoked for his friend as he was for his
own victory a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely pumped for Robert,'' Appleby said. ``I'm so
happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama was thick throughout most of Sunday. Allenby and
Stadler were playing together, and while they each had problems
during the course of their rounds, they never were far from the
lead. Allenby overcame a water ball and double bogey at the third
hole, and Stadler dodged the trouble of bogeys at the ninth and
10th holes.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby had a one-shot lead through 16 holes and had some
company along the way. When he got to the 17th fairway, Appleby was
walking in the gallery to the right of the 17th green. Little did
Appleby know that Allenby would practically doink him in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby's shot was about 10 yards to the right of the green and
chipped 12 feet by the pin. His par try slid by the high side,
dropping him into a tie with Stadler, who narrowly missed a 35-foot
birdie try.
</P>
<P>
   So to the 18th they went, tied at 13 under par.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier, Brad Fabel had lost his chance with a
double bogey on the 17th when his drive went into the jungle right
of the fairway. Edwards missed his chance at a spot in the playoff
when his tee shot found the left trees on No. 18 and he had to
punch out, making a bogey to drop to 12-under.
</P>
<P>
   When Allenby and Stadler had to make testy par putts to force
the playoff, it looked like the extra holes would be a showcase for
sharp putting.
</P>
<P>
   When Allenby put a 6-iron into the water just a few feet from
the bulkhead at the 18th, he gave Stadler a seemingly simple chance
at victory. He was 35 feet left of the hole and needed only two
putts for victory. But the first one stopped five feet short and
the second one buzzed the right lip. Allenby sank an eight-footer
to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Both players made routine pars on the 10th and 18th holes, which
they alternated on in the playoff. But Stadler missed a six-footer
at the 10th and an eight-footer at the 18th, either of which could
have won the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a bit of intrigue on the 76th hole, the matter
was settled. Allenby bombed a 140-yard wedge out of the left
fairway bunker over the green and into the bleachers. His nearest
point of relief was to the left of a television tower left of the
green. He chipped 10 feet past the hole, then stroked the putt into
the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler had powered his approach over the pin and about three
inches into the rough behind the green. His flop shot stopped 12
feet short, and his putt to extend the tournament died off to the
right.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler was trying to win for the first time since 1996. He had
quite the home-course advantage as fans roared approval at his good
play, while Allenby's support was more polite than partisan.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was Allenby, who also had a four-year drought
between wins, who came through. His last one came in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After the win, Australians were calling in from all over.
Houstonian Steve Elkington, who was born and raised Down Under,
called Allenby on the green via a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt they'll be checking in from the Outback, too.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ Momentum might as well be the equivalent of eternal
life on Earth, as unattainable as it appears to be for the Astros
so far this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foiled once again in their attempt to string together more than
two consecutive victories, the Astros on Sunday suffered a tough
4-3 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This game was one the Astros never should have let escape their
grasp. In command for most of the afternoon, they lost a three-run
lead in the sixth inning and eventually lost the game on Jeromy
Burnitz's two-out RBI double off Doug Henry in the bottom of the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating that we haven't been able to put more
wins together,'' Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``But it's
not like we're not trying. We're definitely capable of playing
better than we're playing. We're just not clicking right now; we're
not meshing. But we just have to keep pushing and try not to get
too frustrated. I still believe we're going to show more
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros closed out April with a 9-14 record, their most
losses in the opening month of the season since they were 11-14 in
1989. Their .391 winning percentage is their worst in April since
they opened the 1984 season with an 8-14 record (.364).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough year so far,'' said Astros starting pitcher
Shane Reynolds. ``We've just started out bad. We're trying to put a
winning streak together, and we still have a chance to win this
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds had won his previous three starts before taking a
no-decision in Sunday's game. He held the Brewers to three runs
(two earned) in 6 innings before the bullpen took over.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanded reliever Yorkis Perez retired the only batter he
faced, and Henry (0-1) retired five of seven before his encounter
with Burnitz, who was hitless in his previous eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to stay away (with the pitch), and I got a little
more of the plate than I wanted to,'' said Henry, who has allowed
nine runs in his 11 appearances. ``It just gets frustrating. I'm
trying to turn this around, and it's not working. But I ain't
quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a different set of circumstances, Astros center fielder
Roger Cedeno probably would have caught Burnitz's game-winning hit,
which sailed over his head and bounced over the fence, allowing
Marquis Grissom to score the decisive run. Because Grissom was at
second base, Cedeno was playing shallow with hopes of being able to
throw Grissom out at the plate on a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit that ball pretty good,'' Cedeno said. ``With the
winning run on second base, I had to play kind of in-between.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Burnitz's double, the extent of the scoring was a pair
of three-run homers _ Richard Hidalgo's in the second and Geoff
Jenkins' in the sixth, the latter serving as the precursor to a
near brawl. After Jenkins' massive blast, which he admired from the
batter's box before circling the bases, Reynolds came in high and
tight with an 0-2 pitch on the next hitter, Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers starter Jason Bere already had hit Hidalgo in the plate
appearance following his home run. Reynolds insisted he wasn't
throwing at Hayes, but both benches and bullpens emptied before
order was restored. Home-plate umpire Dan Morrison issued warnings
to both managers, and the game was completed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure any of it was intentional,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact the Astros scored in just one inning and produced only
seven hits was disturbing, especially considering they're hitting
just .217 through the first three games of the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``As explosive as our offense is, we should be scoring a lot
more runs,'' said Caminiti, who was 1-for-2 with three walks.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Caminiti's three walks gave the Astros their first
baserunner of the game, and left fielder Matt Mieske followed with
an infield single, setting the table for Hidalgo's sixth homer,
which ranks second on the team behind Jeff Bagwell's eight. The
Brewers tied the game in the sixth on Jenkins' towering shot to
right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly feel like I only threw one bad pitch the whole
game, and that's the one that tied it up,'' Reynolds said. ``This
might have been the best I've felt all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' winning rally started with one out in the ninth.
Henry walked Grissom, who was pinch-hitting for relief pitcher
David Weathers. After James Mouton flied out to right field, Mark
Loretta singled to right, setting the stage for Burnitz's heroics,
which dropped the Astros to 0-4 in one-run games.

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
THE WOODLANDS _ This is not to disparage anything about Robert
Allenby's performance under stressful and pressure-packed
circumstances.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the picture that followed his wonderful and gutsy Shell
Houston Open playoff win Sunday is, to say the least, more common
on the PGA Tour than 32-inch waists.
</P>
<P>
   There's the young, handsome champion, shaking his fist into the
air after sinking his nerve-racking 12-foot putt on the fourth
playoff hole and watching his opponent barely miss. There's the
tall, slim, fair-haired champion with the prim-and-proper accent,
rushing to the ropes to hug his blond wife and beautiful baby.
There's the trophy presentation. There's the obligatory kiss
planted on the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Craig Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   He's lost 50 pounds and still buys pants that he has to hitch up
after every shot. He stands there, all disheveled, his hair a mess,
sweat dampening his shirt and his emotions on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   He plays the game the way we all would, if we had his talent.
Mis-hit a shot? Throw the club. Hit an iron into the rough? Slam
the club into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Mis-hit a five-foot putt for the money? Let out a choice
four-letter word. Blow another putt, then another, then another?
Call yourself stupid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have at it,'' Stadler told reporters, after running his hand
through his mussy hair in complete frustration. ``Take your best
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to second place at the
SHO, which Stadler so eloquently described in everyday terms:
``Second place isn't worth a compared to first.''
</P>
<P>
   Stadler only endeared himself more to the people who crammed
themselves around the TPC hoping to see him win a tournament that
should've, would've and could've been his. The Walrus wallowed and
wavered and came down with the yips at money time, just like we all
would have.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody seemed to care. Why not? He was one of us, someone
with whom the hackers can relate, while Allenby was one of the
countless PGA pretty boys, with so much talent it almost makes us
sick.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, the best golfer on this day ultimately won and
deserved the $504,000 check and all the pride and prestige that
goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Allenby stayed focused and determined throughout the tournament,
but especially on the gut-wrenching final day of the SHO, which
never ceases to amaze with its great finishes. Allenby made big
shot after big shot even when the odds of his winning seemed
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Allenby deserved was to hear cheers when his
approach on the first playoff hole landed in the water, while
Stadler was safely on the green in two.
</P>
<P>
   But the rude cheers indeed happened, because much of the crowd
grasped the obvious. Stadler is Everyman if Everyman had a game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly a classy show put on by the fans, but, hey,
how many times does a former Masters champion, a terrific golfer
with 12 PGA Tour wins to his credit, look and sound like one of the
fellas in our regular Sunday morning 50-cents-a-skin foursome?
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoff pretty much stunk,'' Stadler said. ``I hit a lot
of good shots and a lot of really bad putts.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. On the first playoff hole, the title should have been
Stadler's, but he pushed a five-footer right. Groan. We've been
there.
</P>
<P>
   On the second playoff hole, it should have been Stadler's title
again after a terrific iron to six feet, but he yanked the putt too
much. We've been there.
</P>
<P>
   On the third playoff hole, Stadler had a straight eight-footer
for the win. He pushed it again _ ``Cold-cocked it,'' he said.
We've been there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after Allenby received a favorable drop after hitting
his approach under the bleachers on No. 10, Allenby chipped to 12
feet and made the putt. Stadler got a good read from Allenby's putt
but missed his 12-footer by an inch.
</P>
<P>
   We've been there _ disappointed and disheartened.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, someone asked Stadler what he'll take from the bad
playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of Bud Lights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. All those fans who cheered wildly for Stadler and groaned
with his every miss as if it was them flubbing the putts probably
did the same. In fact, some obviously got a head start on Stadler
drowning his sorrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose that many opportunities,'' Stadler said, ``it
certainly doesn't leave a good taste in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Bud Light. We've been there.

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN the sixth inning, after Milwaukee's Geoff Jenkins had unloaded a
game-tying three-run homer off Shane Reynolds, the Houston pitcher
brushed back Charlie Hayes with an inside fastball, and Hayes took
a few ominous steps toward the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon you heard Bill Brown, calling the game on TV, utter
the most ominous phrase in baseball: ``Both benches have emptied.''
They came from the dugouts, and they came from the bullpens. But
only words were exchanged, and after a warning to both teams from
the men in blue, the game continued.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was splendid. Only a few days earlier, a brawl
between the Tigers and White Sox had resulted in the suspension of
16, including both managers. A total of 25 players and coaches were
hit with fines.
</P>
<P>
   And in a casual moment Sunday, before tempers flared, Jim
Deshaies had mentioned there was talk of the pitchers forming their
own union. Brown jokingly asked the former Astros pitcher, now his
partner in the booth, if he would seek the job of running the
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support their agenda any way I can,'' he said. ``The
problem is, you want the really top pitchers to be out front. But
the good ones win no matter what; they could be pitching from
second base.''
</P>
<P>
   You reflect that the pitchers are rebelling because of a trend
that can no longer be ignored. Virtually every recent change made
by the game's interior decorators has favored the hitter. The mound
is lower, the strike zone smaller, and in most of the new parks _
Enron Field somehow comes to mind _ the fences are closer.
</P>
<P>
   Today pitchers are scolded for not throwing inside and driving
back the hitters, whose tender sensibilities are offended if they
can't crowd the plate. Yet the umpires rarely call the inside
strike, adding to the frustration of the men on the hill.
</P>
<P>
   The tension builds. Pitchers feel more and more under siege,
pressured to take back with force the inside corner. Some hitters
now wear pads on their arms and legs and don't mind taking one for
the team _ as long as the location is fairly benign. Any pitch high
and tight is regarded as a barbaric practice, roughly in the class
of clubbing baby seals.
</P>
<P>
   In another era, it was the general custom for a batter who felt
abused to meet the pitcher under the stands after the game. The
next advance in retaliation turned out to be the bunt along the
first-base line. This offered two exciting options: If the pitcher
fielded the bunt, the batter could level him going down the line.
And if the first baseman came after the ball, forcing the pitcher
to cover the bag, the runner could nail him with his spikes. Spikes
were metal in those days, and players wore them very sharp. They
cut each other like fighting roosters.
</P>
<P>
   Always popular, of course, was the ``purpose pitch,'' a term
created by the late Branch Rickey, a pious man who did not attend
games on Sunday. The pitcher avenged a fallen teammate by drilling
someone on the opposing side. The goal was to punish, not to maim.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, a batter would demonstrate his displeasure by
throwing his bat at the mound. But you seldom see this today
because it was hard to be accurate from a distance of 60 feet, six
inches.
</P>
<P>
   What batters are partial to now is charging the mound and trying
the case with knuckles. Of course, it makes no sense at all. The
pitcher has to throw inside for tactical reasons, as well as to
show his teammates he doesn't lack innards. Of more importance, no
owner wants to see his high-priced talent injured in a scrap or a
pileup.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the benches clear, valuable merchandise is in
jeopardy. So plainly the remedy of going to the mound has failed,
and baseball now must look for alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manager must control his players,'' said Detroit skipper
Phil Garner. Of course, Phil said this prior to getting slapped
with an eight-day suspension, along with Chicago counterpart Jerry
Manuel. It is hard to see how the managers can exercise control
from their vantage point in the commode.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Tigers and White Sox penalized and the total
number of games to be missed, 82, represent the harshest group
punishment on record. In an interesting footnote, the judge in this
case was Frank Robinson, baseball's director of operations. In his
own playing days, Frank had his share of fights.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers have the worst record in baseball, meaning it isn't
hard to imagine their frame of mind. The Chicago fireworks started
when Dean Palmer, the Detroit third baseman, rushed the mound after
being hit by Jim Parque. The Tigers may have found an outlet for
their stress, but their play hasn't improved.
</P>
<P>
   As home runs pile up, and pitchers walk the park, one forecast
seems safe. This is going to be a long, hot summer.

CABLE COMPANY BLOCKS ABC IN KEY MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)  (DUPLICATON WARNING: The following story is also being transmitted
with ``e'' and ``f'' category codes) 
 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ABC television network went dark on Time Warner
Cable systems in New York, Philadelphia and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
early on Monday morning as talks between the network's parent
company, the Walt Disney Co., and the cable company broke down.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks struck 12:01 a.m., when an agreement that allows the
cable company to carry the stations ran out, Time Warner began
blocking the signals of ABC stations, including WABC-TV in New
York. Ultimately a total of 3.5 million housholds that subscribe to
Time Warner in markets including Houston, Los Angeles and suburban
Milwaukee were expected to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The failed talks meant that Time Warner customers had to
disconnect their cable boxes and use standard TV antennas to get
ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the stations' signals would not be returned to
the cable systems unless the two sides could come to an agreement.
Barring that, it was possible that Federal Communications
Commission could help resolve the matter, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Each side was quick to blame the other for the removal of the
ABC stations. Each said the other had disregarded federal
regulations and proved unyielding in the negotiations, which began
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an expired agreement that had allowed Time Warner to
transmit the signal of seven Disney-owned, ABC TV stations, over
its cable systems. That agreement ran out in late December and the
two sides have agreed to one-month extensions ever since as the two
sides hash out how much Time Warner will pay Disney for its cable
channels. The last extension expired at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president, said that with Disney
permitting transmission of the station's signals through May 24,
Time Warner was bound to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thoroughly outrageous,'' he said. ``We gave Time
Warner total, complete and unqualified authorization to carry our
broadcast signals and they chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner at midnight began running a headline
that said ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner promised to attempt to resolve the situation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have also highlighted some of the complex issues
facing players in the emerging new media universe, which could be
dominated by AOL Time Warner when that merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began late last year when Disney asked for several
concessions from Time Warner in return for allowing Time Warner to
continue carrying seven of its ABC stations. Disney has demanded
that Time Warner cable systems not only feature its new channels _
Toon Disney and the Soap Channel _ but also make the Disney Channel
part of the basic service packages, and Time Warner says the
company has asked for as much as $300 million for the right to
carry the channels. Time Warner has agreed to Disney's demands
regarding the channels, but it has balked at the amount of money it
says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued, executives said, Disney also raised
concerns that a merged AOL Time Warner would have too much power in
the coming age of interactive television, in which consumers will
be offered more channels and the opportunity to purchase goods
through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, Disney's Washington lobbyist, who is advising
the company's negotiators, said Disney feared that Time Warner
would hinder other entertainment companies from offering
interactive programming over its cable lines while promoting its
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, when the proper technology is in place,
ABC could conceivably enable viewers of its local and national
newscasts to press a button on their remote controls and have more
information delivered to their TV screens. To do so would require
two-way communication along cable or phone lines. Padden said
Disney worries that Time Warner would block that feature from ABC
newscasts while promoting a similar one on CNN, which it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, there are concerns that Time Warner's
on-screen programming guides will promote Time Warner's programming
over offerings from other companies. Time Warner could also block
channels it does not own from offering sponsors the opportunity to
create interactive advertisements, he said. ``We said, `Please
commit to us that you will treat our channels no differently than
you treat the channels that you own,''' Padden said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, Time Warner representatives have
called Disney's demand too broad for discussion. ``What company
would negotiate away those kinds of commercial rights for
businesses that don't even exist yet?'' said Mike Luftman, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also said Disney was demanding high fees because it
calculated that Time Warner could not afford to lose the right to
broadcast ABC. Losing ABC's signal now would anger Time Warner
customers, who might decide to switch to satellite television to
get the channels. (In Houston, Disney gave out 18,000 free
satellite dishes in in an attempt to put more pressure on Time
Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives do not deny that they are asking for
concessions from Time Warner that they might not have been able to
win if a new broadcasting agreement were already in place. But they
want to set terms for their relationship with Time Warner before
its merger with America Online receives government approval and it
becomes even more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had agreed to grant Time Warner permission to retransmit
ABC programming through May 24, the end of the crucial ratings
sweeps period, in which broadcasters gauge audience levels in order
to set advertising rates. Time Warner has refused to accept that
extension, demanding instead an eight-month postponement of the
deadline, which would come well after the expected close of the
Time Warner-America Online merger.

   NEW YORK _ The ABC television network went dark on Time Warner
Cable systems in New York, Philadelphia and Raleigh-Durham, N.C.,
early on Monday morning as talks between the network's parent
company, the Walt Disney Co., and the cable company broke down.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks struck 12:01 a.m., when an agreement that allows the
cable company to carry the stations ran out, Time Warner began
blocking the signals of ABC stations, including WABC-TV in New
York. Ultimately a total of 3.5 million housholds that subscribe to
Time Warner in markets including Houston, Los Angeles and suburban
Milwaukee were expected to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The failed talks meant that Time Warner customers had to
disconnect their cable boxes and use standard TV antennas to get
ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the stations' signals would not be returned to
the cable systems unless the two sides could come to an agreement.
Barring that, it was possible that Federal Communications
Commission could help resolve the matter, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Each side was quick to blame the other for the removal of the
ABC stations. Each said the other had disregarded federal
regulations and proved unyielding in the negotiations, which began
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an expired agreement that had allowed Time Warner to
transmit the signal of seven Disney-owned, ABC TV stations, over
its cable systems. That agreement ran out in late December and the
two sides have agreed to one-month extensions ever since as the two
sides hash out how much Time Warner will pay Disney for its cable
channels. The last extension expired at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president, said that with Disney
permitting transmission of the station's signals through May 24,
Time Warner was bound to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thoroughly outrageous,'' he said. ``We gave Time
Warner total, complete and unqualified authorization to carry our
broadcast signals and they chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner at midnight began running a headline
that said ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner promised to attempt to resolve the situation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have also highlighted some of the complex issues
facing players in the emerging new media universe, which could be
dominated by AOL Time Warner when that merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began late last year when Disney asked for several
concessions from Time Warner in return for allowing Time Warner to
continue carrying seven of its ABC stations. Disney has demanded
that Time Warner cable systems not only feature its new channels _
Toon Disney and the Soap Channel _ but also make the Disney Channel
part of the basic service packages, and Time Warner says the
company has asked for as much as $300 million for the right to
carry the channels. Time Warner has agreed to Disney's demands
regarding the channels, but it has balked at the amount of money it
says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued, executives said, Disney also raised
concerns that a merged AOL Time Warner would have too much power in
the coming age of interactive television, in which consumers will
be offered more channels and the opportunity to purchase goods
through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, Disney's Washington lobbyist, who is advising
the company's negotiators, said Disney feared that Time Warner
would hinder other entertainment companies from offering
interactive programming over its cable lines while promoting its
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, when the proper technology is in place,
ABC could conceivably enable viewers of its local and national
newscasts to press a button on their remote controls and have more
information delivered to their TV screens. To do so would require
two-way communication along cable or phone lines. Padden said
Disney worries that Time Warner would block that feature from ABC
newscasts while promoting a similar one on CNN, which it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, there are concerns that Time Warner's
on-screen programming guides will promote Time Warner's programming
over offerings from other companies. Time Warner could also block
channels it does not own from offering sponsors the opportunity to
create interactive advertisements, he said. ``We said, `Please
commit to us that you will treat our channels no differently than
you treat the channels that you own,''' Padden said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, Time Warner representatives have
called Disney's demand too broad for discussion. ``What company
would negotiate away those kinds of commercial rights for
businesses that don't even exist yet?'' said Mike Luftman, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also said Disney was demanding high fees because it
calculated that Time Warner could not afford to lose the right to
broadcast ABC. Losing ABC's signal now would anger Time Warner
customers, who might decide to switch to satellite television to
get the channels. (In Houston, Disney gave out 18,000 free
satellite dishes in in an attempt to put more pressure on Time
Warner.)
</P>
<P>

AMID CONTROVERSY, MAYFIELD WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS BREWSTER  
 Inland Valley Daily Bulletin 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. - Jeremy Mayfield, under a cloud of suspicion by
NASCAR, overcame a day of adversity and anxiety to win the NAPA
California 500 on a brilliant Sunday afternoon. Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   More than four hours after taking the checkered flag at the NAPA
California 500, the sanctioning body announced his Ford Taurus
failed to meet the requirement for minimum roof height during a
routine post-race inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like Mayfield's dance on the No. 12 of his Mobil
1-sponsored car, might have caved in the roof. According to NASCAR
spokesman Danielle Humphrey, the required height of 51 inches was
not met at a post-race inspection, although she did not have the
amount of infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The win will not be affected,'' said Humphrey. ``The car will
be confiscated by NASCAR so it can be looked at further.''
</P>
<P>
   With his performance, Mayfield became the 10th different winner
of a Winston Cup Series race this year in 10 starts. His journey
before an estimated sellout crowd of 110,000 at California Speedway
took him from a lap down and in last place to a 0.300-second margin
of victory over Bobby Labonte and a winner's check of $125,925.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, we had a great car,'' said Mayfield, who went 62 races
before scoring his second Cup victory. ``We had a problem in the
oil lines. The gauge was pegged at 340 degrees, but it hung in
there. That won the race right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was burning up in my car and everything else. It really
shows how tough this team is.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 22 lead changes among 15 drivers in the 250-lap event
that took 3 hours, 20 minutes and 50 seconds to complete. Darrell
Waltrip, retiring from racing after a 29-year career at the end of
the season, gave his fans one last chance to applaud as he led lap
156 before fading to the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd and Jeff Burton completed the top five, followed by
Ward Burton, pole-sitter Mike Skinner, Rusty Wallace, Dale Jarrett
and Tony Stewart. Defending champion Jeff Gordon, who was never a
factor throughout the day,finished 11th. He was one of 20 cars in
the field of 43 that finished in the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Mayfield, the Owensboro, Ky., resident who
finished second at this race in 1998 to Mark Martin, went through
an eventful weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, NASCAR vice president and chief operating officer
Mike Helton acknowledged there was ``an issue with the No. 12
car.'' There had been reports that Mayfield's fuel did not meet a
post-race inspection in the last Cup race at Talladega, Ala., two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Talk in the garage area has focused on possible suspensions,
loss of points and fines, although Helton said it would be early
this week before a decision is rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough,'' Mayfield said about the off-track
distractions. ``I don't know what to say because nothing has come
out yet ... but these two weeks have been pretty weird for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But no tougher than Mayfield's day at the track. The Mobil 1
Ford Taurus driver overcame:
</P>
<P>
   -- The oil problem which plagued him all day and was never
fixed. Mayfield spent the entire day with his back against the
32-gallon oil container.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rookie Matt Kenseth, who probably would have won had there
not been two yellow flags in the last 30 laps. Kenseth, who led
four times for 119 laps, rallied to finish third after falling as
far back as seventh when he pitted on lap 220.
</P>
<P>
   -- A failed ignition box on the final restart of the race on lap
246.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into turn one I had a good start and all of a sudden it
quit running,'' said Mayfield, ``Your natural instinct is you start
hitting switches somewhere and I knew where the ignition box was
and I slapped it real quick. Bobby was under me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Man, we're done here,' but I guess he got loose
or whatever and our car recovered. I just had my hand up trying to
motion him off because that could have been a big wreck if I would
have switched boxes and it wasn't that
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who assumed the Winston Cup points lead by 20 points
over Martin, wanted to pass Mayfield on the outside, but checked up
when he saw Mayfield slow and lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kinda scared me a little bit because I thought I was going
to run into him,'' said Labonte. ``It was one of those deals where
I kind of had the pass but wasn't sure I was clear.''
</P>
<P>
   What was clear to Labonte was that without the yellow flags,
Kenseth would have won his first Cup race in his 15th start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Matt would have won and I might have finished
second,'' said Labonte. Kenseth, who won Saturday's Busch Grand
National Series Auto Club 300 for the second straight year, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were two cautions at the end and we didn't (win),''
said the rookie points leader. ``I mean, a 4 1/2 - or five-second
lead - plus we were running a tenth faster than Bobby was with 30
laps to go - unless I did something incredibly stupid or something
broke on the car, we were probably gonna win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not the way it turned out. It's great to run third,
but it's not my goal to finish third.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth lost the lead when Jimmy Spencer, who sat on the outside
pole, became the third of four drivers to hit the wall in turn
four. He came in for four tires, as did Labonte, but Mayfield opted
for two tires and two bags of ice. ``One time I was like, `I'm not
going to make it.' '' said Mayfield, whose worst finish at the
Fontana track is 12th in the 1997 inaugural event. ``I've never
gotten out of a car but I was burned up and I didn't think I was
going to make it until the end, but they filled me up with ice and
I took off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield led just 26 laps, at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is made of strong people that have been through a
lot and never gave up all day long,'' said Mayfield. ``No matter
how far you're down, just keep digging and keep working.''

IS REUSED WATER SAFE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &HT;    By HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chemical and biological contaminants in wastewater
to be recycled for drinking under Los Angeles' ``toilet-to-tap''
program pose a threat to human health because of the difficulty of
detection and filtration, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the water reuse field said there is no way to know
for sure whether treated wastewater is really free from every
possible chemical and biological contaminant, and testing for such
matter is often unreliable or outright flawed.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials insist the project to recycle
wastewater for household use -- labeled by critics as a
``toilet-to-tap'' program -- will produce safe, clean, drinkable
water for residents of the San Fernando Valley and other parts of
Los Angeles. The project, now on hold, could start producing
recycled water for use in about five years.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say there are too many variables, and using filtered
wastewater for human consumption should only be considered ``a
solution of last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always inventing new chemicals for all kinds of
purposes, and they end up in the wastewater,'' said water reuse
consultant Daniel Okun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how to measure them because they don't tell us
what's there -- they're trade secrets. There are thousands and
thousands of these chemicals in the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Okun is a retired University of North Carolina environmental
engineering professor who has served as a consultant on reuse
projects throughout California since the 1970s. He opposes reuse
for human consumption, calling it ``a risk I believe is
unnecessary,'' but says more needs to be done in the area of
agricultural reuse and water conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Local and state water officials dispute Okun's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is safe,'' said S. David Freeman, general manager of
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very stringent water-quality standards. This is not
the DWP saying the water is safe, this is the (state) department of
health, which throws you in jail if you're violating the health
standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said treated water coming from the Donald C. Tillman
water reclamation plant -- which will be spread into the ground,
where it percolates some 500 feet into the groundwater supply -- is
much cleaner than the water that, for example runs through people's
lawns, picking up fertilizer and pesticides, before it reaches that
same groundwater supply.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials also noted that the water Los Angeles
imports from other regions -- specifically from the Colorado River
and the San Francisco Bay Area -- is already made up partly of
treated wastewater. Upstream communities treat their sewage and
then dump the water into the rivers feeding the Bay Area, before
that water is pumped to Southern California and disinfected, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The East Valley Water Reclamation Project was supposed to start
pumping water in April but is on hold while the DWP board and the
City Council review it.
</P>
<P>
   The DWP board is expected to discuss it Tuesday, while the City
Council's Environmental Quality and Waste Management Committee is
expected to schedule a hearing sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   It will at first treat 10,000 acre-feet of water a year, but
could be expanded up to 35,000 acre-feet -- enough to supply about
70,000 families for a year. The water will spread underground for
about five years before it is drawn up through wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should be anxious or worried,'' said
David Spath, chief of drinking water and environmental management
for the state Department of Health Services. ``I think there are
enough safeguards in place to reduce the risk to a level that is
very, very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most well-known health studies in Southern
California are based on one of the nation's oldest water reuse
projects, the Montebello Forebay project near the Whittier Narrows
Dam, run by the Water Replenishment District of Southern California
and the Los Angeles County Sanitation District since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies of the health of people drinking water from that
project have turned up rates of cancer and diseases that are no
different from the rates found in similar populations drinking
water from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would expect, if there was an adverse effect from drinking
reclaimed water, the more you drank the worse people's health would
be. It didn't work out that way,'' said Earle Hartling, water
recycling coordinator for the Sanitation District. ``It was
statistically scattered, just like you would find anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Ongerth, a former chief of the state Bureau of
Sanitary Engineering and a co-author of the state's regulations on
water reuse, said the study was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Ongerth, who agrees with Okun in opposing the use of recycled
wastewater for human consumption, said it is extremely difficult to
measure the health of a large population over a long period of
time, especially one as mobile as Southern California.

reclaimed water people in the study have ingested. And sometimes
health effects such as cancer take a much longer time to manifest.

impossible to prove either way, safe or unsafe. It's a matter of
degree and a great deal of subjective opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of water reuse done by the National Research Council in
1998, considered one of the most comprehensive looks at the issue,
said the results of the Montebello study ``do not necessarily prove
the safety of reclaimed water for human consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it calls for more sophisticated tests at a national
level to evaluate health risks associated with using reclaimed
water.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling acknowledged there are many unknown substances present
in untreated water but said ``every single time this new pollutant
du jour comes up ... health department officials set standards for
them, and the treatment process
</P>
<P>
   we operate has been found to remove them to down below the
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRC study, titled ``Issues in Potable Reuse,'' said that
while reusing wastewater for human consumption appears to be safe,
it should be considered ``a solution of last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   The report added that it should ``be adopted only when all other
alternatives for nonpotable reuse, conservation and demand
management have been evaluated and rejected as technically or
economically infeasible.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are the alternatives?
</P>
<P>
   There are always other options, of course, but experts note that
some of them are significantly more expensive, involve political
obstacles and environmental consequences, or are unreliable during
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   Importing more water, for example, is not likely because
Southern California is being forced to live within its current
amounts due to environmental concerns, as well as competition with
other states that use the same water sources, said Metropolitan
Water District spokesman Adan Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   Other options include encouraging more conservation measures,
either by farmers who use large quantities of water or by suburban
households that consume the majority of their water in keeping
their lawns green.
</P>
<P>
   But both of those involve asking for voluntary measures from
other people and are therefore not considered reliable. In
addition, both groups already have taken conservation steps.
Farmers have improved their irrigation techniques, while households
reduced their water usage by installing low-flush toilets and more
efficient shower heads during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Freeman said, is to plan ahead for the future and
become more self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we absolutely need this last drop of water today?'' Freeman
said. ``Of course not. We don't need any last drop of water today.
Anybody can be successful in water supply in years of plenty. It's
our job to be sure there's enough water here when we have a
drought.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman added: ``My daddy was an umbrella salesman, and he said
any fool can buy an umbrella on a rainy day. It takes a wise one to
buy when the sun is shining.''

DELK PUTS A CHARGE INTO KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - This was a little hard to see coming, no short
jokes intended.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll have to forgive the Lakers if they were not expecting
Tony Delk to come off the bench in the fourth quarter Sunday and
make like Teddy Roosevelt leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Delk is a 6-2 backup, journeyman point guard. Plays behind Mr.
Flash himself, Kings star Jason Williams. Delk spent most of the
season's first half never getting off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he was in the fourth quarter, acting like Magic
Johnson in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   Delk had four offensive rebounds and nine points in the decisive
quarter. The smallest guy on the floor, and he was pounding the
boards. He and Predrag Stojakovic, another forgotten bench player
in this series, were the sparks that led the Kings to an 18-2 run
the lethargic Lakers could never overcome.
</P>
<P>
   And Delk pulled it off while giving the Kings something Williams
often struggles to provide - control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes as a team, I think you have to slow the ball down,''
Delk said. ``Sometimes we rush our offense. We've done that a lot
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs are really important, you can't just run down the
court and take the first shot available. You can't do that. Teams
are too good.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day, Delk had 11 points and five rebounds - all on the
offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever had a game like that,'' he said.
``I've had a lot of rebounds, but never all offensive. This is
something new for me. I took a page out of Ron Harper's book.''
</P>
<P>
   And Delk did his damage in the fourth quarter while being
guarded by Kobe Bryant, who has at least five inches on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Delk played tremendously,'' Kings forward Chris Webber
said. ``His patience, his dribbling, hitting the 15-footer. We
could really see it during the game. He was ready and pumped up to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy who sat on the bench in 21 of the Kings' first 55 games
was coming up big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Delk was just terrific,'' Kings coach Rick Adleman said.
``What can you say? He defended, he got those offensive boards. He
had a pretty tough assignment in Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony's been playing so well for us. He's the one guy in all
three games who played pretty darned good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stojakovic had been the Kings' second-leading scorer against the
Lakers in the regular season, averaging 20.3 points in the four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the first two games of their playoff series, he was 2
for 12. Sunday, he had 19 points and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a different player on his home court,'' Bryant said.
``His confidence level is higher at home. We could have chased him
a little bit better and done a better job of guarding him.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the Sacramento bench was coming through.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat the Lakers, we have to have those two guys click, and
they did tonight,'' Kings center Vlade Divac said. ``Tony just put
on a show.''

KENSETH'S LUCK TAKES A TURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA - Is it better to be lucky than good?
</P>
<P>
   Ask Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston Cup rookie knows the answer after finishing
third in Sunday's NAPA Auto Parts 500 before more then 100,000 at
California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``To finish third was great,'' said Kenseth, who finished .87
seconds behind winner Jeremy Mayfield. ``But it's not my goal to
run third. I want to win races. If we would have run third or
fourth all day and finished third, I could take that. But when you
lead almost the entire race and dominate the last half and have it
wrapped up and lose it at the end like that, it's a tough one to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you consider how strong Kenseth was Sunday. He
led 119 of the 250 laps, including 78 of the final 163, and was a
comfortable 4.92 seconds ahead of second-place Bobby Labonte with
just 30 circuits remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a four-and-half, or five-second lead and were running a
(tenth-of-a-second) quicker than (Bobby Labonte),'' Kenseth said.
``So unless I did something incredibly stupid or something broke in
the car, we were going to win the race. But that's not the way it
turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jimmy Spencer changed that when he hit the outside wall
in turn four, bringing out the fourth of five cautions and wiping
out Kenseth's margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned on losing all day,'' Kenseth joked. ``I knew
something was gonna happen, and the minute I start thinking to
myself, `Boy, we are in pretty good shape,' sure enough, something
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That caution brought the field to pit lane on lap 220. Kenseth
and Labonte each took four tires. Martin and Mayfield each took
two, putting them up front. Kenseth and Labonte dropped to seventh
and ninth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made more sense to get four tires than two,'' Kenseth
said. ``As soon as the caution came out, I told (crew chief Robbie
Reiser), `give me four tires.' In hindsight, maybe I could have
just got two and would have been able to hold (the field) off,
maybe not. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything in my power, and my team did everything in
their power to win the race. We just came up a little bit short.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth fought his way through the field and was running fourth
when the caution was shown for the final time with seven laps
remaining after Dick Trickle scraped the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be tough to come back (from seventh),''
Kenseth said. ``We were too loose with new tires the entire day. I
knew we had our work cut out for us. I'm actually pretty happy to
come back and finish third, considering we came out in the pits in
(seventh) place and bunched together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like our chances were a little better (when the track
went green with four laps left). That (caution) helped. There just
wasn't enough laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth slipped by Jeff Burton on the restart and zoomed to
within two-car lengths of Mayfield and Labonte but could get no
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both better on short runs,'' Kenseth said. ``We saw
it all day. I would get new tires with air pressure down, and my
car would just be extremely loose. I just couldn't stand on the gas
like I needed to be able to catch those guys.''

CABLE COMPANY BLOCKS ABC IN KEY MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for reorganizing and new material)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being transmitted
with ``e'' and ``f'' category codes) 
 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The ABC television network went dark on Time Warner
Cable systems in New York and other major metropolitan areas arund
the country early on Monday morning as talks between the network's
parent company, the Walt Disney Co., and the cable company broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks struck 12:01 a.m., when an agreement that allows the
cable company to carry the ABC stations ran out, Time Warner began
blocking the signals, including that of WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately a total of 3.5 million households that subscribe to
Time Warner in markets including Houston, Los Angeles, suburban
Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., were expected to
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The failed talks meant that Time Warner customers had to
disconnect their cable boxes and use standard TV antennas to get
ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the stations' signals would not be returned to
the cable systems unless the two sides could come to an agreement.
Barring that, it was possible that Federal Communications
Commission could help resolve the matter, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an expired agreement that had allowed Time Warner to
transmit the signal of seven Disney-owned ABC TV stations over its
cable systems. That agreement ran out in late December and the two
sides have agreed to one-month extensions ever since as they hash
out how much Time Warner will pay Disney for its cable channels.
The last extension expired at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had agreed to grant Time Warner permission to retransmit
ABC programming through May 24, the end of the crucial ratings
sweeps period, in which broadcasters gauge audience levels in order
to set advertising rates. Time Warner has refused to accept that
extension, demanding instead an eight-month postponement of the
deadline, which would come well after the expected close of the
Time Warner-America Online merger.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were quick to blame each other for the removal of
the ABC stations. Each said the other had disregarded federal
regulations and proved unyielding in the negotiations, which began
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president, said that with Disney
permitting transmission of the station's signals through May 24,
Time Warner was bound to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thoroughly outrageous,'' he said. ``We gave Time
Warner total, complete and unqualified authorization to carry our
broadcast signals and they chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner at midnight began running a message
with a headline saying, ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered a proposal that would have kept ABC for our
customers,'' the message said. ``Disney said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner promised to attempt to resolve the situation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have also highlighted some of the complex issues
facing players in the emerging new media universe, which could be
dominated by AOL Time Warner when that merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began late last year when Disney asked for several
concessions from Time Warner in return for allowing Time Warner to
continue carrying seven of its ABC stations. Disney has demanded
that Time Warner cable systems not only feature its new channels _
Toon Disney and the Soap Channel _ but also make the Disney Channel
part of the basic service packages, and Time Warner says the
company has asked for as much as $300 million for the right to
carry the channels. Time Warner has agreed to Disney's demands
regarding the channels, but it has balked at the amount of money it
says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued, executives said, Disney also raised
concerns that a merged AOL Time Warner would have too much power in
the coming age of interactive television, in which consumers will
be offered more channels and the opportunity to purchase goods
through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, Disney's Washington lobbyist, who is advising
the company's negotiators, said Disney feared that Time Warner
would hinder other entertainment companies from offering
interactive programming over its cable lines while promoting its
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, when the proper technology is in place,
ABC could conceivably enable viewers of its local and national
newscasts to press a button on their remote controls and have more
information delivered to their TV screens. To do so would require
two-way communication along cable or phone lines. Padden said
Disney worries that Time Warner would block that feature from ABC
newscasts while promoting a similar one on CNN, which it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, there are concerns that Time Warner's
on-screen programming guides will promote Time Warner's programming
over offerings from other companies. Time Warner could also block
channels it does not own from offering sponsors the opportunity to
create interactive advertisements, he said. ``We said, `Please
commit to us that you will treat our channels no differently than
you treat the channels that you own,''' Padden said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, Time Warner representatives have
called Disney's demand too broad for discussion. ``What company
would negotiate away those kinds of commercial rights for
businesses that don't even exist yet?'' said Mike Luftman, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also said Disney was demanding high fees because it
calculated that Time Warner could not afford to lose the right to
broadcast ABC. Losing ABC's signal now would anger Time Warner
customers, who might decide to switch to satellite television to
get the channels. (In Houston, Disney gave out 18,000 free
satellite dishes in in an attempt to put more pressure on Time
Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives do not deny that they are asking for
concessions from Time Warner that they might not have been able to
win if a new broadcasting agreement were already in place. But they
want to set terms for their relationship with Time Warner before
its merger with America Online receives government approval and it
becomes even more powerful.

NO REASON FOR FANS TO SUPPORT ROCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Rocker comes to town tonight at Dodgers
Stadium, and this is not an excuse to stock up on size D batteries
and rotten fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is harmless. He is at most a sports social disease, known
around locker rooms everywhere as footus mouthus. He probably
doesn't even realize that he would be beloved in 49 states if he
had just limited his rude remarks to New York and the more unique
characteristics of its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   No, the most dangerous aspect of the Atlanta Braves closer, who
blasted a potpourri of humanity in a December issue of Sports
Illustrated, are those in orbit around him.
</P>
<P>
   An altogether too large group of fans, in Atlanta but also in
San Diego this past weekend, have cheered Rocker and sought his
autograph, as if there was something honorable in what he said and
the way he said it, as if there were some truths between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   There is no valid reason for anyone to seek Rocker out and
support him. Even if you believe he has the right to say anything
he wants, that he should be afforded the same freedom of speech as
everyone else regardless of how rude or moronic he may be, he
shouldn't be turned into some kind of sage of the politically
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply loyal Braves fans, who drone on endlessly with the
equally P.I. Tomahawk Chop, can be excused because they would
support anyone in a Braves uniform if he could help them win a
World Series. If Elian Gonzalez was 18 and had a splitter, he would
have been adopted by Ted Turner before papa even knew he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   But this drift of opinion appears to go beyond Braves fans. The
mot-so-silent majority lining up behind him Rocker are making their
own statement, and it's even more distasteful than Rockers'.
</P>
<P>
   It's just more proof that our species isn't fully evolved. Maybe
some people read or heard only the short version, that he took
shots at different races and gays. Some people are plumb tired of
incidents like this -- Fuzzy Zoeller on Tiger Woods, Reggie White
on a similar cross-section of mankind -- and irked at the messenger
as a result. And admittedly, the media has developed some bad
habits.
</P>
<P>
   But that shouldn't color anyone's opinion of Rocker. His words
speak for themselves. For those who have forgotten:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Imagine having to take the seven train (in New York) to the
ballpark, looking like Beirut, looking at some kid with purple hair
next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude who just got
out of jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom
with four kids. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. You can walk an entire
block in Times Square and not hear anybody speaking English. Asians
and Koreans and Vietnamese and Indians and Russians and Spanish
people ... How the hell did they get in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   _ About a female driver, he said ``Stupid b----! Learn to
f---ing drive!'' When another female driver strayed into his lane,
he said ``Look at this idiot. I guarantee you she's a Japanese
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he also called a black teammate a fat monkey'' and said
the Braves lost a game because shortstop Walt Weiss was too old.
And during the postseason against the Mets and Yankees, he spit at
fans, gave them the finger, and threw a 90-mph ball at a net fence
separating the fans from the field.
</P>
<P>
   By all means, let's cheer the man and invite him over for a
barbeque.
</P>
<P>
   What strikes me most about Rocker is that he's dumb.
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered everything he said. This wasn't a case of a
writer (Jeff Pearlman wrote the SI article) provoking someone to
speak, using quotes that were off-the-record, or playing
buddy-buddy with a guy and then turning on him. Rocker knew his New
York experience was on top of the agenda. And still he went off on
a rant.
</P>
<P>
   In his rushed apologies, Rocker said he wasn't racist or
prejudiced, and that he was baited by New York fans. But it is now
de rigeur for athletes who say racist things to say they're not
racist, as if we're supposed to draw a distinction when they use
the buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   If he had any smarts, he could have just couched his words like
a Pat Buchanan or Rush Limbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a shame it is that so many large American cities have
blighted communities, he could have said. Or he could have lamented
that family values have deteriorated to the point where kids act
out, where there are too many young, single mothers, and that many
of their fathers are in and out of the penal system.
</P>
<P>
   See John? The difference between a bigot and a conservative
politician is merely a vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   And timing. With so many people apparently in favor of sending
Elian home to Cuba, perhaps John's thoughts about immigration
simply were ahead of their time. I tried to ask the Dodgers Devon
White about the positive responses to Rocker, and he pondered the
question for a moment before politely declining to get in the
middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   If only Rocker would have had the same common sense when that
reporter came to Macon. No SI article, no penalty from Major League
Baseball, no headlines, no zippy one-liners from sports columnists
and talk show hosts. Just a dysfunctional relationship with a
dysfunctional city, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, John Rocker comes to town in assorted regalia -- Braves
closer, insensitive idiot, knee-jerk reactionary hero, symbol for
all that ails sports and its fans. I close with one of his quotes
from the SI article: I'm not a racist or prejudiced person. But
certain people bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, like John Rocker and his fans.

</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president, said that with Disney
permitting transmission of the station's signals through May 24,
Time Warner was bound to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thoroughly outrageous,'' he said. ``We gave Time
Warner total, complete and unqualified authorization to carry our
broadcast signals and they chose not to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner at midnight began running a message
with a headline saying, ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered a proposal that would have kept ABC for our
customers,'' the message said. ``Disney said no.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner promised to attempt to resolve the situation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have also highlighted some of the complex issues
facing players in the emerging new media universe, which could be
dominated by AOL Time Warner when that merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began late last year when Disney asked for several
concessions from Time Warner in return for allowing Time Warner to
continue carrying seven of its ABC stations. Disney has demanded
that Time Warner cable systems not only feature its new channels _
Toon Disney and the Soap Channel _ but also make the Disney Channel
part of the basic service packages, and Time Warner says the
company has asked for as much as $300 million for the right to
carry the channels. Time Warner has agreed to Disney's demands
regarding the channels, but it has balked at the amount of money it
says Disney is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continued, executives said, Disney also raised
concerns that a merged AOL Time Warner would have too much power in
the coming age of interactive television, in which consumers will
be offered more channels and the opportunity to purchase goods
through their television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, Disney's Washington lobbyist, who is advising
the company's negotiators, said Disney feared that Time Warner
would hinder other entertainment companies from offering
interactive programming over its cable lines while promoting its
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, when the proper technology is in place,
ABC could conceivably enable viewers of its local and national
newscasts to press a button on their remote controls and have more
information delivered to their TV screens. To do so would require
two-way communication along cable or phone lines. Padden said
Disney worries that Time Warner would block that feature from ABC
newscasts while promoting a similar one on CNN, which it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, there are concerns that Time Warner's
on-screen programming guides will promote Time Warner's programming
over offerings from other companies. Time Warner could also block
channels it does not own from offering sponsors the opportunity to
create interactive advertisements, he said. ``We said, `Please
commit to us that you will treat our channels no differently than
you treat the channels that you own,''' Padden said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, Time Warner representatives have
called Disney's demand too broad for discussion. ``What company
would negotiate away those kinds of commercial rights for
businesses that don't even exist yet?'' said Mike Luftman, a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner also said Disney was demanding high fees because it
calculated that Time Warner could not afford to lose the right to
broadcast ABC. Losing ABC's signal now would anger Time Warner
customers, who might decide to switch to satellite television to
get the channels. (In Houston, Disney gave out 18,000 free
satellite dishes in in an attempt to put more pressure on Time
Warner.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives do not deny that they are asking for
concessions from Time Warner that they might not have been able to
win if a new broadcasting agreement were already in place. But they
want to set terms for their relationship with Time Warner before
its merger with America Online receives government approval and it
becomes even more powerful.

CABLE COMPANY BLOCKS ABC IN KEY MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for reorganizing and new material)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: The following story is also being transmitted

 By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The ABC television network went dark on Time Warner
Cable systems in New York and other major metropolitan areas arund
the country early on Monday morning as talks between the network's
parent company, the Walt Disney Co., and the cable company broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   As clocks struck 12:01 a.m., when an agreement that allows the
cable company to carry the ABC stations ran out, Time Warner began
blocking the signals, including that of WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately a total of 3.5 million households that subscribe to
Time Warner in markets including Houston, Los Angeles, suburban
Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., were expected to
be affected.
</P>
<P>
   The failed talks meant that Time Warner customers had to
disconnect their cable boxes and use standard TV antennas to get
ABC programming.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said the stations' signals would not be returned to
the cable systems unless the two sides could come to an agreement.
Barring that, it was possible that Federal Communications
Commission could help resolve the matter, at least temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an expired agreement that had allowed Time Warner to
transmit the signal of seven Disney-owned ABC TV stations over its
cable systems. That agreement ran out in late December and the two
sides have agreed to one-month extensions ever since as they hash
out how much Time Warner will pay Disney for its cable channels.
The last extension expired at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had agreed to grant Time Warner permission to retransmit
ABC programming through May 24, the end of the crucial ratings
sweeps period, in which broadcasters gauge audience levels in order
to set advertising rates. Time Warner has refused to accept that
extension, demanding instead an eight-month postponement of the
deadline, which would come well after the expected close of the
Time Warner-America Online merger.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were quick to blame each other for the removal of
the ABC stations. Each said the other had disregarded federal
regulations and proved unyielding in the negotiations, which began
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president, said that with Disney
permitting transmission of the station's signals through May 24,
Time Warner was bound to carry them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thoroughly outrageous,'' he said. ``We gave Time
Warner total, complete and unqualified authorization to carry our
broadcast signals and they chose not to do so.''
</P>

with a headline saying, ``Disney Has Taken ABC Away From You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered a proposal that would have kept ABC for our
customers,'' the message said. ``Disney said no.''

VETERANS' LAST HONOR AT RISK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Larry Van Kuran is still bitter about how the
United States didn't support the troops during and immediately
after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Now he worries that when military veterans die, they might be
slighted once again.
</P>
<P>
   The number of dying veterans and the lack of space at the few
remaining Veterans Affairs Department cemeteries may keep Vietnam
veterans from finding a final resting place among fellow patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to start planning for death now because if we wait
10 or 15 years it'll definitely be too late, if it's not already
too late,'' said Van Kuran, a 54-year-old Encino resident.
``There's a lot of anger toward the VA. I feel that they've let
down the vets. That's not the government I thought I was fighting
for.''
</P>
<P>
   With the average age of the veterans rising and a growing number
of war veterans dying, national cemeteries are filling up at an
ever-increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   Any honorably discharged veteran is eligible for interment at a
national cemetery. But the need is quickly outpacing the available
space.
</P>
<P>
   By 2008, veterans will die at a rate of 1,700 per day, according
to government estimates. A committee has identified several cities
with an immediate need for additional burial grounds, but the VA
has no construction plans for new cemeteries beyond this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A veteran's funeral has become part of the honor system for us
vets,'' said Van Kuran, who enlisted and served 18 months (1966-67)
in Vietnam as part of the Army's elite First Infantry Division. ``I
think we earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the establishment of national cemeteries in 1862, about
2.6 million veterans have been interred in national cemeteries and
about 6.7 million headstones and markers have been furnished. In
1998, 76,718 veterans and family members were interred across the
nation. The VA expects to bury 80,300 more vets and by 2004, the
number of interments is expected to increase to 98,700.
</P>
<P>
   Robert ``Mike'' Walker, the acting undersecretary for memorial
affairs, is optimistic about the creation of future state and
national cemeteries, but he is concerned about the length of time
it takes from selecting a site to opening the cemetery, which could
take seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way too long,'' Walker said. ``We're looking at ways of
compressing the site selection process and building cemeteries. It
is a complex process. But we have a goal, we are looking to provide
a burial option for all veterans either in a state or a national
cemetery within 75 miles of their home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the VA's National Cemetery Administration
has built or started building new cemeteries in six areas
identified in 1987 as most in need. But the NCA has not addressed
how it will meet the increased demand for veteran burials over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   To counter these deficiencies, Congress last year passed a law
requiring the Defense Department to provide military funeral honors
for Air Force veterans. The law states that the DOD provide, at a
minimum, a ceremonial flag-folding, flag presentation and the
playing of taps at military funerals.
</P>
<P>
   But base realignments and closures and force reductions have put
military funeral details in overwhelming demand, especially in
California, Texas and other states with high veteran populations.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to meet the demand with their own honor guards, many
bases have turned to patriotic volunteers, such as the All Veterans
Burial Squad, based in the San Fernando Valley, which performs
military ceremonies at cemeteries across the city for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of about four to six volunteers perform a grave site
burial for veterans,'' said Dick Fisher, a spokesman for Forest
Lawn Mortuaries, which gets a handful of requests each month for
military honors at its cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he tries to fulfill every request as a show of
respect for soldiers like Van Kuran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what all the macho guys said they'd do,'' Van Kuran
said. ``I did everything that our dads did. But society didn't
support us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody promised us a parade,'' he added, ``but these final
military honors ... should be there.''

L.A. MAYOR RACE AT GRASS ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The race for Los Angeles mayor will fought in the
trenches of neighborhood politics next year, with the candidates
attempting to do what none has dared in this city for more than 40
years -- a grass-roots campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was the city where the modern political campaigns of
slick mailings and television commercials developed. But with the
burgeoning demands of neighborhoods wanting recognition and power,
all major candidates say their chances of success lie in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the essence of my campaign,'' said Councilman Joel
Wachs, who is using his Studio City base of homeowner activists to
reach across the city. ``I am out every night in different parts of
the city talking about neighborhoods and community involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wachs said it is that preliminary work he has done in
the campaign that has put him in a virtual dead heat as
front-runner in independent polls with City Attorney James Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part and parcel of my candidacy, and I think the others
are recognizing that it works and they're trying to emulate me,''
Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultant Joe Cerrell said the campaigns
at this early stage remind him of the 1950s, when the California
Democratic Clubs and organized labor had active groups where people
walked precincts to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this is a nonpartisan race, but you have that sense
they're trying to rebuild that,'' Cerrell said. ``The only real
organized group in the city now is labor, but I have a sense that
people are tired of all-mail-and-television campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cerrell pointed to the national campaign of Vice President
Al Gore, who has been campaigning in small towns and community
groups, and the U.S. Senate campaign in New York of first lady
Hillary Clinton, who has concentrated on small towns.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hahn announced plans to develop a group of committees
around the city to build grass-roots support. His first will be in
South Central Los Angeles, where he has a base of support inherited
from his father, former county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grass-roots support will be the key to winning the election,''
Hahn said. ``We will have committees throughout the city from the
Valley to the Westside and the Eastside.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, who follows his
term as speaker with a run for mayor, has been working for months
throughout the city to build support, a campaign adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio comes out of the neighborhood and he knows what it
takes to build consensus,'' said Steve Gray-Barkan. ``He has done
that his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, as he did while speaker, he will continue to reach out to
different communities, like labor, education and the Valley. He was
the one who made sure the Valley would get the money to pay for the
secession study.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Barkan said he believes the emphasis on community
campaigning is a reflection of the number of candidates in a race
more than a year away with no clear favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see a lot more neighborhood and community organizing
this time around because of the lessons that have been learned,''
Gray-Barkan said. ``Look at labor and neighborhood associations.
They have been very effective at expressing their concerns at the
city level and getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, the businessman-adviser to Mayor Richard
Riordan, has been campaigning throughout the city, mostly at small
groups, campaign consultant Ace Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff was one of the first to announce a grass-roots campaign
and used the San Fernando Valley -- which accounted for more than
50 percent of the vote in the last mayoral election -- as his
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to have 1,000 volunteers on board by the end of
the year,'' Smith said. ``(Soboroff) already has started doing
precinct walks and coffees all over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is it is not enough to run the traditional
advertising campaign. All that stuff doesn't turn real unless the
candidate spends time talking to real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, said the effort is essential
for any candidate who wants to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many credible candidates you need to get people out to
vote,'' Becerra said. ``You're looking at needing 25 (percent) to
30 percent to get in a runoff, and that means it is essential to
identify your supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in grass roots. It's what got me elected in the
first place. I wasn't supposed to win my Assembly seat in 1990 but
did it through meeting with people.''

NASCAR: 10 RACES, 10 WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA - Sunday's NAPA Auto Parts 500 produced the 10th
different winner in NASCAR Winston Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unbelievable,'' three-time Winston Cup champion Jeff
Gordon said. ``It's pretty amazing how competitive it is right now.
Any guy can win. It's just hitting the right combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Winner Jeremy Mayfield) was fast all day, and he deserved to
win (Sunday). I've never seen it like this. It's good for the
sport, but it makes it tougher to get up to the front and battle
for wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst finish: Gordon's recent dominance of California Speedway
ended with an 11th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   It was his worse finish in four races here. He won in 1997 and
'99 and finished fourth two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tricky racetrack,'' said Gordon, who started 26th and
was running seventh early on. ``The groove really widened out, and
you just never knew where you could run. It was really good for us
at the beginning. We moved up through the field. We just used up
our tires coming to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleventh is not bad. We'd have liked a top 10, but we're doing
what we need to stay in the top 10 in points. I think maybe we lost
one or two positions (Sunday), but we'll go get 'em at Richmond
(Va.).''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments: Sunday was another long day for former CART
driver Scott Pruett and former Winston Cup champion Darrell
Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, who hadn't placed higher than 19th in the previous nine
races, finished a disappointing 34th. He started sixth but quickly
dropped to 30th by lap 10 and 41st after 30 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who is retiring at the end of the season, finished
29th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the day we were loose,'' said Waltrip, who started
seventh. ``Loose, loose, loose. We did run well on one set of
tires, but another set really cost us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're trying some things we shouldn't be trying. I don't
know. Our qualifying run and the reaction (Sunday) from the fans
still made my last race (at California Speedway) memorable.''

   For example: Did ya know the White Sox's Jose Valentin did it
last week? And he got the single, double, triple and home run in
order.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Dodgers, a cycle brings even more psychotic odds.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years have elapsed since Wes Parker did it in May 1970 a
10-inning game, by the way. That's the longest cycle drought of any
current big-league team.
</P>
<P>
   And Parker is the only L.A. Dodger to (begin ital)ever(end ital)
do it.
</P>
<P>
   By our calculations, that makes the chances of it happening ...
about as good as a Dodgers catcher throwing out a runner this
season.
</P>
<P>
   They're 0 for 20 in that department so far, in case you were
wunderin'...

FEW CHALLENGERS LEFT FOR LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The mismatch between Lennox Lewis and Michael
Grant was good for Lewis, bad for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the undisputed champion in the eyes of everyone who is
objective, did what he wanted to do: He destroyed a reputedly good
opponent to bolster his image as the world's dominant heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   And he did it with Tyson-like finality: the equivalent of four
knockdowns in less than two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's no Mike Tyson, and he never will be. The Briton is
a very good boxer with considerable power but neither the savage
warrior nor the sublime boxer who can carry the heavyweight
division - and boxing, to a good extent - on his massive shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   After this fight, we're left with a good, but uninspiring
heavyweight champ, and no one who can give him much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sad, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Grant, only a 2-1 underdog, was supposed to have been a
legitimate test. He was young, athletic, hungry and Lewis' size,
even a bit bigger. Some experts actually picked him to win.
</P>
<P>
   However, he was an embarrassment come fight time. If he's
learned anything in his career, he forgot it Saturday. He fought
like a big, strong amateur who had no business in the ring with a
fighter of Lewis' skills.
</P>
<P>
   And, again, he was deemed Lewis' best possible opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Who else is out there?
</P>
<P>
   -Evander Holyfield. The 37-year-old former champ, who faces John
Ruiz next month for the vacant WBA title stripped from Lewis, might
be the best equipped to compete with Lewis, but we saw what
happened in two forgettable bouts between the two.
</P>
<P>
   -David Tua. Some believe the big-punching Samoan could test
Lewis. He's short (about 5-10) but wide (about 225 in shape) and
has a tremendous punch.
</P>
<P>
   However, many wonder whether he's simply too small for the 6-5,
250-pound Lewis, who probably would be able to keep Tua at a
distance (as he did Holyfield) with a stiff jab and his own big
right. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Tyson. See above. Too small (begin ital)and(end ital) too far
over the hill.
</P>
<P>
   This fight (begin ital)does(end ital) have the most intrigue
because of Tyson's notoriety and is the fight Lewis wants because
of the buzz it would cause and the money he'd make, not necessarily
in that order.
</P>
<P>
   However, we wonder how serious Tyson is about fighting at all.
After two postponements, he's scheduled to face Lou Savarase on
June 24 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there's an opportunity out there for me and him,''
Lewis said. ``I'm the man at the top, and he knows where to find
me.''
</P>
<P>
   After those three? No one.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer, said openly he believes there
are no promising heavyweights and that his fighter could reign for
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four boring years.
</P>
<P>
   More Lewis: Promoter Panos Eliades said immediately after the
fight that Lewis would face Francios Botha on July 15 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Botha doesn't have the speed or athleticism of Grant but is a
solid boxer and has experience in big fights. He won't win, but he
probably won't go out with the whimper Grant did. ...
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who received a reported $10 million for Saturday's fight,
earned $28,328 per second - about the same as the average
wage-earner makes in a (begin ital)year.(end ital) ...
</P>
<P>
   New rankings: The publisher of a boxing Web site has established
rankings similar to the Associated Press college football poll, in
which selected writers vote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, roughly 25 major boxing writers have agreed to take part
in the monthly poll orchestrated by Howard Sirota of
boxingranks.com.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have more than 100 writers worldwide participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a new ranking system that will completely replace
the corrupt and self-serving rankings jerry-rigged by the sectarian
sanctioning bodies,'' a group of five prominent writers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope the writers don't become corrupt and that
they're able to put in the considerable time necessary to rank 10
figh in each of 17 divisions - 170 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big job.
</P>
<P>
   The first poll has been posted on the Web site. ...
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas
is negotiating to fight No. 1 contender Ross Thompson on July 29
and could fight Felix Trinidad in December.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' trial on assault charges has been pushed back to late
July. He and four others have pleaded not guilty to charges they
beat up a man last year in a home outside Santa Barbara. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's official, or as official as any fight involving Julio Cesar
Chavez: Kostya Tszyu will defend his WBC junior welterweight belt
against Chavez on July 15 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear for the 37-year-old former champion's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is 103-4-2, with 86 KOs. He could stop fighting now and
call it a decent career. ...
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 seats - $300 to $900 - remain for the Oscar De La
Hoya-Shane Mosley fight June 17 at Staples Center. ...
</P>
<P>
   The junior middleweight division is becoming more interesting by
the minute.
</P>
<P>
   First, middleweight Bernard Hopkins said he'd like to move down
to claim some of the fame and fortune at 154 pounds. Now, Antwun
said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Echols, a friend of Michael Nunn's from Davenport, Iowa, would
like to avenge a loss to Hopkins first.
</P>
<P>
   After that - or if that fight doesn't happen - he'd like to meet
Vargas. He said he walks around about 165 and would have no problem
making 154.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``I'd have no problem making
weight. I think Vargas would be a good fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Echols faces Lionel Ortiz in a middleweight bout Friday in North
Carolina on ESPN2. ...
</P>
<P>
   Paul Spadafora defends his IBF lightweight title Saturday
against Mike Griffith in Pittsburgh on HBO. ...
</P>
<P>
   The latest daughters to become boxers are J'Marie Moore (Archie
Moore) and Irichell Duran (Roberto Duran). Let's see, that brings
the total to five. The daughters of Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and
George Foreman already are pro fighters.
</P>
<P>
   They all have sons. Don't boys fight anymore? Well, Marvis
Frazier was a pro boxer - sort of. ...
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Duran, well aware of the rigors of the sport, said he'll
never forgive his daughter for her decision to become a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do? Signs for another fight at 48. He'll face
Pat Lawlor - who once beat Duran - on June 3 in his native Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Duran, who began his career in 1967, will have fought in five
decades. He should have quit two decades ago. ...
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Martinez of Fontana, the fighter who made the U.S.
Olympic team only to quit ``for financial reasons,'' has turned
pro.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Cameron Dunkin, said it's likely Martinez will fight
on the ABC show in L.A. the afternoon of the De La Hoya-Mosley
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin also advises junior lightweight champ Diego Corrales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid (Martinez) can already hang with Corrales. It won't
be long before you hear a lot about him,'' Dunkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin also has signed Larry Mosley, Shane's cousin. ...
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Tapia is scheduled to defend the marginal WBO
bantamweight title Saturday against Javier Torrez in Las Cruces,
N.M., on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the promotion, Tapia is trading two $25 tickets to
the fight and $50 (donated by HUD) for guns.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 387 guns were turned in. ...
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Briggs' shocking decision loss to unknown Sedreck Fields
last week was a big blow to his career. ...
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Williams, the heavyweight from Long Beach, has become an
``opponent.'' He was stopped by Denmark's Brian Nielsen in the
fourth round last week in Copenhagen. ...
</P>
<P>
   Israel Vasquez faces Angel Chacon in a 12-round junior
featherweight bout Saturday at Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio.

IT'S OLD HAT TO THESE BALL CATCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Richard Villalobos of West Hills saw last week's
review of the ``Game Hat,'' a patented ballcap made by a fellow
near San Diego that helps baseball spectators shag foul balls
without the use of a glove.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't agree more about our lack of enthusiasm about
wearing it as fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's probably because he, along with Richard Brown of
Pasadena and Bill Hunt of Macon, Ga., have for the last dozen years
have their own patented ball-grabbing device disguised as a hat.
Which not only looks more snazzy, but, with a little more
dexterity, cou efficient for souvenir collectors.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``Game Hat'' might be more adept at snaring line
drives because it's easy to flip off, the trick to the ``Catch-It
Cap'' (patent numbers 4,628,543 and 4,768,232) is getting the hat
off your head and then your left hand into the slot on the left
side in time. A mitt-like padded glove concealed inside does the
catching.
</P>
<P>
   (The newer version soon to be out will take the back inside
panel of the cap and make it easier to get your hand in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really made to catch line drives that well,'' said
Brown, who, in the early days of production, hand-sewed the mitts
into the caps himself. ``This is more for high fly balls - like
home runs. And you really need two hands to make the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Catch-It Cap,'' now manufactured and marketed through
athletic apparel company Fila, is available for $24.95 by phone at
888-92CATCH or for $19.95 on the Internet at Web site
www.catchitcap.com.

RIGHT UP HOLLYWOOD'S FAIRWAY

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Book: ``The Greatest Player Who Never Lived,'' by J. Michael
Veron.
</P>
<P>
   Vital stats: Sleeping Bear Press, $22.95, 286 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The story: A piece of fiction? That's what it says. But the more
you get wrapped up in this fact-finding mission of law firm intern
Charley Hunter, the more the Grisham-like history-mystery seems
plausible. Hunter is asked to catalog old files that once belonged
to Bobby Jones - the legendary amateur golfer and a former partner
at the firm. What Hunter discovers piece by piece is the existence
of another golf legend, Beau Steadman. Who? That's the point.
</P>
<P>
   The potential movie: Since the book's release several months ago
it has sold out of the publisher's first two printings reps from
Creative Artists Agency and Artists Management Group in Hollywood
are among a half-dozen groups who've asked about buying the movie
rights. Also asking is Jack Nicklaus Productions, headed by former
ABC Sports executive Terry Jastrow (who's married to actress Anne
Archer).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dumbfounded me, all the attention it's received lately,''
said Veron, a trial lawyer in Lake Charles, La., of his first
novel.
</P>
<P>
   The best gauge for a movie future will be how another golf
flick, ``The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' does this summer. That
movie, directed by Robert Redford and starring Matt Damon, Will
Smith and Charlize Theron, is also based on a book written in the
similar vein of Veron's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they have a herd instinct (to making movies
today),'' Veron said. ``If someone makes one about a blue shirt and
it goes well, everyone starts making one about a blue shirt. I
guess if (`Bagger Vance') does well, it gives us a better chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But until then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a huge case that goes to trial May 15 that's really
taking all my time right now,'' Veron said. ``Maybe that helps, so
that I don't get too distracted by all this talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up: Veron is working on a second novel entitled ``The
Greatest Course That Never Was.''

MEMORIES FLOW AT OJAI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE JARES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. - Tradition at the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament is
almost palpable, like the heat of the sunshine in Libbey Park,
where the main matches are played, or like the tang of the freshly
squeezed orange juice served free each morning.
</P>
<P>
   Probably never has the tradition hung thicker than in the last
four days, when the event celebrated its 100th anniversary and
introduced a Wall of Fame, honoring the 80 people who have
participated in ``The Ojai'' and later won at least one Grand Slam
title. (The list includes Bill Tilden, Billie Jean King, Pancho
Gonzalez, Stan Smith, Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport.)
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of those champions, and many other alumni, came back
for the festivities, sharing their memories under the eucalyptus
trees at Libbey and at a banquet Saturday night at the Ojai Valley
Inn.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ambidextrous Beverly Baker Fleitz, who came out
of Santa Monica in the 1950s with a left-handed forehand and a
right-handed forehand. No need for a backhand. She served
right-handed until she hurt her arm; then she served lefty.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled winning the Ojai mixed doubles in 1956 with
soon-to-be husband John. That trip she stayed with an Ojai family
who made sure to have cold milk and cookies at her bedside each
night.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, her hosts gave her permission to go out on a date
with John. They returned and were enjoying a goodnight kiss at the
door when John's car, the brake improperly set or not set at all,
rolled backward into the hosts' swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that I still got my cold milk and cookies,''
said Beverly Fleitz, ``but John was not invited back.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for Ojai tradition:
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Beverly Fleitz presented the trophy to the winning
CIF boys' doubles team from Peninsula High, one of whom is her
grandson, Jeff Kazarian.
</P>
<P>
   Family is important here. Pat Henry Yeomans pointed out that her
mother, Corinne Henry, won mixed doubles in 1926, Yeomans herself
won the mixed in 1939 (with Gene Mako of Glendale, now 84 and also
here for the celebration), and Yeomans' son, John, won the men's
open singles in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kramer, who some consider the greatest player of all time,
was on hand, remembering that, as a rising star from Montebello
High, he won the interscholastic singles at Ojai in 1937 and 1939.
He would have won in 1938, too, he said, but he stayed up late the
night before the final, losing at poker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kramer lost all our money betting three kings against three
aces,'' said Ted Schroeder, another of the returning champs. ``We
had to live off orange juice and cookies from the hospitality
tent.''
</P>
<P>
   (Oh, the boy Kramer lost to in '38? Arthur Marx, son of
Groucho.)
</P>
<P>
   Patty Fendick, women's intercollegiate singles champ at Ojai in
1986 (for Stanford), is now the women's coach at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fondest memory is probably the picture board,'' she said.
``We used to laugh at all the old pictures. Now my players come and
laugh at the old pictures of me the bad haircuts and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality of the Ojai citizenry was praised time and
again, and much was made of the orange juice provided each morning,
and the tea provided each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   George Toley, 84, who coached the USC men to 10 NCAA titles
before retiring, recalled a hotly contested morning doubles match
between his Trojans and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Lesch of the Bruins became unhappy with the decisions and
left the court to go to tournament headquarters to see if he could
get a change in officials,'' said Toley. ``Well, the orange juice
tent was right next to the court, so Pancho Contreras of USC went
in, got a pitcher of orange juice and some paper cups and delivered
juice to each of the linesmen and the umpire while we waited for
Lesch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was roaring with laughter, and even the UCLA side
was laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted tennis coach and psychologist Vic Braden was master of
ceremonies at the Saturday-night banquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who lost in the first round remember this as one
of their favorite tournaments,'' he said. ``I'm still looking for
someone who had a lousy time here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is heaven,'' said ex-Wimbledon champ and U.S. Davis Cup
hero Alex Olmedo, who won seven Ojai titles. ``I have great
memories.''

L.A. MAYOR RACE AT GRASS ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Inserting dropped word in first graf) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The race for Los Angeles mayor will be fought in
the trenches of neighborhood politics next year, with the
candidates attempting to do what none has dared in this city for
more than 40 years -- a grass-roots campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was the city where the modern political campaigns of
slick mailings and television commercials developed. But with the
burgeoning demands of neighborhoods wanting recognition and power,
all major candidates say their chances of success lie in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the essence of my campaign,'' said Councilman Joel
Wachs, who is using his Studio City base of homeowner activists to
reach across the city. ``I am out every night in different parts of
the city talking about neighborhoods and community involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wachs said it is that preliminary work he has done in
the campaign that has put him in a virtual dead heat as
front-runner in independent polls with City Attorney James Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part and parcel of my candidacy, and I think the others
are recognizing that it works and they're trying to emulate me,''
Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultant Joe Cerrell said the campaigns
at this early stage remind him of the 1950s, when the California
Democratic Clubs and organized labor had active groups where people
walked precincts to get votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, this is a nonpartisan race, but you have that sense
they're trying to rebuild that,'' Cerrell said. ``The only real
organized group in the city now is labor, but I have a sense that
people are tired of all-mail-and-television campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cerrell pointed to the national campaign of Vice President
Al Gore, who has been campaigning in small towns and community
groups, and the U.S. Senate campaign in New York of first lady
Hillary Clinton, who has concentrated on small towns.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hahn announced plans to develop a group of committees
around the city to build grass-roots support. His first will be in
South Central Los Angeles, where he has a base of support inherited
from his father, former county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grass-roots support will be the key to winning the election,''
Hahn said. ``We will have committees throughout the city from the
Valley to the Westside and the Eastside.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, who follows his
term as speaker with a run for mayor, has been working for months
throughout the city to build support, a campaign adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio comes out of the neighborhood and he knows what it
takes to build consensus,'' said Steve Gray-Barkan. ``He has done
that his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, as he did while speaker, he will continue to reach out to
different communities, like labor, education and the Valley. He was
the one who made sure the Valley would get the money to pay for the
secession study.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Barkan said he believes the emphasis on community
campaigning is a reflection of the number of candidates in a race
more than a year away with no clear favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see a lot more neighborhood and community organizing
this time around because of the lessons that have been learned,''
Gray-Barkan said. ``Look at labor and neighborhood associations.
They have been very effective at expressing their concerns at the
city level and getting things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Soboroff, the businessman-adviser to Mayor Richard
Riordan, has been campaigning throughout the city, mostly at small
groups, campaign consultant Ace Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff was one of the first to announce a grass-roots campaign
and used the San Fernando Valley -- which accounted for more than
50 percent of the vote in the last mayoral election -- as his
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to have 1,000 volunteers on board by the end of
the year,'' Smith said. ``(Soboroff) already has started doing
precinct walks and coffees all over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling is it is not enough to run the traditional
advertising campaign. All that stuff doesn't turn real unless the
candidate spends time talking to real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, said the effort is essential
for any candidate who wants to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many credible candidates you need to get people out to
vote,'' Becerra said. ``You're looking at needing 25 (percent) to
30 percent to get in a runoff, and that means it is essential to
identify your supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in grass roots. It's what got me elected in the
first place. I wasn't supposed to win my Assembly seat in 1990 but
did it through meeting with people.''

   The Nine Planets
</P>

   seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/nineplanets.html
</P>
<P>
   Outer space is cool again. On the heels of box office hits such
as (beginitalic)Armageddon(enditalic), Hollywood is churning out
space adventure films, such as (beginitalic)Mission to
Mars(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Battlefield Earth(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Red Planet(enditalic), another Mars movie coming out
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better time to bone up on the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``The Nine Planets,'' a Web site dedicated to everything
that orbits the Sun, from Earth to the rings of Saturn and beyond.
Although great for those last-minute science papers, the site is
also just plain interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It has extensive information on the planets and their moons,
from mythology to hard science. For example, the site notes that
Mercury was probably named for the messenger of the gods because it
moves quickly across the sky. Also, its eccentric orbit helped
prove Einstein's theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that Neptune, the eighth planet from the sun, was
discovered after astronomers noticed a peculiarity in the orbit of
Uranus, the seventh planet. Pluto was discovered by accident, for
much the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good photos, such as a full color shot of
Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, which has active volcanoes on its
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with all the book learning? You can also vote for your
favorite planet. In an amazing turn of events, Earth seems to be
winning. What a bunch of homers. Mars rules!

   This magazine just can't win for losing. Much of this month's
issue is devoted to John McCain, whose presidential campaign flamed
about the same time they were dropping this collection of
irrelevancy in the mail. There is an essay by the White Tornado
himself, repeating much of what we heard in stump speeches all
winter. There is also a feature on Cindy McCain, who,
(beginitalic)George (enditalic)has learned, loves her children. In
all fairness, there also are pieces on the wives of George W. Bush,
Al Gore and Bill Bradley, whose campaign fell apart about the same
time as McCain's. Beyond that, there's not much to keep the covers
apart, though the Vietnam retrospective by Pulitzer Prize winner
David Halberstam is worth a look. The main feature is on stars who
give extensively to charity, and it leads with U2's Bono, who has
become involved in Third World debt relief. That, and finding that
elusive word that rhymes with Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Reason
</P>
<P>
   The lead piece happily notes that the world hasn't come to an
end, as gloomily predicted by experts during the first Earth Day
back in 1970. There hasn't been a global famine, city dwellers
aren't wearing gas masks, and we haven't run out of oil. While the
statistics seem to bear this out, the piece is written in an
off-putting we-told-you-so style that makes it read like an
eighth-grade social studies book. In another piece, a dad defends
the ribald animated TV show (beginitalic)South Park(enditalic),
which has sent the Religious Right into a tizzy with its profane
dialogue and adult themes. Writer Barry S. Fagin taped and
previewed the show and then let his kids watch a few episodes. He
emerged believing that (beginitalic)South Park (enditalic)can
actually teach his kids something, mainly that it's fun to ridicule
celebrities, hypocrites and ``people who believe stupid things.''
Also, cartoons are not real. We had an inkling. That Yosemite Sam
just never seems to run out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Utne reader
</P>
<P>
   The main package deals with dwindling privacy in an increasingly
computerized world. The most interesting piece involves a man who
walks 120 miles from his tiny Quaker community in southeastern Ohio
to the state capital, Columbus, to return his driver's license in
an act of defiance. We later learn that he and his wife have no
marriage certificate (no government interference, thank you),
refused immunization for their first child and never filed birth
certificates for the rest. Great idea, except he can't take them as
tax deductions. You walk away admiring the guy but at the same time
glad you're not stuck on a six-hour flight with him. Another
article examines the relative futility of the U.S. Census Bureau's
efforts to count immigrants and minorities. It has become this
silly: Census-takers in Chicago invented an ersatz superhero to
cajole Hispanics to fill out their census forms. His name: Super
Censo. Now we're cooking with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Working mother
</P>
<P>
   The magazine for moms offers advice on how to organize your day
around getting the little tykes fed, off to school and yourself to
work without losing your sanity. The real-mom model who poses for
the article is sporting an ear-to-ear grin, so apparently, it's a
real snap. There is some genuinely good advice, but I'm guessing
most moms won't quite find the time for the ``categorize your
closet'' chapter. Another story profiles the ``Mom of the Year,'' a
28-year-old mother of three who develops school programs by day and
powders bottoms by night. In her spare time, she works on cold
fusion experiments in the family basement. There's also a decent
piece on figuring out if your kids can be left at home alone. To
find out if you're ready to take the plunge, the article provides a
list of probing questions, such as ``Is your child a pyromaniac?''
OK, we made that one up.

   On Nov. 20, 1821, the Nantucket whaling ship Essex sank after it
was rammed by a huge sperm whale, the first ever known to
deliberately attack a ship. The incident, which a member of the
crew called an act of ``fury and vengeance,'' was as famous then as
the fate of the Titanic would become in the 20th century (it
inspired Herman Melville's climactic scene in his 1851 novel,
(beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic)). Philbrick recreates the months
at sea with the hard-working men of the Essex, and the chilling
attack and its aftermath, when 20 men in three small boats tried to
save themselves. Only eight survived the following months, which
Philbrick calls ``a kind of terrible laboratory experiment devised
to see just how far the human animal could go in its battle against
the savage sea.'' This is a terrific addition to the list of recent
books about danger and adventure on the high seas.

   National Public Radio's Simon has written a memoir that is a
thinly-veiled excuse to talk about sports. No, we are too kind.
It's not veiled at all. It's a fan's memoir. If you enjoy the
author as host of NPR's (beginitalic)Weekend
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Edition(enditalic), you will enjoy him here
- he is witty, easy company. It helps, of course, if you have your
own feelings about sports, especially sports from Chicago. Simon
has an undying allegiance to that city, forged by incidents such as
when he was in kindergarten and his family moved to San Francisco,
where some evil second-graders tied him to a tree with a jump rope
after he ridiculed them for not knowing White Sox pitcher Billy
Pierce. In addition to Chicago and its athletes, Simon covers his
family traumas - his father's alcoholism, the divorce of his
parents, whom he calls ``the funniest man and the most beautiful
woman in Chicago'' - and his career as a journalist.

   ``Ravelstein, with his bald powerful head, was at ease with
large statements, big issues, and famous men, with decades, eras,
centuries. He was, however, just as familiar with entertainers like
Mel Brooks as with the classics and could go from Thucydides' huge
tragedy to Moses as played by Brooks.'' Bellow might be describing
himself, but isn't - he is describing his late friend Allan Bloom,
the model for Bellow's character, Abe Ravelstein. Like Bloom,
Ravelstein was a debt-plagued academic who wrote a book that sold
like crazy and made him rich (in Bloom's case, (beginitalic)The
Closing of the American Mind(enditalic).) The narrator is Chick,
the Bellow persona whose friendship with Ravelstein is built on
intellect, rivalry and affection. Chick has wives, and Ravelstein
has a boyfriend and a disease, but the core of this novel is the
wise interplay between the friends as they face Ravelstein's
mortality.

<P>
   (HarperCollins, $24)
</P>
<P>
   The title is a gimmick. Cleese and Bates actually make a
heartfelt effort to explore the volatile mother-child relationship
that haunts so many adult lives today. They interviewed a wide
range of people about their experiences with their mothers,
discussing mothers as martyrs, mothers who interfere with their
children's lives, mothers who don't listen and mothers who withhold
approval. Many people, they discovered, received much of their
mothering from women other than their mothers. Another finding: Our
mothers often do not expect from us all that we think they do. The
authors advise you to keep a sense of humor about your mother,
confront the issues that divide you and communicate with her. Most
of all, you should remember that ``managing your mother is really
about managing yourself.''

   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, 1821, the Nantucket whaling ship Essex sank after it
was rammed by a huge sperm whale, the first ever known to
deliberately attack a ship. The incident, which a member of the
crew called an act of ``fury and vengeance,'' was as famous then as
the fate of the Titanic would become in the 20th century (it
inspired Herman Melville's climactic scene in his 1851 novel,
(beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic)). Philbrick recreates the months
at sea with the hard-working men of the Essex, and the chilling
attack and its aftermath, when 20 men in three small boats tried to
save themselves. Only eight survived the following months, which
Philbrick calls ``a kind of terrible laboratory experiment devised
to see just how far the human animal could go in its battle against
the savage sea.'' This is a terrific addition to the list of recent
books about danger and adventure on the high seas.

<P>
   (Hyperion, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio's Simon has written a memoir that is a
thinly-veiled excuse to talk about sports. No, we are too kind.
It's not veiled at all. It's a fan's memoir. If you enjoy the
author as host of NPR's (beginitalic)Weekend
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Edition(enditalic), you will enjoy him here
- he is witty, easy company. It helps, of course, if you have your
own feelings about sports, especially sports from Chicago. Simon
has an undying allegiance to that city, forged by incidents such as
when he was in kindergarten and his family moved to San Francisco,
where some evil second-graders tied him to a tree with a jump rope
after he ridiculed them for not knowing White Sox pitcher Billy
Pierce. In addition to Chicago and its athletes, Simon covers his
family traumas - his father's alcoholism, the divorce of his
parents, whom he calls ``the funniest man and the most beautiful
woman in Chicago'' - and his career as a journalist.

   Ravelstein

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saul Bellow
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ravelstein, with his bald powerful head, was at ease with
large statements, big issues, and famous men, with decades, eras,
centuries. He was, however, just as familiar with entertainers like
Mel Brooks as with the classics and could go from Thucydides' huge
tragedy to Moses as played by Brooks.'' Bellow might be describing
himself, but isn't - he is describing his late friend Allan Bloom,
the model for Bellow's character, Abe Ravelstein. Like Bloom,
Ravelstein was a debt-plagued academic who wrote a book that sold
like crazy and made him rich (in Bloom's case, (beginitalic)The
Closing of the American Mind(enditalic).) The narrator is Chick,
the Bellow persona whose friendship with Ravelstein is built on
intellect, rivalry and affection. Chick has wives, and Ravelstein
has a boyfriend and a disease, but the core of this novel is the
wise interplay between the friends as they face Ravelstein's
mortality.

   and Brian Bates
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (HarperCollins, $24)
</P>
<P>
   The title is a gimmick. Cleese and Bates actually make a
heartfelt effort to explore the volatile mother-child relationship
that haunts so many adult lives today. They interviewed a wide
range of people about their experiences with their mothers,
discussing mothers as martyrs, mothers who interfere with their
children's lives, mothers who don't listen and mothers who withhold
approval. Many people, they discovered, received much of their
mothering from women other than their mothers. Another finding: Our
mothers often do not expect from us all that we think they do. The
authors advise you to keep a sense of humor about your mother,
confront the issues that divide you and communicate with her. Most
of all, you should remember that ``managing your mother is really

   Don't you just hate when you get the words to a song wrong? We
do, too. So we consulted a couple of Web sites that catalog
commonly misheard song lyrics and give the right words at the same
time. Great for those bar bets, and good for a chuckle as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is named after the most commonly misheard lyric,
from (beginitalic)Purple Haze(enditalic) by Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then hilarity results. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both sites have huge lists of commonly misheard
songs. Kissthisguy also has people fessing up, telling embarrassing
stories about when their friends made fun of them for singing the
wrong lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mondegreen's favorites is from the Bob Dylan tune,
(beginitalic)Blowin' in the Wind(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``The answer my friends, is blowin' in the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``The ants are my friends, they're blowin'
the wind.''

   Offers yet another chapter in the most overcovered story of the
presidential season, namely John McCain's temper. Article tries to
gauge the boiling points of former presidents, ranging from Nixon's
rants caught on tape to LBJ's ornery behavior around his aides.
Calvin Coolidge apparently bullied his wife and played practical
jokes on his staff, while John Adams once called George Washington
a ``muttonhead.'' Main piece names most overrated/underrated things
from American culture, from books to movies to obscure things like
French heroes of the American Revolution. Inexplicably, their movie
expert picks (beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)as most
overrated film. In the book department, the author chooses
Melville's (beginitalic)Moby-Dick (enditalic)as the most overrated.
As the most underrated, they pick another tale of the sea, Herman
Wouk's (beginitalic)The Caine Mutiny. (enditalic)They also note
that Humphrey Bogart was ``awesomely perfect'' in the movie
version. Dude!
</P>
<P>
   Archaeology
</P>
<P>
   Purists might go for the story on ``curious urns'' found in the
Amazon (undoubtedly the site of an ancient Sam's Club), but my
favorite was a relatively short article on the archaeology of a pet
cemetery. The lead is really catchy: ``Like Persephone, I walk half
my life among the living and half (the professional half) among the
dead.'' The author spends most of her time on humans, researching
how memorials reveal diversity within ethnic groups. While looking
at the National Military Cemetery at the Presidio in San Francisco,
she stumbled over its pet cemetery. There's also an interesting
article on the vast network of pillboxes, roadblocks and trenches
that awaited a German invasion of Great Britain, which never came.
A sidebar notes that the indefatigable British have converted some
of the old pillboxes into bat roosts, garden sheds and a peacock
house, whatever that is. One couple even painted their pillbox
pink. Blimey!

   Harper's

<P>
   Includes a fascinating piece of journalism this month - a
profile of the U.S. government's favorite arms dealer, a German
named Ernst Werner Glatt, who lives on a sprawling farm at the
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. According to
this well-researched piece, Glatt has been involved in most of the
nation's covert arms deals of the past quarter-century, secretly
funneling weapons to American-backed guerilla forces during the
Cold War. There's an also interesting piece on radicals in the
Pacific Northwest, though the author wastes valuable real estate at
the top of the story describing his mundane plane ride to Portland
and his bus trip to Eugene. The magazine's centerpiece notes that
the Olympic Park in Sydney is built on the site of an old toxic
waste dump, near a contaminated creek, a waste treatment plant and
the ``dioxin capital of the world.''

   Great cover this month. After all, who's more of a cowboy than
Dylan McDermott, the star of (beginitalic)The Practice(enditalic),
a TV show about lawyers in Boston? Oh well. He's still a handsome
diablo, and he's also in a new movie called (beginitalic)Texas
Rangers. (enditalic)And, no, they couldn't resist the ``Marshal
Dylan'' headline. In the real cowboys section, there is an
interesting feature on the Professional Bull Riders circuit, which
has adopted a pro-wrestling approach - only with real bulls.
Instead of wooden stands and a corn pone announcer, PBR shows are
filled with laser shows, rock music and gouts of flame. Bull riding
is one of the fastest growing sports in the U.S., with 1.5 million
viewers each week on TNN. There's also some nice photos from a West
Texas ranch but, alas, no captions. Oh well, I think those are cows
in the background.

 &HT;    INTERIOR SECRETARY BABBITT TAKES STOCK AS 8-YEAR TENURE DRAWS TO
END (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``A'' and ``K'' categories 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (beginitalic)(Following is an edited interview with Interior
Secretary and former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, who is closing
out eight years of service in the Clinton Cabinet.
(enditalic)Republic (beginitalic)Washington Bureau reporter Jeff
Barker spoke with Babbitt in his office in Washington on April 21.
The interview began with comments about a proposed series of
state-federal land swaps that were reported on extensively on
Wednesday.) (enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic: What is the land that you want to protect in
Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt: There isn't any big surprise. The governor (Jane
Hull) has written me about the negotiations that are going on with
respect to the state's land selections, about exchanging state
inholdings in existing federal monuments and parks and about our
previous proposals to protect open space in the Lake Pleasant area
north of Phoenix and down in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about monuments. This is about a really rare
opportunity to effect some large and really important land
exchanges which will protect open spaces and put the state land
trust in a position of having better and more developable land
which will, in the long run, provide more revenue. It is generally
a win-win situation{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   AR: National monuments would be, obviously, an important legacy
of your time at Interior. And the CARA bill could also be an
important legacy. (CARA is the Conservation and Reinvestment Act,
which would provide $900million a year for federal conservation
projects and land acquisition.)
</P>
<P>
   I have a press release from Sen. (Frank) Murkowski (R-Alaska)
that I was reading it to somebody, and they said, ``This looks like
extortion to me.'' Murkowski is saying, ``Well, you can have one or
the other.'' He says plainly, if you continue to go forward with
more monuments, then this CARA bill is going to get bottled up. Is
this extortion?
</P>
<P>
   BB: I don't think it's appropriate to respond to threats of
blackmail. I think we should consider policies on their merits.
That's all I have to say.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Do you have a sense of how many more monuments might be
designated in your tenure? I saw from the Wilderness Society some
speculation about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon
Steens Mountain and Soda Mountain, the Canyons of the Ancients in
Colorado, the Missouri Breaks in Montana. Are these under active
consideration?
</P>
<P>
   BB: The answer is, I have been out on the landscape in all of
these places. In Oregon, for example, I am meeting regularly with
the entire Oregon delegation in an attempt to work out a
legislative proposal for Steens Mountain. My interest in that is
well known. We're trying to do it legislatively. There's another
place in Oregon called Soda Mountain, where -
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you say legislatively, you mean you have to do it in
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Do it in Congress, through legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There's another place, Soda Mountain in Oregon, where I think
there's general consensus that a presidential proclamation is
appropriate. The governor supports it. There is extensive support
in the local community, and I believe that that's high on the list
of ones that I am actively considering recommending to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   So it all depends. There are two in Oregon. One we're looking at
(would be) a presidential proclamation, the other one we're working
with the delegation to do legislation. I think that the important
thing is not the label. It's the protection for the label.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Let's talk just about the CARA bill, then. How significant
is it that you would have this automatic $900 million a year for
land and water conservation. How significant is that that you have
that automatically triggered instead of having to haggle over it?
</P>
<P>
   BB: It's an important legislative objective.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Is that significant in terms of the Babbitt legacy or the
Clinton legacy? And does this bill fit into that?
</P>
<P>
   BB: We're not in the business of ranking things around here. We
leave that for historians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   AR: OK. I want to talk about the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   BB. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AR: How far are we from seeing the rail system?
</P>
<P>
   BB: My major concerns about the Canyon have been protecting the
true Grand Canyon. That's what the national monument was all about,
was trying to get the Grand Canyon co-extensive with its
hydrographic areas, number one.
</P>
<P>
   Number two, managing visitation. I am pleased with the progress
of the mass-transit proposals. They are enormously complicated. We
made it a priority, starting in 1994. I'm satisfied that it's now
on a track to completion{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   The third issue, of course, has been airplanes. We are
continuing this sort of endless, uphill struggle against the tour
operators over in Las Vegas. I think we've made some progress,
though. We're not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   AR: The latest plan that was just announced, the restrictions on
flights. That still doesn't quite put you where you want to be?
</P>
<P>
   BB: No, we're not. But it's a forward step.
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you became Interior Secretary you gave a talk about
mining and grazing. Could you assess both mining and grazing, where
you would like to be versus where, in fact, you are. Are there
disappointments that you haven't been able to accomplish as much
you might have liked?
</P>
<P>
   BB: I'm not in the disappointment business. I can tell you what
we've managed to do. (He describes the restoration of riparian
areas in the state). And you know, the major obstacle has been a
United States Congress, which, on these issues, is simply a doormat
for the livestock industry and the mining industry. So we've had
very little help from Congress{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you look back at your tenure in Interior, how will you
regard the independent counsel investigation?
</P>
<P>
   BB: It was not a pleasant experience. It was a part of the
witch-hunting mentality of this town. It had one positive aspect,
and that is, it caused me to focus on what I really wanted to do.
It sort of improved my vision about what it is that I really wanted
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Did it focus you because you concentrated that much harder?
</P>
<P>
   BB: When stuff like that comes, your inevitable kind of reaction
is to take a step back from all the sort of day-to-day routine
stuff. (You ask yourself), ``What does the schedule today amount
to? Why am I making six public appearances today? What does it have
to do with what I was given, invited here by the president to do?''
</P>
<P>
   AR: Is there any message you'd want to impart to the independent
counsel about the way the investigation was conducted?
</P>
<P>
   BB: The statute expired. It's all gone. I mean, the statute was
an absurd piece of legislation that contributed to this kind of
witch-hunting environment. Everybody in Congress recognized that.
So there isn't any more independent counsel. I guess I can console
myself by saying, ``Well, maybe I was the poster child for the
repeal of the independent counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   AR: If Al Gore were elected president, would you consider
staying on as Secretary of Interior if he asked you to?
</P>
<P>
   BB: You never say never. But I think, in life, it's important to
get off the stage while the audience is still applauding. That's
one reason why, after two terms as governor - there were no term
limits - I said it's time to move on{hellip}. I've been here eight
years. Eight years is a nice bracket. I learned that being
governor. Four years is not enough, because you can start a lot of
things, but it's hard to work them into the sort of institutional
culture. And that's really been true around here.
</P>
<P>
   AR: You said you were an empty-nester now, the last time I
asked. And I remember writing a story and they put the headline on
it: ``Bruce and Hattie: The Reluctant Power Couple.'' You weren't
too big on the dinner-party scene in Washington at the time because
you had kids at home and you wanted to be home. Do you venture out
more?
</P>
<P>
   BB: There was a year in which, all of a sudden, both children
were away at college and the dog died - all in the same one-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been about four years ago. And that has
obviously left us a little more time to, you know, kind of dip into
the Washington social scene. We're still not big players. We've
actually made a few friends now.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I'll tell you something. The price that you pay by
raising a family, with both of us as professionals - you really
have no social life. That was true in Phoenix. We had no social
life other than our family and our immediate friends.
</P>
<P>
   We're doing a little better now. And there's lot of interesting
stuff in this town. There really is. I'm working right now on a
little dinner that we're having at Ford's Theater in two weeks as
part of a Park Service symposium on the Civil War. I'm really
interested in the Civil War and how we interpret it in the
(national) parks.
</P>
<P>
   So when you invite people, they come. I invited John Keegan, who
is the world's leading military historian. He's a Brit who likes
the Civil War. His (beginitalic)A Mask of Command (enditalic)is one
of the great classics of the 20th century. So I invited him. I
invited James McPherson, who wrote (beginitalic)Battle Cry of
Freedom(enditalic), the big Civil War thing. And Eric Fromer, who
is the outstanding historian of Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   So I invited them to dinner, sort of. We're going to have a
little dinner before the conference at Ford's Theater. This is the
sort of thing that I've never had the time to do. There are nice
little things like this. I still don't go to press functions. I
still don't go to the Gridiron, or the White House Correspondents'
(Dinner), or any of that stuff. They are still as uninteresting as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But I - well, we get around a little more.
</P>
<P>
   AR: I could count, but how many of the Cabinet members have been
in for the duration?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Three of us.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Three? (Health and Human Services Secretary) Donna
Shalala{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   BB: Shalala, (Education Secretary Richard) Riley and myself.
</P>
<P>
   AR: At one time - this was years ago when I spoke to you - you
mentioned that you were sometimes awakened late in the evening by
the president calling you to chat about something or another. Does
that still happen?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Yes. You know, so far as I'm aware, he never sleeps.
(Laughs.) And certainly it never seems to be a serious discussion,
except the most interesting discussions take place in - really, in
two areas. One is in the middle of the night, when he's at the end
of his day and all alone and thinking about it. And the other one
is traveling - usually on the home leg of an Air Force One trip,
(when) he gets gregarious and likes to hang around and talk.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Is he seeking your counsel, or is he just chatting about
whatever's on his mind, or both?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Well, the answer's both. The answer is both. And usually in
a - you know, in a free-flowing, a very free-flowing mix.
</P>
<P>
   AR: I get the sense, and tell me if it's true, that that was
part of the reason when you were being considered for the Supreme
Court - that he not only didn't want to lose you at Interior, but
he didn't want to lose those 2 a.m. phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   BB: Well, I think that's part of it. I'm not flattering myself
by saying it's so. Another reason is that he doesn't like to pick
fights when he makes judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Have you thought about what comes next, then? Do you want to
stay in D.C.? You want to live in Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Well, I've thought about it; haven't gone very far. I can
tell you what I don't want to do. I'm not going to go back to the
practice of law. I'm not going to be a lobbyist. I'm not going to
run for office. That leaves a wide world, except that Hattie
reminds me - you know, it's not clear what else you're qualified to
do once you exclude all those things.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you'll be seeing a lot more of me in Arizona now. I mean,
you know, people have asked me, ``Why is it that you are involved
so deeply in these growth and open-space issues in Arizona? And you
know, do you have some kind of agenda? Are you coming home to run
for governor again?''
</P>
<P>
   My answer is: I'm out of politics, but I am back to Arizona. And
this stuff that we're working on with these growth and land issues,
that's not because I'm a member of the president's Cabinet. There
are plenty of legacy things to do, land exchange in Arizona being
one of them. It's because I really - I've been away from Arizona
for a long time. I'm a little bit homesick. I want to re-engage in
Arizona as a citizen.Associated PressInterior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt has an ambitious list of goals he hopes to accomplish in
his final months in office.Arizona will ``be seeing a lot more of
me.''

 &HT;    INTERIOR SECRETARY BABBITT TAKES STOCK AS 8-YEAR TENURE DRAWS TO
END (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``A'' and ``K'' categories 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (beginitalic)(Following is an edited interview with Interior
Secretary and former Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt, who is closing
out eight years of service in the Clinton Cabinet.
(enditalic)Republic (beginitalic)Washington Bureau reporter Jeff
Barker spoke with Babbitt in his office in Washington on April 21.
The interview began with comments about a proposed series of
state-federal land swaps that were reported on extensively on
Wednesday.) (enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic: What is the land that you want to protect in
Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Babbitt: There isn't any big surprise. The governor (Jane
Hull) has written me about the negotiations that are going on with
respect to the state's land selections, about exchanging state
inholdings in existing federal monuments and parks and about our
previous proposals to protect open space in the Lake Pleasant area
north of Phoenix and down in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about monuments. This is about a really rare
opportunity to effect some large and really important land
exchanges which will protect open spaces and put the state land
trust in a position of having better and more developable land
which will, in the long run, provide more revenue. It is generally
a win-win situation{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   AR: National monuments would be, obviously, an important legacy
of your time at Interior. And the CARA bill could also be an
important legacy. (CARA is the Conservation and Reinvestment Act,
which would provide $900million a year for federal conservation
projects and land acquisition.)
</P>
<P>
   I have a press release from Sen. (Frank) Murkowski (R-Alaska)
that I was reading it to somebody, and they said, ``This looks like
extortion to me.'' Murkowski is saying, ``Well, you can have one or
the other.'' He says plainly, if you continue to go forward with
more monuments, then this CARA bill is going to get bottled up. Is
this extortion?
</P>
<P>
   BB: I don't think it's appropriate to respond to threats of
blackmail. I think we should consider policies on their merits.
That's all I have to say.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Do you have a sense of how many more monuments might be
designated in your tenure? I saw from the Wilderness Society some
speculation about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon
Steens Mountain and Soda Mountain, the Canyons of the Ancients in
Colorado, the Missouri Breaks in Montana. Are these under active
consideration?
</P>
<P>
   BB: The answer is, I have been out on the landscape in all of
these places. In Oregon, for example, I am meeting regularly with
the entire Oregon delegation in an attempt to work out a
legislative proposal for Steens Mountain. My interest in that is
well known. We're trying to do it legislatively. There's another
place in Oregon called Soda Mountain, where -
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you say legislatively, you mean you have to do it in
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   BB: Do it in Congress, through legislation.
</P>
<P>
   There's another place, Soda Mountain in Oregon, where I think
there's general consensus that a presidential proclamation is
appropriate. The governor supports it. There is extensive support
in the local community, and I believe that that's high on the list
of ones that I am actively considering recommending to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   So it all depends. There are two in Oregon. One we're looking at
(would be) a presidential proclamation, the other one we're working
with the delegation to do legislation. I think that the important
thing is not the label. It's the protection for the label.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Let's talk just about the CARA bill, then. How significant
is it that you would have this automatic $900 million a year for
land and water conservation. How significant is that that you have
that automatically triggered instead of having to haggle over it?
</P>
<P>
   BB: It's an important legislative objective.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Is that significant in terms of the Babbitt legacy or the
Clinton legacy? And does this bill fit into that?
</P>
<P>
   BB: We're not in the business of ranking things around here. We
leave that for historians and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   AR: OK. I want to talk about the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   BB. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   AR: How far are we from seeing the rail system?
</P>
<P>
   BB: My major concerns about the Canyon have been protecting the
true Grand Canyon. That's what the national monument was all about,
was trying to get the Grand Canyon co-extensive with its
hydrographic areas, number one.
</P>
<P>
   Number two, managing visitation. I am pleased with the progress
of the mass-transit proposals. They are enormously complicated. We
made it a priority, starting in 1994. I'm satisfied that it's now
on a track to completion{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   The third issue, of course, has been airplanes. We are
continuing this sort of endless, uphill struggle against the tour
operators over in Las Vegas. I think we've made some progress,
though. We're not there yet.
</P>
<P>
   AR: The latest plan that was just announced, the restrictions on
flights. That still doesn't quite put you where you want to be?
</P>
<P>
   BB: No, we're not. But it's a forward step.
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you became Interior Secretary you gave a talk about
mining and grazing. Could you assess both mining and grazing, where
you would like to be versus where, in fact, you are. Are there
disappointments that you haven't been able to accomplish as much
you might have liked?
</P>
<P>
   BB: I'm not in the disappointment business. I can tell you what
we've managed to do. (He describes the restoration of riparian
areas in the state). And you know, the major obstacle has been a
United States Congress, which, on these issues, is simply a doormat
for the livestock industry and the mining industry. So we've had
very little help from Congress{hellip}.
</P>
<P>
   AR: When you look back at your tenure in Interior, how will you
regard the independent counsel investigation?
</P>
<P>
   BB: It was not a pleasant experience. It was a part of the
witch-hunting mentality of this town. It had one positive aspect,
and that is, it caused me to focus on what I really wanted to do.
It sort of improved my vision about what it is that I really wanted
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   AR: Did it focus you because you concentrated that much harder?
</P>
<P>
   BB: When stuff like that comes, your inevitable kind of reaction
is to take a step back from all the sort of day-to-day routine
stuff. (You ask yourself), ``What does the schedule today amount
to? Why am I making six public appearances today? What does it have
to do with what I was given, invited here by the president to do?''
</P>
<P>
   AR: Is there any message you'd want to impart to the independent
counsel about the way the investigation was conducted?
</P>
<P>
   BB: The statute expired. It's all gone. I mean, the statute was
an absurd piece of legislation that contributed to this kind of
witch-hunting environment. Everybody in Congress recognized that.
So there isn't any more independent counsel. I guess I can console
myself by saying, ``Well, maybe I was the poster child for the
repeal of the independent counsel statute.''
</P>
<P>
   AR: If Al Gore were elected president, would you consider
staying on as Secretary of Interior if he asked you to?
</P>
<P>
   BB: You never say never. But I think, in life, it's important to
get off the stage while the audience is still applauding. That's
one reason why, after two terms as governor - there were no term
limits - I said it's time to move on{hellip}. I've been here eight
years. Eight years is a nice bracket. I learned that being
governor. Four years is not enough, because you can start a lot of
things, but it's hard to work them into the sort of institutional
culture. And that's really been true around here.
</P>
<P>
   AR: You said you were an empty-nester now, the last time I
asked. And I remember writing a story and they put the headline on
it: ``Bruce and Hattie: The Reluctant Power Couple.'' You weren't
too big on the dinner-party scene in Washington at the time because
you had kids at home and you wanted to be home. Do you venture out

</P>
<P>
   BB: There was a year in which, all of a sudden, both children
were away at college and the dog died - all in the same one-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been about four years ago. And that has
obviously left us a little more time to, you know, kind of dip into
the Washington social scene. We're still not big players. We've
actually made a few friends now.
</P>

   Here are reviews of 2 Websites and current magazines:
</P>
<P>
   WEBSITES
</P>
<P>
   Misheard Song Lyrics
</P>
<P>
   www.kissthisguy.com and Mondegreen  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (www.enteract.com/ &UR; ~jessicar/lyrics/)
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just hate when you get the words to a song wrong? We
do, too. So we consulted a couple of Web sites that catalog
commonly misheard song lyrics and give the right words at the same
time. Great for those bar bets, and good for a chuckle as well.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is named after the most commonly misheard lyric,
from (beginitalic)Purple Haze(enditalic) by Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``'Scuse me, while I kiss this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then hilarity results. Or not.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, both sites have huge lists of commonly misheard
songs. Kissthisguy also has people fessing up, telling embarrassing
stories about when their friends made fun of them for singing the
wrong lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mondegreen's favorites is from the Bob Dylan tune,
(beginitalic)Blowin' in the Wind(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   The real lyric: ``The answer my friends, is blowin' in the
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The misheard lyric: ``The ants are my friends, they're blowin'
the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, hilarity results. Or not.

<P>
   MAGAZINE REVIEWS:
</P>
<P>
   American Heritage
</P>
<P>
   Offers yet another chapter in the most overcovered story of the
presidential season, namely John McCain's temper. Article tries to
gauge the boiling points of former presidents, ranging from Nixon's
rants caught on tape to LBJ's ornery behavior around his aides.
Calvin Coolidge apparently bullied his wife and played practical
jokes on his staff, while John Adams once called George Washington
a ``muttonhead.'' Main piece names most overrated/underrated things
from American culture, from books to movies to obscure things like
French heroes of the American Revolution. Inexplicably, their movie
expert picks (beginitalic)The Godfather (enditalic)as most
overrated film. In the book department, the author chooses
Melville's (beginitalic)Moby-Dick (enditalic)as the most overrated.
As the most underrated, they pick another tale of the sea, Herman
Wouk's (beginitalic)The Caine Mutiny. (enditalic)They also note
that Humphrey Bogart was ``awesomely perfect'' in the movie
version. Dude!
</P>
<P>
   Archaeology
</P>
<P>
   Purists might go for the story on ``curious urns'' found in the
Amazon (undoubtedly the site of an ancient Sam's Club), but my
favorite was a relatively short article on the archaeology of a pet
cemetery. The lead is really catchy: ``Like Persephone, I walk half
my life among the living and half (the professional half) among the
dead.'' The author spends most of her time on humans, researching
how memorials reveal diversity within ethnic groups. While looking
at the National Military Cemetery at the Presidio in San Francisco,
she stumbled over its pet cemetery. There's also an interesting
article on the vast network of pillboxes, roadblocks and trenches
that awaited a German invasion of Great Britain, which never came.
A sidebar notes that the indefatigable British have converted some
of the old pillboxes into bat roosts, garden sheds and a peacock
house, whatever that is. One couple even painted their pillbox
pink. Blimey!
</P>
<P>
   Harper's
</P>
<P>
   Includes a fascinating piece of journalism this month - a
profile of the U.S. government's favorite arms dealer, a German
named Ernst Werner Glatt, who lives on a sprawling farm at the
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. According to
this well-researched piece, Glatt has been involved in most of the
nation's covert arms deals of the past quarter-century, secretly
funneling weapons to American-backed guerilla forces during the
Cold War. There's an also interesting piece on radicals in the
Pacific Northwest, though the author wastes valuable real estate at
the top of the story describing his mundane plane ride to Portland
and his bus trip to Eugene. The magazine's centerpiece notes that
the Olympic Park in Sydney is built on the site of an old toxic
waste dump, near a contaminated creek, a waste treatment plant and
the ``dioxin capital of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys&AMP;Indians
</P>
<P>
   Great cover this month. After all, who's more of a cowboy than
Dylan McDermott, the star of (beginitalic)The Practice(enditalic),
a TV show about lawyers in Boston? Oh well. He's still a handsome
diablo, and he's also in a new movie called (beginitalic)Texas
Rangers. (enditalic)And, no, they couldn't resist the ``Marshal
Dylan'' headline. In the real cowboys section, there is an
interesting feature on the Professional Bull Riders circuit, which
has adopted a pro-wrestling approach - only with real bulls.
Instead of wooden stands and a corn pone announcer, PBR shows are
filled with laser shows, rock music and gouts of flame. Bull riding
is one of the fastest growing sports in the U.S., with 1.5 million
viewers each week on TNN. There's also some nice photos from a West
Texas ranch but, alas, no captions. Oh well, I think those are cows
in the background.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,

HOLY COW! OHIO HAS A MOTTO PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By JANE FRITSCH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is OK for the federal government to print ``In God We Trust''
on umpteen billion pieces of currency, but it is by no means OK for
the state of Ohio to use the motto, ``With God, All Things Are
Possible'' on its official seal or anywhere else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ruled the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
last week in a 30-page decision that reads like
Thomas-Aquinas-takes-the-bar-exam. Lesser minds may have trouble
following the logic, but in the end it comes down to something like
this: References to a particular religion are forbidden; general
references to God are not.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's slogan is a quotation from the New Testament and is
therefore clearly Christian, the court said. ``In God We Trust''
comes from ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' by Francis Scott Key and is
not a reference to a specific faith.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over the separation of church and state has
its roots in 1959, when the Ohio Legislature approved ``With God,
All Things Are Possible,'' as the state's official motto. It had
been the idea of a 12-year-old Cincinnati boy who was concerned
that Ohio was the only state without a motto.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio had a history of motto trouble. In 1866, the legislature
had approved the motto ``Imperium in Imperio,'' Latin for ``An
Empire Within an Empire.'' But there was a great outcry over the
``pretentious feudal meaning'' of the phrase, according to the Ohio
Historical Society, and the legislation was repealed a year later.
Ohio remained motto-free for almost 92 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 motto languished in obscurity until 1996, when Sen.
George Voinovich, a Republican who was then the governor of Ohio,
returned from a trip to India, where he noticed the slogan,
``Government Work Is God's Work'' on a public building. He began
pushing to have Ohio's motto inscribed on a building at the state
Capitol, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to file a
lawsuit to have it banned.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Columbus ruled that the motto could be used,
as long as the state did not cite its Christian origin. But the
appeals court overturned that ruling in its 2-1 decision last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the words of Jesus speaking about salvation,'' said Mark
Cohn, the lawyer who handled the case for the ACLU. ``It's an
expression of Ohio looking favorably on Christianity. It's not the
same as `In God We Trust.' No one knows what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   As the length of the opinion suggests, this was not an easy call
for the appeals court. Quoting from a 1972 Supreme Court case about
public financing of private schools, the opinion noted that the
line of separation between church and state, ``far from being a
wall, is a blurred, indistinct and variable depending on all the
circumstances of a particular relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous court decisions, and there have been many, have
approved the use of the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of
Allegiance, the decision noted. And it was long ago settled that
prayers could be recited at the opening of Congress. For a public
body to invoke divine guidance is not a step toward the
establishment of a religion, one ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   The mottos of some states include the word ``God,'' the opinion
said, but Ohio's is the only one that contains a direct quotation
from either the Old or New Testament of the Christian Bible. It is
taken directly from the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 19, Verse 26, in
which Jesus is quoted as saying, ``It is easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God.'' Asked who, then can be saved, Jesus replied,
``With men, this is impossible, but with God all things are
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU argued that the motto, therefore, constitutes an
endorsement of the Christian religion, but lawyers for the state
contended that the origin of the words is irrelevant. In fact, they
said, few people know the origin of the motto, which was intended
only to encourage hope and acknowledge the humility of Ohio's
government and its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the line, the appeals court ruled, the state of Ohio
had crossed it. ``While the words of the motto might not overtly
favor Christianity,'' the court said, ``as the words of Jesus,
they, at a minimum, demonstrate a particular affinity toward
Christianity in the eyes and ears of a reasonable observer.'' The
Ohio Legislature, the court added, ``in following the suggestion of
the 12-year-old boy who suggested the words of Jesus as the
official motto of the state, has given an unconstitutional
preference to Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is probably unnecessary to mention that the state of Ohio
plans to appeal.

HOLY COW! OHIO HAS A MOTTO PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   It is OK for the federal government to print ``In God We Trust''
on umpteen billion pieces of currency, but it is by no means OK for
the state of Ohio to use the motto, ``With God, All Things Are
Possible'' on its official seal or anywhere else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ruled the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
last week in a 30-page decision that reads like
Thomas-Aquinas-takes-the-bar-exam. Lesser minds may have trouble
following the logic, but in the end it comes down to something like
this: References to a particular religion are forbidden; general
references to God are not.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's slogan is a quotation from the New Testament and is
therefore clearly Christian, the court said. ``In God We Trust''
comes from ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' by Francis Scott Key and is
not a reference to a specific faith.
</P>
<P>
   The latest skirmish over the separation of church and state has
its roots in 1959, when the Ohio Legislature approved ``With God,
All Things Are Possible,'' as the state's official motto. It had
been the idea of a 12-year-old Cincinnati boy who was concerned

HOW TO POOH-POOH $70 MILLION WAR CHESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review)

   DETROIT _ For anyone living inside Washington's Beltway during
an election year, it often appears as though political campaigns
are taking over the country. The hinterlands complain loudly about
the number of advertisements on television and radio. Fund-raisers
raise seemingly enormous sums.
</P>
<P>
   But drive 525 miles northwest to the Motor City, home to some of
the world's largest companies, and the perspective changes. In a
typical year, the auto industry spends more than 100 times as much
on advertising as the presidential candidates combined. Even the
nearly $70 million that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas raised before
the first vote was cast in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1
seems like spare change in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even get the attention of a top auto executive about
anything less than $250 million,'' said Gerald Meyers, a former
chairman and chief executive of the American Motors Corp. ``They
drool more down the sides of their mouths at breakfast than $70
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry ad spending is enormous _ $1 in every $7 of all
advertising spending in this country _ because the companies are
huge. General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler each have about
eight times the annual sales of the Microsoft Corp., and are each
considerably larger than all the world's airlines put together.
Years of budget cuts in Washington, coupled with mergers in the
auto industry, have left few government departments operating on
the same scale as the automakers; the nation's annual military
budget is now only 74 percent larger than GM's annual revenue,
although the armed forces are still able to employ far more people
because soldiers earn much less than auto workers.
</P>
<P>
   With some Americans increasingly inured to advertising, media
manipulation has become more important. The media operations of
automakers dwarf those of the presidential campaigns. GM has 150
press officers worldwide; the Bush campaign has only four. Both
also have many media assistants who are not authorized to talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While auto shows do not yet attract the 15,000 journalists who
show up for the Democratic and Republican conventions, they are
drawing more attention, like the 4,000 journalists who have shown
up for New York's auto show, which ends April 30. More than a third
of the 5,700 journalists who covered Detroit's auto show in January
were from overseas, because mergers have made the industry more
global.
</P>
<P>
   There are some differences, of course, between the political and
automotive press. Newspapers and TV networks pay the bills for the
political journalists who troop on and off campaign buses. But
automakers pay for many journalists covering the introductions of
new models at auto shows and elsewhere; a few organizations,
including The New York Times, decline free trips.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers put reporters up in luxury hotel rooms costing up
to $600 a night, often inviting spouses and domestic partners, too,
although the manufacturers have cracked down to prevent journalists
from bringing along dirty laundry to be cleaned at $5 a shirt and
up. And while the political campaigners trudge to places like Des
Moines and Manchester, N.H., the automakers compete to fly
journalists to exotic settings that will provide unusual backdrops
for photography: BMW's Land Rover showed off its Discovery sport
utility vehicle by shuttling writers and photographers to the Gobi
Desert in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   If politicians get their message across on surprisingly small
budgets, do automakers get their money's worth as they try to
establish their brand images through much more extensive
advertising and public relations? The executives say they have
little choice about the spending, and that their ads are not just
another part of the ``white noise'' of American culture. There are
two dozen automakers in this country, some selling scores of models
_ 75 in GM's case _ so it takes much more advertising than it does
to promote a few presidential candidates. News coverage also
reinforces political campaign advertising and the public's
awareness of politicians' names in a way auto executives can only
dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Negative ads may be cost effective for politicians, but they are
rare in the auto industry. Any given car competes with so many
other models that it is hard to criticize all of the alternatives
even with a big ad budget. Auto executives also change jobs often
enough that they do not want to hit a potential future employer too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a gentleman's club _ they don't like to beat each
other to death,'' said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant in
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced marketers like Roger Adams, who made his name at
PepsiCo by reviving Mountain Dew and is now general manager of GM's
Buick division, unsurprisingly contend that auto ads are better
than campaign ads. ``A lot of political advertising is a blatant
sell, and that turns people off,'' said Adams, who has begun to
revive Buick by hiring Tiger Woods, the golfer, as its ad pitchman.
``If I see another Bush ad, I think I'll scream _ it's all `I've
done this, I've done that.'''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Twenty years after the death of Tito,
Yugo-nostalgia wafts through the remnant of the Yugoslavia he
created. And everywhere here, despite the continuing sway of
Slobodan Milosevic, there is a strong feeling of fin-de-regime,
that another era of personal rule is coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious radio station called Radio Nostalgia, its owners
and finances unclear, plays songs of the Tito era and has become
one of the most popular in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt anyone over 30 about the past and they will immediately
talk about how respected Yugoslavia used to be, how wonderful were
the summers on the Croatian coast, how easy it was to travel the
world without a visa, how shopping trips to Italy were common and
how often young people were sent abroad, to the United States or
Europe, for vacations and school.
</P>
<P>
   To be the pampered buffer between East and West, anti-Soviet and
anti-imperialist and members neither of the Warsaw Pact nor NATO,
meant easy access anywhere. Yugoslav Communism was relatively
liberal and relatively rich, and could seem a form of model for the
rest of Eastern Europe. Tito helped found the nonaligned movement,
which had real meaning in a world of competitive superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tito died on May 4, 1980, after a long illness, millions
of people wept _ as millions of Russians did when Stalin died in
1953 _ for an uncertain future without the nation's guiding star.
But Yugo-nostalgia is not the same sad plaint as Communist
nostalgia in the rest of the East. Yugoslavia is the one place in
Europe that was almost surely better off in the past, closer then
than now to acceptance and inclusion in the West and further,
politically, from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in this incredibly shrinking country, when even tiny
Montenegro talks of independence, there is a continuing sense of
bewilderment, poverty and farce, of helplessness as the Milosevic
era goes through its lengthy death throes.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic wars, Western sanctions and visa restrictions, most
people under 30 have barely traveled, not even to Croatia.
Milosevic himself, indicted for war crimes, cannot travel abroad.
He cannot even go to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic that he
titularly rules as the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, present
his defiance in the face of Washington and NATO's bombing as the
act of a new Tito, the founder of a new bloc of anti-hegemonistic
nations _ like Russia, China and Belarus _ that will stand up to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs are sophisticated enough to take this as pathetic
nonsense. They know they are associated with a group of countries
that care less about Yugoslavia than Yugoslavia cares about them.
</P>
<P>
   While China has helped the regime greatly with credits, loans
and investments, and the Russians have helped with deliveries of
energy, both have much more business to do with the United States.
Vladimir Putin won the Russian presidency, not a Communist, and he
has met with the Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov has even urged Belgrade to be more reasonable
toward the U.N. mandate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Tito _ Tito!'' was the reassuring but empty slogan in
the years that followed his passing 20 years ago, an era when a
clumsy collective presidency ran the country and decentralization
seemed to be an answer to disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of Communist ``brotherhood and unity,'' a new
form of enforced multiethnicity, Tito had tried to draw a line
under Yugoslavia's bloody past. But nationalism stayed alive in
people's minds, to emerge with vengeance after 1989, when the rest
of Communism was disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism was the simplest alternative ideology for Communist
parties seeking to keep their hold on power. Even though he kept a
portrait of Tito in his office until 1991, Milosevic tried to ride
the new tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic originally saw his role as a Serbian Tito, running a
Yugoslavia that the Serbs would dominate. ``His main miscalculation
was to think the West would never allow the disintegration of
Yugoslavia,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political
analyst. ``If we had a time machine, and could go back to 1990
knowing what we know now, I'm not sure the West would have allowed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one even thinks ``After Milosevic _ Milosevic!''
Instead, one graffiti scrawl in Belgrade, referring to Tito, reads:
``And even the lockmaker was better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fecklessness of the so-called democratic opposition
to Milosevic, the circles around the regime _ held together by
money, privilege, corruption and power _ are edgy, if not yet
disloyal. Even those who believe that the Socialists can remain on
top understand there will have to be a different leader. But the
problem with Milosevic handing over to a loyalist is that the West
has indicted his most trusted allies.
</P>
<P>
   Disaffection with the regime is widespread, undermined only by
fear of the future and of the opposition's chaotic rivalries. Yet
any fair election _ and there will be local and federal elections
this year and vital Serbian elections before the end of next year _
seems sure to deliver a stinging blow to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some here like to quote Markovic, who once warned opponents that
the Communists came to power through armed struggle, not
negotiations, and will leave the same way. But the country has
choked on blood and fratricidal wars that have brought it only
disintegration and decline. And Milosevic cannot be sure, if he
tries to override a clear loss in elections, that the army and
police will back him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when his term as Yugoslav president expires next year, he
could take another role _ possibly as Yugoslav or Serbian prime
minister, or remain as Socialist Party leader _ to keep influence
over the country and over his own fate, especially in the face of
Western demands that he be extradited. In any event, Djilas
believes that Milosevic is a legalist who will not only hold
elections but also abide by them if the results are clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the finest novel by Ivo Andric, the Bosnian-born
novelist most famous for writing ``Bridge over the Drina,'' is
``Bosnian Chronicle.'' Set in the Napoleonic era, it is a story of
Western power and rivalries, represented by the French and Austrian
consuls, played out in a small outpost of a relatively indifferent
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   As Napoleon finally begins to suffer defeat after defeat, the
French consul, Daville, finds that he is treated differently. Even
in his own mind, there has been a sudden shift that leaves him
feeling ``only a great emptiness,'' as he comes to think about life
``without Napoleon as the basic assumption.'' He was, Andric
writes, ``sharing the experience of thousands of French people at
that time, exhausted in the service of a regime that had in fact
been defeated long ago, because it had been obliged to ask of
people more than they could give.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 20 years after Tito's death, Serbs feel what Daville
felt. The Milosevic regime has exhausted them and itself through
one sacrifice after another, some self-inflicted, some imposed.
While no one foresees the end, everyone feels it coming.

FOR YUGOSLAVS, THE PAST KEEPS GETTING BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Twenty years after the death of Tito,
Yugo-nostalgia wafts through the remnant of the Yugoslavia he
created. And everywhere here, despite the continuing sway of
Slobodan Milosevic, there is a strong feeling of fin-de-regime,
that another era of personal rule is coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious radio station called Radio Nostalgia, its owners
and finances unclear, plays songs of the Tito era and has become
one of the most popular in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Prompt anyone over 30 about the past and they will immediately
talk about how respected Yugoslavia used to be, how wonderful were
the summers on the Croatian coast, how easy it was to travel the
world without a visa, how shopping trips to Italy were common and
how often young people were sent abroad, to the United States or
Europe, for vacations and school.
</P>
<P>
   To be the pampered buffer between East and West, anti-Soviet and
anti-imperialist and members neither of the Warsaw Pact nor NATO,
meant easy access anywhere. Yugoslav Communism was relatively
liberal and relatively rich, and could seem a form of model for the
rest of Eastern Europe. Tito helped found the nonaligned movement,
which had real meaning in a world of competitive superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   So when Tito died on May 4, 1980, after a long illness, millions
of people wept _ as millions of Russians did when Stalin died in
1953 _ for an uncertain future without the nation's guiding star.
But Yugo-nostalgia is not the same sad plaint as Communist
nostalgia in the rest of the East. Yugoslavia is the one place in
Europe that was almost surely better off in the past, closer then
than now to acceptance and inclusion in the West and further,
politically, from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in this incredibly shrinking country, when even tiny
Montenegro talks of independence, there is a continuing sense of
bewilderment, poverty and farce, of helplessness as the Milosevic
era goes through its lengthy death throes.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic wars, Western sanctions and visa restrictions, most
people under 30 have barely traveled, not even to Croatia.
Milosevic himself, indicted for war crimes, cannot travel abroad.
He cannot even go to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic that he
titularly rules as the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his influential wife, Mirjana Markovic, present
his defiance in the face of Washington and NATO's bombing as the
act of a new Tito, the founder of a new bloc of anti-hegemonistic
nations _ like Russia, China and Belarus _ that will stand up to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs are sophisticated enough to take this as pathetic
nonsense. They know they are associated with a group of countries
that care less about Yugoslavia than Yugoslavia cares about them.
</P>
<P>
   While China has helped the regime greatly with credits, loans
and investments, and the Russians have helped with deliveries of
energy, both have much more business to do with the United States.
Vladimir Putin won the Russian presidency, not a Communist, and he
has met with the Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov has even urged Belgrade to be more reasonable
toward the U.N. mandate in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Tito _ Tito!'' was the reassuring but empty slogan in
the years that followed his passing 20 years ago, an era when a
clumsy collective presidency ran the country and decentralization
seemed to be an answer to disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of Communist ``brotherhood and unity,'' a new
form of enforced multiethnicity, Tito had tried to draw a line
under Yugoslavia's bloody past. But nationalism stayed alive in
people's minds, to emerge with vengeance after 1989, when the rest
of Communism was disintegrating.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism was the simplest alternative ideology for Communist
parties seeking to keep their hold on power. Even though he kept a
portrait of Tito in his office until 1991, Milosevic tried to ride
the new tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic originally saw his role as a Serbian Tito, running a
Yugoslavia that the Serbs would dominate. ``His main miscalculation
was to think the West would never allow the disintegration of
Yugoslavia,'' said Aleksa Djilas, a historian and political
analyst. ``If we had a time machine, and could go back to 1990
knowing what we know now, I'm not sure the West would have allowed
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one even thinks ``After Milosevic _ Milosevic!''
Instead, one graffiti scrawl in Belgrade, referring to Tito, reads:
``And even the lockmaker was better.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fecklessness of the so-called democratic opposition
to Milosevic, the circles around the regime _ held together by
money, privilege, corruption and power _ are edgy, if not yet
disloyal. Even those who believe that the Socialists can remain on
top understand there will have to be a different leader. But the
problem with Milosevic handing over to a loyalist is that the West
has indicted his most trusted allies.
</P>
<P>
   Disaffection with the regime is widespread, undermined only by
fear of the future and of the opposition's chaotic rivalries. Yet
any fair election _ and there will be local and federal elections
this year and vital Serbian elections before the end of next year _
seems sure to deliver a stinging blow to the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Some here like to quote Markovic, who once warned opponents that
the Communists came to power through armed struggle, not
negotiations, and will leave the same way. But the country has
choked on blood and fratricidal wars that have brought it only
disintegration and decline. And Milosevic cannot be sure, if he
tries to override a clear loss in elections, that the army and
police will back him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when his term as Yugoslav president expires next year, he
could take another role _ possibly as Yugoslav or Serbian prime
minister, or remain as Socialist Party leader _ to keep influence
over the country and over his own fate, especially in the face of
Western demands that he be extradited. In any event, Djilas
believes that Milosevic is a legalist who will not only hold
elections but also abide by them if the results are clear enough.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the finest novel by Ivo Andric, the Bosnian-born
novelist most famous for writing ``Bridge over the Drina,'' is
``Bosnian Chronicle.'' Set in the Napoleonic era, it is a story of
Western power and rivalries, represented by the French and Austrian
consuls, played out in a small outpost of a relatively indifferent
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   As Napoleon finally begins to suffer defeat after defeat, the
French consul, Daville, finds that he is treated differently. Even
in his own mind, there has been a sudden shift that leaves him
feeling ``only a great emptiness,'' as he comes to think about life
``without Napoleon as the basic assumption.'' He was, Andric
writes, ``sharing the experience of thousands of French people at
that time, exhausted in the service of a regime that had in fact
been defeated long ago, because it had been obliged to ask of
people more than they could give.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 20 years after Tito's death, Serbs feel what Daville
felt. The Milosevic regime has exhausted them and itself through
one sacrifice after another, some self-inflicted, some imposed.
While no one foresees the end, everyone feels it coming.

CHANCE ENCOUNTERS :  WHO SAYS GAMBLING IS A SCOURGE? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The prospect or hope or threat that a big new casino may be on
the way to the Catskills, just 90 miles from Manhattan, stirs mixed
emotions among New York's casino frequenters. Residing within 90
minutes of the Monticello Raceway, the proposed site of yet another
gambling enterprise, means reducing by almost half the time it
takes to get to the action in Atlantic City or in Connecticut. That
is the promise. The threat is identical: In an hour and a half you
can be dropping the family savings into the latest in slot machines
or at old-style craps, blackjack and like diversions.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of gambling shows little sign of abating. Along with
most casino patrons, I remain agnostic about the moral and social
considerations. Granted, gambling may not be the most edifying of
pastimes; gamblers could assuredly broaden themselves by reading
best sellers and watching wrestling instead of whiling away the
hours in clockless rooms. On the other hand, whose business is it
if adults find pleasure in throwing away their money, and why
shouldn't it be thrown away in New York instead of Connecticut or
New Jersey? (Compulsive gamblers no doubt require treatment, but
not, most players must agree, at the expense of everyone else or as
an excuse for crackdowns by busybodies.)
</P>
<P>
   What needs to be added in favor of casinos, moreover, is an
appeal that goes beyond the basic ``gaming,'' as its promoters
prefer to call gambling. Casino visitors find themselves part of a
welcoming community with one thing on its collective mind. Along
with the opportunity to take a flier against the odds on a
sprinkling of roulette numbers, there is admittance to a
camaraderie of hope in opposition to fate's negative forces.
</P>
<P>
   That is what you can see in the busloads of anticipation that
roll up to the casinos every morning. That is what you can hear in
the cheers, hollers and squeals for a craps shooter in the throes
of a hot roll or when the dealer goes bust against the whole
blackjack table or when the slots light up and the coins clang in
their jolly fashion. It is not just the joy of winning, but of
winning as part of a team. The relationships are not enduring, but
they offer a sort of stimulation that workaday existence rarely
provides. Those heady moments of unity and celebration keep players
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   In my own preferred casino pastime, poker, the situation is
different from most other games, since the patrons compete against
one another, and the house takes its cut regardless of who wins.
But here, too, the contestants, though competitors, are united in
the action.
</P>
<P>
   Poker players tend to spend more time with one another than
players at other casino games; it is not unusual for an enthusiast
to fiddle with his chips and study his down cards for 10 hours at a
stretch. After a couple of shift changes, players and dealers are
on a first-name basis. If you weaken and drop out around midnight,
be assured that on your return for the early-morning activity, you
will find some of the companions you left behind still at it.
</P>
<P>
   But morning or night, when you join in, you immediately become
part of a small, dedicated fraternity, bound like Freemasons by the
rules of the society. There is a sense in the poker room of being
among the anointed, at several degrees of separation from the
robots at the slots or the suckers battling the odds at games with
names like Caribbean Stud, which bear a deceptive resemblance to
real poker but which the poker vet scorns as inventions that give
the house a considerable edge.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say a poker table is always a convivial place;
tension can make for testiness. But it is not unusual for a player
who has just lost a big hand to a worthy competitor to offer
sincere congratulations to the winner. Conversation at the table is
not wide ranging and initiates tend to be careful about giving
offense. Politics is generally avoided and racial or ethnic slurs
are definitely out. The main subject, a safe one, is about the
straight you didn't make or the miracle flush that you caught on
Fifth Street. Everyone can share in the lamentation or rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   But set aside snobbery; even slot-machine addicts feel they are
part of a club. Whatever game you favor, the casino makes it easy
to join up. Women and men, blacks and whites, the disabled and the
able bodied _ all are welcome. Democracy prevails: Among these
strangers, the player finds a home. As the poker regulars like to
say, all you need is a chair and a chip.
</P>
<P>
   That is the special lure of the casino, be it upstate or
downstate or on the reservation. For your time at the table or at
the machine, loneliness is abolished; you are among a cadre of the
like minded. Win or lose, the world seems a friendlier place.
</P>
<P>
   All right, if you win, it is a little more friendly.

DEFINING THE TARGET IN THE BATTLE OF VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look closely at a few typical events on the campaign trail these
days and the true targets of this presidential election quickly
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al Gore recently talked about education (a major
concern to suburban mothers) in Columbus, Ohio (the swing city in a
swing state). George W. Bush unveiled his new ``compassionate
conservative'' agenda on health care, home ownership and tax cuts
(another bid for the center, especially women, who rank health care
high) in Cleveland and St. Louis (both in traditionally swing
states with a combined total of 32 electoral votes). Gore went to
the drug store with an older woman who lacks prescription drug
coverage (big, big issue with the elderly).
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential candidate at this stage of the game swears he
would fight for every state and every vote in this richly diverse
country. But the ugly little truth is that some states are more
important than others, not just because they are big (with a lot of
electoral votes) but because they are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season was dominated by New Hampshire, the
general election campaign will most likely be ruled by an arc of
big industrial states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois and Missouri. Or, as a gleeful David Leland, chairman of
the Ohio Democratic Party, puts it: ``Bush was here yesterday and
Gore was here last week. I suspect we'll see a lot of both.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a demographic corollary: Some groups of voters will get
more attention than others _ like elderly voters, the legendary
800-pound gorillas of politics, who used to be reliably Democratic
but in recent elections have swung toward the Republicans; married
suburban mothers, an important part of the Clinton vote but now a
battleground between Bush and Gore; and Catholics, once the
quintessential Reagan Democrats, pulled one way by their cultural
conservatism and another by their instincts on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strategic thinking in the parties these days
revolves around these groups and these states. For example, Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster, talks about ``the Reagan seniors, aged
60 to 70,'' who tend to be more affluent than older retirees but
also very responsive to the idea of expanding Medicare to cover
prescription drugs _ which many of them suddenly need.
</P>
<P>
   Put the geography and the demographics together, and a
65-year-old woman (a high likelihood of voting) in a Macomb County,
Mich., suburb, with an affection for the Bush family (a Republican
advantage), a concern for the country's values (ditto) and mounting
medication bills (a Democratic advantage) can look like ground zero
in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This targeting also explains why some candidates for the vice
presidential nomination become so compelling _ like Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania, the popular Catholic governor of a battleground
state, who suddenly appeals to so many Republicans. Some Democrats
say Bush has a problem with white Catholics, not just because of
the criticism over his visit to Bob Jones University in the primary
season, but also because of the Southern conservative dominance of
the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge would neatly provide geographic and cultural balance,
although his support for abortion rights carries risk for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the effort will be confined to those states in the
middle, of course. For some time to come, each candidate will be
probing for weaknesses and targets of opportunity in the other's
base. Most notably, Bush is making forays into California, which
the Democrats carried by wide margins in the last two elections;
the Republicans are running advertising aimed at Hispanics, hoping
that Bush's appeal to that voting bloc in Texas is transferable.
And Gore is paying attention to Florida, a Republican-leaning state
whose governor, Jeb Bush, has a personal stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts see the electoral map as pro-Republican in the
South and Mountain West, pro-Democratic on the West Coast and
Northeast, and up for grabs in much of the industrial heartland.
Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter,
said, ``They don't have strong liberal tendencies like the
Northeast or the West Coast and they don't have strong conservative
tendencies like the Southern and Rocky Mountain states.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Teeter, a pollster long active in Republican politics, said
of that arc of battleground states: ``Because they're big, they
have all the elements in them that the country has _ they have
rural areas that are Republican, small towns that are Republican,
suburbs with a lot of swing votes, big cities with union members
and blacks that are Democratic.'' This long-running role in
presidential politics, he added, has given rise to the axiom that
no Republican has ever been elected president who didn't win Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-KEY-STATES-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: win Ohio.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This political map can change, and has. Most notably, the once
solidly Democratic South realigned to the Republicans in
presidential voting in the late 1960s. For much of the 1980s, the
Republicans were considered to have an ``electoral lock'' on the
presidency because of their strength in the South and California.
But California, which has 54 electoral votes, began turning to the
Democrats in 1988, when Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee, lost it narrowly in what was nationally a sweeping defeat
for the Democrats. In the last two elections, Democrats have
anchored their victories on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The important demographics can also shift. The over-60 vote went
to the Republicans by a surprising margin of 10 percentage points
in the 1998 midterm elections, according to the exit polls.
``Senior women are anywhere from 12 to 15 percent of the
electorate,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``They will
vote at an 80 to 85 percent clip.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pollsters say the tug of war for older voters will be
between their attraction for Republican leadership on values _
including Bush's promise to ``uphold the honor and dignity of the
office'' and a general concern over the country's moral direction _
and Democratic promises to protect Medicare and Social Security.
``Once very specific Medicare and Social Security issues go off the
table, values concerns come back,'' said Stan Greenberg, a
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster, grumbled that at the height
of the campaign, ``Democrats wake up every day saying, `What is it
we gotta do today? Oh, yeah, scare seniors and make sure the black
vote gets out.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms'' have become almost a cliche in presidential
politics, but married mothers are, if anything, likely to be more
important in this election than in years past. In large part, this
reflects Bush's greater personal appeal to this group and his
careful courtship on issues and style; from the start, his promise
of compassionate conservatism and emphasis on issues like education
showed his determination to close the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
showed how much better Bush was doing among mothers than the last
Republican nominee. In April 1996, 60 percent of mothers said they
were backing Clinton, while 37 percent said they were backing Dole.
Last month, 41 percent of mothers said they were backing Gore,
while 52 percent were backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the soccer mom cliche,'' Cook said, ``but I have to
tell you that middle- and upper-middle-income white women who
economically ought to be Republicans but on social and cultural
issues _ abortion, guns, education and health care _ gravitate to
the Democrats, will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the demographic trends that cut across state lines,
states also have their idiosyncracies. The auto industry's
dominance in Michigan, for example, makes it almost inevitable that
the Bush campaign will try to paint Gore there as an environmental
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the focus on swing voters, the cardinal rule of
politics is to cultivate your base. Still, as this unusually long
post-primary, pre-convention political season drags on, the
battlegrounds are clear. And assuming the election stays
competitive, it will only get worse. ``If you want to know what
hell is like for a voter, it's a swing presidential state with a
key Senate race and an open congressional race,'' Bolger said.
``They're going to see so many political messages that there won't
be any actual news _ just 30 minutes of 30-second spots.''

DEFINING THE TARGET IN THE BATTLE OF VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look closely at a few typical events on the campaign trail these
days and the true targets of this presidential election quickly
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Al Gore recently talked about education (a major
concern to suburban mothers) in Columbus, Ohio (the swing city in a
swing state). George W. Bush unveiled his new ``compassionate
conservative'' agenda on health care, home ownership and tax cuts
(another bid for the center, especially women, who rank health care
high) in Cleveland and St. Louis (both in traditionally swing
states with a combined total of 32 electoral votes). Gore went to
the drug store with an older woman who lacks prescription drug
coverage (big, big issue with the elderly).
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential candidate at this stage of the game swears he
would fight for every state and every vote in this richly diverse
country. But the ugly little truth is that some states are more
important than others, not just because they are big (with a lot of
electoral votes) but because they are up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary season was dominated by New Hampshire, the
general election campaign will most likely be ruled by an arc of
big industrial states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois and Missouri. Or, as a gleeful David Leland, chairman of
the Ohio Democratic Party, puts it: ``Bush was here yesterday and
Gore was here last week. I suspect we'll see a lot of both.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a demographic corollary: Some groups of voters will get
more attention than others _ like elderly voters, the legendary
800-pound gorillas of politics, who used to be reliably Democratic
but in recent elections have swung toward the Republicans; married
suburban mothers, an important part of the Clinton vote but now a
battleground between Bush and Gore; and Catholics, once the
quintessential Reagan Democrats, pulled one way by their cultural
conservatism and another by their instincts on domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strategic thinking in the parties these days
revolves around these groups and these states. For example, Celinda
Lake, a Democratic pollster, talks about ``the Reagan seniors, aged
60 to 70,'' who tend to be more affluent than older retirees but
also very responsive to the idea of expanding Medicare to cover
prescription drugs _ which many of them suddenly need.
</P>
<P>
   Put the geography and the demographics together, and a
65-year-old woman (a high likelihood of voting) in a Macomb County,
Mich., suburb, with an affection for the Bush family (a Republican
advantage), a concern for the country's values (ditto) and mounting
medication bills (a Democratic advantage) can look like ground zero
in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This targeting also explains why some candidates for the vice
presidential nomination become so compelling _ like Gov. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania, the popular Catholic governor of a battleground
state, who suddenly appeals to so many Republicans. Some Democrats
say Bush has a problem with white Catholics, not just because of
the criticism over his visit to Bob Jones University in the primary
season, but also because of the Southern conservative dominance of
the party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge would neatly provide geographic and cultural balance,
although his support for abortion rights carries risk for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the effort will be confined to those states in the
middle, of course. For some time to come, each candidate will be
probing for weaknesses and targets of opportunity in the other's
base. Most notably, Bush is making forays into California, which
the Democrats carried by wide margins in the last two elections;
the Republicans are running advertising aimed at Hispanics, hoping
that Bush's appeal to that voting bloc in Texas is transferable.
And Gore is paying attention to Florida, a Republican-leaning state
whose governor, Jeb Bush, has a personal stake in the election.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts see the electoral map as pro-Republican in the
South and Mountain West, pro-Democratic on the West Coast and
Northeast, and up for grabs in much of the industrial heartland.
Charles Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter,
said, ``They don't have strong liberal tendencies like the
Northeast or the West Coast and they don't have strong conservative
tendencies like the Southern and Rocky Mountain states.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Teeter, a pollster long active in Republican politics, said
of that arc of battleground states: ``Because they're big, they
have all the elements in them that the country has _ they have
rural areas that are Republican, small towns that are Republican,
suburbs with a lot of swing votes, big cities with union members
and blacks that are Democratic.'' This long-running role in
presidential politics, he added, has given rise to the axiom that
no Republican has ever been elected president who didn't win Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-R-KEY-STATES-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &QL; 
UNDATED: win Ohio.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This political map can change, and has. Most notably, the once
solidly Democratic South realigned to the Republicans in
presidential voting in the late 1960s. For much of the 1980s, the
Republicans were considered to have an ``electoral lock'' on the
presidency because of their strength in the South and California.
But California, which has 54 electoral votes, began turning to the
Democrats in 1988, when Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
nominee, lost it narrowly in what was nationally a sweeping defeat
for the Democrats. In the last two elections, Democrats have
anchored their victories on the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The important demographics can also shift. The over-60 vote went
to the Republicans by a surprising margin of 10 percentage points
in the 1998 midterm elections, according to the exit polls.
``Senior women are anywhere from 12 to 15 percent of the
electorate,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ``They will
vote at an 80 to 85 percent clip.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pollsters say the tug of war for older voters will be
between their attraction for Republican leadership on values _
including Bush's promise to ``uphold the honor and dignity of the
office'' and a general concern over the country's moral direction _
and Democratic promises to protect Medicare and Social Security.
``Once very specific Medicare and Social Security issues go off the
table, values concerns come back,'' said Stan Greenberg, a
Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Bolger, a Republican pollster, grumbled that at the height
of the campaign, ``Democrats wake up every day saying, `What is it
we gotta do today? Oh, yeah, scare seniors and make sure the black
vote gets out.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer moms'' have become almost a cliche in presidential
politics, but married mothers are, if anything, likely to be more
important in this election than in years past. In large part, this
reflects Bush's greater personal appeal to this group and his
careful courtship on issues and style; from the start, his promise
of compassionate conservatism and emphasis on issues like education
showed his determination to close the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
showed how much better Bush was doing among mothers than the last
Republican nominee. In April 1996, 60 percent of mothers said they
were backing Clinton, while 37 percent said they were backing Dole.
Last month, 41 percent of mothers said they were backing Gore,
while 52 percent were backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the soccer mom cliche,'' Cook said, ``but I have to
tell you that middle- and upper-middle-income white women who
economically ought to be Republicans but on social and cultural
issues _ abortion, guns, education and health care _ gravitate to
the Democrats, will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the demographic trends that cut across state lines,
states also have their idiosyncracies. The auto industry's
dominance in Michigan, for example, makes it almost inevitable that
the Bush campaign will try to paint Gore there as an environmental
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the focus on swing voters, the cardinal rule of
politics is to cultivate your base. Still, as this unusually long
post-primary, pre-convention political season drags on, the
battlegrounds are clear. And assuming the election stays
competitive, it will only get worse. ``If you want to know what
hell is like for a voter, it's a swing presidential state with a
key Senate race and an open congressional race,'' Bolger said.
``They're going to see so many political messages that there won't
be any actual news _ just 30 minutes of 30-second spots.''

THE CHALLENGE TO CHINA'S RULERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Surely China's rulers never dreamed that a
spiritual movement started by a former grain company clerk could
turn into the most serious challenge to their authority since the
pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989. But that is what the brutal
suppression of the group called Falun Gong has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive media coverage of China's actions _ which have led to
at least a dozen deaths, alleged death by torture, thousands of
cases of abuse and the harassment of tens of thousands _ has
blighted the human rights reputation of the government.
</P>
<P>
   But little light has been cast on why so many people feel Falun
Gong, founded seven years ago and now claiming millions of
adherents, is worth dying for. Nor is it widely understood in the
West that aspects of the movement, or cult, suggest that its
followers are misled and its leader deluded, or even a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a closer examination of Falun Gong's beliefs and
practices challenges some of the easy assumptions about Beijing's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong's founder, Li Hongzhi, was one of many self-styled
masters of traditional Chinese breathing exercises, known as
qigong, to emerge during a resurgence of the discipline in the late
1980s and early 1990s. The exercises are meant to focus the body's
vital energy, which traditional Chinese medicine calls qi. This
energy has its mundane uses, like improving one's health and sense
of well-being. But there has always been a supernatural
undercurrent to its cultivation, which has included the belief that
qigong can also be used to develop the ability to fly, to move
objects by telekinesis and to heal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Li differentiated himself from other qigong masters by wrapping
his regimen in a cosmology that promises salvation through the
refinement of one's character until the body literally evolves into
another form of matter. At that point, the saved person is capable
of flying to paradise, which may exist out in the cosmos, or in
another dimension.
</P>
<P>
   He said interracial children are the spawn of the ``Dharma
Ending Period,'' a Buddhist phrase that refers to an era of moral
degeneration. In an interview last year, he said each race has its
own paradise, and he later told followers in Australia that, ``The
yellow people, the white people, and the black people have
corresponding races in heaven.'' As a result, he said, interracial
children have no place in heaven without his intervention.
</P>
<P>
   He also included many China's folk superstitions, including
references to fox and weasel spirits, which make Falun Gong
attractive to the masses. It offered a homegrown religion, not the
staid precepts of state-sanctioned Buddhism and Taoism, or the
foreign feel of Christianity. And it did so at a time when
religious interest was on the rise, as disillusioned Chinese sought
spiritual solace in the wake of the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Li preaches a number of other peculiar doctrines, among them
that the Earth is gradually being infiltrated by aliens. ``Some
people you see walking on the streets are, in fact, not humans,''
he told followers last year. He reports seeing green, blue and
multicolored beings in other dimensions, and says the magician
David Copperfield can fly. Li claims that he, too, can fly, though
he says it is against his enlightened nature to do so in public.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of this is metaphorical. In an interview last year, Li said
all of the things he talks about are real, though he is constrained
in describing them by the limitations of human language. What makes
such pronouncements more than harmless eccentricity is that Li also
exhorts his followers to ``defend the Fa,'' or law, as described by
his teachings, praising those who confront China's often brutish
state police.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Jimmy Zhou, an accountant and emigrant to the United
States, who returned to China late last year to help keep the
banned movement alive. Soon afterward, he was arrested, beaten and
humiliated for a week before being released.
</P>
<P>
   That Zhou should have to suffer for his beliefs is an ugly
commonplace of totalitarian societies, though in this instance that
may well play into the hands of the movement the government is
trying to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them in the tradition of millennarian movements in
Chinese history, movements that talk about a new world coming and
have often spelled the end of a regime,'' says Merle Goldman, a
professor of Chinese history at Boston University. ``They start out
as nonpoliticized movements, but the way the government reacts
politicizes them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou insists, based on Li's teachings, that the French had
discovered a 2-billion-year-old nuclear reactor in Africa, evidence
of a prehistoric civilization that practiced Falun Gong. Li's
teachings also instruct Zhou that mankind has been ``left in
complete destruction'' 81 times and that another round of
destruction may be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou spoke ominously of this coming upheaval. ``Something is
going to happen,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean a catastrophe, but
there will be some sudden change that will be good for good people,
but bad for bad people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is just this sort of theologizing that disturbs Chinese
leaders. China has an uneducated, increasingly restive population,
one historically prone to swift and often disastrous alignments
behind charismatic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Beijing's crackdown on the group was neither swift
nor unconsidered. On April 25 last year, more than 10,000 Falun
Gong followers surrounded Beijing's leadership compound on the 10th
anniversary of the start of the 1989 pro-democracy protests. This
amounted to a direct challenge to the party, and as such, Falun
Gong's act was inherently political and certain to provoke a harsh
response. Beijing claimed the demonstration was orchestrated by Li,
who first denied, then admitted, being in China the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Until that demonstration, however, Falun Gong was tolerated and
even enjoyed the open support of some government officials.
Millions of followers congregated in public parks and plazas across
the country each morning for group exercises. The Chinese press
grew increasingly critical of the group in 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after Beijing Television broadcast a program
critical of the group, Falun Gong followers besieged the station.
The municipal government told the station to resolve the dispute
before the sensitive anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy killings
on June 4, a date on which the government is wary of any
gatherings. The TV station buckled, fired the reporter who had
produced the program and broadcast a positive piece on Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, the group staged dozens of such actions
across the country, culminating in the Beijing demonstration on
April 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong is no more tolerant of the Western press. When I
wrote last year about a $600,000 New Jersey home bought by Li's
wife (Li said the house was actually a gift from a follower that
was later returned), Li's spokesman, Zhang Erping, told me on the
telephone, ``How does it feel to know that millions of Falun Gong
practitioners in China know your name.'' Afterwards, I received
dozens of e-mail messages and faxes from angry Falun Gong
followers, including one from Lili Feng, an assistant professor at
Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, who warned, ``You will get
paid back for what you said and did by gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong has not been implicated in any violent acts, though
Beijing clearly fears any mass movement it does not control. But it
is particularly affronted by religious faith. Atheism is the
official party, and preferred state, faith.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Beijing regime has no moral credibility with
which to fight an expressly spiritual foe. It cannot put forward
its own view of spirituality, since it hasn't got one. The upshot
is that the party is increasingly threatened by any belief system
that challenges its ideology. And if the followers of such a belief
system demonstrate an ability to organize as well, the party may
well feel it has no option but to attack it to retain its hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Falun Gong constitutes a genuine threat to the
party, Richard Baum, acting director of the Center for Chinese
Studies at UCLA, said: ``Only in the sense that it has the ability
to organize thousands of followers beyond the reach of the state.
In a `normal' society, there would not be repeated displays of
state force against thousands of passive, peaceful citizens who
were committing no crime other than bearing witness to their
beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong followers show no sign of giving up the fight. One of
them, Wang Jinzhi, has been detained three times for her beliefs
and is now banned from entering the country, where she has a
husband and child. But she said on Thursday from Japan, ``I believe
that in the near future not only China but the whole world will
recognize Falun Gong as the law of the universe that created
life.''

POWER IN BLACK AND WHITE

   DURBAN, South Africa _ On the radio waves and television
screens, the conflict often appears stark and simple: The battle in
Zimbabwe, it seems, is a battle between blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressors are the landless black supporters of President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. Their enemies are the prosperous white
farmers, who own more than half of that country's fertile land. The
issue is land redistribution and the prominent victims are white
men whose haggard faces feature on the evening news here in
Zimbabwe's neighbor, South Africa, and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But what, then, accounts for the predominantly black body count?
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, 11 people have been killed in Zimbabwe. Of
those victims, only two were white. In reality, the people bearing
the brunt of that country's seething political violence are poor,
landless and overwhelmingly black.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the struggle in Zimbabwe is less about race
and land than it is about one ruling party's struggle to keep its
virtual monopoly of power. For while Mugabe rages about the white
enemy, his supporters have quietly recognized that ordinary blacks
pose the more potent political threat.
</P>
<P>
   It is the black majority that has the power to end the ruling
party's overwhelming control of Parliament in coming elections, now
tentatively scheduled for May. And for the first time in 20 years,
the ordinary blacks of Zimbabwe _ who are weary of soaring
inflation, deepening poverty and government corruption _ seem
inclined to do just that. Most of the blacks who died were killed
because they opposed Mugabe's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a situation where more and more black people are
saying, `Let's get rid of this government,''' said John Makumbe, a
political science professor at the University of Zimbabwe. ``And
violence is being perpetrated against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole land and race issue is a classic diversion of
attention from the real issues which are facing this country, high
levels of unemployment, inflation and poverty,'' Makumbe said.
``What you really have is a government under siege trying to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the government call it old-style despotism. And it
rings a strikingly discordant note in a corner of the world where
democracy and freedom of political expression has flourished in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, four democracies here at the foot of the continent _
South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mozambique _ elected presidents
in contested elections that were deemed free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   And leaders from this region who have willingly and freely given
up power _ men like Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Sir Ketumile
Masire of Botswana _ are winning respect as elder statesmen as they
mediate conflicts in Burundi and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Mugabe, who once inspired and sheltered black
freedom fighters across the region. But today, as he and his allies
support illegal land invasions of white-owned farms and stand by
without condemning attacks on opposition party members, many people
cannot help but shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe and his party, many critics say, have become too hungry
for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's almost a caricature of all the things people think black
African leaders do,'' said Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.
``He seems to be wanting to make a cartoon of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shattered because Mugabe is one of the most highly
qualified and most able leaders,'' Tutu said, in remarks to
European journalists that were published in news reports here.
``One just wants to weep. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's governing party currently controls all but three seats
in Parliament. But it seems likely that voters will whittle away at
that dominant position.
</P>
<P>
   In February, voters handed Mugabe his first political defeat
since he became president 20 years ago. They rejected a
constitutional amendment that would have expanded his powers and
allowed the government to seize white-owned land without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The serious attacks on black opponents began within weeks of
that defeat. And government critics say the ruling party has
deliberately played down those killings, hoping to distract the
public with vigorous rhetorical attacks on Zimbabwe's white
minority, who dominate the economy but make up less than 2 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The black victims include an electrician, a policeman, a
pregnant woman and the driver of Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition
party leader; they were killed in clashes with supporters of the
government. Last week, two people were stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
   The killings typically receive only cursory mention in
Zimbabwe's government-controlled media and little coverage in the
foreign press, according to the Media Monitoring Project of
Zimbabwe, which monitors news coverage about that country.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers like The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only independent
daily, have reported more extensively on the deaths, noting they
are typically politically motivated with little to do with race or
land.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 22, the office of the Daily News was firebombed.
The government detained a South African photographer in connection
with the explosion, which shattered the newspaper's windows, but
injured no one.
</P>
<P>
   But journalists at the newspaper, which is critical of the
government, blame supporters of Mugabe. Two weeks ago, the
newspaper's editor in chief, who is black, received a death threat,
warning him to stop criticizing the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think race is the primary thing,'' said William Saidi,
the assistant editor of the Daily News. ``The general plan is to
silence all opposition.''

TOURISTS STUMBLE INTO THE LINE OF FIRE  
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Malcolm Nance was kibitzing last week with the owner of a San
Diego travel agency who bragged that he had just sent some clients
on a trek to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Are you aware that they declared a state of emergency
in western Nepal two weeks ago?''' Nance recalled. ``The State
Department has put out advisories on numerous armed robberies by
Communist insurgents. I said, `You know, you could become liable if
your customers are kidnapped.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nance, a Navy veteran, is the chief consultant at Real World
Rescue, one of the leading companies that teach travel safety to
government and humanitarian agency workers, business travelers and,
increasingly, leisure travelers who are roaming the third world and
sometimes running into the kinds of trouble _ like kidnapping _
that aren't much covered in those cheery travel guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have terrorists now who specifically target Western
tourists, like in the Philippines,'' said Nance. He was referring
to an incident last Sunday on Sipadan Island in Malaysia, where 21
people, including 10 foreigners, were kidnapped from a luxury
diving resort. Islamic rebels from the nearby southern Philippines
claimed responsibility for the abduction. An American couple from
Rochester, N.Y., managed to escape after they frustrated the
terrorists by refusing demands to swim out to the kidnappers' boat.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, tourists have become primary targets,
Nance said. So-called special interest travel, encompassing
adventure travel, eco-tourism and journeys to exotic locales, is
the fastest-growing segment of the $519 billion U.S. travel market,
according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model victim is no longer the U.S. government official, no
longer the corporate executive _ it's the first Western traveler
who's in sight when a kidnapper's goals need to be met,'' Nance
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nance's vocabulary brims with alarming terms _ hostage-taking,
for one _ that are seldom uttered by travel agencies. But a glance
at the travel warnings stacked up on a State Department Web site
(www.travel.state.gov) shows how trouble can intrude into an
itinerary with the urgency of a sudden dose of food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound. In March, two 19-year-old American women were
murdered in a beach resort in Costa Rica where, five months
earlier, two elderly Americans had been killed in a robbery. In
1999, rebels murdered eight foreigners _ four Britons, two
Americans and two New Zealanders _ among a group of tourists at
luxury camp sites in Bwindi National Park in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   In Algeria, ``U.S. citizens should not move anywhere in Algeria
unless accompanied by a known Algerian citizen,'' the State
Department said in a recent advisory. In Yemen, tribal clans have
kidnapped hundreds of foreigners, including the Polish ambassador,
over the last decade. American citizens were most recently
kidnapped there in January and October.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of countries like Yemen, if you're a tourist and you
happen to encounter that tribe that has a particular complaint that
day, they're going to say, `Hey, let's take him,''' said Nance, who
says he is amazed at how many people ignore the State Department's
``Travel Warning'' list.
</P>
<P>
   Nance's company, whose clients include organizations with
worldwide reach like the Peace Corps, teaches ways to avoid risk,
as well as survival skills to use when trouble does occur.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the courses designed for government and military
workers, and partly based on military survival and evasion training
techniques from the Vietnam War era, trainers pose as terrorists to
subject clients to a simulated ordeal of being abducted and held
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, isn't there an easier way to buy your way out of
potential trouble on the road? As a young comedian, Woody Allen
joked that he refused to join a gym to work on his self-defense
skills, opting instead to pay his body-building trainer ``to walk
me home at night.'' In fact, many top business people and some
leisure travelers now make their trips accompanied by travel
escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while we'll hear people say, `Oh, can we hire
someone to go to Africa with us?''' Nance said. ``But that's having
bodyguards, which is a very specific thing for people with very
specific amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Shuman, 29, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., calls himself a ``VIP
host.'' He said more and more people are hiring security guards to
accompany them _ even on domestic trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people at a certain level, like in these Internet
companies with a lot of money coming in really quickly _ people
flying in on their Gulfstreams and Citations _ having security can
be kind of a fashion statement,'' he said. ``Security looks cool,
almost like the Secret Service. But having security also can solve
a real problem. For one thing, it keeps them from getting bothered
when they're in a restaurant or a club.''

NEWS OF THE WEEK IN SUMMARY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monopoly Medicine
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's future? Split in two, if the government gets its
way. The Justice Department and states suing Microsoft told a
federal judge those are the appropriate remedies for a company the
court has ruled is a ``predatory'' monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal calls for Microsoft's Windows operating
system to be placed in one company, while the other company would
get the rest including the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet
and the MSN Internet service. There are also a smorgasbord of curbs
on Microsoft's conduct that would last three years. And the two
companies cannot get back together for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now in the lap of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
But appeals could take years. Microsoft calls the plan ``extreme,
reckless and not justified by the evidence in the case.'' Two of
the 19 states in the suit apparently agreed, declining to support
the breakup proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Never-Ending Argument
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate has lately been dominated by efforts to ban
``dilation and extraction,'' a late-term procedure that abortion
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Nebraska and two dozen
other states have banned it, but a Supreme Court argument last week
on the Nebraska law produced strong hints that all such bans may be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Most justices appeared to agree with a lower court that the ban
is so vaguely worded as to put doctors at risk of prosecution for
performing any sort of late-term abortions, even constitutionally
protected second-trimester ones, which occur well before the point
of fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   That Whining Sound Of Lost Money and Lives
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a study showing malaria is a major impediment to
African development, the World Bank announced that it would pledge
$500 million toward the eradication of the disease. The
announcement came in Abuja, Nigeria, at the first international
summit on the disease, which kills 3,000 Africans a day, most of
them children.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, done by
Harvard's Center for International Development and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, concluded that sub-Saharan
Africa's gross domestic product would now be $400 billion instead
of $300 billion if malaria had been eliminated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense is mosquito nets dipped in
insecticide, a fact which Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Center for
International Development, said might induce Americans to
contribute more money to cure the disease. ``Bed nets,'' he pointed
out, ``aren't going to end up in bank accounts in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Whispers
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered an overhaul of
security measures at the State Department after a laptop computer
containing sensitive files on arms proliferation vanished from her
intelligence bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers scheduled hearings into a series of
security lapses at the department, including the discovery of an

<TEXT>
<P>
   Monopoly Medicine
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's future? Split in two, if the government gets its
way. The Justice Department and states suing Microsoft told a
federal judge those are the appropriate remedies for a company the
court has ruled is a ``predatory'' monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The government proposal calls for Microsoft's Windows operating
system to be placed in one company, while the other company would
get the rest including the Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet
and the MSN Internet service. There are also a smorgasbord of curbs
on Microsoft's conduct that would last three years. And the two
companies cannot get back together for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is now in the lap of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
But appeals could take years. Microsoft calls the plan ``extreme,
reckless and not justified by the evidence in the case.'' Two of
the 19 states in the suit apparently agreed, declining to support
the breakup proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Never-Ending Argument
</P>
<P>
   The abortion debate has lately been dominated by efforts to ban
``dilation and extraction,'' a late-term procedure that abortion
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.'' Nebraska and two dozen
other states have banned it, but a Supreme Court argument last week
on the Nebraska law produced strong hints that all such bans may be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Most justices appeared to agree with a lower court that the ban
is so vaguely worded as to put doctors at risk of prosecution for
performing any sort of late-term abortions, even constitutionally
protected second-trimester ones, which occur well before the point
of fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   That Whining Sound Of Lost Money and Lives
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a study showing malaria is a major impediment to
African development, the World Bank announced that it would pledge
$500 million toward the eradication of the disease. The
announcement came in Abuja, Nigeria, at the first international
summit on the disease, which kills 3,000 Africans a day, most of
them children.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 27 African economies from 1965 to 1990, done by
Harvard's Center for International Development and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, concluded that sub-Saharan
Africa's gross domestic product would now be $400 billion instead
of $300 billion if malaria had been eliminated in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The first line of defense is mosquito nets dipped in
insecticide, a fact which Jeffrey Sachs of the Harvard Center for
International Development, said might induce Americans to
contribute more money to cure the disease. ``Bed nets,'' he pointed
out, ``aren't going to end up in bank accounts in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Whispers
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered an overhaul of
security measures at the State Department after a laptop computer
containing sensitive files on arms proliferation vanished from her
intelligence bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers scheduled hearings into a series of
security lapses at the department, including the discovery of an
eavesdropping device in a conference room _ which resulted in the
expulsion of a Russian diplomat _ and the 1998 theft of documents
by a man in a tweed coat within view of Albright's office.

   At Long Last, Gene Therapy
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of hype and dashed hopes, after more than 4,000
patients with more than a dozen diseases were treated
unsuccessfully in hundreds of studies, gene therapy has finally
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in France reported that they inserted new genes into
cells of three babies with a rare genetic disease that prevents
them from growing immune systems. Without treatment, the babies
would be killed by microorganisms that ordinarily pose no threat.
With gene therapy, the babies developed normal immune systems and
went home from the hospital to live openly in the microbe-laden
world.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin for Nasdaq?
</P>
<P>
   To economists, financial markets are efficient price discovery
mechanisms. But after watching the Nasdaq stock market soar and
plunge, then plunge and soar during the month of April, investors
and the general public may be wondering if the folks who bought and
sold technology stocks knew what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 10 biggest one-day gains in Nasdaq history came
during April. So did four of its biggest one-day declines. In the
19 days it was open during April (markets were closed April 21 in
observance of Good Friday), the Nasdaq lost 1 percent or more of
its value 11 times, according to Birinyi &AMP; Associates, a stock
market research firm. It rose more than 2 percent seven times. The
selloffs were more severe than the rallies: For the month, the
Nasdaq fell by more than 15 percent, even after rising 6 percent
for the week that ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Big Decision
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race was thrown for a loop, as Rudolph
Giuliani, the mayor of New York and presumptive Republican nominee,
announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The
disease, Giuliani said, was caught in its earliest stages, when,
medical professionals noted, chances for a cure are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's announcement stirred speculation that he would sit
out the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but the mayor said he
would put discussion about his political future on hold until he
and his doctors had decided on the best course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Killers From Outer Space
</P>
<P>
   A killer rock from outer space is a new suspect in the greatest
murder mystery of all time, a mass extinction a quarter-billion
years ago that wiped out most animal species on earth, including
trilobites, the three-lobed predators that once ruled the seas.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in the April 15 issue of Earth and Planetary Science
Letters announced the discovery in Australia of a previously
unknown crater about 75 miles wide, one of the largest ever found.
Its dating, while imprecise, tentatively ties it to the sudden
disappearance, 247 million years ago, of trilobites, other marine
invertebrates and early reptiles. The demise of the dinosaurs 65
million years ago has also been linked to the collision of a huge
cosmic object with Earth, so all chicken littles should start
scanning the skies with renewed anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The Universe's Baby Steps
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, astronomers have taken clear pictures of the
infant universe. To make the pictures, a balloon-borne telescope
called Boomerang captured traces of radiation emitted from the
roiling gases of the cosmos some 13 billion years ago, when it was
a mere 300,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cloudy shapes in the pictures confirmed cosmology's
leading theory: that the universe was born in a fiery explosion.
But they did not reveal other features that must have existed if
the theory, called inflation, is correct. Scientists are waiting
for better pictures and furiously recalculating.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire at the National Zoo
</P>
<P>
   A gunman opened fire Monday at the Washington's 111-year-old
National Zoo, wounding seven children, one critically. Police
arrested Antoine Jones, 16, on Tuesday and are holding him without
bail. Prosecutors said they intend to try him as an adult on
attempted murder charges. If found guilty, he could face life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were not certain what provoked the shootings at
one of Washington's most popular tourist attractions, but community
leaders noted a pattern of violence against schoolchildren in the
District of Columbia, at least 17 of whom have been killed this
school year.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity at the Ballpark
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball players aren't known for political
activism, but the Elian Gonzalez case spurred more than a dozen
players and coaches to sit out games last Tuesday, in support of a
work stoppage by Cuban-Americans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez and coach Cookie Rojas, both
Cuban-born, left Shea Stadium before the Mets' game with the
Cincinnati Reds, while Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez, a Cuban
defector, wore street clothes in the dugout at Yankee Stadium. Reds
outfielder Alex Ochoa, whose parents are Cuban, played because his
team was riddled by injuries. ``They need me to play.'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A blow to demagogues' rights
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Constitution has just ducked another bullet, but beware the
ricochet. This being a big-time election year, the Constitution
remains in danger from the politicians who are sworn to uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   The near miss this time was an amendment championing so-called
victims' rights. The amendment was pulled by its sponsors at the
last minute when they found putative supporters jumping ship.
Enough senators had figured out that the amendment was such an
unholy mess that even the temptation of easy demagoguery couldn't
keep them aboard.
</P>
<P>
   You can't be sure this monster won't walk again, however. Its
authors have retired only to the cloakroom to work on their
skittish confreres out of public sight.
</P>
<P>
   There's a perfectly good case for legislatively enumerating some
rights for crime victims _ rights, for instance, to be notified of
trials and probation hearings, to be told a prisoner release is
imminent and more.
</P>
<P>
   But 47 states already have constitutional provisions or
legislation that either explicitly or in effect sets out rights for
crime victims. (Who are, in any event, the implied concern of the
criminal justice system from the get-go.)
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, muddle the Constitution with gratuitous complications
whose broad implications would be uncertain and whose applications
would ignite years of contentious litigation?
</P>
<P>
   You almost have to feel sorry for the politicians who have been
working the law-and-order hustle for decades. Crime has been
falling sharply for several years. We have a bigger proportion of
our people in jails and prisons than any other nation except
Russia, that model of social enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, getting hard to sell criminals to the
electorate, so hawking victims' rights is the new product from the
same old pitchmen.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the states aren't adequately funding their
victim programs. If so, then the federal remedy, if any is called
for, would be matching grants to incite more statehouse effort.
There's no call to gum up the Constitution over this evolving and
unstable area of law.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the ineptness of the amendment that it is
wordier than the whole Bill of Rights _ a rhetorical thicket oddly
dangerous to prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment could allow angry or impatient victims to demand
overwrought charges and trials before cases are well-prepared. It
could block plea-bargains in favor of hopeless trials. Where there
are multiple victims, their contrary demands could produce wildly
disparate prosecutions for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Constitution has been attacked by
showboating pols out to force prayer into public schools, deny
women abortions, require balanced budgets, limit elected terms and
criminalize flag-burners. April alone saw further sallies at the
Constitution to require super-majorities for tax increases and to
exempt campaign funding reforms from free-speech considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, repeatedly menaced, could use a few victim's
rights itself.

 &HT;    CHINA INVITES RIGHTS ACTIVIST IN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL PRISONERS
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until noon EST, Mon., May 1, 2000.

 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just a few weeks before Congress is to vote on
permanent normal trade relations with China, Beijing has for the
first time invited an American non-profit organization for a visit
to discuss the plight of political prisoners in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although it suspended official dialogue with the United States
on human rights last year after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia, in late March China quietly resumed responding to
the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation's requests for
information on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director John Kamm has made more than 50 visits to
Beijing over the past 10 years to ask officials about prisoners of
conscience, but for the first time, he said, China has given him a
formal invitation to do so. An April 29 fax from the Ministry of
Justice invited him to Beijing May 18-20 for an ``exchange of
views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it,'' Kamm said in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C., where he is to testify Wednesday
before the House Ways and Means Committee urging the normalization
of trade ties with China. ``In some respects it's something I've
been waiting 10 years for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said Chinese also confirmed in the letter that two
laborers, Chen Gang and Zhang Jingsheng, who took part in
pro-democracy demonstrations 11 years ago are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said the explained their prison terms and said when both are
due to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Justice letter was the first direct comment from
the government on the two men's cases since they were jailed _
along with many others _ for demonstrations centered on Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said the letter explained that Chen and Zhang were arrested
in separate incidents in southern Hunan province in 1989 and that
both men are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Kamm, a businessman who lived in Hong Kong for 23
years before moving to San Francisco, has used a
non-confrontational approach to ask the Ministry of Justice for
information on hundreds of political prisoners, then sought to meet
with officials in Beijing. Sometimes he was rebuffed. Other times,
they responded with detailed accounting of a prisoners' status.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with grants from the Smith Richardson Foundation and
the International Republican Institute, Kamm created the Dui Hua
Foundation, which means ``dialogue'' in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Other human rights groups praised Kamm's work but suggested that
Beijing's timing, so close to the controversial trade vote in
Congress _ a major hurdle to membership in the World Trade
Organization _ made its motives suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John would be the first to say that this is certainly
connected to the fact that he has good relations with members of
Congress, and this is likely to be seen positively over there,''
said Sophia Woodman, a Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Human
Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although she thought Kamm's trip would be a positive step, she
said it was more important for the Chinese government to have a
dialogue with human rights activists in its own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they raise their voices and ask to engage with the
government in a peaceful manner, what happens is they get
arrested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said he knows China's communist government may be willing
to make some concessions for PNTR but said the United States can
use that to its own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a developing country, a poor country. They're always
going to want something,'' he said. ``We need to figure out how can
we use that to prompt them in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his upcoming visit, Kamm intends to submit a new list of 51
prisoners. To come up with the names, Kamm, along with three
researchers in Hong Kong, combs through libraries, bookstores and
other publicly available sources. They focus on four crimes:
endangering the social order; endangering state security; revealing
state secrets and counterrevolution; which was abolished in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, Kamm said he had uncovered about 1000
names, more than three-quarters of which were previously unknown by
anyone outside China. Prisoners include labor and democracy
activists, as well as Christian evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told Kamm at the end of 1997 that China has more than
1,900 prisoners convicted of counter-revolution. He estimated less
than one-fifth are known to foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's considered mundane and often denigrated, what I do, the
prisoner list business,'' said Kamm.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the lists have had an effect. Of 100 names he
submitted in 1995, he has received information on 47. Of those, 31
were in prison at the time, but 17 have since been released on
parole or had their sentence reduced.

 &HT;    CHINA INVITES RIGHTS ACTIVIST IN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL PRISONERS

<P>
   BEIJING _ Just a few weeks before Congress is to vote on
permanent normal trade relations with China, Beijing has for the
first time invited an American non-profit organization for a visit
to discuss the plight of political prisoners in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although it suspended official dialogue with the United States
on human rights last year after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia, in late March China quietly resumed responding to
the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation's requests for
information on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director John Kamm has made more than 50 visits to
Beijing over the past 10 years to ask officials about prisoners of
conscience, but for the first time, he said, China has given him a
formal invitation to do so. An April 29 fax from the Ministry of
Justice invited him to Beijing May 18-20 for an ``exchange of
views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it,'' Kamm said in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C., where he is to testify Wednesday
before the House Ways and Means Committee urging the normalization
of trade ties with China. ``In some respects it's something I've
been waiting 10 years for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said Chinese also confirmed in the letter that two
laborers, Chen Gang and Zhang Jingsheng, who took part in
pro-democracy demonstrations 11 years ago are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said the explained their prison terms and said when both are
due to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Justice letter was the first direct comment from
the government on the two men's cases since they were jailed _
along with many others _ for demonstrations centered on Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said the letter explained that Chen and Zhang were arrested
in separate incidents in southern Hunan province in 1989 and that
both men are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Kamm, a businessman who lived in Hong Kong for 23
years before moving to San Francisco, has used a
non-confrontational approach to ask the Ministry of Justice for
information on hundreds of political prisoners, then sought to meet
with officials in Beijing. Sometimes he was rebuffed. Other times,
they responded with detailed accounting of a prisoners' status.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with grants from the Smith Richardson Foundation and
the International Republican Institute, Kamm created the Dui Hua
Foundation, which means ``dialogue'' in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Other human rights groups praised Kamm's work but suggested that
Beijing's timing, so close to the controversial trade vote in
Congress _ a major hurdle to membership in the World Trade
Organization _ made its motives suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John would be the first to say that this is certainly
connected to the fact that he has good relations with members of
Congress, and this is likely to be seen positively over there,''
said Sophia Woodman, a Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Human
Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although she thought Kamm's trip would be a positive step, she
said it was more important for the Chinese government to have a
dialogue with human rights activists in its own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they raise their voices and ask to engage with the
government in a peaceful manner, what happens is they get
arrested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said he knows China's communist government may be willing
to make some concessions for PNTR but said the United States can
use that to its own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a developing country, a poor country. They're always
going to want something,'' he said. ``We need to figure out how can
we use that to prompt them in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his upcoming visit, Kamm intends to submit a new list of 51
prisoners. To come up with the names, Kamm, along with three
researchers in Hong Kong, combs through libraries, bookstores and
other publicly available sources. They focus on four crimes:
endangering the social order; endangering state security; revealing
state secrets and counterrevolution; which was abolished in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, Kamm said he had uncovered about 1000
names, more than three-quarters of which were previously unknown by
anyone outside China. Prisoners include labor and democracy
activists, as well as Christian evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told Kamm at the end of 1997 that China has more than
1,900 prisoners convicted of counter-revolution. He estimated less
than one-fifth are known to foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's considered mundane and often denigrated, what I do, the
prisoner list business,'' said Kamm.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the lists have had an effect. Of 100 names he
submitted in 1995, he has received information on 47. Of those, 31
were in prison at the time, but 17 have since been released on
parole or had their sentence reduced.

 By JEFF D. VITUCCI and HILLARY LEON  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Hispanics are fast becoming an online economic power.
 &HT;    A recent Hispanic Business/Zogby International poll found that
almost one-half (49 percent) of Hispanics have made an online
purchase in the last three months, compared to 34.7 percent of
Anglos, 31.3 percent of African Americans and 14.9 percent of
Asians. The same poll found that Hispanics are more likely to spend
larger amounts on the Web compared to other groups. About 38
percent of Hispanics surveyed spent more than $100 in the past
three months, compared to 16 percent of Anglos, 11 percent of
Asians and 6 percent of African Americans.
 &HT;    In a study of 2,000 Internet-ready U.S. Hispanics, commissioned
by Espanol.com, 76 percent of respondents reported having made
purchases online, with 62 percent having done so in the last 12
months. The study found that average purchases range from
approximately $325 to $550 per year.
 &HT;    In terms of specific purchases, 65 percent of Hispanics surveyed
reported buying software upgrades, 52 percent purchased CDs and
music tapes and 48 percent purchased books and magazines.
 &HT;    The trend may be attributable in part to an increased effort on
the part of online retailers to market specifically to Hispanics,
says David Morse of Cultural Access Group, a marketing consulting
firm.
 &HT;    ``Presently, there is a concentrated effort to market to ethnic
groups. The sudden interest in the Hispanic market stems from the
growth in their population and in their per capita income,'' Morse
said.
 &HT;    Corresponding increases in computer ownership and Internet
access also have helped fuel Hispanics' embrace of e-commerce.
According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce National
Telecommunications and Information Administration study, about 26
percent of Hispanic households in the United States owned a
computer in 1998. The percentage constitutes a doubling of computer
ownership among Hispanic households from four years earlier.
 &HT;    The Department of Commerce reports that the disparity between
the computer ownership rate among Hispanics and that of Anglos _
roughly a 2 to 1 ratio _ largely disappears at higher income
levels. For example, while about 80 percent of all households with
an annual income greater than $75,000 own a computer, the figure
drops only slightly, to about 75 percent, for similarly affluent
Hispanic households.
 &HT;    Because the Internet is relatively new, historic data on
Internet use are lacking. However, according to the Department of
Commerce study, approximately 12.6 percent of Hispanic households
use the Internet, compared to 11.2 percent of African American and
29.8 percent of Anglo households. The study indicates that 72.5
percent of Hispanics who are online are using the Internet for
e-mail, 60.5 percent for information searches, 43.5 percent for
taking courses, 17.4 percent for job searches and 28.3 percent for
other purposes.
 &HT;    The Tomds Rivera Policy Institute put Hispanic Internet
connectivity at 15 percent, and other studies suggest the rate is
even higher.
 &HT;    While the connectivity rate in the Hispanic community is
comparatively low, those who are online are purchasing at a higher
level than that for the overall population. One reason may be the
Hispanic tradition of bargain-hunting.
 &HT;    ``Latinos are very price-conscious, and the best deals are
online. We like a bargain,'' says Yaz Colon, co-founder and chief
marketing and merchandising officer at Espanol.com.
 &HT;    A contributing factor may be the Internets relative
affordability as a communications tool, especially among Hispanics
with relatives in Latin America.
 &HT;    'We are finding that Hispanics like an international focus. They
want to read, chat and retrieve information from their hometowns,''
Morse said.
 &HT;    Perhaps more importantly, Hispanics do not appear to be afraid
to use Internet technology. According to the U.S. Department of
Commerce study, 31.6 percent of Hispanics are not concerned about
Internet confidentiality, compared to almost 23 percent of Anglos,
28.4 percent of African Americans and 24 percent of Asians.
 &HT;    ``Non-Latinos prefer to surf the Web on their own, while Latinos
expect a lot in customer service, including online chat instant
help, and toll-free numbers. Latinos value communication, and we
give them every avenue to do so,'' Colon said.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    ``Orwellian.'' ``Kafkaesque.'' Both terms describe a nightmarish
immigration case being litigated in Florida.
 &HT;    Imagine being in your home eating breakfast with your family,
when U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities charge
in, handcuff you in front of your wife and children and drag you
off to an unspecified location _ all without charging you with a
crime.
 &HT;    Such an arrest occurred in Tampa on May 19, 1997. The victim,
Palestinian refugee Mazen Al-Najjar, then a 40-year-old professor
at the University of South Florida in Tampa, has been in an INS
holding facility since he was grabbed.
 &HT;    Although he has not been charged with a crime, Al-Najjar has
been denied bail based on ``secret evidence'' that supposedly
connects him with Palestine Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist
organization in the Middle East.
 &HT;    His troubles began in 1995 after newspaper articles suggested
that the World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), a USF think
tank that he managed, was a fundraising front for terrorists.
Matters worsened after the head of Islamic Jihad was shot to death
in the Mideast.
 &HT;    Two days later, another Tampa Muslim, Ramadan Shallah, who had
been an instructor at USF and a member of WISE, assumed leadership
of Islamic Jihad.
 &HT;    For area anti-Muslim forces, Shallah's new post confirmed
suspicions that WISE was dangerous and prompted the university to
officially investigate the group. Authorities had expected to
uncover an active terrorist cell with a money trail leading from
Tampa to Gaza City and the West Bank. But investigators found no
such evidence.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Al-Najjar remains in jail to this day, not
formally charged. He is being held under a provision of the
Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which
Congress enacted in response to the World Trade Center and Oklahoma
City bombings.
 &HT;    Implemented to protect American citizens, the measure has had
the unintended consequence of undermining some of the nation's most
cherished constitutional protections.
 &HT;    The merits of Al-Najjar's case aside, the anti-terrorism law
lets the government use informant testimony or other forms of
secret evidence to imprison and deport legal immigrants suspected
of terrorism without letting the suspects cross-examine their
excusers.
 &HT;    The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that aliens have the same
rights of due process that thieves, drug traffickers and murderers
enjoy. If the INS has incriminating evidence against Al-Najjar, he
has a constitutional right to see it.
 &HT;    The Sixth Amendment states: ``In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an
impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall
have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and the cause
of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him;
to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.''
 &HT;    Obviously, U.S. citizens should expect the government to take
all reasonable care to protect them from terrorism, both foreign
and domestic. But that same government also has a duty to protect
the constitutional rights of everyone _ even those in the minority
whose ideas and religions the majority rejects.
 &HT;    Only last week was Al-Najjar granted an appearance in a Miami
federal court to ask for his freedom on constitutional grounds. His
attorneys argued that their client's right to due process was
violated. Judge Joan A. Lenard said she would decide upon further
review.
 &HT;    To add insult to injury, witnesses say, Al-Najjar's wife,
children and supporters were treated harshly by federal agents and
the judge. When, for example, the 11-year-old daughter took her
seat and lowered her face into her hands, an officer yelled, ``Put
your head up.''
 &HT;    Al-Najjar was forced to wear the same unwashed clothes he wore
upon arrest three years ago. He could speak to his attorneys for
only a few minutes _ through a blurred glass partition. He was
awakened at 1 a.m. in Bradenton for a hearing scheduled for 4 p.m.
in Miami, a flight that took one hour.
 &HT;    In court, he appeared dirty and tired. In other words, federal
authorities made the man look every bit the terrorist they are
painting him to be.
 &HT;    If evidence indicates that Al-Najjar has terrorist connections,
he should be punished appropriately. If no such evidence exists,
however, he should be released.

 By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI)  
 &HT;    The people of America are usually pretty fastidious about
celebrating the dates of important historical happenings. One such
event occurred in South Dakota 10 years ago, but one would never
know it happened if one waited for the mainstream media to bring it
up.
 &HT;    In 1989, Gov. George Mickelson (R-S.D.) came to my newspaper,
The Lakota Nation Journal, to cut the ribbon for the grand opening
of our new building in Rapid City. He gave a speech to my employees
and some friends who had come to help celebrate the occasion.
 &HT;    In his speech, Mickelson said that 40 years ago when he was
about 12 years old, he asked his father, who happened to be
governor of South Dakota at the time, about the most difficult
thing he had to contend with as governor. His father replied, ``The
bad relationship between Indians and whites.''
 &HT;    I took this message to heart. The year 1990 was to be the 100th
anniversary of the Massacre at Wounded Knee, a very infamous time
in American history. I wrote a column and suggested to the governor
that Indians and whites come together in 1990. I wrote that, just
as the Lakota planned a ``Wiping Away the Tears'' ceremony on Dec.
29, 1990, the date of the massacre, perhaps the whites and Indians
could use this special year and special ceremony to do likewise and
make it a Year of Reconciliation.
 &HT;    In a special editorial to my newspaper he wrote that he would do
everything in his power to see it happen. He did make it happen. A
proclamation was passed, making 1990 ``The Year of
Reconciliation.'' And more than that, he did something no other
state in the union would dare attempt: He got the state legislators
to pass a bill making Oct. 12 _ Columbus Day in the rest of America
_ Native American Day in South Dakota.
 &HT;    Ten years later, South Dakota is the only state in the union
that celebrates Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day.
 &HT;    Mickelson didn't just talk the talk, he walked the walk. He
actively set out to begin the dialogue between Indians and whites.
Unless you've lived in South Dakota (or any of the states with
large Indian populations), it would be hard for you to understand
the anger and bitterness that exists between the races.
 &HT;    Recently, I had lunch with a representative of a South Dakota
senator who had just paid a visit to Corson County and was shocked
at the hatred the white population of that county displayed against
the Lakota (Sioux) people. She was so taken aback at the vocal
abuse heaped upon the Lakota that she nearly resigned from her job.
 &HT;    One could almost feel the change happening in South Dakota
during the Year of Reconciliation. Indians and whites were talking.
Both races were ready to sit and talk about the good, the bad and
the ugly in this state.
 &HT;    And then a terrible thing happened. Mickelson died in a plane
crash. With him died the Year, and the Century, of Reconciliation.
 &HT;    It is such a sad thing to not only lose a great governor, but to
see the tiny window he had opened slammed shut after his death.
 &HT;    It has been 10 years since the Year of Reconciliation became an
active proclamation in South Dakota. And yet, the silence about it
is deafening. No one in the media wants to bring it up. It was an
historic time when truly great things were happening and when peace
could have come between the races.
 &HT;    The American people are usually overzealous about celebrating
anniversaries, but this one is now four months old and not one item
has appeared in newspapers or on television in South Dakota. Is it
because we now have a governor who would just as soon keep this
anniversary in the closet?
 &HT;    A few weeks ago, Gov. Bill Janklow (R-S.D.) trashed the Civil
Rights Commission's Report on racism in South Dakota as
``garbage,'' and it is this hostile and primitive attitude that
feeds the proponents of racism here. Many covert racists are only
too eager to follow the governor's lead.
 &HT;    But all of that aside, why has there been no white leader in
South Dakota willing to pick up the torch of reconciliation once
held high by Mickelson? The Indians have talked about it and
wondered, but it requires strong leadership on the other side of
the fence.
 &HT;    The people of South Dakota, white and red, lost a tremendous
opportunity to lead America out of the depths of racism by serving
as an example of how people can come together for positive change.
Perhaps 1990 was not the year, and perhaps the races were not ready
to come to the table as friends. The years since would surely point
to that as racism continues to grow and fester.

said.
 &HT;    Corresponding increases in computer ownership and Internet
access also have helped fuel Hispanics' embrace of e-commerce.
According to a recent U.S. Department of Commerce National
Telecommunications and Information Administration study, about 26
percent of Hispanic households in the United States owned a
computer in 1998. The percentage constitutes a doubling of computer
ownership among Hispanic households from four years earlier.
 &HT;    The Department of Commerce reports that the disparity between
the computer ownership rate among Hispanics and that of Anglos _
roughly a 2 to 1 ratio _ largely disappears at higher income
levels. For example, while about 80 percent of all households with
an annual income greater than $75,000 own a computer, the figure
drops only slightly, to about 75 percent, for similarly affluent
Hispanic households.
 &HT;    Because the Internet is relatively new, historic data on
Internet use are lacking. However, according to the Department of
Commerce study, approximately 12.6 percent of Hispanic households
use the Internet, compared to 11.2 percent of African American and
29.8 percent of Anglo households. The study indicates that 72.5
percent of Hispanics who are online are using the Internet for
e-mail, 60.5 percent for information searches, 43.5 percent for
taking courses, 17.4 percent for job searches and 28.3 percent for
other purposes.
 &HT;    The Tomds Rivera Policy Institute put Hispanic Internet
connectivity at 15 percent, and other studies suggest the rate is
even higher.
 &HT;    While the connectivity rate in the Hispanic community is
comparatively low, those who are online are purchasing at a higher
level than that for the overall population. One reason may be the
Hispanic tradition of bargain-hunting.
 &HT;    ``Latinos are very price-conscious, and the best deals are
online. We like a bargain,'' says Yaz Colon, co-founder and chief
marketing and merchandising officer at Espanol.com.
 &HT;    A contributing factor may be the Internets relative
affordability as a communications tool, especially among Hispanics
with relatives in Latin America.
 &HT;    'We are finding that Hispanics like an international focus. They
want to read, chat and retrieve information from their hometowns,''
Morse said.
 &HT;    Perhaps more importantly, Hispanics do not appear to be afraid
to use Internet technology. According to the U.S. Department of
Commerce study, 31.6 percent of Hispanics are not concerned about
Internet confidentiality, compared to almost 23 percent of Anglos,
28.4 percent of African Americans and 24 percent of Asians.
 &HT;    ``Non-Latinos prefer to surf the Web on their own, while Latinos
expect a lot in customer service, including online chat instant
help, and toll-free numbers. Latinos value communication, and we
give them every avenue to do so,'' Colon said.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    ``Orwellian.'' ``Kafkaesque.'' Both terms describe a nightmarish
immigration case being litigated in Florida.
 &HT;    Imagine being in your home eating breakfast with your family,
when U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities charge
in, handcuff you in front of your wife and children and drag you
off to an unspecified location _ all without charging you with a
crime.
 &HT;    Such an arrest occurred in Tampa on May 19, 1997. The victim,
Palestinian refugee Mazen Al-Najjar, then a 40-year-old professor
at the University of South Florida in Tampa, has been in an INS
holding facility since he was grabbed.
 &HT;    Although he has not been charged with a crime, Al-Najjar has
been denied bail based on ``secret evidence'' that supposedly
connects him with Palestine Islamic Jihad, a notorious terrorist
organization in the Middle East.
 &HT;    His troubles began in 1995 after newspaper articles suggested
that the World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), a USF think
tank that he managed, was a fundraising front for terrorists.
Matters worsened after the head of Islamic Jihad was shot to death
in the Mideast.
 &HT;    Two days later, another Tampa Muslim, Ramadan Shallah, who had
been an instructor at USF and a member of WISE, assumed leadership
of Islamic Jihad.
 &HT;    For area anti-Muslim forces, Shallah's new post confirmed
suspicions that WISE was dangerous and prompted the university to
officially investigate the group. Authorities had expected to
uncover an active terrorist cell with a money trail leading from
Tampa to Gaza City and the West Bank. But investigators found no
such evidence.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Al-Najjar remains in jail to this day, not
formally charged. He is being held under a provision of the
Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which
Congress enacted in response to the World Trade Center and Oklahoma
City bombings.
 &HT;    Implemented to protect American citizens, the measure has had
the unintended consequence of undermining some of the nation's most
cherished constitutional protections.
 &HT;    The merits of Al-Najjar's case aside, the anti-terrorism law
lets the government use informant testimony or other forms of
secret evidence to imprison and deport legal immigrants suspected
of terrorism without letting the suspects cross-examine their
excusers.
 &HT;    The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that aliens have the same
rights of due process that thieves, drug traffickers and murderers
enjoy. If the INS has incriminating evidence against Al-Najjar, he
has a constitutional right to see it.
 &HT;    The Sixth Amendment states: ``In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an
impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall
have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and the cause
of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him;
to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,
and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.''
 &HT;    Obviously, U.S. citizens should expect the government to take
all reasonable care to protect them from terrorism, both foreign
and domestic. But that same government also has a duty to protect
the constitutional rights of everyone _ even those in the minority
whose ideas and religions the majority rejects.
 &HT;    Only last week was Al-Najjar granted an appearance in a Miami
federal court to ask for his freedom on constitutional grounds. His
attorneys argued that their client's right to due process was
violated. Judge Joan A. Lenard said she would decide upon further
review.
 &HT;    To add insult to injury, witnesses say, Al-Najjar's wife,
children and supporters were treated harshly by federal agents and
the judge. When, for example, the 11-year-old daughter took her
seat and lowered her face into her hands, an officer yelled, ``Put
your head up.''
 &HT;    Al-Najjar was forced to wear the same unwashed clothes he wore
upon arrest three years ago. He could speak to his attorneys for
only a few minutes _ through a blurred glass partition. He was
awakened at 1 a.m. in Bradenton for a hearing scheduled for 4 p.m.
in Miami, a flight that took one hour.
 &HT;    In court, he appeared dirty and tired. In other words, federal
authorities made the man look every bit the terrorist they are
painting him to be.
 &HT;    If evidence indicates that Al-Najjar has terrorist connections,
he should be punished appropriately. If no such evidence exists,
however, he should be released.

 By TIM GIAGO (NANWICA KCIJI)  
 &HT;    The people of America are usually pretty fastidious about
celebrating the dates of important historical happenings. One such
event occurred in South Dakota 10 years ago, but one would never
know it happened if one waited for the mainstream media to bring it
up.
 &HT;    In 1989, Gov. George Mickelson (R-S.D.) came to my newspaper,
The Lakota Nation Journal, to cut the ribbon for the grand opening
of our new building in Rapid City. He gave a speech to my employees
and some friends who had come to help celebrate the occasion.
 &HT;    In his speech, Mickelson said that 40 years ago when he was
about 12 years old, he asked his father, who happened to be
governor of South Dakota at the time, about the most difficult
thing he had to contend with as governor. His father replied, ``The
bad relationship between Indians and whites.''
 &HT;    I took this message to heart. The year 1990 was to be the 100th
anniversary of the Massacre at Wounded Knee, a very infamous time
in American history. I wrote a column and suggested to the governor
that Indians and whites come together in 1990. I wrote that, just
as the Lakota planned a ``Wiping Away the Tears'' ceremony on Dec.
29, 1990, the date of the massacre, perhaps the whites and Indians
could use this special year and special ceremony to do likewise and
make it a Year of Reconciliation.
 &HT;    In a special editorial to my newspaper he wrote that he would do
everything in his power to see it happen. He did make it happen. A
proclamation was passed, making 1990 ``The Year of
Reconciliation.'' And more than that, he did something no other
state in the union would dare attempt: He got the state legislators
to pass a bill making Oct. 12 _ Columbus Day in the rest of America
_ Native American Day in South Dakota.
 &HT;    Ten years later, South Dakota is the only state in the union
that celebrates Native American Day in lieu of Columbus Day.
 &HT;    Mickelson didn't just talk the talk, he walked the walk. He
actively set out to begin the dialogue between Indians and whites.
Unless you've lived in South Dakota (or any of the states with
large Indian populations), it would be hard for you to understand
the anger and bitterness that exists between the races.
 &HT;    Recently, I had lunch with a representative of a South Dakota
senator who had just paid a visit to Corson County and was shocked
at the hatred the white population of that county displayed against
the Lakota (Sioux) people. She was so taken aback at the vocal
abuse heaped upon the Lakota that she nearly resigned from her job.
 &HT;    One could almost feel the change happening in South Dakota
during the Year of Reconciliation. Indians and whites were talking.
Both races were ready to sit and talk about the good, the bad and
the ugly in this state.
 &HT;    And then a terrible thing happened. Mickelson died in a plane
crash. With him died the Year, and the Century, of Reconciliation.
 &HT;    It is such a sad thing to not only lose a great governor, but to
see the tiny window he had opened slammed shut after his death.
 &HT;    It has been 10 years since the Year of Reconciliation became an
active proclamation in South Dakota. And yet, the silence about it
is deafening. No one in the media wants to bring it up. It was an
historic time when truly great things were happening and when peace
could have come between the races.
 &HT;    The American people are usually overzealous about celebrating
anniversaries, but this one is now four months old and not one item
has appeared in newspapers or on television in South Dakota. Is it
because we now have a governor who would just as soon keep this
anniversary in the closet?
 &HT;    A few weeks ago, Gov. Bill Janklow (R-S.D.) trashed the Civil
Rights Commission's Report on racism in South Dakota as
``garbage,'' and it is this hostile and primitive attitude that
feeds the proponents of racism here. Many covert racists are only
too eager to follow the governor's lead.
 &HT;    But all of that aside, why has there been no white leader in
South Dakota willing to pick up the torch of reconciliation once
held high by Mickelson? The Indians have talked about it and
wondered, but it requires strong leadership on the other side of
the fence.
 &HT;    The people of South Dakota, white and red, lost a tremendous
opportunity to lead America out of the depths of racism by serving
as an example of how people can come together for positive change.
Perhaps 1990 was not the year, and perhaps the races were not ready
to come to the table as friends. The years since would surely point
to that as racism continues to grow and fester.

WEB SITES TARGET WOMEN SURFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Targeting the influx of women who surf the Internet, a growing
number of Web sites promise to save busy mothers and career women
time and money, with one-stop shopping for everything from birth
control pills to housewarming gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Women make up about 50 percent of Internet users, and the number
of women online jumped 32 percent between February 1999 and
December 1999, according to a Nielsen report released this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Web sites are looking to grab market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women really are just the fastest-growing segment of
e-commerce shoppers and users,'' said Melinda Halpert, senior vice
president of marketing for the Women's Consumer Network in
Washington, D.C. It launched a site about a year ago to help busy
women find good values on everything from disability insurance to
child care to new cars.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, including WCN's, charge a membership fee; others
offer free registration. But they all say it's worth the effort to
sign up, considering the discounts members enjoy and the time they
can save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many busy working women are trying to juggle so many
responsibilities for our homes, our jobs, our life,'' Halpert said.
``We're helping to save time in the kind of primary comparison
shopping that a lot of women do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sites even promise to deliver dry cleaning, stamps,
flowers, and United Parcel Service packages, as well as the
groceries that online supermarket delivery services have already
carved out as a niche.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web pages make passing references to men, but they
clearly focus on women as the ones in the household who are pressed
for time and responsible for shopping for everything from the
perfect birthday gift to designer clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the sites acknowledge that women want to do more than just
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Some provide advice about relationships, health, and beauty;
others offer a virtual community in the form of a message board or
chat room. And some offer links to information about the
presidential campaign and financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, their bread and butter is still helping women to
shop. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --www.womensconsumer.net _ For $21.95 a year, you get discounts
on what the Women's Consumer Network has found to be the best of
everything, from birth control pills to debt-collection services
for chasing alimony and child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises unbiased research, group buying power, and
exclusive discounts, although the network receives commissions from
the companies, based on members' use of the recommended services or
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company, no provider can pay for our endorsement up
front,'' Halpert said. A company is not approached unless it meets
the network's standards for value, and a recommendation is not
based on how much commission a company is willing to pay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of products and services WCN compares before
making a recommendation: Banking services, legal services available
by telephone, health and disability insurance, Internet service
providers, emergency cellular phone service, child care, and gift
basket delivery services.
</P>
<P>
   The site says it can save members hundreds, if not thousands, of
dollars on such major purchases as a car.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, membership also includes an e-mail newsletter, a
``Customer Care'' gift every month, and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   --www.iVillage.com _ While the focus of this site, subtitled
``The Women's Network,'' is ``busy women sharing solutions and
advice,'' it also lets them shop for baby doll dresses at
gapkids.com and beauty supplies at gloss.com.
</P>
<P>
   Free membership as an ``iVillager'' allows women access to
bargains, a personal shopper to find the perfect gift, and a
newsletter with ideas for kids' gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Members can create online shopping lists to keep track of all of
those gift ideas for birthdays, baby showers, anniversaries, and
other special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   At ``Shopping Central,'' women can link to reviews of Web stores
that sell everything from knitting supplies to greeting cards; find
sales in their local areas by designer, store, or type of
merchandise; and search for items by such topics as art and
collectibles, astrology, baby goods, and career women.
</P>
<P>
   The Web store reviews are notable because they say whether the
businesses are owned by women.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're really pressed for time, you can link to a
selection of ``gifts you can get in a hurry,'' including gift
certificates for everything from spa visits to restaurant dining.
</P>
<P>
   And iVillage.com offers ``channels'' on astrology, health,
beauty, book clubs, money, and the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   There are also online tools for planning menus, picking baby
names, and checking your financial and physical health _ along with
a ``pregnancy calendar,'' so you'll know what to expect during
those nine months.

WHAT KIDS DON'T KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's good for kids to learn something about money. But what are
they learning in a society obsessed with the buck?
</P>
<P>
   A recent Junior Achievement poll found that 25 percent of
teenagers surveyed believed they'd be millionaires by age 40. The
dollar signs were even bigger for the 15 percent who believed
they'd be earning more than $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey questioned 1,302 students in grades 6 though
12, and pollsters consider 25 percent high, particularly when only
about 7 percent of the US population are millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Achievement, dedicated to educating young people about
business, winced at the unrealistic view of life and work in what
it calls ``the millionaire generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation has grown up in extremely prosperous times,''
says Monte Lutz, spokesman for Junior Achievement Inc. in Colorado
Springs, Colo. ``They have the idea that anything they can imagine
or think can actually happen. Their life experience, combined with
a society fascinated with fame and fortune, have convinced them
that all they have to do to be a millionaire is show up and play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The message blasts not only from television and newsstands, but
also from a growing list of children's money books. Titles such as
``Coin Country,'' ``KidBiz,'' ``Fast Cash For Kids,'' and ``The
Totally Awesome Money Book'' outline everything from the history of
money to how to set up a lemonade stand.
</P>
<P>
   There's some useful information here, and the books talk about
the need to be responsible with money. But the sheer number of
titles _ about 15 at the Borders bookstore in Braintree _ combined
with the popularity of stock market clubs, computer games called
``Gazillionaire'' and ``Profitania,'' and summer business camps,
just might be sending the message that greed is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are bored,'' says Mike Caslin, chief executive of the
National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, which runs
business camps. ``They want to know why they're in school.
Entrepreneurship gives them the why.''
</P>
<P>
   His organization works with teens ages 14 to 18, many
underprivileged, and has a fine reputation for inspiring young
people to start businesses and get their lives together.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't something vital missing from a society that considers
money a stronger motivator than the excitement of learning?
Shouldn't the words of Shakespeare, Jefferson, and Maya Angelou
always light a fire hotter than any economy?
</P>
<P>
   John Dacey, professor of developmental psychology at Boston
College and author of the book ``Your Anxious Child,'' says the
economy is often too hot for a kid to handle and the money flowing
from parents and from employers eager for hourly workers is putting
a lot of pressure on teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's possible to keep up with the Joneses, to buy the
coolest thing,'' he explains, noting that anxiety ratchets up when
kids aren't sure what that coolest thing is. ``We've all heard
about the kid who was killed for a coat or for his sneakers. What
we don't hear about is the kid ostricized for not wearing the right
shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens buy status when they buy presents for each other. ``They
don't buy a girlfriend or boyfriend a tape or CD anymore,'' Dacey
says. ``They buy a leather coat. And I'm not just talking
Wellesley. I'm talking Roxbury. A generation of kids is taking on
adult responsibilities of spending and choices when they don't yet
have the judgmental ability to handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, parents? The school investment workshop, the games, and
the books aren't enough. Kids need to talk with adults about values
as well as price tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents come in younger and younger and ask, `What do we teach
our kids?' says Joan Indursky DiFuria, who cofounded the Money,
Meaning &AMP; Choices Institute in San Francisco with psychologist
Stephen Goldbart. The organization helps people define their values
and gain perspective on the staggering wealth that has become
commonplace in the high-tech boom.
</P>

   The biggest mistake is making things too easy and ``shielding
our children from what helped make us mature adults,'' says Janine
Bempechat, assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education. She's the author of the book ``Getting Our Kids Back on
Track: Educating Children for the Future.''

REAL ESTATE SALE COULD HELP RETIREES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I had to retire last year for health reasons. I will collect
disability checks until 65, then $1,470 monthly from Social
Security. In May, I will receive the first of four checks from my
former employer's ESOP, eventually totallin $82,300. My husband
plans to retire in three years at 55. We will sell our primary home
and move to our vacation home; our plan is to have little or no
mortgage obligations by the time my husband retires. As long as
he's working, I plan to contribute the maximum $2,000 a year to a
Roth IRA. By the time I hit 65, how healthy do you think our
retirement savings might be?
</P>
<P>
   S.R., East Sandwich, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost certainly, you'll have enough in savings to make up
the difference between your disability income and the lower Social
Security benefit. If you continue your contributions to the Janus
fund accounts, plus fully fund your Roth IRA for the next three
years, plus add the ESOP payments to your savings _ and if you
achieve average investment gains of 10 percent _ you would have
$325,054 in three years when your husband retires. Adding the final
ESOP payment at the end of the next year, you would then have
$379,541 at the end of the fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   If you then discontinue contributions to your accounts and
simply let the accounts grow for the following 11 years, you would
accumulate $1,174,809 by the time you reach age 65. The second
calculation also presumes 10 percent investment returns, and that
you will pay any taxes that result from the Janus accounts from
other funds. (These calculations do not include the value of your
insurance policies.)
</P>
<P>
   Such an accumulation would, of course, be a whole lot more than
you would need to make up for the difference between $3,364 in
monthly disability income and $1,470 in Social Security payments.
But it would only be a little more than adequate to deal with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When you first retire, you will have an income stream of $81,368
a year. But by the time 12 more years have passed and you switch
from disability income to Social Security, you will need $123,708
to buy what $81,868 bought in 2003, presuming that inflation runs
at a 3.5 percent average clip.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, instead of needing $19,488 a year to cover the difference
between disability and Social Security, you will need about $65,000
a year. (It's silly to make an exact projection here, because the
amount of Social Security benefits will indubitably rise modestly
over the next 17 years, so the shortfall is likely to be
considerably smaller.) Also, you would be in a much better
situation if there is a cost-of-living adjustment in your husband's
pension. And if your husband, too, will qualify for Social
Security, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, given the relentless power of inflation to gnaw
away at savings, consider whether you might continue some additions
to the Janus portfolio early in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   If you were able to come out of the move to your remodeled
vacation home without a mortgage and with cash to boot, it would
help a lot. If you achieve 10 percent investment returns (and pay
the taxes from other funds) you could expect that every dollar you
could cull from the real estate swap would grow to $4 by that
critical stage at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Your investment choices seem solid. I especially like the
addition of Vanguard Health Care to what is otherwise an all-index
rollover portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am satisfied with the funds to which my employer
contributes. I am not afraid of risk and fear I am missing out on
higher returns from the more aggressive funds available. What about
adding a new fund and transferring the balance from the Wellington
and/or Windsor positions to one of the following Vanguard funds:
Mid-Cap Index, Growth Index, Morgan Growth, PRIMECAP, Explorer,
Capital Opportunity, Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   S.G., Cambridge, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree with your thinking when it comes to Wellington, but
not necessarily Windsor. Wellington is a fine fund, and the kind of
thing you'll want to be thinking about in 20 years. But for now,
the ticket should be stocks, stocks and more stocks. I suggest you
transfer the entire balance in the Wellington holding to new funds,
putting $3,600 each into Vanguard Health Care and Vanguard Capital
Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, realign your contributions so that 30 percent goes into
Vanguard Index 500, 20 percent each to Windsor and Growth and
Income, and 10 percent each to Health Care, Capital Opportunity,
and a new position in Vanguard Mid-Cap Index.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand your temptation to pull the trigger on Vanguard
Windsor, but its doldrums of the past few seasons are simply a
function of a market in which the value stocks, which are Windsor's
staples, are out of fashion. I would expect the fund to return to
its very solid long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q. I recently had a CD mature and was not notified. I suspect they
didn't send me one because last time I had an IRA CD mature I put
the proceeds in a money market account rather than another CD,
because I wanted to combine several accounts to make it easier for
me in a couple of years when I turn 70 1/2 and will need to make
withdrawals. If I had remembered the CD was maturing I would have
moved the money to another bank to get a full 1 percent additional
interest. Are they obligated to send reminder notices?
</P>
<P>
   M.B., Beaumont, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A certificate of deposit is, at bottom, a contract. The terms
are precisely what is spelled out in the certificate itself _
nothing more. Read the document carefully; you may be out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, these people don't impress me as particularly
hot bankers. Go to the branch manager or one of the highest
officers. Most bankers, I think, would be willing to come to some
sort of accommodation. But I suspect that as a matter of law or
regulation, you have no recourse, save to complain and hope for the
best.

 &HT;    Hundreds of sites vying for attention
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How much would you pay for this newspaper? The day may
be coming _ thanks to the growing popularity of Web auctions _ when
the consumer sets the price and merchants compete to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all Web auction sites is eBay, a place where many
Web users first learned of the excitement of an online auction. The
site, www.ebay.com, is still one of the Web's most popular places
to buy and trade. To participate, you'll need to register with the
site, but the process is easy and free. Once registered, you'll be
able to make bids to buy products listed and sell your own items.
The site takes a fee from sellers to help pay the freight.
</P>
<P>
   The fee system is a bit complex and varies based on the value of
the item and other factors. Here's how eBay describes it:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put an item up for auction and set the opening bid for
$5, your insertion fee will be 25 cents. Then let's say that at the
end of your auction, the high bid is $20. The $20 is used to
calculate your Final Value fee (a percentage of the final sale
price). In this instance, it's $1. ... For this example, you would
pay eBay $1.25.''
</P>
<P>
   But eBay was just the pebble that helped to create the Internet
auction avalanche. There are now literally hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of auction sites online.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of just how many, take a look at an
excellent site called Internet Auction List _ Largest Auction
Directory. It's located at www.internetauctionlist.com/. If you
look at the left side of the page, you'll see that the listings of
the various auction sites are divided by category. There are way
too many categories to list, but, as examples, you'll find
groupings of sites for automobiles, aviation, bankruptcy, boats,
clothing, comics, consumer electronics, firearms and farm
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that collect links to the hundreds of auction sites on the
Web are especially valuable, because if you are selling a rare
collectible you are most likely to get a good price for it from an
informed audience of specialists. So you should bookmark another
collection of auction links called BidFind at www.bidfind.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Here as well, the auction pages are grouped according to
category. While the category names differ slightly, it's the same
idea and the same basic categories.
</P>
<P>
   One excellent feature of BidFind is the listing of new auction
sites that appears on the right side of the page. That's valuable,
since new auction sites seem to be popping up with great frequency,
and some of the newest offer special promotional deals as a way of
building an audience.
</P>
<P>
   So be sure to check out the newest sites (but keep in mind that
there are no guarantees of a site's ethics or legitimacy, so you'll
want to be a smart consumer as you try sites without a track
record).
</P>
<P>
   Now that Web auction sites are old hat to most Web shoppers, the
reverse auction site has become very trendy _ such as Priceline.com
(www.priceline.com). The slogan of that site explains the notion of
reverse auctions in just a few words: ``Name your own price and
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reverse auction site worth watching is called
NetgenShopper.Com and is located at www .netgenshopper.com. You
simply register (free) and fill out a form telling about the item
you want to buy. Then sellers contact you, offering their best
price on that item.

 &HT;    Major retailers going online
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to e-shopping strategies, there are
typically two ways a company can turn. Either build a Web site and
manage it in-house, or outsource all or part of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller dot-com start-ups or niche retailers are in that zone
where it's attractive to them to have it outsourced,'' said Steve
Simpson, a partner in the e-retailing group of Deloitte &AMP; Touche in
Atlanta. ``But some of the more mature retailers have built up
large IT capabilities and can handle it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some metro Atlanta companies think it's better to source out
their e-commerce needs because it's less labor intensive and less
costly to keep up with technology if someone else is doing the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Home Depot, prefer handling their own
cyberstores.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot has decided to build its own e-commerce
site and the company plans to manage it. The Web site will have a
comprehensive inventory that closely matches the home improvement
retailer's stores. That's about 50,000 products, with potential for
up to 300,000 products, said spokesman Don Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that tallies up quite an undertaking to bring this
online,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement retailer plans to do a market by market
roll-out starting this summer. Though Home Depot has not revealed
which markets will come first, shoppers can expect to start surfing
Home Depot's site sometime in July. The retailer is using IXL
Enterprises Inc., an Internet strategy company, as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 7-month-old Figleaves.com wants to leave the Web site
development to the experts. The Atlanta-based intimate apparel
start-up, which began selling undergarments on its site last
December, is in discussions to outsource its e-commerce work to
Deloitte Consulting. Deloitte would build and host Figleaves.com's
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figleaves is in the `soft wear' business, not software,'' said
Ari Straus, the company's chief executive officer. ``The concept of
shared risk created the hot application service provider market.
Today, these solutions support the needs of young, growing
companies like Figleaves. Tomorrow, they'll actually support
businesses like Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are finding that combining strategies is the way
to go. Such is the case with Wolf Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera reached an agreement with Outpost.com in late March.
While Wolf Camera maintains control over its Web site in-house,
Outpost.com will handle any fulfillment and customer service needs
when shoppers click on the Wolfxpress.com site listed on
Outpost.com. Outpost.com also has a wider audience to help Wolf
Camera reach more of the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera spokesman Wayne Freedman said having their functions
in-house means employees understand the company's objectives and
missions.
</P>
<P>
   The linkup with Outpost.com puts orders in customers' hands
faster, Freedman said. That's an advantage, he added, to know
Outpost.com can fulfill orders until 9 p.m. and guarantee that
customers would have it on their desks by the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The latest snapshot for what's to come for e-revenues points to
big growth online until 2004. U.S. consumers are expected to spend
$38.8 billion in online purchases in 2000, according to Forrester
Research of Cambridge, Mass. By 2004, that figure will be $184
billion, or 7 percent of all retail sales, the report says.
Forrester predicts that online shopping will hit a spending plateau
in 2004, until Generation Y creates the next surge in e-commerce
around 2010 _ when they hit their prime earning years. In the
meantime, the industry expects a major shakeout of less-successful
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, retailers and e-tailers are trying to reach
their customers any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control how people shop,'' said Evan Schwartz,
author of ``Webonomics'' and ``Digital Darwinism,'' two books on
e-commerce. ``They're going to shop in different channels provided
you offer the same products, the same prices and return policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have learned the hard way that consumers want to buy
what they want, when they want, where they want, and at the price
they want _ whether it's online, in-store, or by catalog, mail
order or phone.
</P>
<P>
   Does the ``customer is always right'' come to mind?
</P>
<P>
   But that message isn't getting through to some retailers.
Haverty's Furniture for instance, has a Web site, but it's a
browsing tool, not a cyberstore where you can place orders for that
new four-poster bed. John Slater, president and chief executive of
the furniture chain, said that 15 percent of all delivered
furniture is canceled or exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is one of the most wonderful tools to come along
for consumers and retailers _ it's right up there with
television,'' Slater said. ``But I don't believe that sales of
big-ticket items that are personal can be made over the Internet
without first sitting in that product.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, another Atlanta-based retailer, has a Web site, but does
not plan to expand it to sell apparel, shoes or furniture online.
But its sister chain, Macy's, does offer goods online at Macys.com.
Both chains are owned by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers are taking a cautious approach to their
e-commerce strategies because the formula for profitability is
still being hammered out. And Wall Street is still waiting for
online giants, such as Amazon.com, to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional retailers have responded at least fairly
well,'' Schwartz said. ``But I still think a lot of them are
behind.''

INTERNET BANKS A HAVEN FROM HIGH FEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes where to find web banking text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jason Chute has some advice for consumers getting bounced around
right now in the banking equivalent of musical chairs: Try an
Internet bank.
</P>
<P>
   Chute has tried Netbank.com out of Georgia for the last six
months and has found little to complain about. Netbank pays him a
rate of interest on his checking account that is six times what
most bricks-and-mortar banks offer, charges him no fees for writing
checks or making online bill payments, and requires no minimum
balance in his account.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the sort of treatment that disgruntled
FleetBoston and Citizens Bank customers have been demanding from
their banks in the wake of recent mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like your bank, switch,'' said the 26-year-old
Chute. ``And for those people who are afraid of the Internet or
don't have access, you don't need it. You get a monthly paper
statement mailed to you and you can handle most of your banking
over their 800 customer service number.''
</P>
<P>
   Chute has a point. Internet banks have some disadvantages _ ATM
charges and deposit delays are drawbacks _ but their potential is
enormous. No one likes to stand in line at a bank (Chute says he
hasn't been inside a bank in three years), and increasingly, with
ATMs and direct deposit, there is less and less reason to go.
</P>
<P>
   Internet banks say they can afford to pay higher interest rates
and charge fewer fees than traditional banks because they don't
have branches or ATM networks to pay for. For example,
Lighthousebank.com, which recently received its final regulatory
approvals, expects to open in June with just 25 employees, about
what three FleetBoston branches employ.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for an Internet bank is fairly easy. You have to read
the fine print just like you would with a regular bank, but the
product offerings of most Internet banks are strikingly simple and
similar. It took me about two hours to compare the product
offerings of six banks. It's a lot more confusing with traditional
banks, which seem to delight in customized account features that
make comparisons difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A simple checking account at an Internet bank generally requires
a low minimum balance or no balance at all, while paying as much as
4 percent interest and offering free online bill payments.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston, by contrast, offers a self-service checking account
that has no minimum balance requirement, but it offers no interest
and charges monthly fees of $7 ($5 with direct deposit) plus $4.50
for online bill payment. It also charges $2 if a teller or a phone
service representative is used to do a transaction that could be
done electronically.
</P>
<P>
   To get an interest rate of 0.5 percent, a customer would have to
sign up for a FleetOne Classic account, which requires a $2,000
balance in checking or a $4,000 combined balance to avoid a $10
monthly fee. The $4.50 fee for online bill payment would still
apply. To avoid that fee, a customer would have to sign up for a
FleetOne Gold account, which would require parking $10,000 in
various Fleet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Certificates of deposit are also more attractive at Internet
banks. The six banks I surveyed were all offering rates of more
than 6 percent for six-month CDs with a minimum deposit of $2,500.
By contrast, the Boston average of banks surveyed by Bank Rate
Monitor is just 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet banks have some limitations. Most don't have extensive
ATM networks, so customers are forced to use the ATMs of other
banks and absorb their surcharges. Some Internet banks reimburse
customers for some surcharges ($5 to $7 a month is typical), but
not all of them do.
</P>
<P>
   Depositing money is also more difficult. Direct deposit, wire
transfers, and ATMs, if they happen to be owned by the Internet
bank, are all options. But in general Internet bank customers have
to rely on the US mail to deposit a check. That may not be too big
of a burden if the check is going to someplace local, but if it's
going to Oakland or Atlanta it can take a lot longer. Although
Internet banks provide postage-paid envelopes, Chute said deposit
delays in dealing with Netbank in Georgia have been the biggest
downside for him.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from ATM fees and deposit delays, officials at FleetBoston
say consumers simply feel more comfortable in dealing with a bank
where they can talk to someone in person if they need to. Since
banking is not the same as buying a book online, the officials said
customers prefer a ``clicks and mortar bank'' like Fleet, where
they can get all the benefits of an Internet as well as a
traditional bank.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Wolfson, director of interactive banking at Fleet, said few
customers shop for a checking account based on pricing factors such
as interest rates and fees. What they want, he said, are financial
options, including having the same institution provide their
banking, brokerage, and credit card services. That type of
integration is hard to find at Internet banks today, although it's
coming.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet bank deposits are insured the same as deposits
at traditional banks, Wolfson raised doubts about whether many of
the Internet banks popping up today will be around in years to
come. Big players, including General Electric and Wall Street
brokerage houses, are getting into the business and there may be a
shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a known entity,'' Wolfson said. ``People know Fleet will
be around in two years. An Internet bank is somewhat of an
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but I suspect 10 years from now the dynamics
may be far different. In the meantime, the rates offered by
Internet banks are enough to get anyone's attention, especially at
a time when fees are on the minds of just about every banking
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the perfect solution for the FleetBoston and Citizens
customers,'' said Thomas Venables, a former community savings bank
executive who is now president and chief executive of
Lighthousebank. ``Traditional banking is going to keep losing
market share.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Another glitch
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Essential.com, which sells energy and communications services
online, suffered another customer service glitch recently. The
Burlington, Mass. company responded admirably, but the incident
renewed concerns about whether the company's customer service
problems are behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Essential.com has forthrightly acknowledged its customer service
had lagged badly as its customer base soared. Company officials
detailed a number of initiatives they had taken to correct the
problem.

 &HT;    An eBay trip offers lots of information for browsers

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether you do it online or at a real-world flea
market, there's nothing quite like the thrill of buying something
you want and not having to pay full price for it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a discount clothing chain that uses the slogan
``Everybody loves a bargain.'' At the moment, some of the hottest
sites on the Web are auction sites that let you bid on anything
from vintage china and dolls to airline tickets and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions bring the thrills and chills of bidding on rare
and unique items to people who used to think auctions were all
about society matrons in mink and pearls bidding on impressionist
paintings in fancy New York auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. You don't have to be a millionaire to go
online and bid on everything from vintage Wedgwood china to compact
discs. Bargains abound, and for novice collectors it can be
educational, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one example: Not too long ago, I went to a flea market
and bought a set of vintage china for what I was pretty sure was an
outstanding bargain.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine was more skeptical. ``You should get on eBay
and see what it's really worth,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   I went straight to eBay the first chance I had. I scrolled
through three pages of pictures and descriptions of my new china.
Judging by the auctioneers' prices and the current bids, I'm happy
to say I did get a pretty good deal.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly when Web auctioneer eBay (www.ebay.com)
became the last word on flea market bargains. However, there is no
doubt that eBay was one of the founders of the ``name your price''
craze sweeping the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just this past week eBay showed Wall Street that
there's gold in all those pages of what may look like junk.
First-quarter operating results for the online auctioneer exceeded
expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its site
surpassed $77 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of Fiestaware.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to eBay in a while, this might be a good
time to take another look. The site has been completely redesigned
to make the virtual flea market experience much easier than it used
to be. Users can click on a tab called ``gallery'' in their
selected area and just view pictures and current bids on the items
they are interested in. You can find out what a certain collectible
is going for on the eBay market or just browse the selection of
goods available.
</P>
<P>
   This is much better than the old eBay, which was just a text
list. You took a chance that the item you clicked on would be
something you might want. This was time-consuming and, unless you
were a very serious collector, not that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The new method lets you see the dishes, watches, oriental rugs
or whatever captures your fancy before you decide to find out more
about the item or even place a bid.
</P>
<P>
   While I was making sure my flea market china was truly a
bargain, I also learned a lot about my new china as I read the
descriptions the sellers posted with their items. Some of the
auctioneers were dealers who had shops in cities and towns across
the country and offered links to related sites, collectors' clubs
and other points of interest. If you want to begin a collection,
eBay can help you learn about various items and how much you can
expect to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Passing time on eBay doesn't have to be about shopping. It's a
great place to play your own at-home version of the hot PBS series
``Antiques Roadshow.'' Here's all you have to do: Find an item in
your house you think might be worth some money. Then head over to
eBay to see if there is a matching category for your collectible.
</P>
<P>
   You might be pleasantly surprised, as was my friend Alex after
browsing eBay's Beatles section. To her great surprise, she found
that a book about making the film ``A Hard Day's Night,'' which she
had bought in a dollar store, is fetching nearly $50 on eBay. Think
about that the next time you see a bin of remaindered books.
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you have a couple of million or just a couple of
hours, online auctions can teach you about fine art or oriental
rugs or just help you figure out how much that strange bowl in your
grandmother's living room is really worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's e-commerce with a kick.

 &HT;    Bringing home the bacon a brand new way
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They've done it. They have finally done it. They have
come up with a gimmick to lure men into grocery shopping. It's
called shopping for groceries using Priceline.com, a kind of
win-win lottery that turns buying diapers into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, familiar to many of us as the outfit that
auctions airplane seats and hotel rooms, has a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo here in metro Atlanta,
Priceline now has us bidding for baby carrots, live lobsters and
Folgers coffee.
</P>
<P>
   I can testify that just a little time and practice has me
trimming 25 percent and more off food and grocery items and having
a lot more fun than sitting on the floor clipping coupons.
</P>
<P>
   There are several online approaches to shopping _ some, like
Peapod and Webvan, aimed at meeting the needs of busy, working
households. The Priceline service, however, focusing on cost
saving, addresses the pocketbook issue that is precious to many
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process struck me at first as kind of clunky and slow,
even on my speedy computer, but with some practice _ and
considerable savings _ I warmed up. Saving money makes you patient,
and while it has limitations and is not the whole answer to grocery
shopping, the Priceline game clearly could gain fans among the
computer crowd _ especially those whose minds may not turn to
groceries until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in a ``guy'' way, I figured the smartest approach
to this grocery auction business was to go for the commodities, the
big-ticket items that are consumed heavily _ the detergents, paper
towels, toilet tissue and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea. I bid successfully for three 92-ounce boxes of
Tide at $3.55 each and three triple-roll packages of Brawny paper
towels at $1.57 each, which experienced shoppers will recognize as
a saving of nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   Getting bolder, I went for an immediate need, kitty litter, and
wrestled away three 14-pound containers of Tidy Cats Scoop Cat
Litter for $4.52 each, though they sold off the shelf for about
$6.50.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll, I have now gone for coffee, juices and bottled water.
I'm even eyeing those live lobsters. What fun!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   First you take out a membership, obtain a Priceline card and
submit a credit or debit card that is stored in the system's
memory, allowing you to pay online, in advance, for items as you
strike deals.
</P>
<P>
   Then you go to the main shopping page and begin compiling your
shopping list, cruising the cyber-aisles and making choices. When
you select an item, the bargaining begins with a pop-up screen that
offers three or more brands, all of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you the going shelf-price range of the items and
invites your bid, advising that you have a ``great chance'' to get
your choice with an offer of 85 percent of the list price. It's a
good chance at 66 percent, a fair chance at 50 percent and a poor
chance at 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing rejection, you tend to go high as a beginner, but later
you take chances and learn that if you are rejected at a low price,
you can always inch back upward.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement comes when you have compiled your list and
submitted the collective bids.
</P>
<P>
   A suspenseful minute passes as an on-screen display that looks
like a slot machine spins, alternating ``yes'' and ``sorry'' next
to each item, and then finally the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   You confirm your acceptance of the sales prices; your bank
account or charge card, as you prefer, is automatically debited,
then out prints your shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   You then go to the store, pick up your items from the shelf,
where you can see plainly how much you saved on each, and then you
check out, running your Priceline card through the slot. It
dutifully reports you have already paid.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick up your groceries, you begin to learn how and why
this is worthwhile for the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   First, I have never picked up the items without also picking up
other items that catch my eye. So luring me into the store results
automatically in additional sales, either from impulse or from me
remembering empty spots on the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not for everybody. It is very slow and
time-consuming at times. Many favorite brands or product sizes are
not offered, even though they are in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that battle to limit yourself to the bargains,
and the fight not to give in to picking up additional impulse
items. But there is appeal, a novelty, that could catch on. But
what's the reasoning behind the grocery auction?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Brown, senior vice president of the Washington-based Food
Marketing Institute, gives a grocer's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about going after all the types of customers out there,''
she said. ``It's about searching for ways to help and enhance a
shopping experience, using all of the technologies and other
approaches at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While many consumers are drawn to the convenience of Peapod and
Webvan, services that deliver goods to the home at a price, others
are interested in bottom-line savings, as reflected in the ardent
pursuit of discount coupons in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline approach, which is being adopted in partnership
with supermarket chains all across the country, adds a bit of the
glitz and glamour of gamesmanship, tapping into an experience that
many online shoppers recognize from eBay and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose organization represents supermarkets and online
retail services, says the Priceline service is one of many
experiments in progress as the volume-sensitive grocery business
struggles to build traffic in stores and online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing in retail as the average customer,''
Brown said, ``but we do what we can to pull together all of the
segments.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the cost of the bargains to the retailers?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the cost is being borne now by wholesalers and
retailers in an effort to build the volume, though there are
obvious questions about how long the sizable discounts can last.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodgett, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, says he is
optimistic about Priceline's possibilities in near term but wonders
what will happen when the ``grand opening'' sale runs its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the
consumers won't be getting such a great deal,'' Blodgett said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that all seems far away. For now, let's go after those
live lobsters for next weekend!

 &HT;    Domain name isn't hard to get
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm interested in getting a domain name and business going on
the Internet. I've contacted a domain registrar, and they quoted a
price of $19.95 for a year. Is that in the ballpark? I'd like more
information about registering and hosting.
</P>
<P>
   _Ernie M. Margate, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ernie isn't the only one with domain name questions.
There are lots of you. Right off the bat, let's define ``domain
name.'' Finding something on the Internet can be like trying to
find a contact lens or the back of an earring. A domain name was
invented to make it easier.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: A domain name corresponds to an address _ or string of
numbers like a Social Security number _ that identify and locate a
computer or server on the Web (Yahoo.com vs. 204.71.200.243). The
domain name is meant to be catchy and easy to remember so that
surfers can find Web sites and send e-mail to a familiar name
without having to commit numbers to memory or tattoo them on their
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Why would someone want a domain name? Well, do you have a
Web page on the hard drive of your computer that you want to share
with the world? Like Ernie, do you want to start a business on the
Internet? Registering a domain name is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You want a name that springs to mind quickly, isn't hard to
spell. And, if you're starting a business, gives you some sort of
name branding. Pick an alternate or two because domain names gotta
be unique, so you gotta be creative.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Got five minutes? Let's register. Check the availability
of your preferred domain name with InterNIC (www.internic.net/).
Domain registrars have sprung up all over. InterNIC has a great
list. Heck, we also did a yahoo.com search on ``domain
registrars.'' Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Prices to register are all over the map. $12 a year. $34 a
year. $60 for two years. Do research. Some will just register the
name. Others wrap registration, monthly hosting and e-mail
account(s) into a Web hosting package. Look to your own ISP for
registration and hosting options.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You may end up tacking on charges depending on the size
and type of site. If you'll be running a business like Ernie, you
may want e-commerce features. E-commerce packages allow people
visiting your Web store to make purchases. Visitors can fill up a
shopping cart with merchandise and check out with a credit card.
Sites like Amazon.com, Sundance.com, etc., allow online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Know what? You don't even need to be a Web developer to
create a Web store. Hosts can make it as easy as a few clicks. They
walk you through registering, setting up and designing your site,
and making it ``e-commerceable.''
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Office 2000 shows Microsoft's prowess
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While I do not expect to lose any sleep wondering what
will become of Microsoft, I will say this for Bill and his Merry
Men and Women: They have given us some pretty fine software.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over Office 2000, and the portions of it that I use
regularly, it is undoubtedly the best collection of the standard
programs available today.
</P>
<P>
   Take FrontPage, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   I've been through most of the Web creation programs on the
market. The really simple ones are capable of creating only really
simple Web sites _ usually the one-page kind your children might
wish to set up. A couple of pictures, ``Hi! I'm Eric! I Love The
X-Files!'' _ that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated ones are, in my experience, a very mixed
bag. I put up a fairly complicated site using Symantec's Virtual
Page, and it was a chore. Strange things occurred _ like huge gaps
between one line of text and the other _ for reasons I could never
determine.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all _ and this is not all the fault of Virtual Page, by
any means _ the site looked entirely different depending on which
browser you used to examine it. It usually looked better in
Microsoft Internet Explorer. As a result, after years of resisting
attempts to shove Explorer down my throat, I began using it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   When Office 2000 arrived, I pulled all the elements of my site
into FrontPage and worked on picture alignment, so difficult in
Virtual Page that I just about gave up using pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot better now, although there are still some
discrepancies between browsers. That, I fear, is unavoidable. But
FrontPage is, as far as I'm concerned, head and shoulders above the
rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Word will certainly remain my high-powered writing program, too
_ although I must admit that WordPad meets 98 percent of the
requirements I'm ever likely to have. Most people who write, I
believe, do not make huge demands on a writing program. (I'm trying
to avoid the accursed phrase ``word processor'' here. Food may need
processing; words do not.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, what is there beyond cut and paste, paste and drag,
find and replace, spellcheck and undo? Well, it's fun to play with
fonts once in a while, put things in italics and look at print
preview to make sure you got it all on one page, but the rest of a
huge program like Word is used primarily by secretaries, and people
like professors and researchers who must write formal papers for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The big thing in Word 2000 seems to be foreign languages. You
can set it up to write in a huge number of languages and to
translate between them, too. And, with a nod to those writers with
special needs, when you choose New under the File menu, you can
find a vast array of choices in addition to good old Blank Page.
</P>
<P>
   Writing a report? You can choose among Contemporary Report,
Elegant Report and Professional Report. I have no idea what you
must do if you want an elegant, contemporary, professional report
all in one.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legal pleading wizard to help you through the
construction of a legal pleading. Unfortunately, no simple begging
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   So I suppose there's still room for improvement.

 &HT;    Based on test version, Windows Millennium's a winner
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few weeks ago, I sat down at my computer to install
still another new version of Windows. This is the version that will
be released later this year to replace Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat there and listened to the hard disk spin and whir, I
realized I was in danger of feeling nostalgic about a computer
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind getting misty-eyed over a sunset or walks on the
beach in Oregon, but I hadn't planned to turn into the kind of guy
who gets warm and tingly over Windows. Truth is, back when I
installed the first version of Windows ever, it was little more
than a poorly done rip-off of the Macintosh operating system. It
would have had to improve greatly to aspire to bad.
</P>
<P>
   But by now I've used all the versions, including Windows 2000,
which is aimed at the business market and was released this year.
Over the years, Windows has gotten better. And the latest version,
Millennium Edition (which ends up with the too-cute nickname of
ME), is the best Windows yet, at least on first impression. Don't
rush to the store yet. It's still a beta, or test, release, but _
to start with a highly technical evaluation _ it works real good.
</P>
<P>
   I installed the test edition of Millennium on my home PC. If
that machine was a human it would need a good therapist. So many
programs have been installed and removed, so many internal changes
have been made, that it crashes more often than the stock market
has lately. So I did not have high hopes when I installed Windows
ME.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that my Frankenstein of a computer has run
flawlessly since that moment. It hasn't frozen or crashed since.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ before I get carried away _ some disclaimers: For
starters, it's impossible to really judge something as complex as a
new edition of Windows after trying it for just a few weeks on a
single computer. And it is possible that a fresh installation of
any operating system would have made things better. But there are
some solid reasons why this new Windows should be more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Windows ME is not a radical departure from Windows 98.
That's good, not bad. Since much of the computer code stayed the
same, programmers were able to refine the way Windows works without
injecting a lot of new programs. For another, this new Windows
incorporates a technology called SFP, System File Protection. This
technology prevents new applications from mistakenly overwriting
old system files _ a fairly common problem _ and that keeps the
system more stable, according to Microsoft. For once, my computer
agrees with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another noticeable advance is the speed with which Windows ME
loads and closes down. That may not seem like a big thing, but in
this instant world, most of us have grown to expect that kind of
response from microwaves, TVs and other gadgets. The reason for
this is technical _ Microsoft got rid of some of the old code used
in DOS operating systems that had hung around past its time _ but
you'll see the difference that has made and like it.
</P>
<P>
   The last item I'll mention may be the most important. Anyone who
has tried to use the interactive help features in Windows 98 will
appreciate this. The suggestions offered for fixing a problem were
often more complicated than the problem itself and could only be
understood by people so technically savvy that they didn't need the
help in the first place. The new interactive help truly does guide
you through fixing many common problems and doesn't start off with
the assumption that you are an honors graduate from MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Windows isn't perfect. But this new version is the most
worthwhile upgrade I've seen in a while. It's especially impressive
that I'm making this judgment based on a beta version of the
program, so _ with any luck at all _ the final shrink-wrap version
that you'll find in stores will be even better.

 &HT;    Savvy shoppers learn the rules before they begin
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Before you start your e-shopping adventures, here are some key
points to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   1. SECURITY: Most reputable Web retailers have secure ordering
forms to protect your personal information. They'll let you know
you are ordering via a secure connection. They also offer detailed
information about their security policies. If you aren't sure if a
site offers security, think twice before placing an order.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to check with your credit card companies
about security options they offer. For example, American Express
will not hold card members responsible for unauthorized charges
online. Nor are you responsible for the first $50 in unauthorized
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   2. PRIVACY POLICY: Technically, there's no law preventing any
Web site from giving out personal information about you to anyone
who asks. However, most retailers are sensitive to shoppers'
privacy concerns. Make sure each site you visit has a privacy
policy. Most of them do.
</P>
<P>
   3. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Most sites have automated e-mail systems
that tell you when they received your order, when they sent it and
when it is expected to arrive. Some e-tailers will send you postal
tracking numbers for your reference if there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   4. UNDERSTAND THE ORDER PROCESS: Remember, your order isn't
final until you hit the ``submit'' key. If your Internet connection
seems slow, or nothing seems to be happening, you might be tempted
to keep hitting ``submit'' as you would the buttons on an elevator
that just won't close. Don't do it! Each time you tap submit, you
could be creating another order. One click is all usually all you
need.

 &HT;    Web opens new doors for stores
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Going Cyber!''
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting is a bit crooked and hard to make out from a
distance, and yet the sign on the front door of ``The Family
Jewels'' in downtown Decatur, Ga. speaks volumes. Next week, the
13-year-old antiques and collectibles store will become an
online-only operation, joining a host of other businesses for whom
the Internet is the greatest thing to come along since customers
with unlimited lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can move anywhere in the world and I'll always have my
inventory with me,'' enthused owner Lisa Cohen. ``My computer is
the world!''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Jewels isn't going out of business. Only
``shifting,'' according to the hand-lettered sign. It's just one
more sign of these times, when countless business owners are using
the Internet to discover and develop their rightful niche in the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a matter of staying right where they are, offline
and behind a counter. Others, like Cohen, come to see that they and
their customers would be better served by ``going cyber''
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like a beautiful Lalique bowl could sit in the store
for years because maybe only five people who came in knew what it
was and they didn't collect it,'' said Cohen, who's selling on
Yahoo and eBay and will do business by e-mail
(famjewlinc(at)aol.com), and her own Web site
(http://members.aol.com/famjewlinc/collect2/index.htm). ``But I put
it on the Internet and get 500 people who'll see it in seven days
and who'll know what they're looking at.''

 &HT;    Doing it my way, sort of
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnosk.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might have been the nearly silent episode of ``Law
&AMP; Order'' that finally did it.
</P>
<P>
   The sound on my television set had been faltering for quite a
while; now, when it practically went mute in the middle of
Detective Lenny Briscoe cracking wise, I decided it might be time
to buy a new one.
</P>
<P>
   This was not some lighthearted whim. I'd had that TV since
leaving college _ long enough that the cable company didn't even
have the right, suitably archaic, equipment to hook me up.
</P>
<P>
   Long enough to confirm the accuracy of a friend's observation
the year I went 13 weeks without owning a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have,'' he sighed, just before heading out to buy another
cold beer, ``a fear of commitment to new appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the appliances so much as the actual shopping for them
that gives me agita. In fact, when it comes to shopping for almost
anything but basic essentials, all I can come up with are reasons
not to:
</P>
<P>
   _ The staff will be too dumb or too devious to sell me the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The traffic will be horrible, the parking nonexistent and my
car (7-years-old, ahem!) might need gas.
</P>
<P>
   _ What if I can't find what I want? (Worse, what if I can ?)
What if I have to return something?
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother?
</P>
<P>
   Why not just create the Me Store instead?
</P>
<P>
   It hit me the next morning, when I opened the yellow pages to
``Televisions'' and instantly felt overwhelmed. If only I could do
all my shopping online, I thought, I'd never have this problem. I
could buy exactly what I wanted, when I wanted, without ever having
to get into my car or out of my pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the perfect store. The ``Me Store.'' Always open,
always stocked with exactly what I wanted, never about another
human being's needs except mine. All mine!
</P>
<P>
   One month later, I'd bought a whole lot and learned even more.
Neither the Internet nor human nature is 100 percent predictable,
and so the complete Me Store may be something of a pipe dream _ for
now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure was fun trying. I shopped at many more sites than
the eight bookmarked below, but they're all representative of
something I learned along the way.
</P>
<P>
   So, where'd I finally end up buying that new TV? Well, just keep
reading .
</P>
<P>
   THE SITES
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com _ Everyone's heard of this behemoth hawking
everything from books to buzz saws. What few people realize is that
it has only one customer: Me! Seriously, I bought one measly thing
from them, and all of a sudden they couldn't stop thinking about
me. They greet me by name each I log on. They're constantly
compiling lists of books, videos and CDs they think I'd enjoy. I
sometimes get the feeling they're all just sitting around, waiting
for me to order something.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Flattery will definitely get you somewhere in
the Me Store.
</P>
<P>
   twinings.com _ The last time I cut myself, I bled Earl Grey. Not
all grocery stores carry English-made Twinings Teas but they
should. Even the Queen drinks nothing but! The site featured
Twinings teas I'd never even heard of, let alone seen in Kroger,
and a chart to determine which blend to drink when (``after
dinner'') and why (``to help with a cold or flu''). It even
converted your total order from pounds to dollars. Unfortunately,
the bloody thing crashed every time I tried to actually place an
order for two days, so I finally gave up and headed for Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Parts of the Me Store may not always be open.
</P>
<P>
   zabars.com _ What am I, chopped liver? Like New Year's Eve
celebrations and mob hits, the chopped chicken liver from Zabar's
is something we'll never quite see the likes of here. I'd rather go
without than go without Zabar's, so imagine my glee when the
venerable Upper West Side deli and gourmet food shop put up a Web
site. Even the fact that it's not yet set up to handle Internet
orders (you have to fax or phone) didn't deter me from droolingly
scanning the offerings: Corned beef, bagels-and-schmears, smoked
salmon, rugelach ... What, no chopped liver?! I fired off a
distraught e-mail and four days later, received a polite (well, for
New York) response to the effect that I had to phone, ask for
personal shopping and pay an extra $7.50 for what is, let's face
it, the guts of a chicken. Except for very special occasions, I
guess I'll have to do without.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Parts of the Me Store may still be under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   drugstore.com _ I'm getting awfully tired of wandering through
huge drug ``superstores,'' wondering why it's easier to find potato
chips than Q-tips and how come they can process film in an hour,
but you have to stand in line all day to buy Chap Stick.
Fortunately, there are huge drugstore Web sites I can wander
through, wondering whether I really want to go through all this
bother just to buy Chap Stick. Well, yes, since they also gave _
gave! _ me $20 worth of ``bath and spa'' products suitable for
washing away any lingering trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Zabar's, schmabar's ... Who says there's no free
lunch?!
</P>
<P>
   endlesspools.com _ I am a firm believer in the benefits of
regular exercise. Just so long as I don't have to, you know,
actually stand up or go outside to do it. Enter the Endless Pool, a
``counter-current swimming and water exercise machine'' _
basically, a teeny-tiny little swimming pool they build inside your
den or wine cellar so you can paddle in place. If you even have to
ask how much one of these babies costs (the Web site doesn't quote
prices), you know you can't afford it _ in my case, I'd have to
include the cost of buying a house, since I doubt my landlord would
let me install one in my apartment. If I walked into a store they'd
instantly have me pegged as a relatively impoverished poseur, but
what does a Web site know? They're sending me a free video,
brochures and ``other materials.'' Heck, it's only a matter of time
until I fake them into sending me a free pool!
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: I can be whoever I want in the Me Store.
Including Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ivillage.com _ My niece is about to turn 11 in San Francisco and
she likes (in no particular order) clothes, baseball, the
Backstreet Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries. Stumped for a gift to
have sent to her (the operative phrase), I consider calling my
mother, but I know she's not home and besides, I'm really not up to
hearing about how she ran into some old boyfriend of mine (unless
he's fat and bald) and his wife (ditto). But this Web site that
bills itself as ``The Women's Network'' provides real human
``personal shoppers'' free of charge. Within the promised 48 hours,
Leslie e-mails me information about a San Francisco museum's
exhibition on ``The Science of Baseball.'' She also directs me to
ivillage's toy department. Leslie, I love you for trying, but the
ideal gift for an 11-year-old lies somewhere between toys and a
museum visit.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Call your mother. No, wait, there's more: The Me
Store really can't do your important thinking for you.
</P>
<P>
   delias.com calyxandcorolla.com _ Being a reporter pretty much
boils down to finding the right people to talk to, and then making
them talk. So it should be easy for me to complain to stores about
their products or services, right? Hah! You know the drill: You
talk to some teen clerk, who says you need to talk to the manager,
who vaguely promises to pass it along to ``corporate.'' If only the
big cheeses at ``corporate'' could hear from you directly about how
they done you wrong. Now, with e-mail, they can. Endlessly. While
it took Delia's six days to respond to my e-mail questioning their
handling of the aforementioned niece's birthday present, other Web
vendors seem to realize they've put a lot of eggs in the e-commerce
basket and are quite good about saying ``so sorry.'' Some are truly
spectacular about it: Calyx &AMP; Corolla didn't just apologize for
messing up an order; in a prompt e-mail that included (mistakenly,
I think) their interoffice communication about me, this purveyor of
gorgeous flowers gave me a whopping $75 credit. Hey, maybe I'll
send them flowers!
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: The customer is always right in the Me Store.
And the wronged customer can usually be bought off.
</P>
<P>
   circuitcity.com _ So, remember what started this whole thing? I
spent several days e-shopping for TVs: Flat TVs, fat TVs, TVs with
the VCR built right in. There were no traffic jams to suffer
through and no salespeople to feel stupid around; there was even
circuitcity.com's empathetic acknowledgment that ``Buying a TV/VCR
can be complicated with all the choices available today.'' My
feelings having finally been validated, I decided to click and buy.
That is, just as soon as I figured out what color I wanted. And the
screen size. VCR, inside or out? V-chip, yay or nay? Have it
delivered right to my door within days, or get in my car (aargh!)
and pick it up today at a Circuit City store near my home? Come to
think of it, my old TV wasn't so bad _ in fact, if I put my ear
right up against it and listened hard, I could actually hear
something, though it might just have been the sound of my heart
pounding at the mere thought of having to commit to a new
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: You can't fight human nature, not even in the Me
Store.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Nyko's Viper PSX ($30; www.nyko.com) is the slickest, most
functional, coolest, highest-tech video game controller on the
market. Any PlayStation gamer without it is underpowered. It comes
in sexy translucent colors, has an auto-fire turbo mode _ useful
for scrolling shooters _ and can function in digital or analog
modes even with games that shouldn't. The only real drawback is
that the cord is a little short and forces one to sit about a foot
closer to the electromagnetic wash of that big screen TV in the
living room. That can't be good for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK, MA, NO WIRES
</P>
<P>
   If your Sony PlayStation controller wires are weaving a tangled
web, try MadCatz's new wireless Dual Force controllers ($40;
www.madcatz.com). These little marvels are easy to set up and a
blast to use. Plug the receiver into the controller port on your
PlayStation and you're good to go. They look and function just like
Sony's Dual Shock controllers but can be configured to function as
a TV remote, allowing you to channel-surf while the game is loading
or to mute the volume when the phone rings. MadCatz's Dual Force
controllers feel good, look cool and function perfectly.

 &HT;    Croc2: Newer isn't always better
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For gaming with kids, the original Croc was a fun romp with lots
of eye candy and a cute little backpack-wearing crocodile. And
though the sequel, Croc2 (Fox Interactive, $20, for PC and
consoles), is fun, some unfortunate changes have robbed the concept
of a lot of its zip. As in the original, Croc must battle little
red imps and an array of cartoonish monsters in a silly-scary but
beautiful 3-D world, whacking them with his tail and a loud
''kerpow!'' Croc2 also adds fun new vehicles such as go-carts and
speedboats, as well as a larger-feeling world. But overall it's a
step down from the straightforward fun of Croc with its misguided
attempt at simplifying the controls _ you simply have less control
_ and annoying conversations with characters that interrupt play.
Also frustrating are bugs that make some simple tasks impossible
and the removal of the original camera controls. The bottom line is
that Croc2 is still a fun game, but somewhere on a corporate
flip-chart at Fox Interactive are a lot of mediocre ideas that
somehow made it into the game.

 &HT;    Vintage bookstore's horizons expanding
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a mid-17th century Bible for sale and copies
of every Life magazine issue ever printed. Recently, an urgent
request came in for ``any and all pre-1960 poultry books.''
</P>
<P>
   Something interesting's always happening at Atlanta Vintage
Books, though the most intriguing development of late doesn't
involve what's on the shelves: Some of the store's best, most loyal
customers have never set foot in the place.
</P>
<P>
   They're cybershoppers. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they
may be helping rather than hurting independent stores savvy enough
to see venturing onto the Web as one more way of keeping their
doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of the business is steadily growing,'' said Alice
Otten, who took Atlanta Vintage Books online soon after buying the
store four years ago. ``Originally, 20 to 30 percent of our sales
in dollars were over the Internet. That's already up to about 40 to
45 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply a case of customers who once visited the
12-year-old store in search of Santayana or Tom Swift now logging
on instead. Otten said its Internet presence actually allows
Vintage Books, which is renowned for its children's, aviation and
African-American book areas, to reach new customers all over the
world. On a recent Friday morning employee A.R. Swan logged on and
found 21 e-mails waiting to be read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're totally expanding our customer base,'' said
Swan, who is primarily responsible for maintaining Vintage Books'
presence on five Internet sites and responding to e-mail orders and
inquiries. ``Very few of our online sales are to locals, and many
are repeat customers.''
</P>
<P>
   What those Internet shoppers may never get to see is a cozily
eclectic shop where the glass case filled with illuminated
manuscripts lies just beyond bookshelves labeled ``Nazi Germany''
and ``Whales,'' but before ``Success'' and ``Climate.'' Where the
47-volume, circa-1898, English Classics collection of Shakespeare's
works is, alas, not signed by the author, but Suzanne Somers'
poetry book is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Internet users everywhere could react
instantly when a copy of ``The Duke Kahanamoku Story'' recently
washed up at Atlanta Vintage Books. Priced at $65, the bio of the
circa-1920s Olympic gold medal swimmer, early surfer, sometime
movie actor and later, sheriff in his native Honolulu, was sold
within 10 minutes of being listed online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got over 100 calls and e-mails,'' Swan laughingly recalled.
``Surfer guys saying, `Heey dude!,' people from the South Pacific.
I don't think it ever even made it onto the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon _ sometimes called ``clicks-and-mortar,'' refers
to the blending of computer-based sales within traditional
bricks-and-mortar shops. The impact of clicks-and-mortar on used
bookstores is undeniable, helping savvier owners sidestep many of
the problems ``new'' bookstores face from huge Internet and chain
competitors who can outstock them and reach customers around the
world. The number of used bookstores in the United States increased
14 percent between 1995 and 1999, according to a study conducted by
Book Hunter Press; Internet sales ranged from 10 percent to 50
percent of gross sales at stores online during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While media reports have chronicled the Internet's negative
impact on new bookstores, the opposite is the case with used
bookstores,'' the report concluded. ``The Internet has enabled many
used booksellers to expand their customer base to the entire world,
and at the same time, it has provided used bookstores with an
additional revenue stream that supplements their in-store traffic
and other non-Internet mail order sales.'' Instead of relying on
word-of-mouth, expensive catalogs or print ads that may or may not
be seen by customers, used bookstores can join others listing their
stock on searchable sites like Advanced Book Exchange
(www.abe.com), Bibliofind (www.bibliofind.com) or even Internet
uberforce Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Potential drawbacks for ``bricks-and-mortar'' stores include the
time and expense of maintaining their Web site lists and responding
to e-mail, while continuing to run a store. Atlanta Vintage Books
lists the same 5,000-plus books (out of an inventory of about
60,000) on all the sites it uses, including one it just joined at
an annual cost of $185.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only went on there because one of our very good customers,
who we've never met, asked us to,'' Otten explained while Swan
worked through a minor glitch in the first order via that Web site.
``When I looked it up, there were about 35 orders we'd gotten from
(the customer) in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   If clicks-and-mortar operations like Atlanta Vintage Books
ultimately succeed, it likely will be for the most old-fashioned
reason: Customers think they can count on the people who run them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawkins is such a customer. The Greenville, S.C., Top 40
radio disc jockey was referred to Vintage Books by another store. A
collector of volumes in a particular biographical series and by
``Tarzan'' creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, he still goes online
occasionally to do research and look for books. Increasingly,
though, he finds himself dialing the phone to speak directly with
Atlanta Vintage Books manager Carrie Stikeleather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like calling your family and saying `I need this,'''
Hawkins said fondly about the store and staff he has never laid
eyes on. ``Everyone there has been great. I know I can trust
Carrie. If she says I need it, I need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he ever venture to Atlanta, Otten vows, the store will be
there. For her, the Internet could never entirely replace spending
time in a shop where every customer or book is potentially a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to make a lot more money doing this,'' Otten said
on a recent weekday morning when the people in the store included a
woman checking out a book of dog drawings she had seen described
online, and a book ``scout'' offering a carton full of Nabokovs and
Ferlinghettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make a fortune on the Internet and I'd just have to
hire someone to type up orders all day,'' Otten said. ``But that's
not the type of store any of us want.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   GET COOKIN': Groceries and gourmet food
</P>
<P>
   webvan.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: When it launches officially May 1, webvan.com
will sell most everything you'd find in your local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: You mean there's something to like besides the
fact that they'll deliver to your doorstep, whenever you want? Cool
weekly menus that offer suggestions for dinner _ you can buy
prepared dishes or simply click on the recipe link and make it
yourself. You pay for your order online by providing your credit or
debit card information during checkout, so you don't have to worry
about paying when the delivery gets there _ and couriers are
instructed not to accept tips or gratuities. Delivery is free for
orders of $50 or more and only $4.95 for orders under $50. However,
from now through July 31, delivery is free for all orders.
</P>

cookware and appliances. Big selection of specialty foods, too.

instance. Or by brand _ All-Clad, T-Fal, KitchenAid.

<P>
   tavolo.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Specialty foods, cookbooks, kitchen and
tableware.

</P>
<P>
   living.com
</P>

</P>
<P>
   What we like: One of the coolest things about this very smooth,
very thorough site, is the Stylefinder. Click on one of the
``rooms'' _ Classic, Urban, Mission, etc. A bigger photo comes up,
with a list on the right side, of everything in the room. When you
move your mouse to a word, say ``end table with drawer,'' a yellow
box on the photo moves over to indicate which is the end table.
Pretty cool.

stuff.

it's cool. And this site has really neat, well-designed stuff _
that goes from the inexpensive to the obscene. Where else can you
get a soap dispenser that looks like one of those novelty birds
that bobs for water? From Germany? For $18? Or a Japanese Weather
Clock for $72 that gives you the time and weather. A hairbrush for
$23? Yes, but it's such a perfectly designed hairbrush.

</P>
<P>
   lucy.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Women's sports apparel.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Clothing, accessories, jewelry, pet, apothecary,
home.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The fact that you won't end up looking just like

   pieceunique.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: An online classified marketplace of recent and
vintage fashions from top designers.
</P>
<P>

such names as Armani, Chanel, Karan, Versace, Prada, Gucci, Hermes
and more. Recently, a Calvin Klein ``mint condition'' silk
sleeveless navy blue dress, size 6, that retailed for $895 was
going for $425.

</P>
<P>
   MEN: intmale.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's swimwear, apparel, shoes and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The longtime International Male fashion catalog
has an impressive Web site. One cool thing is that when you go to
``tops,'' for instance, you get a choice of short sleeve, long
sleeve, sleeveless, tank, novelty and sweaters. You don't have to
plow through a zillion choices.
</P>
<P>
   etuxedo.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Discount tuxedos, shirts and accessories.
</P>
<P>

just need to take the suit somewhere for alterations. The site also
links to eSuits for discount suits, sport coats, slacks and
blazers.
</P>
<P>
   MEN AND WOMEN: jcrew.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's and women's clothes and accessories.

</P>
<P>
   brooksbrothers.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's and women's clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: When in doubt, there's always Brooks Brothers _
and their Web site makes it real easy to buy their always timeless
clothes. Our favorite thing? When you click on any item for an
enlarged view, you still get links to options in that category
(blazers, shirts, shoes) on the left side of the page.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS AND TEENS:
</P>
<P>
   delias.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Teen girls' clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: First, that the girl on the home page when we were
shopping looked like a real teenager _ not too skinny, not
unrealistically glam. The prices are low, the choices plentiful.
And, even the strictest parents may rest at ease: Most of the
clothes, even the flirty dresses, are appropriate for your little
girls.
</P>
<P>
   gapkids.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Clothes for boys and girls _ not as extensive a
selection as in the store, but you don't have to fight the traffic
at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The sales pages, which are usually pretty full of
options, and you don't have to struggle through those jam-packed
sales racks at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   GET RICH: Or, at least, get some help managing your money
</P>
<P>
   doughnet.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Financial services and advice for teenagers (and
their parents).
</P>
<P>
   What we like: That it's a site for teenagers to learn to manage
their money. The site also links to online merchants and when it's
time to check out, doughnet.com takes over and reminds the shoppers
how much they have in their accounts, what the balance will be
after the transaction, and if they'd like to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Financial planning services.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Lots of advice. Invest in the market, refinance
your mortgage, check your bank statements online, compare insurance
rates, or plan for your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   GO LUXE: Jewelry and luxury sites
</P>
<P>
   miadora.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: High-quality jewelry for the high-maintenance
person with a budget to match. You can buy a simple 18K diamond
ring for $375, or upgrade to the 18K platinum diamond ring for
$1,625. Or how about an elegant Cartier diamond baignoire
wristwatch for $12,990? You know you deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ashford.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Watches and clocks; vintage watches; diamonds
and bridal; designer jewelry; writing accessories; leather goods
and handbags; ties and scarves; fragrances bath and body; and
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This site advertises ``all the stuff you really,
really want,'' and if money's no object, you'll find it here. But
if you're on a budget you can still find some reasonably priced
items. For example, sorting by price, a Pierre Cardin man's
wristwatch at half price, just $40. At the other end of the scale,
there's an RGM Automatic Chronograph 105S men's wristwatch for
$26,000.
</P>
<P>
   luxuryfinder.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: With a name like that, what do you think?
</P>
<P>
   What we like: In fairness, let's point out that you can buy many
fine products here for $125 or less. But what fun is that? Let's
look at some of the big-ticket items: A signed first edition of
``Finnegans Wake'' by James Joyce, $10,500. An early 19th century
Regency Period cut glass chandelier, $96,315.
</P>
<P>
   GET PAMPERED: Beauty sites
</P>
<P>
   gloss.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Beauty products and advice, a virtual makeover,
magazine and gift center.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This site is about to become the online outpost of
Estee Lauder, which bought the site a few weeks ago. Gloss.com will
still offer a variety of products including Bobbie Brown Essentials
and MAC. It also has a decent selection of products for men.
</P>
<P>
   GET OUT OF TOWN: Travel and travel accessories
</P>
<P>
   ebags.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Luggage, backpacks and other bags for all
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: You need a new gym bag, your spouse needs a
suitcase and your kid wants a knapsack for school. Here's one place
to get 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   expedia.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel plans _ from airfare to car rentals to
hotels
</P>
<P>
   What we like: It's really good one-stop shopping. Go to the
hotels page and you have links to travelscape.com, which offers
hotel room at up to 70 percent off standard room rates around the
world. The Vacation Wizard helps you choose from hundreds of
packaged trips based on your specific criteria, including
destination, price, and activities.
</P>
<P>
   air4less.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Discounted airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: No fuss, no muss. Whereas expedia.com is a
behemoth, all-purpose site, air4less.com makes it easy ``in just 3
clicks'' to reserve tickets.
</P>
<P>
   travelocity.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel plans _ from airfare to car rentals to
hotels to cruises.

</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel arrangements, vehicles, home financing,
groceries, yard sale items.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Aside from those annoying William Shatner
commercials, this is a good sight for serious bargain hunters. You
specify what you want to buy or when you want to travel, and how
much you want to pay for it. The site looks for a match and replies
within an hour.
</P>
<P>

   iGadget.com

<P>
   What they sell: High-tech gadgets of all kinds
</P>
<P>
   What we like: What's not to like about a site that identifies
itself as ``Where 007 does his shopping''? If you're looking for a
Viper Night Vision Goggle System, you can get one here for $399.99.
Or a Global Positioning System unit, pocket-sized, for $179.99. Or,
to be more practical, a Panasonic Linear Drive Electric Shaver for
$189.99.

   What we like: This is the art site for the masses _ a little
less highbrow than guild.com. Heavy on the reproductions and
posters, which fill the home page.
</P>
<P>
   GIMME! GIMME!: Cool gifts for weddings, graduations, Mother's
and Father's days, whenever
</P>
<P>
   redenvelope.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Personal and corporate gifts.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Clean, lots of choices, upscale too. Buying is
easy because the categories are clear and useful.
</P>
<P>
   della.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: There are two sites _ a wedding gift registry
and gifts for other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Very clear, very upscale, very creative. Lots of
cool options _ gifts you may never have thought of _ and some you
have. For weddings, everything from a Simon Pearce glass from
Gump's to a REI Trail Dome 2-person backpacking tent. For other
gifts, options from New York's Museum of Modern Art to Gump's to
Amazon. Teen gifts, for example, include Urban Decay Body Paints to
Go from Eve.com for $12, the Backstreet Boys' ``Millennium'' CD
from Amazon.com for $13.28, and a St. Johns Marathons 1919 baseball
cap by Blue Marlin for $29.99 from Fogdog.
</P>
<P>
   maryscorner.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: This site, named for CEO Mary Spear, promises
``exceptional goods for extraordinary living.''
</P>
<P>
   What we like: It's imaginative and fun to browse. Pamper
yourself with a hydrating body mist ($12), keep time on your hands
with a ring watch for $29.50, accessorize your activities (Miro
Tapestry Bag, $38); please your pooch with a doggy chew toy (Big
Mean Kitty or Cat Burglar, each $13.50); or satisfy your chocolate
cravings (Belgium Dark Chocolate Sauce, $16.95). For men, the
offerings aren't great _ so, guys, head for a sporting goods site.
</P>
<P>
   giftemporia.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Gifts from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The fact that metro Atlanta is represented. Forget
driving: buy a Lady Bug Light, $192, from City Art Works in
Atlanta; Gardenview table accessories, $40 - $55, from The
Chandlery in Roswell; a Dedham Strawberry Sorbet Rabbit figure for
$68 from Hospitality House in Atlanta; an elephant-shaped
footstool, $199, from Affairs for the Home in Duluth.

 &HT;    Hundreds of sites vying for attention
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How much would you pay for this newspaper? The day may
be coming _ thanks to the growing popularity of Web auctions _ when
the consumer sets the price and merchants compete to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of all Web auction sites is eBay, a place where many
Web users first learned of the excitement of an online auction. The
site, www.ebay.com, is still one of the Web's most popular places
to buy and trade. To participate, you'll need to register with the
site, but the process is easy and free. Once registered, you'll be
able to make bids to buy products listed and sell your own items.
The site takes a fee from sellers to help pay the freight.
</P>
<P>
   The fee system is a bit complex and varies based on the value of
the item and other factors. Here's how eBay describes it:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put an item up for auction and set the opening bid for
$5, your insertion fee will be 25 cents. Then let's say that at the
end of your auction, the high bid is $20. The $20 is used to
calculate your Final Value fee (a percentage of the final sale
price). In this instance, it's $1. ... For this example, you would
pay eBay $1.25.''
</P>
<P>
   But eBay was just the pebble that helped to create the Internet
auction avalanche. There are now literally hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of auction sites online.
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of just how many, take a look at an
excellent site called Internet Auction List _ Largest Auction
Directory. It's located at www.internetauctionlist.com/. If you
look at the left side of the page, you'll see that the listings of
the various auction sites are divided by category. There are way
too many categories to list, but, as examples, you'll find
groupings of sites for automobiles, aviation, bankruptcy, boats,
clothing, comics, consumer electronics, firearms and farm
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sites that collect links to the hundreds of auction sites on the
Web are especially valuable, because if you are selling a rare
collectible you are most likely to get a good price for it from an
informed audience of specialists. So you should bookmark another
collection of auction links called BidFind at www.bidfind.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Here as well, the auction pages are grouped according to
category. While the category names differ slightly, it's the same
idea and the same basic categories.
</P>
<P>
   One excellent feature of BidFind is the listing of new auction
sites that appears on the right side of the page. That's valuable,
since new auction sites seem to be popping up with great frequency,
and some of the newest offer special promotional deals as a way of
building an audience.
</P>
<P>
   So be sure to check out the newest sites (but keep in mind that
there are no guarantees of a site's ethics or legitimacy, so you'll
want to be a smart consumer as you try sites without a track
record).
</P>
<P>
   Now that Web auction sites are old hat to most Web shoppers, the
reverse auction site has become very trendy _ such as Priceline.com
(www.priceline.com). The slogan of that site explains the notion of
reverse auctions in just a few words: ``Name your own price and
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reverse auction site worth watching is called
NetgenShopper.Com and is located at www .netgenshopper.com. You
simply register (free) and fill out a form telling about the item
you want to buy. Then sellers contact you, offering their best
price on that item.

 &HT;    Major retailers going online
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to e-shopping strategies, there are
typically two ways a company can turn. Either build a Web site and
manage it in-house, or outsource all or part of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller dot-com start-ups or niche retailers are in that zone
where it's attractive to them to have it outsourced,'' said Steve
Simpson, a partner in the e-retailing group of Deloitte &AMP; Touche in
Atlanta. ``But some of the more mature retailers have built up
large IT capabilities and can handle it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some metro Atlanta companies think it's better to source out
their e-commerce needs because it's less labor intensive and less
costly to keep up with technology if someone else is doing the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Home Depot, prefer handling their own
cyberstores.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot has decided to build its own e-commerce
site and the company plans to manage it. The Web site will have a
comprehensive inventory that closely matches the home improvement
retailer's stores. That's about 50,000 products, with potential for
up to 300,000 products, said spokesman Don Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that tallies up quite an undertaking to bring this
online,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement retailer plans to do a market by market
roll-out starting this summer. Though Home Depot has not revealed
which markets will come first, shoppers can expect to start surfing
Home Depot's site sometime in July. The retailer is using IXL
Enterprises Inc., an Internet strategy company, as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 7-month-old Figleaves.com wants to leave the Web site
development to the experts. The Atlanta-based intimate apparel
start-up, which began selling undergarments on its site last
December, is in discussions to outsource its e-commerce work to
Deloitte Consulting. Deloitte would build and host Figleaves.com's
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figleaves is in the `soft wear' business, not software,'' said
Ari Straus, the company's chief executive officer. ``The concept of
shared risk created the hot application service provider market.
Today, these solutions support the needs of young, growing
companies like Figleaves. Tomorrow, they'll actually support
businesses like Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers are finding that combining strategies is the way
to go. Such is the case with Wolf Camera.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera reached an agreement with Outpost.com in late March.
While Wolf Camera maintains control over its Web site in-house,
Outpost.com will handle any fulfillment and customer service needs
when shoppers click on the Wolfxpress.com site listed on
Outpost.com. Outpost.com also has a wider audience to help Wolf
Camera reach more of the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf Camera spokesman Wayne Freedman said having their functions
in-house means employees understand the company's objectives and
missions.
</P>
<P>
   The linkup with Outpost.com puts orders in customers' hands
faster, Freedman said. That's an advantage, he added, to know
Outpost.com can fulfill orders until 9 p.m. and guarantee that
customers would have it on their desks by the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The latest snapshot for what's to come for e-revenues points to
big growth online until 2004. U.S. consumers are expected to spend
$38.8 billion in online purchases in 2000, according to Forrester
Research of Cambridge, Mass. By 2004, that figure will be $184
billion, or 7 percent of all retail sales, the report says.
Forrester predicts that online shopping will hit a spending plateau
in 2004, until Generation Y creates the next surge in e-commerce
around 2010 _ when they hit their prime earning years. In the
meantime, the industry expects a major shakeout of less-successful
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, retailers and e-tailers are trying to reach
their customers any way they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control how people shop,'' said Evan Schwartz,
author of ``Webonomics'' and ``Digital Darwinism,'' two books on
e-commerce. ``They're going to shop in different channels provided
you offer the same products, the same prices and return policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have learned the hard way that consumers want to buy
what they want, when they want, where they want, and at the price
they want _ whether it's online, in-store, or by catalog, mail
order or phone.
</P>
<P>
   Does the ``customer is always right'' come to mind?
</P>
<P>
   But that message isn't getting through to some retailers.
Haverty's Furniture for instance, has a Web site, but it's a
browsing tool, not a cyberstore where you can place orders for that
new four-poster bed. John Slater, president and chief executive of
the furniture chain, said that 15 percent of all delivered
furniture is canceled or exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is one of the most wonderful tools to come along
for consumers and retailers _ it's right up there with
television,'' Slater said. ``But I don't believe that sales of
big-ticket items that are personal can be made over the Internet
without first sitting in that product.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich's, another Atlanta-based retailer, has a Web site, but does
not plan to expand it to sell apparel, shoes or furniture online.
But its sister chain, Macy's, does offer goods online at Macys.com.
Both chains are owned by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers are taking a cautious approach to their
e-commerce strategies because the formula for profitability is
still being hammered out. And Wall Street is still waiting for
online giants, such as Amazon.com, to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional retailers have responded at least fairly
well,'' Schwartz said. ``But I still think a lot of them are
behind.''

 &HT;    Bringing home the bacon a brand new way
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They've done it. They have finally done it. They have
come up with a gimmick to lure men into grocery shopping. It's
called shopping for groceries using Priceline.com, a kind of
win-win lottery that turns buying diapers into a game.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, familiar to many of us as the outfit that
auctions airplane seats and hotel rooms, has a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking up with Winn-Dixie and Bi-Lo here in metro Atlanta,
Priceline now has us bidding for baby carrots, live lobsters and
Folgers coffee.
</P>
<P>
   I can testify that just a little time and practice has me
trimming 25 percent and more off food and grocery items and having
a lot more fun than sitting on the floor clipping coupons.
</P>
<P>
   There are several online approaches to shopping _ some, like
Peapod and Webvan, aimed at meeting the needs of busy, working
households. The Priceline service, however, focusing on cost
saving, addresses the pocketbook issue that is precious to many
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole process struck me at first as kind of clunky and slow,
even on my speedy computer, but with some practice _ and
considerable savings _ I warmed up. Saving money makes you patient,
and while it has limitations and is not the whole answer to grocery
shopping, the Priceline game clearly could gain fans among the
computer crowd _ especially those whose minds may not turn to
groceries until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in a ``guy'' way, I figured the smartest approach
to this grocery auction business was to go for the commodities, the
big-ticket items that are consumed heavily _ the detergents, paper
towels, toilet tissue and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad idea. I bid successfully for three 92-ounce boxes of
Tide at $3.55 each and three triple-roll packages of Brawny paper
towels at $1.57 each, which experienced shoppers will recognize as
a saving of nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   Getting bolder, I went for an immediate need, kitty litter, and
wrestled away three 14-pound containers of Tidy Cats Scoop Cat
Litter for $4.52 each, though they sold off the shelf for about
$6.50.
</P>
<P>
   On a roll, I have now gone for coffee, juices and bottled water.
I'm even eyeing those live lobsters. What fun!
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works.
</P>
<P>
   First you take out a membership, obtain a Priceline card and
submit a credit or debit card that is stored in the system's
memory, allowing you to pay online, in advance, for items as you
strike deals.
</P>
<P>
   Then you go to the main shopping page and begin compiling your
shopping list, cruising the cyber-aisles and making choices. When
you select an item, the bargaining begins with a pop-up screen that
offers three or more brands, all of the same size.
</P>
<P>
   It tells you the going shelf-price range of the items and
invites your bid, advising that you have a ``great chance'' to get
your choice with an offer of 85 percent of the list price. It's a
good chance at 66 percent, a fair chance at 50 percent and a poor
chance at 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing rejection, you tend to go high as a beginner, but later
you take chances and learn that if you are rejected at a low price,
you can always inch back upward.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement comes when you have compiled your list and
submitted the collective bids.
</P>
<P>
   A suspenseful minute passes as an on-screen display that looks
like a slot machine spins, alternating ``yes'' and ``sorry'' next
to each item, and then finally the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   You confirm your acceptance of the sales prices; your bank
account or charge card, as you prefer, is automatically debited,
then out prints your shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   You then go to the store, pick up your items from the shelf,
where you can see plainly how much you saved on each, and then you
check out, running your Priceline card through the slot. It
dutifully reports you have already paid.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick up your groceries, you begin to learn how and why
this is worthwhile for the retailers.
</P>
<P>
   First, I have never picked up the items without also picking up
other items that catch my eye. So luring me into the store results
automatically in additional sales, either from impulse or from me
remembering empty spots on the pantry shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not for everybody. It is very slow and
time-consuming at times. Many favorite brands or product sizes are
not offered, even though they are in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that battle to limit yourself to the bargains,
and the fight not to give in to picking up additional impulse
items. But there is appeal, a novelty, that could catch on. But
what's the reasoning behind the grocery auction?
</P>
<P>
   Karen Brown, senior vice president of the Washington-based Food
Marketing Institute, gives a grocer's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about going after all the types of customers out there,''
she said. ``It's about searching for ways to help and enhance a
shopping experience, using all of the technologies and other
approaches at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   While many consumers are drawn to the convenience of Peapod and
Webvan, services that deliver goods to the home at a price, others
are interested in bottom-line savings, as reflected in the ardent
pursuit of discount coupons in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline approach, which is being adopted in partnership
with supermarket chains all across the country, adds a bit of the
glitz and glamour of gamesmanship, tapping into an experience that
many online shoppers recognize from eBay and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose organization represents supermarkets and online
retail services, says the Priceline service is one of many
experiments in progress as the volume-sensitive grocery business
struggles to build traffic in stores and online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing in retail as the average customer,''
Brown said, ``but we do what we can to pull together all of the
segments.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the cost of the bargains to the retailers?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the cost is being borne now by wholesalers and
retailers in an effort to build the volume, though there are
obvious questions about how long the sizable discounts can last.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodgett, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, says he is
optimistic about Priceline's possibilities in near term but wonders
what will happen when the ``grand opening'' sale runs its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the
consumers won't be getting such a great deal,'' Blodgett said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that all seems far away. For now, let's go after those
live lobsters for next weekend!

 &HT;    Office 2000 shows Microsoft's prowess
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While I do not expect to lose any sleep wondering what
will become of Microsoft, I will say this for Bill and his Merry
Men and Women: They have given us some pretty fine software.
</P>
<P>
   Looking over Office 2000, and the portions of it that I use
regularly, it is undoubtedly the best collection of the standard
programs available today.
</P>
<P>
   Take FrontPage, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   I've been through most of the Web creation programs on the
market. The really simple ones are capable of creating only really
simple Web sites _ usually the one-page kind your children might
wish to set up. A couple of pictures, ``Hi! I'm Eric! I Love The
X-Files!'' _ that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated ones are, in my experience, a very mixed
bag. I put up a fairly complicated site using Symantec's Virtual
Page, and it was a chore. Strange things occurred _ like huge gaps
between one line of text and the other _ for reasons I could never
determine.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all _ and this is not all the fault of Virtual Page, by
any means _ the site looked entirely different depending on which
browser you used to examine it. It usually looked better in
Microsoft Internet Explorer. As a result, after years of resisting
attempts to shove Explorer down my throat, I began using it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   When Office 2000 arrived, I pulled all the elements of my site
into FrontPage and worked on picture alignment, so difficult in
Virtual Page that I just about gave up using pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It looks a lot better now, although there are still some
discrepancies between browsers. That, I fear, is unavoidable. But
FrontPage is, as far as I'm concerned, head and shoulders above the
rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Word will certainly remain my high-powered writing program, too
_ although I must admit that WordPad meets 98 percent of the
requirements I'm ever likely to have. Most people who write, I
believe, do not make huge demands on a writing program. (I'm trying
to avoid the accursed phrase ``word processor'' here. Food may need
processing; words do not.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, what is there beyond cut and paste, paste and drag,
find and replace, spellcheck and undo? Well, it's fun to play with
fonts once in a while, put things in italics and look at print
preview to make sure you got it all on one page, but the rest of a
huge program like Word is used primarily by secretaries, and people
like professors and researchers who must write formal papers for
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The big thing in Word 2000 seems to be foreign languages. You
can set it up to write in a huge number of languages and to
translate between them, too. And, with a nod to those writers with
special needs, when you choose New under the File menu, you can
find a vast array of choices in addition to good old Blank Page.
</P>
<P>
   Writing a report? You can choose among Contemporary Report,
Elegant Report and Professional Report. I have no idea what you
must do if you want an elegant, contemporary, professional report
all in one.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legal pleading wizard to help you through the
construction of a legal pleading. Unfortunately, no simple begging
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   So I suppose there's still room for improvement.

 &HT;    An eBay trip offers lots of information for browsers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whether you do it online or at a real-world flea
market, there's nothing quite like the thrill of buying something
you want and not having to pay full price for it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a discount clothing chain that uses the slogan
``Everybody loves a bargain.'' At the moment, some of the hottest
sites on the Web are auction sites that let you bid on anything
from vintage china and dolls to airline tickets and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions bring the thrills and chills of bidding on rare
and unique items to people who used to think auctions were all
about society matrons in mink and pearls bidding on impressionist
paintings in fancy New York auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. You don't have to be a millionaire to go
online and bid on everything from vintage Wedgwood china to compact
discs. Bargains abound, and for novice collectors it can be
educational, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one example: Not too long ago, I went to a flea market
and bought a set of vintage china for what I was pretty sure was an
outstanding bargain.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine was more skeptical. ``You should get on eBay
and see what it's really worth,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   I went straight to eBay the first chance I had. I scrolled
through three pages of pictures and descriptions of my new china.
Judging by the auctioneers' prices and the current bids, I'm happy
to say I did get a pretty good deal.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear exactly when Web auctioneer eBay (www.ebay.com)
became the last word on flea market bargains. However, there is no
doubt that eBay was one of the founders of the ``name your price''
craze sweeping the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just this past week eBay showed Wall Street that
there's gold in all those pages of what may look like junk.
First-quarter operating results for the online auctioneer exceeded
expectations as the amount of merchandise sold on its site
surpassed $77 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of Fiestaware.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to eBay in a while, this might be a good
time to take another look. The site has been completely redesigned
to make the virtual flea market experience much easier than it used
to be. Users can click on a tab called ``gallery'' in their
selected area and just view pictures and current bids on the items
they are interested in. You can find out what a certain collectible
is going for on the eBay market or just browse the selection of
goods available.
</P>
<P>
   This is much better than the old eBay, which was just a text
list. You took a chance that the item you clicked on would be
something you might want. This was time-consuming and, unless you
were a very serious collector, not that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The new method lets you see the dishes, watches, oriental rugs
or whatever captures your fancy before you decide to find out more
about the item or even place a bid.
</P>
<P>
   While I was making sure my flea market china was truly a
bargain, I also learned a lot about my new china as I read the
descriptions the sellers posted with their items. Some of the
auctioneers were dealers who had shops in cities and towns across
the country and offered links to related sites, collectors' clubs
and other points of interest. If you want to begin a collection,
eBay can help you learn about various items and how much you can
expect to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Passing time on eBay doesn't have to be about shopping. It's a
great place to play your own at-home version of the hot PBS series
``Antiques Roadshow.'' Here's all you have to do: Find an item in
your house you think might be worth some money. Then head over to
eBay to see if there is a matching category for your collectible.
</P>
<P>
   You might be pleasantly surprised, as was my friend Alex after
browsing eBay's Beatles section. To her great surprise, she found
that a book about making the film ``A Hard Day's Night,'' which she
had bought in a dollar store, is fetching nearly $50 on eBay. Think
about that the next time you see a bin of remaindered books.
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you have a couple of million or just a couple of
hours, online auctions can teach you about fine art or oriental
rugs or just help you figure out how much that strange bowl in your
grandmother's living room is really worth.
</P>
<P>
   It's e-commerce with a kick.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Nyko's Viper PSX ($30; www.nyko.com) is the slickest, most
functional, coolest, highest-tech video game controller on the
market. Any PlayStation gamer without it is underpowered. It comes
in sexy translucent colors, has an auto-fire turbo mode _ useful
for scrolling shooters _ and can function in digital or analog
modes even with games that shouldn't. The only real drawback is
that the cord is a little short and forces one to sit about a foot
closer to the electromagnetic wash of that big screen TV in the
living room. That can't be good for the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK, MA, NO WIRES
</P>
<P>
   If your Sony PlayStation controller wires are weaving a tangled
web, try MadCatz's new wireless Dual Force controllers ($40;
www.madcatz.com). These little marvels are easy to set up and a
blast to use. Plug the receiver into the controller port on your
PlayStation and you're good to go. They look and function just like
Sony's Dual Shock controllers but can be configured to function as
a TV remote, allowing you to channel-surf while the game is loading
or to mute the volume when the phone rings. MadCatz's Dual Force
controllers feel good, look cool and function perfectly.

 &HT;    Croc2: Newer isn't always better
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   For gaming with kids, the original Croc was a fun romp with lots
of eye candy and a cute little backpack-wearing crocodile. And
though the sequel, Croc2 (Fox Interactive, $20, for PC and
consoles), is fun, some unfortunate changes have robbed the concept
of a lot of its zip. As in the original, Croc must battle little
red imps and an array of cartoonish monsters in a silly-scary but
beautiful 3-D world, whacking them with his tail and a loud
''kerpow!'' Croc2 also adds fun new vehicles such as go-carts and
speedboats, as well as a larger-feeling world. But overall it's a
step down from the straightforward fun of Croc with its misguided
attempt at simplifying the controls _ you simply have less control
_ and annoying conversations with characters that interrupt play.
Also frustrating are bugs that make some simple tasks impossible
and the removal of the original camera controls. The bottom line is
that Croc2 is still a fun game, but somewhere on a corporate
flip-chart at Fox Interactive are a lot of mediocre ideas that
somehow made it into the game.

 &HT;    Domain name isn't hard to get
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm interested in getting a domain name and business going on
the Internet. I've contacted a domain registrar, and they quoted a
price of $19.95 for a year. Is that in the ballpark? I'd like more
information about registering and hosting.
</P>
<P>
   _Ernie M. Margate, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Ernie isn't the only one with domain name questions.
There are lots of you. Right off the bat, let's define ``domain
name.'' Finding something on the Internet can be like trying to
find a contact lens or the back of an earring. A domain name was
invented to make it easier.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: A domain name corresponds to an address _ or string of
numbers like a Social Security number _ that identify and locate a
computer or server on the Web (Yahoo.com vs. 204.71.200.243). The
domain name is meant to be catchy and easy to remember so that
surfers can find Web sites and send e-mail to a familiar name
without having to commit numbers to memory or tattoo them on their
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Why would someone want a domain name? Well, do you have a
Web page on the hard drive of your computer that you want to share
with the world? Like Ernie, do you want to start a business on the
Internet? Registering a domain name is the first step.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You want a name that springs to mind quickly, isn't hard to
spell. And, if you're starting a business, gives you some sort of
name branding. Pick an alternate or two because domain names gotta
be unique, so you gotta be creative.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Got five minutes? Let's register. Check the availability
of your preferred domain name with InterNIC (www.internic.net/).
Domain registrars have sprung up all over. InterNIC has a great
list. Heck, we also did a yahoo.com search on ``domain
registrars.'' Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Prices to register are all over the map. $12 a year. $34 a
year. $60 for two years. Do research. Some will just register the
name. Others wrap registration, monthly hosting and e-mail
account(s) into a Web hosting package. Look to your own ISP for
registration and hosting options.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You may end up tacking on charges depending on the size
and type of site. If you'll be running a business like Ernie, you
may want e-commerce features. E-commerce packages allow people
visiting your Web store to make purchases. Visitors can fill up a
shopping cart with merchandise and check out with a credit card.
Sites like Amazon.com, Sundance.com, etc., allow online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Know what? You don't even need to be a Web developer to
create a Web store. Hosts can make it as easy as a few clicks. They
walk you through registering, setting up and designing your site,
and making it ``e-commerceable.''
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Based on test version, Windows Millennium's a winner
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few weeks ago, I sat down at my computer to install
still another new version of Windows. This is the version that will
be released later this year to replace Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat there and listened to the hard disk spin and whir, I
realized I was in danger of feeling nostalgic about a computer
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mind getting misty-eyed over a sunset or walks on the
beach in Oregon, but I hadn't planned to turn into the kind of guy
who gets warm and tingly over Windows. Truth is, back when I
installed the first version of Windows ever, it was little more
than a poorly done rip-off of the Macintosh operating system. It
would have had to improve greatly to aspire to bad.
</P>
<P>
   But by now I've used all the versions, including Windows 2000,
which is aimed at the business market and was released this year.
Over the years, Windows has gotten better. And the latest version,
Millennium Edition (which ends up with the too-cute nickname of
ME), is the best Windows yet, at least on first impression. Don't
rush to the store yet. It's still a beta, or test, release, but _
to start with a highly technical evaluation _ it works real good.
</P>
<P>
   I installed the test edition of Millennium on my home PC. If
that machine was a human it would need a good therapist. So many
programs have been installed and removed, so many internal changes
have been made, that it crashes more often than the stock market
has lately. So I did not have high hopes when I installed Windows
ME.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that my Frankenstein of a computer has run
flawlessly since that moment. It hasn't frozen or crashed since.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ before I get carried away _ some disclaimers: For
starters, it's impossible to really judge something as complex as a
new edition of Windows after trying it for just a few weeks on a
single computer. And it is possible that a fresh installation of
any operating system would have made things better. But there are
some solid reasons why this new Windows should be more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Windows ME is not a radical departure from Windows 98.
That's good, not bad. Since much of the computer code stayed the
same, programmers were able to refine the way Windows works without
injecting a lot of new programs. For another, this new Windows
incorporates a technology called SFP, System File Protection. This
technology prevents new applications from mistakenly overwriting
old system files _ a fairly common problem _ and that keeps the
system more stable, according to Microsoft. For once, my computer
agrees with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Another noticeable advance is the speed with which Windows ME
loads and closes down. That may not seem like a big thing, but in
this instant world, most of us have grown to expect that kind of
response from microwaves, TVs and other gadgets. The reason for
this is technical _ Microsoft got rid of some of the old code used
in DOS operating systems that had hung around past its time _ but
you'll see the difference that has made and like it.
</P>
<P>
   The last item I'll mention may be the most important. Anyone who
has tried to use the interactive help features in Windows 98 will
appreciate this. The suggestions offered for fixing a problem were
often more complicated than the problem itself and could only be
understood by people so technically savvy that they didn't need the
help in the first place. The new interactive help truly does guide
you through fixing many common problems and doesn't start off with
the assumption that you are an honors graduate from MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Windows isn't perfect. But this new version is the most
worthwhile upgrade I've seen in a while. It's especially impressive
that I'm making this judgment based on a beta version of the
program, so _ with any luck at all _ the final shrink-wrap version
that you'll find in stores will be even better.

 &HT;    Savvy shoppers learn the rules before they begin
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Before you start your e-shopping adventures, here are some key
points to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   1. SECURITY: Most reputable Web retailers have secure ordering
forms to protect your personal information. They'll let you know
you are ordering via a secure connection. They also offer detailed
information about their security policies. If you aren't sure if a
site offers security, think twice before placing an order.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to check with your credit card companies
about security options they offer. For example, American Express
will not hold card members responsible for unauthorized charges
online. Nor are you responsible for the first $50 in unauthorized
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   2. PRIVACY POLICY: Technically, there's no law preventing any
Web site from giving out personal information about you to anyone
who asks. However, most retailers are sensitive to shoppers'
privacy concerns. Make sure each site you visit has a privacy
policy. Most of them do.
</P>
<P>
   3. CUSTOMER SERVICE: Most sites have automated e-mail systems
that tell you when they received your order, when they sent it and
when it is expected to arrive. Some e-tailers will send you postal
tracking numbers for your reference if there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   4. UNDERSTAND THE ORDER PROCESS: Remember, your order isn't
final until you hit the ``submit'' key. If your Internet connection
seems slow, or nothing seems to be happening, you might be tempted
to keep hitting ``submit'' as you would the buttons on an elevator
that just won't close. Don't do it! Each time you tap submit, you
could be creating another order. One click is all usually all you
need.

 &HT;    Web opens new doors for stores
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Going Cyber!''
</P>
<P>
   The handwriting is a bit crooked and hard to make out from a
distance, and yet the sign on the front door of ``The Family
Jewels'' in downtown Decatur, Ga. speaks volumes. Next week, the
13-year-old antiques and collectibles store will become an
online-only operation, joining a host of other businesses for whom
the Internet is the greatest thing to come along since customers
with unlimited lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can move anywhere in the world and I'll always have my
inventory with me,'' enthused owner Lisa Cohen. ``My computer is
the world!''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Jewels isn't going out of business. Only
``shifting,'' according to the hand-lettered sign. It's just one
more sign of these times, when countless business owners are using
the Internet to discover and develop their rightful niche in the
new economy.
</P>
<P>
   For some, it's a matter of staying right where they are, offline
and behind a counter. Others, like Cohen, come to see that they and
their customers would be better served by ``going cyber''
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like a beautiful Lalique bowl could sit in the store
for years because maybe only five people who came in knew what it
was and they didn't collect it,'' said Cohen, who's selling on
Yahoo and eBay and will do business by e-mail
(famjewlinc(at)aol.com), and her own Web site
(http://members.aol.com/famjewlinc/collect2/index.htm). ``But I put
it on the Internet and get 500 people who'll see it in seven days
and who'll know what they're looking at.''

 &HT;    Doing it my way, sort of
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnosk.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might have been the nearly silent episode of ``Law
&AMP; Order'' that finally did it.
</P>
<P>
   The sound on my television set had been faltering for quite a
while; now, when it practically went mute in the middle of
Detective Lenny Briscoe cracking wise, I decided it might be time
to buy a new one.
</P>
<P>
   This was not some lighthearted whim. I'd had that TV since
leaving college _ long enough that the cable company didn't even
have the right, suitably archaic, equipment to hook me up.
</P>
<P>
   Long enough to confirm the accuracy of a friend's observation
the year I went 13 weeks without owning a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have,'' he sighed, just before heading out to buy another
cold beer, ``a fear of commitment to new appliances.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the appliances so much as the actual shopping for them
that gives me agita. In fact, when it comes to shopping for almost
anything but basic essentials, all I can come up with are reasons
not to:
</P>
<P>
   _ The staff will be too dumb or too devious to sell me the right
thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ The traffic will be horrible, the parking nonexistent and my
car (7-years-old, ahem!) might need gas.
</P>
<P>
   _ What if I can't find what I want? (Worse, what if I can ?)
What if I have to return something?
</P>
<P>
   Why even bother?
</P>
<P>
   Why not just create the Me Store instead?
</P>
<P>
   It hit me the next morning, when I opened the yellow pages to
``Televisions'' and instantly felt overwhelmed. If only I could do
all my shopping online, I thought, I'd never have this problem. I
could buy exactly what I wanted, when I wanted, without ever having
to get into my car or out of my pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the perfect store. The ``Me Store.'' Always open,
always stocked with exactly what I wanted, never about another
human being's needs except mine. All mine!
</P>
<P>
   One month later, I'd bought a whole lot and learned even more.
Neither the Internet nor human nature is 100 percent predictable,
and so the complete Me Store may be something of a pipe dream _ for
now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure was fun trying. I shopped at many more sites than
the eight bookmarked below, but they're all representative of
something I learned along the way.
</P>
<P>
   So, where'd I finally end up buying that new TV? Well, just keep
reading .
</P>
<P>
   THE SITES
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com _ Everyone's heard of this behemoth hawking
everything from books to buzz saws. What few people realize is that
it has only one customer: Me! Seriously, I bought one measly thing
from them, and all of a sudden they couldn't stop thinking about
me. They greet me by name each I log on. They're constantly
compiling lists of books, videos and CDs they think I'd enjoy. I
sometimes get the feeling they're all just sitting around, waiting
for me to order something.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Flattery will definitely get you somewhere in
the Me Store.
</P>
<P>
   twinings.com _ The last time I cut myself, I bled Earl Grey. Not
all grocery stores carry English-made Twinings Teas but they
should. Even the Queen drinks nothing but! The site featured
Twinings teas I'd never even heard of, let alone seen in Kroger,
and a chart to determine which blend to drink when (``after
dinner'') and why (``to help with a cold or flu''). It even
converted your total order from pounds to dollars. Unfortunately,
the bloody thing crashed every time I tried to actually place an
order for two days, so I finally gave up and headed for Kroger.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Parts of the Me Store may not always be open.
</P>
<P>
   zabars.com _ What am I, chopped liver? Like New Year's Eve
celebrations and mob hits, the chopped chicken liver from Zabar's
is something we'll never quite see the likes of here. I'd rather go
without than go without Zabar's, so imagine my glee when the
venerable Upper West Side deli and gourmet food shop put up a Web
site. Even the fact that it's not yet set up to handle Internet
orders (you have to fax or phone) didn't deter me from droolingly
scanning the offerings: Corned beef, bagels-and-schmears, smoked
salmon, rugelach ... What, no chopped liver?! I fired off a
distraught e-mail and four days later, received a polite (well, for
New York) response to the effect that I had to phone, ask for
personal shopping and pay an extra $7.50 for what is, let's face
it, the guts of a chicken. Except for very special occasions, I
guess I'll have to do without.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Parts of the Me Store may still be under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   drugstore.com _ I'm getting awfully tired of wandering through
huge drug ``superstores,'' wondering why it's easier to find potato
chips than Q-tips and how come they can process film in an hour,
but you have to stand in line all day to buy Chap Stick.
Fortunately, there are huge drugstore Web sites I can wander
through, wondering whether I really want to go through all this
bother just to buy Chap Stick. Well, yes, since they also gave _
gave! _ me $20 worth of ``bath and spa'' products suitable for
washing away any lingering trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Zabar's, schmabar's ... Who says there's no free
lunch?!
</P>
<P>
   endlesspools.com _ I am a firm believer in the benefits of
regular exercise. Just so long as I don't have to, you know,
actually stand up or go outside to do it. Enter the Endless Pool, a
``counter-current swimming and water exercise machine'' _
basically, a teeny-tiny little swimming pool they build inside your
den or wine cellar so you can paddle in place. If you even have to
ask how much one of these babies costs (the Web site doesn't quote
prices), you know you can't afford it _ in my case, I'd have to
include the cost of buying a house, since I doubt my landlord would
let me install one in my apartment. If I walked into a store they'd
instantly have me pegged as a relatively impoverished poseur, but
what does a Web site know? They're sending me a free video,
brochures and ``other materials.'' Heck, it's only a matter of time
until I fake them into sending me a free pool!
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: I can be whoever I want in the Me Store.
Including Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   ivillage.com _ My niece is about to turn 11 in San Francisco and
she likes (in no particular order) clothes, baseball, the
Backstreet Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries. Stumped for a gift to
have sent to her (the operative phrase), I consider calling my
mother, but I know she's not home and besides, I'm really not up to
hearing about how she ran into some old boyfriend of mine (unless
he's fat and bald) and his wife (ditto). But this Web site that
bills itself as ``The Women's Network'' provides real human
``personal shoppers'' free of charge. Within the promised 48 hours,
Leslie e-mails me information about a San Francisco museum's
exhibition on ``The Science of Baseball.'' She also directs me to
ivillage's toy department. Leslie, I love you for trying, but the
ideal gift for an 11-year-old lies somewhere between toys and a
museum visit.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Call your mother. No, wait, there's more: The Me
Store really can't do your important thinking for you.
</P>
<P>
   delias.com calyxandcorolla.com _ Being a reporter pretty much
boils down to finding the right people to talk to, and then making
them talk. So it should be easy for me to complain to stores about
their products or services, right? Hah! You know the drill: You
talk to some teen clerk, who says you need to talk to the manager,
who vaguely promises to pass it along to ``corporate.'' If only the
big cheeses at ``corporate'' could hear from you directly about how
they done you wrong. Now, with e-mail, they can. Endlessly. While
it took Delia's six days to respond to my e-mail questioning their
handling of the aforementioned niece's birthday present, other Web
vendors seem to realize they've put a lot of eggs in the e-commerce
basket and are quite good about saying ``so sorry.'' Some are truly
spectacular about it: Calyx &AMP; Corolla didn't just apologize for
messing up an order; in a prompt e-mail that included (mistakenly,
I think) their interoffice communication about me, this purveyor of
gorgeous flowers gave me a whopping $75 credit. Hey, maybe I'll
send them flowers!
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: The customer is always right in the Me Store.
And the wronged customer can usually be bought off.
</P>
<P>
   circuitcity.com _ So, remember what started this whole thing? I
spent several days e-shopping for TVs: Flat TVs, fat TVs, TVs with
the VCR built right in. There were no traffic jams to suffer
through and no salespeople to feel stupid around; there was even
circuitcity.com's empathetic acknowledgment that ``Buying a TV/VCR
can be complicated with all the choices available today.'' My
feelings having finally been validated, I decided to click and buy.
That is, just as soon as I figured out what color I wanted. And the
screen size. VCR, inside or out? V-chip, yay or nay? Have it
delivered right to my door within days, or get in my car (aargh!)
and pick it up today at a Circuit City store near my home? Come to
think of it, my old TV wasn't so bad _ in fact, if I put my ear
right up against it and listened hard, I could actually hear
something, though it might just have been the sound of my heart
pounding at the mere thought of having to commit to a new
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: You can't fight human nature, not even in the Me
Store.

 &HT;    Vintage bookstore's horizons expanding
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's a mid-17th century Bible for sale and copies
of every Life magazine issue ever printed. Recently, an urgent
request came in for ``any and all pre-1960 poultry books.''
</P>
<P>
   Something interesting's always happening at Atlanta Vintage
Books, though the most intriguing development of late doesn't
involve what's on the shelves: Some of the store's best, most loyal
customers have never set foot in the place.
</P>
<P>
   They're cybershoppers. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they
may be helping rather than hurting independent stores savvy enough
to see venturing onto the Web as one more way of keeping their
doors open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of the business is steadily growing,'' said Alice
Otten, who took Atlanta Vintage Books online soon after buying the
store four years ago. ``Originally, 20 to 30 percent of our sales
in dollars were over the Internet. That's already up to about 40 to
45 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply a case of customers who once visited the
12-year-old store in search of Santayana or Tom Swift now logging
on instead. Otten said its Internet presence actually allows
Vintage Books, which is renowned for its children's, aviation and
African-American book areas, to reach new customers all over the
world. On a recent Friday morning employee A.R. Swan logged on and
found 21 e-mails waiting to be read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're totally expanding our customer base,'' said
Swan, who is primarily responsible for maintaining Vintage Books'
presence on five Internet sites and responding to e-mail orders and
inquiries. ``Very few of our online sales are to locals, and many
are repeat customers.''
</P>
<P>
   What those Internet shoppers may never get to see is a cozily
eclectic shop where the glass case filled with illuminated
manuscripts lies just beyond bookshelves labeled ``Nazi Germany''
and ``Whales,'' but before ``Success'' and ``Climate.'' Where the
47-volume, circa-1898, English Classics collection of Shakespeare's
works is, alas, not signed by the author, but Suzanne Somers'
poetry book is.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Internet users everywhere could react
instantly when a copy of ``The Duke Kahanamoku Story'' recently
washed up at Atlanta Vintage Books. Priced at $65, the bio of the
circa-1920s Olympic gold medal swimmer, early surfer, sometime
movie actor and later, sheriff in his native Honolulu, was sold
within 10 minutes of being listed online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got over 100 calls and e-mails,'' Swan laughingly recalled.
``Surfer guys saying, `Heey dude!,' people from the South Pacific.
I don't think it ever even made it onto the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon _ sometimes called ``clicks-and-mortar,'' refers
to the blending of computer-based sales within traditional
bricks-and-mortar shops. The impact of clicks-and-mortar on used
bookstores is undeniable, helping savvier owners sidestep many of
the problems ``new'' bookstores face from huge Internet and chain
competitors who can outstock them and reach customers around the
world. The number of used bookstores in the United States increased
14 percent between 1995 and 1999, according to a study conducted by
Book Hunter Press; Internet sales ranged from 10 percent to 50
percent of gross sales at stores online during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While media reports have chronicled the Internet's negative
impact on new bookstores, the opposite is the case with used
bookstores,'' the report concluded. ``The Internet has enabled many
used booksellers to expand their customer base to the entire world,
and at the same time, it has provided used bookstores with an
additional revenue stream that supplements their in-store traffic
and other non-Internet mail order sales.'' Instead of relying on
word-of-mouth, expensive catalogs or print ads that may or may not
be seen by customers, used bookstores can join others listing their
stock on searchable sites like Advanced Book Exchange
(www.abe.com), Bibliofind (www.bibliofind.com) or even Internet
uberforce Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Potential drawbacks for ``bricks-and-mortar'' stores include the
time and expense of maintaining their Web site lists and responding
to e-mail, while continuing to run a store. Atlanta Vintage Books
lists the same 5,000-plus books (out of an inventory of about
60,000) on all the sites it uses, including one it just joined at
an annual cost of $185.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only went on there because one of our very good customers,
who we've never met, asked us to,'' Otten explained while Swan
worked through a minor glitch in the first order via that Web site.
``When I looked it up, there were about 35 orders we'd gotten from
(the customer) in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   If clicks-and-mortar operations like Atlanta Vintage Books
ultimately succeed, it likely will be for the most old-fashioned
reason: Customers think they can count on the people who run them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawkins is such a customer. The Greenville, S.C., Top 40
radio disc jockey was referred to Vintage Books by another store. A
collector of volumes in a particular biographical series and by
``Tarzan'' creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, he still goes online
occasionally to do research and look for books. Increasingly,
though, he finds himself dialing the phone to speak directly with
Atlanta Vintage Books manager Carrie Stikeleather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like calling your family and saying `I need this,'''
Hawkins said fondly about the store and staff he has never laid
eyes on. ``Everyone there has been great. I know I can trust
Carrie. If she says I need it, I need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he ever venture to Atlanta, Otten vows, the store will be
there. For her, the Internet could never entirely replace spending
time in a shop where every customer or book is potentially a good
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to make a lot more money doing this,'' Otten said
on a recent weekday morning when the people in the store included a
woman checking out a book of dog drawings she had seen described
online, and a book ``scout'' offering a carton full of Nabokovs and
Ferlinghettis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could make a fortune on the Internet and I'd just have to
hire someone to type up orders all day,'' Otten said. ``But that's
not the type of store any of us want.''

will sell most everything you'd find in your local supermarket.

fact that they'll deliver to your doorstep, whenever you want? Cool
weekly menus that offer suggestions for dinner _ you can buy
prepared dishes or simply click on the recipe link and make it
yourself. You pay for your order online by providing your credit or
debit card information during checkout, so you don't have to worry
about paying when the delivery gets there _ and couriers are
instructed not to accept tips or gratuities. Delivery is free for
orders of $50 or more and only $4.95 for orders under $50. However,
from now through July 31, delivery is free for all orders.

with a list on the right side, of everything in the room. When you
move your mouse to a word, say ``end table with drawer,'' a yellow

get a soap dispenser that looks like one of those novelty birds
that bobs for water? From Germany? For $18? Or a Japanese Weather
Clock for $72 that gives you the time and weather. A hairbrush for
$23? Yes, but it's such a perfectly designed hairbrush.

</P>
<P>
   lucy.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Women's sports apparel.
</P>

   styletrek.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Clothing, accessories, jewelry, pet, apothecary,
home.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The fact that you won't end up looking just like

   pieceunique.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: An online classified marketplace of recent and
vintage fashions from top designers.

such names as Armani, Chanel, Karan, Versace, Prada, Gucci, Hermes
and more. Recently, a Calvin Klein ``mint condition'' silk
sleeveless navy blue dress, size 6, that retailed for $895 was
going for $425.

call or e-mail for more info or to order.
</P>
<P>
   MEN: intmale.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's swimwear, apparel, shoes and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The longtime International Male fashion catalog
has an impressive Web site. One cool thing is that when you go to
``tops,'' for instance, you get a choice of short sleeve, long
sleeve, sleeveless, tank, novelty and sweaters. You don't have to
plow through a zillion choices.
</P>
<P>
   etuxedo.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Discount tuxedos, shirts and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This site is inexpensive and delivers fast. You'll
just need to take the suit somewhere for alterations. The site also
links to eSuits for discount suits, sport coats, slacks and
blazers.
</P>
<P>
   MEN AND WOMEN: jcrew.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's and women's clothes and accessories.
</P>
<P>

extensive directory of clothing at a glance. And even after you've
clicked your way deep into the listings of skirts, for example, you
can return to this directory with a single click.
</P>
<P>
   brooksbrothers.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Men's and women's clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: When in doubt, there's always Brooks Brothers _
and their Web site makes it real easy to buy their always timeless
clothes. Our favorite thing? When you click on any item for an
enlarged view, you still get links to options in that category

   KIDS AND TEENS:
</P>
<P>
   delias.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Teen girls' clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: First, that the girl on the home page when we were
shopping looked like a real teenager _ not too skinny, not
unrealistically glam. The prices are low, the choices plentiful.
And, even the strictest parents may rest at ease: Most of the
clothes, even the flirty dresses, are appropriate for your little
girls.
</P>
<P>
   gapkids.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Clothes for boys and girls _ not as extensive a
selection as in the store, but you don't have to fight the traffic
at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The sales pages, which are usually pretty full of
options, and you don't have to struggle through those jam-packed
sales racks at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   GET RICH: Or, at least, get some help managing your money
</P>
<P>
   doughnet.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Financial services and advice for teenagers (and
their parents).
</P>
<P>
   What we like: That it's a site for teenagers to learn to manage
their money. The site also links to online merchants and when it's
time to check out, doughnet.com takes over and reminds the shoppers
how much they have in their accounts, what the balance will be
after the transaction, and if they'd like to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Financial planning services.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Lots of advice. Invest in the market, refinance
your mortgage, check your bank statements online, compare insurance
rates, or plan for your retirement.
</P>

   GO LUXE: Jewelry and luxury sites
</P>
<P>
   miadora.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: High-quality jewelry for the high-maintenance
person with a budget to match. You can buy a simple 18K diamond
ring for $375, or upgrade to the 18K platinum diamond ring for
$1,625. Or how about an elegant Cartier diamond baignoire
wristwatch for $12,990? You know you deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ashford.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Watches and clocks; vintage watches; diamonds
and bridal; designer jewelry; writing accessories; leather goods
and handbags; ties and scarves; fragrances bath and body; and
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This site advertises ``all the stuff you really,
really want,'' and if money's no object, you'll find it here. But
if you're on a budget you can still find some reasonably priced
items. For example, sorting by price, a Pierre Cardin man's
wristwatch at half price, just $40. At the other end of the scale,
there's an RGM Automatic Chronograph 105S men's wristwatch for
$26,000.
</P>
<P>
   luxuryfinder.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: With a name like that, what do you think?
</P>
<P>
   What we like: In fairness, let's point out that you can buy many
fine products here for $125 or less. But what fun is that? Let's
look at some of the big-ticket items: A signed first edition of
``Finnegans Wake'' by James Joyce, $10,500. An early 19th century
Regency Period cut glass chandelier, $96,315.
</P>
<P>
   GET PAMPERED: Beauty sites

<P>
   gloss.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Beauty products and advice, a virtual makeover,
magazine and gift center.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This site is about to become the online outpost of
Estee Lauder, which bought the site a few weeks ago. Gloss.com will
still offer a variety of products including Bobbie Brown Essentials
and MAC. It also has a decent selection of products for men.
</P>
<P>
   GET OUT OF TOWN: Travel and travel accessories
</P>
<P>
   ebags.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Luggage, backpacks and other bags for all
occasions.
</P>
<P>

suitcase and your kid wants a knapsack for school. Here's one place
to get 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   expedia.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel plans _ from airfare to car rentals to
hotels
</P>

world. The Vacation Wizard helps you choose from hundreds of
packaged trips based on your specific criteria, including
destination, price, and activities.
</P>
<P>
   air4less.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Discounted airline tickets.
</P>
<P>

behemoth, all-purpose site, air4less.com makes it easy ``in just 3
clicks'' to reserve tickets.

</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel plans _ from airfare to car rentals to
hotels to cruises.

   Priceline.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Travel arrangements, vehicles, home financing,
groceries, yard sale items.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Aside from those annoying William Shatner
commercials, this is a good sight for serious bargain hunters. You
specify what you want to buy or when you want to travel, and how
much you want to pay for it. The site looks for a match and replies
within an hour.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   homegameroom.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: New and refurbished game machines from this
Tampa, Fla., company.

$695. A Pacman videogame machine, $995. An ``Elvira and the Party

house will become Guy HQ for the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   iGadget.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: High-tech gadgets of all kinds
</P>
<P>
   What we like: What's not to like about a site that identifies
itself as ``Where 007 does his shopping''? If you're looking for a
Viper Night Vision Goggle System, you can get one here for $399.99.
Or a Global Positioning System unit, pocket-sized, for $179.99. Or,
to be more practical, a Panasonic Linear Drive Electric Shaver for
$189.99.
</P>
<P>
   ART SMART: Where to buy cool pieces
</P>
<P>
   guild.com
</P>

</P>

with a selection of new artists and paintings under $500.
</P>
<P>
   art.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Fine art and photography, prints and posters.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: This is the art site for the masses _ a little
less highbrow than guild.com. Heavy on the reproductions and
posters, which fill the home page.
</P>
<P>
   GIMME! GIMME!: Cool gifts for weddings, graduations, Mother's
and Father's days, whenever
</P>
<P>
   redenvelope.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Personal and corporate gifts.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Clean, lots of choices, upscale too. Buying is
easy because the categories are clear and useful.
</P>
<P>
   della.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: There are two sites _ a wedding gift registry
and gifts for other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: Very clear, very upscale, very creative. Lots of
cool options _ gifts you may never have thought of _ and some you
have. For weddings, everything from a Simon Pearce glass from
Gump's to a REI Trail Dome 2-person backpacking tent. For other
gifts, options from New York's Museum of Modern Art to Gump's to
Amazon. Teen gifts, for example, include Urban Decay Body Paints to
Go from Eve.com for $12, the Backstreet Boys' ``Millennium'' CD
from Amazon.com for $13.28, and a St. Johns Marathons 1919 baseball
cap by Blue Marlin for $29.99 from Fogdog.
</P>
<P>
   maryscorner.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: This site, named for CEO Mary Spear, promises
``exceptional goods for extraordinary living.''
</P>
<P>
   What we like: It's imaginative and fun to browse. Pamper
yourself with a hydrating body mist ($12), keep time on your hands
with a ring watch for $29.50, accessorize your activities (Miro
Tapestry Bag, $38); please your pooch with a doggy chew toy (Big
Mean Kitty or Cat Burglar, each $13.50); or satisfy your chocolate
cravings (Belgium Dark Chocolate Sauce, $16.95). For men, the
offerings aren't great _ so, guys, head for a sporting goods site.
</P>
<P>
   giftemporia.com
</P>
<P>
   What they sell: Gifts from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What we like: The fact that metro Atlanta is represented. Forget
driving: buy a Lady Bug Light, $192, from City Art Works in
Atlanta; Gardenview table accessories, $40 - $55, from The
Chandlery in Roswell; a Dedham Strawberry Sorbet Rabbit figure for
$68 from Hospitality House in Atlanta; an elephant-shaped
footstool, $199, from Affairs for the Home in Duluth.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _Q: I wonder whether you
<TEXT>
could get some information about how to contact the agency that
keeps the official time for our nation?
<P>
   _ J. S.
</P>
<P>
   A: To hear the U.S. Naval Observatory master clock ticking, call
(202) 762-1401 or visit tycho.usno.navy.mil/what.html. The Web site
receives ``hundreds of thousands of hits a day.'' Write USNO, Time
Service Division, 3450 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C.
20392
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about 35 unused earphones, the kind you use with small
portable radios, etc. I hate to throw them away. Anyone who would
like to have them can.
</P>
<P>
   _ D. B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good day to read the paper. If you can use these freebies,
e-mail Montoro728(at)aol.com. Enjoy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw somewhere a wedding-planning Web site that served as a
gift registry. That's pretty common, except that this one lets
guests go there and contribute toward the honeymoon as a gift. Can
you find this?
</P>
<P>
   _ T. K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Honeymoon bucks from Spirit of the West Travel (218-8742,
800-405-3606, Ext. 74 or www.weddingwire.com) or from After I Do
(www.afterido.com or 800-956-4436). Older couples find such
services a palatable way to ask for money for the big trip. Gifts
may be made in any amount, and the card announcing the guest's
generosity is sent to the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a cat that just started some bad out-of-litter-box
behavior. Do you know a cat behaviorist? Also, what is the most
effective product for eliminating cat urine odor?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Diana Smith of Heart and Paws reports cats are sensitive to
any changes in their environment (new family members, company,
litter brand or reupholstered furniture). Such changes may lead to
bad litter box behavior. Keep the litter as clean as possible and
confine the feline to a small area, like a laundry room. The cat
will have no choice but to go in the box. Pick up a pint of
Nature's Miracle or spritz a solution of 2 tablespoons vinegar to
one cup water to eliminate the cat urine odor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several other non-Texans and I have noticed ``members of the
house party'' in some wedding announcements. We have never heard of
this custom. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Suzanne H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Welcome to the Lone Star State. The house party is an
invention peculiar to the Deep South. Traditionally, the ladies
(relatives, close friends) who assist the bride with various tasks
_ serving cake, manning the guest book, etc. _ were thanked by
being dubbed members of the house party, reports RSVP Parties and
Particulars' Missy Harris. Now caterers and other vendors have
taken over these duties. So the house party has become a collection
of bridesmaid-also-rans who are honored by being escorted into the
church just before the couple's grandparents and parents. They may
or may not stay at the bride's home. Just like the groom's cake,
the house party is a wonderful Southern addition to any wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have more than 100 empty inkjet cartridges and don't want
to throw them away. I've heard that there might be places that will
pay some money for them so they can be remanufactured. Any way you
can help me out? Recycling is cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.B. A: Albaat Ink Jet buys empty cartridges (with a print
head) for about $2 each and fills them. Mail the cartridges
courtesy of Albaat by downloading the mailing kit at
www.albaat.com. A bulk rate for offices and companies is available.
Q: Armadillo shells are very fragile, as I found out when I was
cleaning one. What's the proper method for long-term preservation
for display?
</P>
<P>
   _Z.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Armadillo shells left out in the wild (sun, rain, heat and
humidity) are more fragile than ``fresh'' ones. Dan Lansford of
Professional Taxidermist advises that you start with a fresh shell
with little or no tissue for best results. Rub the interior with 20
Mule Team Borax, which dries the shell and acts as an insecticide.
Follow with a coating of boiled linseed oil on the outside of the
shell as a dressing. Wipe off excess. The shell should last
``longer than you will,'' just like an antler or bone, adds
Lansford. Store the 'dillo out of direct sunlight in moderate
temperatures (e.g. inside on the dining room table). Q: What really
happens if a tax return is postmarked a day late?
</P>
<P>
   _Tim T.
</P>
<P>
   A: You really could be charged a late fee. Postmarks are checked
and noted. The envelope is stapled to the return as proof of the
tardiness in case ``the IRS may assess a late fee,'' says spokesman
Kenneth Vargas. The late filing penalty is 5 percent a month (with
a maximum 25 percent plus interest) of the outstanding balance.
Refund due? No problem, five percent of $0 is $0. Vargas notes 70
percent of filers receive refunds. Remember, after three years, you
lose the right to claim any refund.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We received a wedding invitation that is addressed to my
husband and myself. It does not mention children or family. Is it
appropriate to take them anyway?
</P>
<P>
   _J.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: No. If the children were invited, their names would have been
on the carrier envelope or inside envelope of the invitation.
Traditionally, children older than 13 receive separate invitations.
Get a sitter and enjoy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter's best friend has been accepted to MIT. Needless
to say, I am impressed, since I could barely get my senior to get
her college applications in on time. I wanted to give her friend a
slide rule. I called several places, but they did not know what a
slide rule was.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The slide rule was the product of many mathematical minds.
Edmund Gunter is credited with drawing a line on which numbers were
proportional to their logs, and William Oughtred combined two of
Gunter's lines, sliding them relative to each other. Voila! The
slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the advent of the calculator, slide rules have lately
disappeared from university bookstores. Neither the University
Co-Op nor the MIT bookstore stocks them. I have found a source for
you _ the Slide Rule Emporium. Prices range from $34.50 for the
basic Pickett Pocket Log/Log Rule to $395 for the Pickett 4 Foot
Power Log Exponential. Call (480) 661-8277 or visit
hometown.aol.com/sciant/index.html to order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the last four years, I have been restoring and
customizing a 1975 Corvette. While shopping for parts, I came
across a pair of custom headlights that are supposed to have come
from Farrah Fawcett's Corvette. I would like to send her a picture
of my car, finished with her headlights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Armand G.
</P>
<P>
   A: I am sure she would love to review her old headlights. The
National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Ky., was not able to
confirm that the Charlie's Angels star owned the automotive icon
(by the way, the museum is available for special events and
weddings). But write to Fawcett in care of Nigro Karlin &AMP; Segal,
10100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 1300, Los Angeles, Calif. 90067
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a question concerning the Lorenzo de Zavala flag.
Which way does the star point, and how is the lettering arranged
around the star?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: This flag has a white star against a blue field with one
point straight up. The letters T-E-X-A-S are between each star
point. The T is immediately to the right of the upward point.
Lorenzo de Zavala, ``a Texan by adoption and by choice,'' designed
this first official Lone Star National Flag of the Republic of
Texas, according to Mamie Wynne Cox's ``The Romantic Flags of
Texas. UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR:

 &HT;    TV-Turnoff Week didn't work for meBy Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I thought about participating in National
TV-Turnoff Week last week. Really, I did.
</P>
<P>
   But then I realized I would have to miss the season finale of
``Once &AMP; Again.'' How could I deprive myself of the dramatic
conclusion to Rick and Lily's first season of romance?
</P>
<P>
   Then I thought, OK, I'll cheat a little. I'll join the boycott a
day late. But then I realized I would have to miss new episodes of
``NYPD Blue,'' ``The West Wing,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``ER.'' I
would have been miserable on a personal level and irresponsible on
a professional level. How can a TV critic assess the TV season
without full knowledge of the final few episodes of the best drama
series?
</P>
<P>
   That's my excuse, and I'm sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   I also would have missed: filmmaker Paul Stekler's ``George
Wallace: Settin' the Woods on Fire''; the first part of ABC's
entertaining ``Arabian Nights''; and countless must-see news
programs, especially Ted Koppel's interview with Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, I only considered TV-Turnoff Week (Apr.
24-30) for a nanosecond. This annual bashing of the tube, now in
its sixth year, has always struck me as ridiculous. Why should we
turn our backs on a fountain of knowledge and entertainment sitting
right there in our homes?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning off the TV, we should dedicate ourselves to
watching only the good stuff. And that means not using the TV for
baby-sitting, background noise or vegetating. Don't turn on the TV
like a light when you walk into the room, and don't sit through a
terrible show just to get to the one you like. Use the TV listings.
Choose thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of TV-Turnoff Week is noble _ except for the turning
off part. Sponsored by the Washington-based watchdog group TV-Free
America, cold turkey week is supposed to ``encourage children and
adults to watch less television in order to promote healthier lives
and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine and dandy. Only an idiot would disagree with that mission.
But does turning off the TV for a week really accomplish that goal?
Watching less is automatic when you're selective. Watching smarter
is altogether different from not watching.
</P>
<P>
   Every year TV-Turnoff Week sends out enough press releases and
faxes to be endorsed by politicians, educators, doctors and scouts.
But the Nielsen folks say the impact on ratings is little to none.
A noble yet futile gesture.
</P>
<P>
   During TV-Turnoff Week we are told to read a book, take a walk,
play a board game, bake cookies instead of staring at the tube.
Know what? If you don't plop down the minute you get home from work
or school and watch non-stop until bedtime, there's plenty of time
for those things along with an hour for your favorite program.
</P>
<P>
   I love the wildly simplistic tips TV-Free America comes up with
for dealing with life after TV-free rehab:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Move your TV set to a less prominent location in your
home.'' When was the last time you tried to pry your 150-pound TV
set out of the massive home entertainment center wedged in your
den? And don't forget inhaling a pound of dust while unhooking the
cable and VCR. Absolutely not. The TV stays right where it is. If
it helps you watch less, throw a towel on it.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Hide the remote control.'' We have two, and they're usually
lost anyway. The one without the dead batteries is probably lurking
beneath the sofa cushions, along with puffs of dog hair and
year-old jelly beans.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Remove TV sets from children's bedrooms.'' Parents who care
about what their young children are watching shouldn't put TV sets
in kids' rooms to begin with, so this one's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Keep the set off during dinner.'' Well, duh. Dinner is for
eating and talking. Everybody knows that. (Unless there's a new
episode of ``The Simpsons'' on Sundays, then normal decorum is out
the window.)
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Limit children's viewing.'' Well, double-duh. And ``limit''
should include time of viewing and programs watched. This one is
basic. And obvious, even to rotting couch potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Television has always been the scapegoat for what's wrong with
America. Gunfire breaks out in the National Zoo, and it's TV's
fault. Kids are fat? TV, not high-calorie foods or lack of
exercise, is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   We have a love-hate relationship with The Box, and sometimes the
love is secret. Almost every day, someone at work or in ``the real
world'' goes out of their way to tell me they never watch TV.
Usually they add, with noses tipped skyward, ``I only watch a
little PBS and news.'' But then in casual conversation, many of
those anti-TV snobs let slip from their pursed lips evidence to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that guy on 'Millionaire' was pathetic last night, wasn't
he?'' Or, ``Did you see this year's dance number on 'Drew Carey?'
What a hoot!''
</P>
<P>
   Like dessert, television itself isn't bad for us. It's how much
and what we choose that determine our health.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ My social isolation is about to become
complete.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer spend much time at the gas station standing in line
behind the lottery players and listening to the guys around the
coffee pot. I pay at the pump, pump my own and am out in two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't go to the post office very often. Almost all my
correspondence is in the form of e-mail and some of my bills are
now automatically deducted from my bank account.
</P>
<P>
   I don't go inside my bank's office anymore. My paycheck is
automatically deposited and I don't believe I've ever seen the
bank's lobby unlocked. For all I know, it never opens. It might
just be there for show. Instead, my financial dealings occur
exclusively through bank machines or on financial auto-pilot.
Tellers are dim childhood memories along with barred teller windows
on marble counter tops.
</P>
<P>
   Government offices? Haven't seen one in years except when I'm
working on a story. I renew my auto tag by mail and get a postcard
</P>
<P>
   from the county that tells me my homestead exemption has been
renewed. I receive tax forms on the Internet and update my address
</P>
<P>
   on Web sites. I sigh over my checkbook and pay manifestly unjust
traffic tickets by mail.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom see movies in theaters. I wait for the tape.
</P>
<P>
   I can even do much of my work on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm to the point where there's hardly a reason to get dressed
and leave the house in the morning. Except for one thing. The
grocery store. It's the last remaining place where I bump into
people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the grocery store may recede from my life.
</P>
<P>
   Publix Super Markets Inc. last week said it plans to launch a
system for Internet grocery shopping in Florida and Georgia. Not
this minute, but sometime around 2001. (Open the frozen-food door,
Hal.)
</P>
<P>
   You'd click around on the cereal, milk and cat-food icons, click
the plastic or paper bag symbols, hit return, and the bag will be
delivered to your door or waiting for you at a store. This would
shave hours off a week of running errands.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it seems wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   No more falling into a supermarket-aisle trance and forgetting
what you need to buy.
</P>
<P>
   No more cursing people who can't maneuver their supersized SUVs
in supermarket parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   No more frustration because the supermarket systematically moves
every last can on every shelf just to confuse and annoy you.
</P>
<P>
   No more arguing with children who want to buy colorfully
packaged things they will never really eat.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, it would give you the ability to tell kids,
``If you don't let me on the computer right now, nobody will eat
tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   I do not consider shopping to be recreation. This is progress.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. There's always a catch.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store ranks up there with libraries, churches, $2.99
breakfast places and hardware stores on Saturdays for running into
</P>
<P>
   people at random.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers, neighbors, the schoolmate of the kids who has taken
to wearing three earrings per ear but whom I still remember as the
</P>
<P>
   cute kid in the preschool photographs, the guy who always shouts
``hustle!'' at softball games, the pretty woman who used to live a
few apartments over, folks I only half remember from somewhere,
maybe high school ... the Internet would make them all disappear
from my life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there's the problem of starving to death should my
phone line go dead. After years of shopping on-line, I surely will
have lost
</P>
<P>
   the ability to count change, find out where milk bottles are or
know for sure whether I want plastic bags or paper. (Both have
definite
</P>
<P>
   advantages, you know.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd be thrown into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from safety considerations, I know I'm just not social
enough to go out and track people down. That's why I value chance
</P>
<P>
   encounters.
</P>
<P>
   But I frequent fewer places these days because it's faster to
get things done on-line or by mail. Don't get around much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Publix's ambitious plans for the Internet haven't been launched
yet, but already I'm feeling my world shrink.

 &HT;    Mushroom madness
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's that time of year when a man's fancy
turns to _ morels. At least that's the way it goes here in our
village.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the other thing they're supposed to be hankering for in
the spring doesn't matter. It does, but for a couple of weeks at
least, it comes limping in a poor second because the only thing on
these men's minds right now is MUSHROOMS.
</P>
<P>
   It's a morel frenzy with all the intrigue of an Agatha Christie
weekend in the country. Grown men, some of them grandfathers and
even a sprinkle of great-grandfathers, are skulking through the
woods. No matter where you go, there's only one topic of
conversation. ``How many did you find?'' and ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   Then it gets down and dirty _ like this morning at the cafe. By
the time I got there, six of my retired farmer coffee-drinking
buddies were already huddled in the corner, speaking in hushed
voices. ``What's up?'' I asked looking stupid enough to convince
them I really didn't know what was going on _ because I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cal wrinkled into a huge chuckle. ``He's lyin' again,'' he said
pointing a gnarled finger at Amos, his best friend since one-room
schoolhouse days. They fought WW2 together, stood up at each
other's weddings, and farmed adjoining land for over 60 years, but
that cuts no ice right now _ not during MUSHROOM season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clown's trying to tell me he found a whole sack of morels
out behind his barn this morning,'' Cal explains, ``and I know he's
lying because that's the first place I looked and there weren't
any.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What were you doing looking behind my barn?'' Amos wants to
know. ``You stay ta' home and look behind your own barn or I'm
going to oil up the shotgun for you.''
</P>
<P>
   About that time Benny walks in with a baggie, a big grin, and an
announcement. ``Look'a here!'' he says holding up a skinny bag with
six pitted pale things in it. ``Found 'em this morning.
MUSH-A-ROONS! Whoppers.'' He passed his treasure around for all to
admire. Puffed up bigger than his morels, Benny offers to buy
coffee. The guys pass the stash from hand to hand with appropriate
comments. They could have been admiring a first grandchild from
what I heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Amos says innocently enough followed by an
uncharacteristic congenial slap on Benny's shoulder, ``ya' find
these in your woods?'' Benny gives him a sideways look that asks,
How stupid do you think I am? and pushes Amos's hand away. ``You're
not sweet-talking me into leading you to my spot.'' Amos denies any
such motives and goes back to his coffee. Conversation picks up
where it left off _ biggest liar wins.
</P>
<P>
   Location is the major topic. Someone says around the apple trees
out at White Star park. Another says he heard somebody found a
``mess of 'em'' out behind Jim Batcher's place. Rose, the waitress,
leans over and tells us her sister says the place to look is in the
woods behind the old Lutheran cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   I plunk my buck on the table for coffee and tip and stand up to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell our secrets,'' Cal urges. I tell him they haven't
got any and nobody cares about a bunch of fungus anyway. They stare
like maybe I'd just spoken in Swahili. ``She ain't from around
here,'' Amos explains.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later I'm walking into the grocery store right
behind Brady Petersen. ``Hey, Brady! How many did you get?'' the
cashier asks. Brady shakes his head and says it's too early but
he'll be going back in the morning. He turns to me and explains.
``MUSHROOMS.''
</P>
<P>
   I cross the street to the bakery, order up a loaf of rye, and
Donna behind the counter asks if I've found any yet. MUSHROOMS. I
shake my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on out for chicken on the grill,'' Steve invites from his
car phone. When I get there he's waiting triumphantly in the middle
of his drive holding up a four-inch morel and almost dancing a jig
of delight. ``MUSHROOM!'' he bubbles. ``I found it right out here
under the trees,'' then trails off into a detailed narration of its
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he fries it up in butter and shares it with his wife and
me. Lots of lip smacking.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you folks, it's absolute morel madness _ right here
my own village.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _Q: I wonder whether you
<TEXT>
could get some information about how to contact the agency that
keeps the official time for our nation?
<P>
   _ J. S.
</P>
<P>
   A: To hear the U.S. Naval Observatory master clock ticking, call
(202) 762-1401 or visit tycho.usno.navy.mil/what.html. The Web site
receives ``hundreds of thousands of hits a day.'' Write USNO, Time
Service Division, 3450 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C.
20392
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about 35 unused earphones, the kind you use with small
portable radios, etc. I hate to throw them away. Anyone who would
like to have them can.
</P>
<P>
   _ D. B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Good day to read the paper. If you can use these freebies,
e-mail Montoro728(at)aol.com. Enjoy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw somewhere a wedding-planning Web site that served as a
gift registry. That's pretty common, except that this one lets
guests go there and contribute toward the honeymoon as a gift. Can
you find this?
</P>
<P>
   _ T. K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Honeymoon bucks from Spirit of the West Travel (218-8742,
800-405-3606, Ext. 74 or www.weddingwire.com) or from After I Do
(www.afterido.com or 800-956-4436). Older couples find such
services a palatable way to ask for money for the big trip. Gifts
may be made in any amount, and the card announcing the guest's
generosity is sent to the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a cat that just started some bad out-of-litter-box
behavior. Do you know a cat behaviorist? Also, what is the most
effective product for eliminating cat urine odor?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: Diana Smith of Heart and Paws reports cats are sensitive to
any changes in their environment (new family members, company,
litter brand or reupholstered furniture). Such changes may lead to
bad litter box behavior. Keep the litter as clean as possible and
confine the feline to a small area, like a laundry room. The cat
will have no choice but to go in the box. Pick up a pint of
Nature's Miracle or spritz a solution of 2 tablespoons vinegar to
one cup water to eliminate the cat urine odor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several other non-Texans and I have noticed ``members of the
house party'' in some wedding announcements. We have never heard of
this custom. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Suzanne H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Welcome to the Lone Star State. The house party is an
invention peculiar to the Deep South. Traditionally, the ladies
(relatives, close friends) who assist the bride with various tasks
_ serving cake, manning the guest book, etc. _ were thanked by
being dubbed members of the house party, reports RSVP Parties and
Particulars' Missy Harris. Now caterers and other vendors have
taken over these duties. So the house party has become a collection
of bridesmaid-also-rans who are honored by being escorted into the
church just before the couple's grandparents and parents. They may
or may not stay at the bride's home. Just like the groom's cake,
the house party is a wonderful Southern addition to any wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have more than 100 empty inkjet cartridges and don't want
to throw them away. I've heard that there might be places that will
pay some money for them so they can be remanufactured. Any way you
can help me out? Recycling is cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.B. A: Albaat Ink Jet buys empty cartridges (with a print
head) for about $2 each and fills them. Mail the cartridges
courtesy of Albaat by downloading the mailing kit at
www.albaat.com. A bulk rate for offices and companies is available.
Q: Armadillo shells are very fragile, as I found out when I was
cleaning one. What's the proper method for long-term preservation
for display?
</P>
<P>
   _Z.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Armadillo shells left out in the wild (sun, rain, heat and
humidity) are more fragile than ``fresh'' ones. Dan Lansford of
Professional Taxidermist advises that you start with a fresh shell
with little or no tissue for best results. Rub the interior with 20
Mule Team Borax, which dries the shell and acts as an insecticide.
Follow with a coating of boiled linseed oil on the outside of the
shell as a dressing. Wipe off excess. The shell should last
``longer than you will,'' just like an antler or bone, adds
Lansford. Store the 'dillo out of direct sunlight in moderate
temperatures (e.g. inside on the dining room table). Q: What really
happens if a tax return is postmarked a day late?
</P>
<P>
   _Tim T.
</P>
<P>
   A: You really could be charged a late fee. Postmarks are checked
and noted. The envelope is stapled to the return as proof of the
tardiness in case ``the IRS may assess a late fee,'' says spokesman
Kenneth Vargas. The late filing penalty is 5 percent a month (with
a maximum 25 percent plus interest) of the outstanding balance.
Refund due? No problem, five percent of $0 is $0. Vargas notes 70
percent of filers receive refunds. Remember, after three years, you
lose the right to claim any refund.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We received a wedding invitation that is addressed to my
husband and myself. It does not mention children or family. Is it
appropriate to take them anyway?
</P>
<P>
   _J.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: No. If the children were invited, their names would have been
on the carrier envelope or inside envelope of the invitation.
Traditionally, children older than 13 receive separate invitations.
Get a sitter and enjoy!
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter's best friend has been accepted to MIT. Needless
to say, I am impressed, since I could barely get my senior to get
her college applications in on time. I wanted to give her friend a
slide rule. I called several places, but they did not know what a
slide rule was.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa D.
</P>
<P>
   A: The slide rule was the product of many mathematical minds.
Edmund Gunter is credited with drawing a line on which numbers were
proportional to their logs, and William Oughtred combined two of
Gunter's lines, sliding them relative to each other. Voila! The
slide rule.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the advent of the calculator, slide rules have lately
disappeared from university bookstores. Neither the University
Co-Op nor the MIT bookstore stocks them. I have found a source for
you _ the Slide Rule Emporium. Prices range from $34.50 for the
basic Pickett Pocket Log/Log Rule to $395 for the Pickett 4 Foot
Power Log Exponential. Call (480) 661-8277 or visit
hometown.aol.com/sciant/index.html to order.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the last four years, I have been restoring and
customizing a 1975 Corvette. While shopping for parts, I came
across a pair of custom headlights that are supposed to have come
from Farrah Fawcett's Corvette. I would like to send her a picture
of my car, finished with her headlights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Armand G.
</P>
<P>
   A: I am sure she would love to review her old headlights. The
National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Ky., was not able to
confirm that the Charlie's Angels star owned the automotive icon
(by the way, the museum is available for special events and
weddings). But write to Fawcett in care of Nigro Karlin &AMP; Segal,
10100 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 1300, Los Angeles, Calif. 90067
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a question concerning the Lorenzo de Zavala flag.
Which way does the star point, and how is the lettering arranged
around the star?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: This flag has a white star against a blue field with one
point straight up. The letters T-E-X-A-S are between each star
point. The T is immediately to the right of the upward point.
Lorenzo de Zavala, ``a Texan by adoption and by choice,'' designed
this first official Lone Star National Flag of the Republic of
Texas, according to Mamie Wynne Cox's ``The Romantic Flags of

RACIAL ABUSE IS ALLEGED AT BOSTON SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The US Department of Education is investigating
allegations that Cape Verdean children were subjected to racist and
abusive treatment by a teacher at James Condon Elementary School in
South Boston, and that school officials tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   The probe focuses on charges that a veteran fifth-grade teacher
physically abused the pupils and called them derogatory names, a
source familiar with the investigation said. Former pupils said
that they were hit, slapped, and pinched, and that their ears were
pulled. They also said they were called names such as ``burro,''
``monkey,'' and ``nappy-haired.''
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Maria Mullaly, is also accused of seating pupils by
skin color, with lighter-skinned children at the front of the class
and darker-skinned children at the back, according to several
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mullaly, 66, has taught at the Condon school since 1975 and
apparently was never disciplined for her alleged actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classroom was run with threats and intimidation and
physical abuse of the students,'' said the source familiar with the
investigation. ``Students of color were singled out for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are pursuing allegations that school
officials covered up the alleged abuse by telling children to lie
and parents to stay silent when the state Department of Social
Services inquired about Mullaly's classroom behavior two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The DSS investigation uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing,
according to documents obtained by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators have evidence of a pattern of abuse
repeated for many years, sources said. Some Cape Verdean students
who sat in Mullaly's classroom decades ago said they still remember
being traumatized by her.
</P>
<P>
   Mullaly, like many of her students, is Cape Verdean. She is
light-skinned and spoke disparagingly about dark-skinned people,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullaly, on leave from the school after a car accident last
year, could not be reached for comment. Daniel Walsh, who was
principal at the Condon school when much of the abuse allegedly
occurred, also did not return phone calls from the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged abuse came to light after complaints by Viana
Mendes, 33, a teacher at the school during the 1997-1998 school
year who also is Cape Verdean. Mendes told investigators that she
witnessed many incidents of physical and verbal abuse directed at
the darker-skinned pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, conducted by the federal Office of Civil
Rights, has been underway for 11 months, spokesman Rodger Murphy
confirmed. Investigators have interviewed more than 25 pupils,
former students, parents, and school officials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy declined to speculate on the outcome of the inquiry. But
sources said investigators will meet with school officials next
month to present the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the issues they must resolve are allegations that school
officials permitted racial discrimination, violated school policies
that forbid corporal punishment, misled government investigators,
and violated the civil rights of several pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Lynch, a spokeswoman for the Boston School Department,
said city officials learned Wednesday that the Office of Civil
Rights has reached some conclusions about the case, but they have
not been told what they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say anything until we know more,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with the Globe, Mullaly's former students told
tales of mistreatment at her hands and said they still bear scars.
</P>
<P>
   Valdir Pires, 13, said he remembers standing at the blackboard
in Mullaly's class two years ago, struggling to figure out a math
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Pires, a special-needs student whose family comes from Cape
Verde, said Mullaly yelled ``Burro!'' and hit him twice on the side
of the head. Humiliated, Pires said he turned red and went back to
his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so embarrassed,'' he said last week, looking down at the
floor of his apartment with his head in his hands. ``Everyone was
looking at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said she witnessed that incident and reported it to
investigators. Pires said Mullaly later told him to deny it
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Pires and several other students also said they were subjected
to Mullaly's seating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was like the A team and the B team,'' said Ana do
Souto, 27, a fifth-grader in Mullaly's classroom in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the darker-skinned pupils always got the worst treatment
from Mullaly, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, who asked that her last name not be used, was one of
Mullaly's pupils in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   She dreamed of becoming a flight attendant, but Mullaly told her
she didn't have the right sort of European look, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I was too black, too big-lipped, and nappy-haired,''
Maria recalled. ``And she made fun of my clothes. She'd say, `Don't
wear that again, you look raggedy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mullaly constantly encouraged the lighter-skinned children, she
said. ``She'd hug 'em, give 'em compliments. To us darker ones, the
best she'd say is, `Can't you do better?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maria said her self-esteem took a nose dive. Today, she's a
happily married homemaker with four children, living in Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I grew up, I felt like I couldn't do things,'' she said.
``Being a stewardess was the main thing I always wanted to do, but
I kind of erased it out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin Fernandes, 29, described himself as the darkest boy in
Mullaly's class in 1982, when South Boston still simmered with
tension over court-ordered busing. In contrast, he said, the
atmosphere inside Mullaly's classroom didn't seem so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what bothered me was (Mullaly's) favoritism toward
whites,'' he said. ``If everybody was disciplined the same way, I
wouldn't have minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Do Souto, a statuesque Cape Verdean who owns a hair salon in
Boston, said she will never forget Mullaly, then Maria Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Newly arrived from her homeland in 1985, do Souto desperately
wanted to fit in at her new school. She said she was mortified when
Mullaly hit her on the head, pulled her ears, and called her names
like ``bruta,'' ``stupida,'' and ``dummy,'' and said she'd be
pregnant before she was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected that from a teacher, who is supposed to set
an example,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Mullaly threatened her with an ``F'' in behavior if she told
anyone about the treatment, do Souto said.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes visited Mullaly's classroom regularly to pick up pupils
for tutoring, and, as a young teacher, was also assigned to observe
the class. She said she was appalled by what she saw.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was ostracized at the school after telling
superiors she had observed Mullaly mistreating pupils. Her teaching
contract was not renewed for the 1998-1999 school year.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes school officials permitted the abuse
because some of the pupils were immigrants who had recently arrived
and who had difficulty fitting into their new surroundings or had
behavior problems. Mullaly, a bilingual teacher, could keep them
under control.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes said she did not report the abuse for several months
because she considered Mullaly a friend. Mendes also said that in
Cape Verde, physical punishment of students is more accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was horrible what was happening to the kids,'' she
said. ``They were being damaged psychologically. I reached a point
where I couldn't walk away any more.''
</P>
<P>
   A DSS investigation in the spring of 1998, triggered after
Mendes filed a 51A, or report of suspected abuse, failed to support
her charges, according to documents obtained by the Globe. DSS
spokesman David Van Dam would not comment on the matter, saying it
was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   After the DSS probe ended, Mendes contacted various officials,
including teachers' union representative Carol Pacheco and the
offices of Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant and Mayor Thomas M.
Menino.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendes said the complaints were not taken seriously, so she
appealed to the civil rights office. The federal investigators
began their probe last May.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mendes worked as a substitute teacher in Boston and
has since moved on to another school district in the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mendes says she feels bad about going to the authorities
about Mullaly. But she said what she witnessed in Mullaly's
classroom was unlike anything she had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was shaming the kids, hitting them, and humiliating
them,'' Mendes said. ``Every time I left the classroom, I'd feel
bad for the kids and guilty that I wasn't doing anything about it.
I reached a point when I knew the truth had to come out.''

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Board of Education is trying to decide how much time
students in kindergarten through eighth grade will spend running,
throwing and doing push-ups at school next year.
</P>
<P>
   Physical education no longer is required by state law for
kindergarten through eighth grade. Gov. Roy Barnes, who proposed
the change in the law, wants kids to focus on core subjects, such
as science and math.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the law doesn't require PE, the state Board of
Education still can make schools hold the classes. The board is
holding meetings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are upset by the new law because they don't feel
kids are active enough. Others say parents should make sure their
kids exercise.

   LOCUSTS ATTACK AUSTRALIA
</P>
<P>
   About 100 billion locusts are on the move through Australia's
outback. The winged insects already have attacked crops in South
Australia and are headed for richer agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate the vermin could cause $150 million in
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The plague is described as the worst in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Record rainfalls have created damp soil, which the locusts need
to hatch eggs. The extra rain also has increased plant life the
locusts feed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spraying what we find,'' said plague manager Walter
Spratt. ``We're trying to do as much as we can
</P>
<P>
   as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   WHEW! THRILL-RIDE PRICES RISE
</P>
<P>
   The price of experiencing death-defying dips on roller coasters
has risen this year. The average adult admission price in North
America is $2.70 higher than last season's price, making the
average adult ticket $37. That's the largest increase in seven
years, according to a survey of 30 theme parks conducted by an
industry magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Disneyland in California began applying its adult
price of $41 to visitors 10 and older. The price previously started
at age 12. Disney World in Florida raised its adult price by $1, to
$46 per ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials say the increases reflect better rides.

 &HT;    Baby teeth _Who needs 'em? You do!
 &HT;    By Jan Roadarmel Ledford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Knock-knock! Who's there?
</P>
<P>
   Dishes. Dishes who?
</P>
<P>
   Dishes the Tooth Fairy. Lost any teeth lately?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Starting at about age 6, your teeth are doomed to
fall out.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry. You won't have to eat oatmeal the rest of your
life. Most mammals (warmblooded animals with hair, like humans)
have two sets of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The first set, called the primary, or baby, teeth, comes in the
early years. The second set, or permanent teeth, erupts later. Even
your dog and cat have primary and permanent teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In humans, the tooth buds for the baby teeth are in the gums
when a person is born. These teeth start pushing through the gums
when the baby is 6 to 8 months old. By age 2, all the primary teeth
usually are present. Underneath the primary teeth, hidden in the
gums, are the buds that will grow into the permanent teeth.
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent tooth develops near the surface, it causes the
root of the baby tooth to shrink. Once the root is gone, the baby
tooth falls out. Baby teeth usually start falling out at about age
6. This continues until all the baby teeth are gone at about age
12. There are 20 baby teeth and 32 permanent teeth. So in your
whole life, you'll have 52 teeth. (That's unlike a shark, which can
grow thousands of replacement teeth during its life.)
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S A TOOTH MADE OF?
</P>
<P>
   A tooth has two parts. The part you see is the crown. It is
covered with enamel, the hardest substance in the human body. The
part below the gum is the root. It is covered with cementum
(pronounced see MEN tum). In the center of the tooth is the pulp,
which contains blood vessels and nerves. Under the enamel is the
dentin. The dentin is what makes up most of the tooth. It is harder
than bone but softer than enamel.
</P>
<P>
   Even though enamel is hard, it can be damaged. Cavities are
caused by bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria coat your teeth if
you don't brush or floss them. Bacteria, which get a free meal
every time you eat or drink, especially love sweet stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The gross news is that the waste products of bacteria are
chemicals that eat your enamel, causing cavities. Cavities can
destroy a tooth. So if your baby teeth are going to fall out
anyway, who cares if they get cavities? YOU should!
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the baby teeth hold a space for the permanent
teeth. If too many baby teeth are lost early, the permanent teeth
might not have a good place to come in. Also, the jaw may not grow
right.
</P>
<P>
   And the decay from a baby tooth can damage the permanent tooth
below.
</P>
<P>
   You can see how important it is to take care of your baby teeth.
You also must pamper your permanent teeth. If one rots away, you
don't get another!
</P>
<P>
   Proper dental care includes brushing twice a day, flossing
daily, seeing your dentist regularly and eating a healthy diet
without lots of sweets.
</P>
<P>
   Also be sure not to smoke, dip or chew tobacco. Keep those
pearly whites clean!
</P>
<P>
   ENTER THE TOOTH FAIRY!
</P>
<P>
   Having a baby tooth fall out isn't such a bad deal. Not only is
a permanent tooth waiting under your gums to take its place, you
also may get a visit from the Tooth Fairy!
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for a tooth is about $1. Ever wonder where the
Tooth Fairy gets the money? One theory is that she has helper
fairies who find money that people lose.
</P>
<P>
   So if you ever see a quarter under the picnic table, maybe you
should leave it there for all the tooth-losing children in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   We want to know about your Tooth Fairy traditions. Do you leave
your tooth under the pillow? Are the front teeth worth more than
the back? Write us at nfk(at)ajc.com with all your Tooth Fairy
secrets.

   HALL-IRAQ-COMMENTARY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``You will look evil in
the eye if you go to Iraq,'' an American aid worker warned before I
visited the country. I spotted it immediately. It was ubiquitous in
the fear that seems to haunt Iraqis' eyes, and in the pain of
starvation and disease that plagues so many of them. It was clear
in the countless military fortifications along every road, evidence
of its wars with its neighbors, and in the terrible persecution of
minorities in its northern and southern regions. (U.S. Rep. Tony P.
Hall for Cox News Service). MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ My wife is hosting a garden party. I'm
hosting a dog party. For most of the morning, members of my wife's
garden club will be gathered in our back yard, sipping coffee or
tea and nibbling on sandwiches hardly the size of piano keys. I'll
be with my dogs, in the little house that's way in the back yard.
If I sound bitter, it's for good reason. I'm good and bitter about
a party at my house that I'm not invited to, not to mention my
eight dogs. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's that time of year when
a man's fancy turns to _ morels. At least that's the way it goes
here in our village. Not that the other thing they're supposed to
be hankering for in the spring doesn't matter. It does, but for a
couple of weeks at least, it comes limping in a poor second because
the only thing on these men's minds right now is MUSHROOMS.
(Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ My social isolation is about to become complete. I
no longer spend much time at the gas station standing in line
behind the lottery players and listening to the guys around the
coffee pot. I pay at the pump, pump my own and am out in two
minutes. I don't go to the post office very often. Almost all my
correspondence is in the form of e-mail and some of my bills are
now automatically deducted from my bank account.(Lane, Daytona

   VINTAGE-BOOKS-ONLINE _ ATLANTA _ There's a mid-17th century

pre-1960 poultry books.'' Something interesting's always happening
at Atlanta Vintage Books, though the most intriguing development of
late doesn't involve what's on the shelves: Some of the store's
best, most loyal customers have never set foot in the place.
They're cybershoppers. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they

Always open, always stocked with exactly what I wanted, never about

   CHIP-IMPLANT _In September, 8-year-old Louie Carter's life
changed forever, with a car accident that left him paralyzed from
the waist down. This week, a computer chip may alter the outcome of
that disability. He'll become the first Georgian, and one of only
eight people in the world, to get the implant in an operation in
Philadelphia. If the surgery is successful, the chip will bypass
his spinal column to allow his brain to send signals to nerves in
his legs, and the Milner youngster might be able to walk again _
not unassisted, but with a walker or crutches. (Lore, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   COXNET PTECH _ (EDS: This is the CoxNet PTECH page for the
current week. This layout is available Tuesday after 2 p.m. EDT.)
</P>
<P>
   COXNET PTECH 0502 -- Netscape 6 is not fun. It's big, busy,
flashy and can be just plain annoying. Netscape took two years to
dream up this mishmash of features, pull-down menus, wacky toolbars
and icons. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Art includes a
4-column color photo of a screenshot of Netscape's new browser.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GADGETS -- Rand McNally, the map people, have developed a
mapping and global positioning system (GPS) device designed to work
with the Palm III and Palm V organizers. (Cummings, Dayton Daily
News) Art includes a 1-column color photo of product in use.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSCENE -- When it comes to reading information in
other languages, most of us are at a loss. There is help for you on
the Web. If you're an experienced user, you probably know that
there are free online translation services available. (Husted,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GAME CORNER -- The new ``Star Trek'' game adventure is
like an episodic TV-caliber adventure _ not a virtual extravaganza
on par with the blockbuster movies.(Staff, Austin
American-Statesman) Art includes a 1-column color photo of video
game box.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY -- The delete key remains one of your best
defenses against junk e-mail. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) Art includes 1 column color sig of
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   E-COMMERCE _ When it comes to e-shopping strategies, there are
typically two ways a company can turn. Either build a Web site and
manage it in-house, or outsource all or part of the work. (DeGross,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   VINTAGE-BOOKS-ONLINE _ ATLANTA _ There's a mid-17th century
Bible for sale and copies of every Life magazine issue ever
printed. Recently, an urgent request came in for ``any and all
pre-1960 poultry books.'' Something interesting's always happening
at Atlanta Vintage Books, though the most intriguing development of
late doesn't involve what's on the shelves: Some of the store's
best, most loyal customers have never set foot in the place.
They're cybershoppers. And contrary to conventional wisdom, they
may be helping rather than hurting independent stores savvy enough
to see venturing onto the Web as one more way of keeping their
doors open. (Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   ME-STORE _ ``It would be the perfect store. The ``Me Store.''
Always open, always stocked with exactly what I wanted, never about
another human being's needs except mine. All mine!'' For those who
prefer to shop from home, this reporter has compiled a list of web
sites she hoped to meet her every need. Some deliver, some don't.
(Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED
</P>
<P>
   GOING-CYBER _ ATLANTA _ ``Going Cyber!'' The handwriting is a
bit crooked and hard to make out from a distance, and yet the sign
on the front door of ``The Family Jewels'' in downtown Decatur, Ga.
speaks volumes. Next week, the 13-year-old antiques and
collectibles store will become an online-only operation, joining a
host of other businesses for whom the Internet is the greatest
thing to come along since customers with unlimited lines of credit.
(Vejnoska, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED

   ESHOP-SAFETY _Before you start your e-shopping adventures, here
are some key points to keep in mind. (Katz, Atlanta

   HALL-IRAQ-COMMENTARY _ DAYTON, Ohio _ ``You will look evil in
the eye if you go to Iraq,'' an American aid worker warned before I
visited the country. I spotted it immediately. It was ubiquitous in
the fear that seems to haunt Iraqis' eyes, and in the pain of
starvation and disease that plagues so many of them. It was clear
in the countless military fortifications along every road, evidence
of its wars with its neighbors, and in the terrible persecution of
minorities in its northern and southern regions. (U.S. Rep. Tony P.
Hall for Cox News Service). MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ My wife is hosting a garden party. I'm
hosting a dog party. For most of the morning, members of my wife's
garden club will be gathered in our back yard, sipping coffee or
tea and nibbling on sandwiches hardly the size of piano keys. I'll
be with my dogs, in the little house that's way in the back yard.
If I sound bitter, it's for good reason. I'm good and bitter about
a party at my house that I'm not invited to, not to mention my
eight dogs. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It's that time of year when
a man's fancy turns to _ morels. At least that's the way it goes
here in our village. Not that the other thing they're supposed to
be hankering for in the spring doesn't matter. It does, but for a
couple of weeks at least, it comes limping in a poor second because
the only thing on these men's minds right now is MUSHROOMS.
(Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ My social isolation is about to become complete. I
no longer spend much time at the gas station standing in line
behind the lottery players and listening to the guys around the
coffee pot. I pay at the pump, pump my own and am out in two
minutes. I don't go to the post office very often. Almost all my
correspondence is in the form of e-mail and some of my bills are
now automatically deducted from my bank account.(Lane, Daytona
Beach News-Journal) MOVED

   COMPLETE STORY OF ELIAN GONZALEZ'S FAMILY AND RESCUE FROM WATERS
OFF FLORIDA COAST AVAILABLE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES SYNDICATE.
</P>
<P>
   ----------------------------------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Because of continuing interest in the Elian Gonzalez story, The
New York Times Syndicate has just transmitted a SHORTENED VERSION
of the New York Times Magazine story ``Just Another Cuban Family
Saga,'' which appeared in the April 23 issue.
</P>
<P>
   The article is free to clients of The New York Times Syndicate's
Centerpiece package.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Times staffer Tim Golden describes the wedge that
split the family as some chose Communism and others freedom. The
family background may be of special interest when the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the 11th Circuit rules on Elian's case on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ALSO INCLUDED: A FREE GRAPHIC of Elian's family tree, created in
Adobe Illustrator. It will be available starting Saturday, April 29
and can be sent to you electronically. Simply e-mail Peter Trigg,
Communications Director, at nytsf(AT)nytimes.com.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXCERPT ...
</P>
<P>
   ```Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: `Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his Aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: `With all this, your life is set
here.'' Several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Lazaro and Delfin (the father's uncles) called, and they
started to offend me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me
how bad the government here is, all that. And me _ I have my
ideals. They never said a thing about the boy staying there _ they
were just insisting that we should go there.''

   AN EXCERPT ...
</P>
<P>
   ```Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: `Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his Aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: `With all this, your life is set
here.'' Several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Lazaro and Delfin (the father's uncles) called, and they
started to offend me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me
how bad the government here is, all that. And me _ I have my
ideals. They never said a thing about the boy staying there _ they
were just insisting that we should go there.''

 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Thanksgiving, three days after his ex-wife and son went
missing in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 31, received a call from
Miami relatives with the news that his 5-year-old son Elian had
been pulled from the waters off the Florida coast by a couple of
fishermen.
 &HT;    Later, after visiting the child at a hospital near Fort
Lauderdale, Juan Miguel's Uncle Lazaro called again to tell him
that the boy's mother Elisa had perished at sea in an apparent
failed flight from Cuba, but that Elian had survived the ordeal
astonishingly well.
 &HT;    The next day, TV news crews had already turned up at the
hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American politicians offering
their support.
 &HT;    With all the attention, Juan Miguel's Aunt Caridad in Miami had
begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's rescue:
that her brother (Juan Miguel's father) and his family might
finally have a reason to leave Cuba and join the rest of the
Gonzalezes in the United States ...
 &HT;    But, the story begins in Cardenas, the home of the Gonzalez
family on Cuba's north coast ...
 &HT;    The elegant colonial town built in the 19th century sits two and
a half hours east of Havana _ and due south of the Florida Keys, in
the path of currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate
migrants to the United States.
 &HT;    When Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio Batista in 1959,
Cardenas was, for the most part, remote from the centers of the
uprising. Juan Miguel Gonzalez's grandparents, Luis and Georgina,
weathered the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a
stevedore at the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children _ Juan
Miguel's father, aunts and uncles _ had a tougher time, and
struggled to find any work at all.
 &HT;    Uncle Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20s, was among
those in the family with great hopes for the revolution. ``I think
I supported them for about a month,'' he said of the Communists.
 &HT;    On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with
subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His devastated
mother Georgina, took down the large framed photograph of Castro
that she had put up on the living-room wall.
 &HT;    Later, several of Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles would remember
1962 as the year they began thinking about a new life outside of
Cuba.
 &HT;    For Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat
for Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and
requited love. When Castro announced in September 1965 that Cubans
with relatives in the United States would be free to leave,
Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress, boarded one of the
so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami.
 &HT;    Back in Cuba, Aunt Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria; Uncle
Manolo trained as a mechanic and found work repairing boat motors
for a fishing cooperative; Lazaro emerged as a talented young
gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources into its sports
program; Juan Miguel's father, Juan, took a job as a police
investigator in the interior ministry, a career choice that not all
his siblings appreciated.
 &HT;    In 1979, with Caridad's help, Delfin got a visa and came to the
United States just months before his mother's death. Another of
Juan Miguel's aunts brought her family in 1983, and Luis, the
family patriarch, followed her the next spring. Manolo and Lazaro
took their families to Costa Rica in August 1984 and applied for
American visas there.
 &HT;    In Miami's Little Havana, the Cuban culture that received them
had begun to grow more diverse with the influx of the younger, more
liberal emigres. At the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were
coming into their own as an American political force.
 &HT;    But in Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing
the country differently. None of them knew a world before Fidel. In
the late 1960s and '70s, when some of Juan Miguel's uncles were
growing bitter, when his aunts felt like outcasts for going to
church, some of their children seemed to thrive.
 &HT;    Like thousands of other young Cubans of his generation, Juan
Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose Antonio, became the first member of
his family to attend college, earning a degree from the University
of Matanzas that led him to a job with the ministry of agriculture.
 &HT;    But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion
his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel.
Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of
Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it
presented.
 &HT;    In September 1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at a birthday party
and the two soon fell in love. When they married, Elisa was just
shy of 16, Juan Miguel not yet 17.
 &HT;    At first, they lived with Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez. Juan
Miguel left school after 10th grade and went to work in a paper
factory, training to become an electrician. Eventually, Elisa and
Juan Miguel went to night school to earn their high school
diplomas.
 &HT;    While he completed his three years of military service with an
army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational
school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and
restaurants.
 &HT;    Varadero, a long ribbon of white-sand beach 10 miles west of
Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Fidel Castro's reluctant
effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned by foreign
companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the country.
 &HT;    In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest
Varadero hotel. Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, and
eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky 1956 Nash
Rambler and to build a home for themselves next to his family's
house.
 &HT;    But Juan Miguel and Elisa struggled to have a child, eventually
losing seven pregnancies.
 &HT;    After several years of marriage, they started drifting apart.
Friends saw them as having less and less in common: she loved
clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked hanging out with
friends _ and began to go with other women.
 &HT;    Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later,
they were living together again. ``We had always wanted to have a
child,'' Juan Miguel said. ``We got together again to see if we
could do it. And finally we did.'' After months of bed rest and
prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993 to Elian, a
name made up from the first three letters of Elisa and the last two
of Juan.
 &HT;    But as much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she was tired of his
running around. Juan Miguel, for his part, said he felt different,
too. ``She was like a sister to me,'' he said. In February 1997, 11
years after they were married and two months after Elian's third
birthday, they separated for good.
 &HT;    Still friends after the split, they shared custody of the boy
and Elisa remained close to her former in-laws.
 &HT;    Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, when at
a Varadero nightspot with friends she met Lazaro Rafael Munero.
Within about two months, he went to live with her at Raquel's
house.
 &HT;    Elisa insisted she had found a good man. The son of an oil
worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18,
he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel
room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When
he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft
drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the
Varadero hotels. Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver.
 &HT;    ``He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop him
off,'' Juan Miguel said of Munero. ``We got along with him all
right.''
 &HT;    Less than a year later, he left Cuba in a small boat with three
friends. Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go
with him but that she refused.
 &HT;    Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero bought a
motorized rubber raft to return to Cuba. He was picked up on Oct.
26, 1998 by the Cuban Coast Guard.
 &HT;    Munero spent the next two months there in prison. After his
release, he moved back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment.
Later they rented an apartment of their own and took Elian with
them.
 &HT;    Months later, they set off before dawn with friends and some of
Munero's family in a homemade boat with a balky 50-horsepower
motor.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel says that only in their first conversation after
Elian was released from the hospital did the boy ever speak about
what had happened.
 &HT;    ```Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: `Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his Aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: `With all this, your life is set
here.'' Several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar
pleas.
 &HT;    ``Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend
me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me how bad the
government here is, all that. And me _ I have my ideals. They never
said a thing about the boy staying there _ they were just insisting
that we should go there.''
 &HT;    Two days later, the foreign ministry in Havana sent the United
States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return.
 &HT;    Fidel Castro himself asked him how he felt about the situation
and what he wanted to do. ``He told me I could do what I pleased,''
Juan Miguel said. ``If I wanted to leave, I could leave.
Nonetheless, I told him no. My decision was clear.''
 &HT;    Castro was quick to recognize the episode's political potential:
an issue with the power to galvanize not only the party faithful
but also every Cuban parent and child and millions of people
abroad.
 &HT;    Within weeks of his rescue, Elian had become the biggest
revolutionary symbol since Che.
 &HT;    Castro's enemies were just as quick to recognize a poster child
when they saw one.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities and advised
them on strategy.
 &HT;    As for Cuba, ``What is clear is that he is going to continue to
be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist
Party chief in Cardenas. ``This battle did not begin with Elian.
Our struggle has been one of challenging the government of the
United States for its attacks against our country. And we will
continue with this struggle, which is one that strengthens us in
every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill.
 &HT;    And Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to be weighing movie
and book deals of various sorts.

 &HT;    Castro's enemies were just as quick to recognize a poster child
when they saw one.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities and advised
them on strategy.
 &HT;    As for Cuba, ``What is clear is that he is going to continue to
be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist
Party chief in Cardenas. ``This battle did not begin with Elian.
Our struggle has been one of challenging the government of the
United States for its attacks against our country. And we will
continue with this struggle, which is one that strengthens us in
every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill.
 &HT;    And Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to be weighing movie
and book deals of various sorts.

ALIENATION: JOHN TRAVOLTA IS THE BAD GUY IN `BATTLEFIELD EARTH'

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Fighting off the aliens was hard, but getting the movie made was
almost impossible.
 &HT;    ``Listen, it's been a 15-year struggle to get this movie done,''
says John Travolta, star and executive producer of ``Battlefield
Earth,'' which will open nationwide on May 12. ``I'm bringing a
historic book to the big screen.''
 &HT;    The delay, of course, was caused by the fact that the movie is
based on a 1982 novel by L. Ron Hubbard, who also founded
Scientology, the controversial religious sect of which Travolta is
a high-profile member.
 &HT;    But the actor insists that ``Battlefield Earth'' isn't about
Scientology in any way, shape or form _ that it might have been
written by an author of any religious orientation.
 &HT;    ``It's just a classic science-fiction story,'' he says. ``This
is an action film based on one of the biggest science-fiction books
ever. The novel is right up there with `Dune.' It belongs on the
screen.
 &HT;    ``I just can't wait for the people to be able to see this
movie,'' the soft-spoken actor says, relaxing in a suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, casually dressed in gray pants and a
matching sweater. ``I've already heard the film dubbed this
summer's `Star Wars.'''
 &HT;    Travolta optioned the novel in 1984, planning to play the film's
young hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler, who in 3000 A.D. leads a revolt
against the alien Psychlos who have taken over the world and
enslaved humanity. By the time he got the film made, however, he
had aged out of the role, and was forced to cede it to Barry
Pepper, most recently seen in ``The Green Mile'' (1999).
 &HT;    It's a pity, the actor says, because there's a lot of
interesting aspects to the role of Johnny.
 &HT;    ``Humans have actually become hunters and gatherers again to
survive,'' Travolta says. ``They live this harsh existence, just
trying to keep a piece of their planet. But it's not exactly easy
on them.''
 &HT;    As for himself, Travolta plays Terl, an 8-foot-tall Psychlo with
lots of hair and one bad attitude.
 &HT;    ``He's a very theatrical character,'' Travolta says. ``I almost
think of him as someone Shakespeare could have created. It's all
about manipulation and blackmail for this character _ he is truly
the most evil character I've ever tried to play.''
 &HT;    And the ugliest, to boot.
 &HT;    ``The movie required an amazing physical transformation,''
Travolta says. ``I wear a tall-head apparatus with strange hair. I
have amber eyes and talons for hands. It's quite remarkable.''
 &HT;    After spending much of the shoot teetering on 4-foot stilts to
capture a Psychlo's stature, Travolta professes unconcern about the
possibility of religious controversy over the movie.
 &HT;    ``The e-mail and fan mail since this picture was announced as a
go has been extraordinary,'' he says. ``I've never been involved
with a picture that got this amount of pre-excitement.
 &HT;    ``In fact, since we could only film half of the 1,050-page book,
the studio is so high on the project that we're even already
talking about a sequel for 2002,'' he adds. ``That's how much
confidence there is in the project.''
 &HT;    He's even pondering making movies of two other Hubbard novels,
``Mission Earth'' (1991) and ``Fear'' (1992).
 &HT;    ``I would love to add science fiction to my body of work,''
Travolta says. ``It's the one genre that I've missed. But I'd like
to do sci-fi in a more realistic way _ you should keep it grounded
in some sort of reality.''
 &HT;    Since resurrecting his film career with ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994),
Travolta has been on a roll, snagging one choice role after another
and earning $20 million a picture. About all he needs to round
things off is an Oscar.
 &HT;    ``Of course, you don't want to build yourself up too much in
case it doesn't happen,'' he says. ``But I've been really proud of
the work I've done in the last few years. I was extremely proud of
`A Civil Action' (1998) and `Primary Colors' (1998). I think these
were pivotal points in terms of my acting career. I think that's
where you see the growth as an actor.''
 &HT;    He doesn't claim any tremendous thespian talent, however, giving
most of the credit to the writers of his films and to his own
legendary work ethic.
 &HT;    ``It's just a matter of the material and what you put out
there,'' Travolta says. ``Your popularity really does depend on
doing good work. Above all, I know for a fact that it can all go
away in a moment.''
 &HT;    That sense may lie behind the barrage of movies Travolta has
cranked out since ``Pulp Fiction,'' and he shows no sign of slowing
down. Later this summer he'll be seen opposite Lisa Kudrow in Nora
Ephron's ``Numbers,'' a comedy about a lottery scam. He is also
signed to do a thriller called ``Domestic Disturbances'' and an
action film called ``Swordfish,'' and he's admitted that the idea
of doing another musical _ his first since ``Grease'' (1978) _
intrigues him.
 &HT;    ``I just want to continue to work at the highest level and
always get better as an actor,'' Travolta says. ``I think there are
many challenges left in this life. Finding an exciting character to
play is the ultimate work challenge, but I also have challenges in
aviation. And the ultimate challenge is to take care of my family
and my 40 employees, whom I love very much.''
 &HT;    That family includes wife Kelly Preston, who plays a female
alien in ``Battlefield Earth,'' their 7-year-old son Jett and a
newborn daughter.
 &HT;    ``I haven't been the same man since I became a father,''
Travolta says. ``Mostly, I'm more vulnerable. You don't ever quite
feel about anyone the way you feel about your child _ you worry
more than you're used to worrying. You get sad when you're not with
them. And it's a vulnerable feeling being a parent.''
 &HT;    Travolta is a hands-on parent, playing Santa each Christmas and
even accompanying Jett around the neighborhood trick-or-treating
last October.
 &HT;    ``I was the Grim Reaper,'' he says, laughing at the memory. ``It
was a way to hide my face. I wore this big hood so no one knew it
was me, until I couldn't breathe under the mask. I finally had to
take it off, and then I was just Jett's dad in this big robe.''
 &HT;    Well, not just that. He is, after all, one of Hollywood's
personifications of cool _ which he admits to, without taking any
credit for it.
 &HT;    ``I'm often asked the secret of this so-called `cool,''' he
says, laughing. ``I don't know what `cool' means. When I was a kid,
`cool' meant wearing a turtleneck and a beret. You held a cigarette
_ that was kind of cool. Now I'm called `cool' all the time, but I
don't know what it means.
 &HT;    ``My characters are cool in `Broken Arrow' (1996) and `Get
Shorty' (1995) and `Battlefield Earth,''' he concedes. ``But as a
person, I feel like this big, goofy guy.''

`COMMITTED' TO COMEDY: HEATHER GRAHAM GOES FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Graham in a scene from
``Committed.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sure, she can be as sexy as she wants to be, but Heather Graham
would rather make you laugh.
 &HT;    She scored her breakthrough by skating naked as the porn star
Rollergirl in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997), got explicitly passionate
with Robert Downey Jr. in ``Two Girls and a Guy'' (1997) and was
hilariously raunchy as Felicity Shagwell in ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me'' (1999), so it's understandable if you don't
think of her as a comedienne.
 &HT;    But the actress says that her first starring vehicle,
``Committed,'' now playing nationwide, actually comes closer to the
real Graham.
 &HT;    ``When my boyfriend saw the movie,'' she says, ``he told me,
`That's more like you on the screen, because you're more cute than
sexy.'''
 &HT;    Graham's boyfriend is, of course, actor/writer/director Ed
Burns, best known for making ``The Brothers McMullen'' (1995) and
``She's the One'' (1996) and then starring in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' (1998).
 &HT;    Burns has felt conflicted about watching her past love scenes,
Graham admits.
 &HT;    ``In some ways he finds it a pain in the neck,'' she says.
``But, on the other hand, it's probably an ego boost for him. It's
kind of a double-edged sword _ you don't want the person you love
making love with someone else, but you don't mind watching them on
the screen because you're going to get them in real life.''
 &HT;    Joline, her character in ``Committed,'' is a woman who won't
take ``no'' for an answer. When her husband (Luke Wilson) leaves
her, she sets out to get him back, leading to an odyssey that takes
her from New York to El Paso, Texas.
 &HT;    ``I was actually afraid to show the script to Ed,'' Graham says
with a laugh. ``It was right at the beginning of our relationship,
and I didn't want him to get nervous. I thought he might think I
completely identified with this girl who was so totally committed
to staying married that she seemed just a little bit crazy.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she admits, she sees some of herself in the
character.
 &HT;    ``I am a committed person,'' Graham says reflectively, ``and I
like the idea that marriage is forever. I'm just not as committed
as Joline.
 &HT;    ``I did understand that feeling of being passionate about
something and just giving yourself over to it,'' the actress says.
``I think we all wonder how far we'd go to keep a promise. In her
case, it's `till death do us part.'
 &HT;    ``I think I also identified with Joline's growing realization
that life doesn't always turn out how you expect it to.''
 &HT;    It certainly didn't for Graham, who thought she'd broken through
as a dramatic actress when she played a teen-age drunk in ``License
to Drive'' (1988) and went on to play a junkie who dies from an
overdose in Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989). But it
wasn't until the surprise hit ``Swingers'' (1996) and, especially,
``Boogie Nights'' that Graham suddenly ``made it,'' hitting
magazine covers and sexiest-women lists nationwide.
 &HT;    That image was something new for the actress, who had a Catholic
upbringing as the daughter of an FBI agent and a schoolteacher so
strict that they deemed ``The Love Boat'' too racy for their
daughters to watch.
 &HT;    ``I was the Goody Two-Shoes,'' she recalls, ``and I wrestled a
lot with thoughts about sex, because my religion made me feel it
was horrible and I would go to hell.
 &HT;    ``I think that I had to work through a lot of things because of
my upbringing,'' the actress adds. ``I don't know if it put a
burden on me _ I guess everyone has certain things from their
upbringing that they need to work out.''
 &HT;    Graham is currently estranged from both the Catholic church and
her parents and sister, but she doesn't want to discuss it.
 &HT;    ``I haven't spoken to my family in something like five years,''
she says with a shrug. ``It's my choice. All I'll say is the reason
has nothing to do with the fact that I'm an actress.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, she bonded immediately with Burns' parents.
 &HT;    ``I love his family,'' Graham says. ``They're really funny. They
have the same kind of sense of humor that Ed does, giving each
other a hard time and teasing. And they're reminiscing fools _
they'll sit and talk about every single thing that's happened in
their lives from their childhood on.''
 &HT;    Next to her acting, her relationship to Burns seems to define
her life. And she doesn't mind saying so, either.
 &HT;    ``I was thinking, `God, look at all these celebrities that
refuse to talk about their relationships. Like, am I making a big
mistake here, like, talking about it?''' she says. ``But I just
think I'm in love, and I've never been this in love, and I think
there's something really kind of beautiful when Ed reads what I say
about him.
 &HT;    ``I think there's something really sweet and romantic about
that,'' she adds. ``He loves it. Every time he reads an article and
I talk about him, he is like, `I love it. This is so great _ I
can't wait for my friends to read this.'''
 &HT;    The two spend huge amounts of time together, Graham reports,
without ever getting tired of each other.
 &HT;    ``We love to do stuff together,'' she says. ``Ed watched a video
of `Swingers' and got a kick out of the swing-dancing parts. He
decided he wanted to learn, so now we're taking dancing lessons
together, everything from the tango to the foxtrot.''
 &HT;    One thing they don't do together is talk about acting, however.
Burns may be a director, she says, but he never has any tips to
offer on her performances.
 &HT;    ``His acting philosophy is, `I don't know,''' she says with a
laugh. ``He's always saying about his acting, `I suck.' But I think
he's really good.''
 &HT;    Particularly gratifying to Graham is Burns' apparent
indifference to the fact that, for all his success, his girlfriend
usually attracts more fan attention than he does.
 &HT;    ``Last year Ed did a movie with Robert De Niro,'' she says,
``and I would visit him on the set. One day De Niro said, `I hope
Heather is coming tomorrow, because my niece and nephew are going
to be here, and they really want to meet her because they loved
`Austin Powers.'
 &HT;    ``Then I was late, and De Niro kept saying to Ed, `Is she here
yet? We're waiting for her,''' Graham says, laughing. ``I thought
it was so bizarre that De Niro was waiting for me.''
 &HT;    Continuing her preference for comedy _ and following up her
critically praised performance in ``Bowfinger'' (1999) _ Graham is
currently at work on the Farrelly brothers' ``Say It Isn't So''
opposite Chris Klein.
 &HT;    She recently celebrated her 30th birthday as one of Hollywood's
hottest stars and says that, in retrospect, she's glad that she
didn't reach that level any earlier.
 &HT;    ``I think all your mistakes add to your wisdom,'' the actress
says thoughtfully. ``In the beginning, I had a real lack of
confidence, and I thought everyone else knew more than I did. I
really kept my opinions to myself.
 &HT;    ``Then I figured out that, whether you do something wrong or
even stupid, it's all right _ it's all part of growing,'' Graham
says. ``I think that really helped me.
 &HT;    ``I only wish I had figured it out earlier.''

GOTTA DANCE: AMANDA SCHULL TAKES `CENTER STAGE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Amanda Schull dancing with Ethan Stiefel
and Sascha Radetsky in a scene from ``Center Stage.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's not exactly Lana Turner being plucked from obscurity while
sipping soda at Schwab's Drugstore, but ...
 &HT;    Barely 12 months ago, aspiring ballerina Amanda Schull was at
the San Francisco Ballet School, rehearsing for an end-of-the-year
performance. Her most ambitious dream was to plie her way to a
contract with the school's parent company, the San Francisco
Ballet.
 &HT;    By chance, she encountered one of many casting agents dispatched
across the country by the producers of the upcoming dance movie
``Center Stage,'' assigned to scout both professional and student
dancers for the pivotal role of Jody Sawyer. The agent invited
Schull to read for the part.
 &HT;    ``I read the next morning,'' Schull says. ``I'd just come from a
rehearsal. She had a little camcorder, and I was beet-red, dripping
with sweat, out of breath and inarticulate. I was beside myself. I
was too excited.
 &HT;    ``She said, `We'll speak to you in about three weeks,''' the
21-year-old recalls, ``and I heard from her in three days. I got
flown down to Los Angeles to read for the director, Nicholas
Hytner, and I met the producer. Then they flew me to New York to do
a screen test, and I got myself a movie.''
 &HT;    And so it is that Schull, a Hawaiian-born blonde with blue eyes,
a lithe dancer's body and precious little attitude, came to head
the cast of ``Center Stage,'' which opens nationwide on May 12 and
is best described as a cross between ``Rocky'' (1976) and ``Fame''
(1980), set in the world of ballet.
 &HT;    Though the film focuses on three young hopefuls _ Schull as the
naive newcomer, Zoe Saldana as a girl with an attitude and Susan
May Pratt as a self-destructive prima donna _ it also makes time
for a smug star (Ethan Stiefel), the pompous artistic director
(Peter Gallagher) threatened by the smug star, a respected teacher
(Donna Murphy), a gay black dancer (Shakiem Evans), Jody's two
would-be boyfriends (Sascha Radetsky and Eion Bailey) and a stage
mother (Debra Monk) vicariously living a dream through her
daughter.
 &HT;    ``I think it's very realistic,'' Schull says during an interview
at New York's Regency Hotel. ``For the screen test they only gave
me a couple of scenes, and they were realistic to me. I had no idea
what to expect and, of course, I thought, `Hollywood is going to
glam it up. It's going to be totally outlandish.'
 &HT;    ``But when I read the whole thing,'' Schull recalls, ``I was
really impressed. They touched on so many different things that it
gives a really general view of all the elements that go into the
life of a dancer, the whole process of becoming a dancer.
 &HT;    ``Nick Hytner was very instrumental in the authenticity,'' she
adds. ``He was constantly asking us for our perspective. `Would you
do this? Would you say this? Would you wear this?' He was always
making sure that we confirmed every single element of the whole
film.''
 &HT;    That's a lot of elements _ backstabbing, underhanded alliances
between competitors, stage mothers from hell, bulimia ...
 &HT;    ``I've seen everything this movie touches on, to the umpteenth
degree,'' Schull says. ``I've seen anorexia, I've seen bulimia,
I've seen stage moms. I've dealt with jealousy and backstabbing.
It's unfortunate, but because there are so many dancers and so few
roles, there is a lot of backstabbing and a lot of unfortunate
experiences.
 &HT;    ``That's another reason the film was nice,'' she says, ``because
they didn't try to hide any of the unglamorous parts. The curtain
goes up and you see all the pretty ballerinas in their tutus and
you think, `Wow, that was just beautiful. Wow, they're just
beautiful.'
 &HT;    ``But you have no idea what goes into the day of a dancer _ you
have no idea what we put our minds through, what we put our bodies
through, what we put our lives through.
 &HT;    ``It's really nice to bring that to a larger audience,'' Schull
concludes, ``so people will hopefully be able to appreciate and
respect our art more.''
 &HT;    Making the film, the young dancer says, was pretty painless.
Acting came fairly easily, because she had her personal experience,
her co-stars and Hytner to draw on for guidance.
 &HT;    Watching herself, though, was another matter.
 &HT;    ``It was me, on the screen,'' she says, cringing. ``I'd never
seen myself dance on a screen that big.
 &HT;    ``Artists always criticize their own work,'' she says with a
grimace. ``Of course, I found little things wrong, with my
shoulders off that way or my foot not pointed right.''
 &HT;    After completing ``Center Stage,'' Schull returned to the San
Francisco Ballet, with which she has a one-year contract. However,
she's not center stage there _ simply a member of the corps de
ballet, one of the unheralded dancers who help make the star look
great.
 &HT;    ``It could have been a lot harder if the people in San Francisco
weren't so amazing,'' Schull says. ``They're very supportive, and
they're curious and interested.
 &HT;    ``I had people say during the movie, `You're so spoiled here,
and when you go back you're just going to be an apprentice,''' she
adds. ``But it wasn't like I was expecting flowers to be thrown at
my feet. It hasn't been hard.''
 &HT;    In part, that's because Schull still thinks of herself as a
dancer, not an actress.
 &HT;    ``I have no idea what the future holds for me, but I've been
working really hard my whole life to be a dancer,'' she says. ``I
started at the age of 4, and I've overcome a lot of obstacles. If I
were to give everything up right now on the off chance I had a
possibility in Hollywood, I wouldn't be paying myself any justice.
 &HT;    ``It's also my first year as a professional dancer,'' Schull
says. ``It's not like I'm jaded or anything. The dancing is still
new and interesting to me. But of course this was an amazing
experience, and I'm not going to close any doors.
 &HT;    ``I just don't want to count my chickens, I guess.''

<P>
   Don't believe the hype _ ``Star Trek'' is not dead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impending end of television's ``Star Trek:
Voyager,'' the lag in the creation of a new series and problems at
the feature-film box office, the ``Star Trek'' franchise is doing
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a baseball manager might say, this is a rebuilding
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Voyager'' will air its season finale on May 24.
``Unimatrix Zero'' marks the return of the Borg and its queen,
played by ``Once and Again's'' Susanna Thompson. However, if
Internet reports are to be believed _ and we're not saying they are
_ Part One may also feature the assimilation of one or more main
characters, a plot used to huge success by ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' for its season-ender 10 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, is that the conclusion of this week's
episode, airing some time next fall, will mark the beginning of the
end for ``Voyager'': Paramount has confirmed that next season, the
show's seventh, will be its last.
</P>
<P>
   That begs a question that fans have been asking since ... well,
since the show debuted in 1995: When will the Voyager make it home?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, soon _ maybe even sooner than expected. While many
have assumed that the Voyager's return to earth would highlight the
final episode, ``Trek'' analysts and at least one cast member _
Robert Picardo _ are speculating that the voyage home will end
sometime next November, with the sweeps-week airing of a previously
announced, two-hour-long ``Trek'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   The timing would be perfect, after all, leaving half a season
for the characters to readjust to Earth and rejoin the Federation,
setting up possible future ``Voyager'' television movies or feature
films.
</P>
<P>
   But that brings up another nagging question: Just what are the
plans for future television movies and feature films?
</P>
<P>
   After ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' ended last year, there were
rumors that the cast would reunite for a television movie, as
happened with ``Babylon 5.'' So far, however, no launching pad has
been erected.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, there hasn't been a peep from
Paramount regarding a 10th ``Star Trek'' feature film. Indeed,
Majel Barrett Roddenberry, widow of ``Star Trek'' creator Gene
Roddenberry, recently told Cinescape magazine that she wouldn't be
surprised if there were no immediate plans for a new film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think there is going to be another movie
for a bit,'' she said. ``There are just so many questions about
what cast they want to use or if they want to start over with a new
group of actors.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the last movie, ``Star Trek: Insurrection''
(1999), garnered poor reviews and a paltry $70 million at the
American box office. Some have suggested that the feature-film
goose may have laid its last golden eggs for now.
</P>
<P>
   There's definitely a future for ``Star Trek'' on the small
screen, however. Paramount and ``Trek'' bigwigs Rick Berman and
Brannon Braga are even now mulling over ideas for the long-promised
fifth television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you much about the new `Star Trek' series, except
that there will be one,'' Braga told fans at the Star Trek Grand
Slam Convention in California last month. ``We haven't nailed down
a concept yet, but we intend to do something that captures the
essence of `Star Trek,' but is completely original and new.''
</P>
<P>
   Braga and Berman are shooting for an early-2001 launch date for
the new series, which would enable it to build on what is expected
to be substantial buzz over ``Voyager's'' grand finale in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In short, even without anything official on future ``Star Trek''
movie or television projects, the development wheel is turning. No
one is ready to give up on a billion-dollar industry just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the low ratings, diminished box office and perceived
creative snags. ``Star Trek,'' in all its forms, is alive and well
and will undoubtedly live long and prosper. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: `STAR TREK: RUMORVILLE' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Television has a new, unnamed ``Star Trek'' series in
development, but so far the powers that be are keeping their cards
very close to the vest as to what the setting for that series might
be, whether it would involve existing characters or even in what
time frame it might be set.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, however, that hasn't stopped Internet-based
Trekkers from speculating and offering their own ideas. Here are
seven of the hottest rumors, presented with the understanding that
_ like almost anything on the Internet _ they probably aren't worth
the screens they're downloaded onto. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: EXCELSIOR.'
</P>
<P>
   There's a strong fan movement afoot to create a series around
Captain Sulu (George Takei) and his U.S.S. Excelsior crew, as seen
in ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991) and the
``Voyager'' episode ``Flashback.''
</P>
<P>
   Takei is all for it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: THE PREQUEL'
</P>
<P>
   One early scenario involved a series that would serve as a
prequel to the original ``Star Trek,'' featuring the very first
crew of the Enterprise, which is established as having been led by
Capt. Robert April.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: ACADEMY'
</P>
<P>
   Imagine seeing Kirk, Spock and McCoy as Starfleet Academy
cadets. That would be the idea behind a widely disseminated
scenario called ``Star Trek: Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the ``Next Generation'' episode ``Tapestry.'' But
casting the three lead roles/cultural icons would be
extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: FLIGHT ACADEMY'
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Top Gun'' (1986) in outer space. That's the idea
behind this projected scenario, which would star hotshot
wannabe-Starfleet pilots in a style much like the ``Next
Generation'' episode ``The First Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: SECTION 31'
</P>
<P>
   5) Another scenario, one of the most removed from the basic
``Trek'' format, has a group of top-secret Starfleet investigators
solving crimes and thwarting conspiracies in the previously
established Section 31. Something like the ``DS9'' episode
``Inquisition,'' in short.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: YOUNG GUNS'
</P>
<P>
   Young Starfleet officers commanding a ship is another approach
being tossed around, taking inspiration from the ``Next
Generation'' episode ``Lower Decks'' and the ``DS9'' episode
``Valiant.''
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: ALIENS'
</P>
<P>
   Two other theories postulate entire shows being based around
either Klingons or Ferengis.

ALIENATION: JOHN TRAVOLTA IS THE BAD GUY IN `BATTLEFIELD EARTH' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of John Travolta with Christian Tessier and
Barry Pepper in a scene from ``Battlefield Earth.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Fighting off the aliens was hard, but getting the movie made was
almost impossible.
 &HT;    ``Listen, it's been a 15-year struggle to get this movie done,''
says John Travolta, star and executive producer of ``Battlefield
Earth,'' which will open nationwide on May 12. ``I'm bringing a
historic book to the big screen.''
 &HT;    The delay, of course, was caused by the fact that the movie is
based on a 1982 novel by L. Ron Hubbard, who also founded
Scientology, the controversial religious sect of which Travolta is
a high-profile member.
 &HT;    But the actor insists that ``Battlefield Earth'' isn't about
Scientology in any way, shape or form _ that it might have been
written by an author of any religious orientation.
 &HT;    ``It's just a classic science-fiction story,'' he says. ``This
is an action film based on one of the biggest science-fiction books
ever. The novel is right up there with `Dune.' It belongs on the
screen.
 &HT;    ``I just can't wait for the people to be able to see this
movie,'' the soft-spoken actor says, relaxing in a suite at Los
Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, casually dressed in gray pants and a
matching sweater. ``I've already heard the film dubbed this
summer's `Star Wars.'''
 &HT;    Travolta optioned the novel in 1984, planning to play the film's
young hero, Johnny Goodboy Tyler, who in 3000 A.D. leads a revolt
against the alien Psychlos who have taken over the world and
enslaved humanity. By the time he got the film made, however, he
had aged out of the role, and was forced to cede it to Barry
Pepper, most recently seen in ``The Green Mile'' (1999).
 &HT;    It's a pity, the actor says, because there's a lot of
interesting aspects to the role of Johnny.
 &HT;    ``Humans have actually become hunters and gatherers again to
survive,'' Travolta says. ``They live this harsh existence, just
trying to keep a piece of their planet. But it's not exactly easy
on them.''
 &HT;    As for himself, Travolta plays Terl, an 8-foot-tall Psychlo with
lots of hair and one bad attitude.
 &HT;    ``He's a very theatrical character,'' Travolta says. ``I almost
think of him as someone Shakespeare could have created. It's all
about manipulation and blackmail for this character _ he is truly
the most evil character I've ever tried to play.''
 &HT;    And the ugliest, to boot.
 &HT;    ``The movie required an amazing physical transformation,''
Travolta says. ``I wear a tall-head apparatus with strange hair. I
have amber eyes and talons for hands. It's quite remarkable.''
 &HT;    After spending much of the shoot teetering on 4-foot stilts to
capture a Psychlo's stature, Travolta professes unconcern about the
possibility of religious controversy over the movie.
 &HT;    ``The e-mail and fan mail since this picture was announced as a
go has been extraordinary,'' he says. ``I've never been involved
with a picture that got this amount of pre-excitement.
 &HT;    ``In fact, since we could only film half of the 1,050-page book,
the studio is so high on the project that we're even already
talking about a sequel for 2002,'' he adds. ``That's how much
confidence there is in the project.''
 &HT;    He's even pondering making movies of two other Hubbard novels,
``Mission Earth'' (1991) and ``Fear'' (1992).
 &HT;    ``I would love to add science fiction to my body of work,''
Travolta says. ``It's the one genre that I've missed. But I'd like
to do sci-fi in a more realistic way _ you should keep it grounded
in some sort of reality.''
 &HT;    Since resurrecting his film career with ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994),
Travolta has been on a roll, snagging one choice role after another
and earning $20 million a picture. About all he needs to round
things off is an Oscar.
 &HT;    ``Of course, you don't want to build yourself up too much in
case it doesn't happen,'' he says. ``But I've been really proud of
the work I've done in the last few years. I was extremely proud of
`A Civil Action' (1998) and `Primary Colors' (1998). I think these
were pivotal points in terms of my acting career. I think that's
where you see the growth as an actor.''
 &HT;    He doesn't claim any tremendous thespian talent, however, giving
most of the credit to the writers of his films and to his own
legendary work ethic.
 &HT;    ``It's just a matter of the material and what you put out
there,'' Travolta says. ``Your popularity really does depend on
doing good work. Above all, I know for a fact that it can all go
away in a moment.''
 &HT;    That sense may lie behind the barrage of movies Travolta has
cranked out since ``Pulp Fiction,'' and he shows no sign of slowing
down. Later this summer he'll be seen opposite Lisa Kudrow in Nora
Ephron's ``Numbers,'' a comedy about a lottery scam. He is also
signed to do a thriller called ``Domestic Disturbances'' and an
action film called ``Swordfish,'' and he's admitted that the idea
of doing another musical _ his first since ``Grease'' (1978) _
intrigues him.
 &HT;    ``I just want to continue to work at the highest level and
always get better as an actor,'' Travolta says. ``I think there are
many challenges left in this life. Finding an exciting character to
play is the ultimate work challenge, but I also have challenges in
aviation. And the ultimate challenge is to take care of my family
and my 40 employees, whom I love very much.''
 &HT;    That family includes wife Kelly Preston, who plays a female
alien in ``Battlefield Earth,'' their 7-year-old son Jett and a
newborn daughter.
 &HT;    ``I haven't been the same man since I became a father,''
Travolta says. ``Mostly, I'm more vulnerable. You don't ever quite
feel about anyone the way you feel about your child _ you worry
more than you're used to worrying. You get sad when you're not with
them. And it's a vulnerable feeling being a parent.''
 &HT;    Travolta is a hands-on parent, playing Santa each Christmas and
even accompanying Jett around the neighborhood trick-or-treating
last October.
 &HT;    ``I was the Grim Reaper,'' he says, laughing at the memory. ``It
was a way to hide my face. I wore this big hood so no one knew it
was me, until I couldn't breathe under the mask. I finally had to
take it off, and then I was just Jett's dad in this big robe.''
 &HT;    Well, not just that. He is, after all, one of Hollywood's
personifications of cool _ which he admits to, without taking any
credit for it.
 &HT;    ``I'm often asked the secret of this so-called `cool,''' he
says, laughing. ``I don't know what `cool' means. When I was a kid,
`cool' meant wearing a turtleneck and a beret. You held a cigarette
_ that was kind of cool. Now I'm called `cool' all the time, but I
don't know what it means.
 &HT;    ``My characters are cool in `Broken Arrow' (1996) and `Get
Shorty' (1995) and `Battlefield Earth,''' he concedes. ``But as a
person, I feel like this big, goofy guy.''

`COMMITTED' TO COMEDY: HEATHER GRAHAM GOES FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Graham in a scene from
``Committed.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Sure, she can be as sexy as she wants to be, but Heather Graham
would rather make you laugh.
 &HT;    She scored her breakthrough by skating naked as the porn star
Rollergirl in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997), got explicitly passionate
with Robert Downey Jr. in ``Two Girls and a Guy'' (1997) and was
hilariously raunchy as Felicity Shagwell in ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me'' (1999), so it's understandable if you don't
think of her as a comedienne.
 &HT;    But the actress says that her first starring vehicle,
``Committed,'' now playing nationwide, actually comes closer to the
real Graham.
 &HT;    ``When my boyfriend saw the movie,'' she says, ``he told me,
`That's more like you on the screen, because you're more cute than
sexy.'''
 &HT;    Graham's boyfriend is, of course, actor/writer/director Ed
Burns, best known for making ``The Brothers McMullen'' (1995) and
``She's the One'' (1996) and then starring in ``Saving Private
Ryan'' (1998).
 &HT;    Burns has felt conflicted about watching her past love scenes,
Graham admits.
 &HT;    ``In some ways he finds it a pain in the neck,'' she says.
``But, on the other hand, it's probably an ego boost for him. It's
kind of a double-edged sword _ you don't want the person you love
making love with someone else, but you don't mind watching them on
the screen because you're going to get them in real life.''
 &HT;    Joline, her character in ``Committed,'' is a woman who won't
take ``no'' for an answer. When her husband (Luke Wilson) leaves
her, she sets out to get him back, leading to an odyssey that takes
her from New York to El Paso, Texas.
 &HT;    ``I was actually afraid to show the script to Ed,'' Graham says
with a laugh. ``It was right at the beginning of our relationship,
and I didn't want him to get nervous. I thought he might think I
completely identified with this girl who was so totally committed
to staying married that she seemed just a little bit crazy.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, she admits, she sees some of herself in the
character.
 &HT;    ``I am a committed person,'' Graham says reflectively, ``and I
like the idea that marriage is forever. I'm just not as committed
as Joline.
 &HT;    ``I did understand that feeling of being passionate about
something and just giving yourself over to it,'' the actress says.
``I think we all wonder how far we'd go to keep a promise. In her
case, it's `till death do us part.'
 &HT;    ``I think I also identified with Joline's growing realization
that life doesn't always turn out how you expect it to.''
 &HT;    It certainly didn't for Graham, who thought she'd broken through
as a dramatic actress when she played a teen-age drunk in ``License
to Drive'' (1988) and went on to play a junkie who dies from an
overdose in Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989). But it
wasn't until the surprise hit ``Swingers'' (1996) and, especially,
``Boogie Nights'' that Graham suddenly ``made it,'' hitting
magazine covers and sexiest-women lists nationwide.
 &HT;    That image was something new for the actress, who had a Catholic
upbringing as the daughter of an FBI agent and a schoolteacher so
strict that they deemed ``The Love Boat'' too racy for their
daughters to watch.
 &HT;    ``I was the Goody Two-Shoes,'' she recalls, ``and I wrestled a
lot with thoughts about sex, because my religion made me feel it
was horrible and I would go to hell.
 &HT;    ``I think that I had to work through a lot of things because of
my upbringing,'' the actress adds. ``I don't know if it put a
burden on me _ I guess everyone has certain things from their
upbringing that they need to work out.''
 &HT;    Graham is currently estranged from both the Catholic church and
her parents and sister, but she doesn't want to discuss it.
 &HT;    ``I haven't spoken to my family in something like five years,''
she says with a shrug. ``It's my choice. All I'll say is the reason
has nothing to do with the fact that I'm an actress.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, she bonded immediately with Burns' parents.
 &HT;    ``I love his family,'' Graham says. ``They're really funny. They
have the same kind of sense of humor that Ed does, giving each
other a hard time and teasing. And they're reminiscing fools _
they'll sit and talk about every single thing that's happened in
their lives from their childhood on.''
 &HT;    Next to her acting, her relationship to Burns seems to define
her life. And she doesn't mind saying so, either.
 &HT;    ``I was thinking, `God, look at all these celebrities that
refuse to talk about their relationships. Like, am I making a big
mistake here, like, talking about it?''' she says. ``But I just
think I'm in love, and I've never been this in love, and I think
there's something really kind of beautiful when Ed reads what I say
about him.
 &HT;    ``I think there's something really sweet and romantic about
that,'' she adds. ``He loves it. Every time he reads an article and
I talk about him, he is like, `I love it. This is so great _ I
can't wait for my friends to read this.'''
 &HT;    The two spend huge amounts of time together, Graham reports,
without ever getting tired of each other.
 &HT;    ``We love to do stuff together,'' she says. ``Ed watched a video
of `Swingers' and got a kick out of the swing-dancing parts. He
decided he wanted to learn, so now we're taking dancing lessons
together, everything from the tango to the foxtrot.''
 &HT;    One thing they don't do together is talk about acting, however.
Burns may be a director, she says, but he never has any tips to
offer on her performances.
 &HT;    ``His acting philosophy is, `I don't know,''' she says with a
laugh. ``He's always saying about his acting, `I suck.' But I think
he's really good.''
 &HT;    Particularly gratifying to Graham is Burns' apparent
indifference to the fact that, for all his success, his girlfriend
usually attracts more fan attention than he does.
 &HT;    ``Last year Ed did a movie with Robert De Niro,'' she says,
``and I would visit him on the set. One day De Niro said, `I hope
Heather is coming tomorrow, because my niece and nephew are going
to be here, and they really want to meet her because they loved
`Austin Powers.'
 &HT;    ``Then I was late, and De Niro kept saying to Ed, `Is she here
yet? We're waiting for her,''' Graham says, laughing. ``I thought
it was so bizarre that De Niro was waiting for me.''
 &HT;    Continuing her preference for comedy _ and following up her
critically praised performance in ``Bowfinger'' (1999) _ Graham is
currently at work on the Farrelly brothers' ``Say It Isn't So''
opposite Chris Klein.
 &HT;    She recently celebrated her 30th birthday as one of Hollywood's
hottest stars and says that, in retrospect, she's glad that she
didn't reach that level any earlier.
 &HT;    ``I think all your mistakes add to your wisdom,'' the actress
says thoughtfully. ``In the beginning, I had a real lack of
confidence, and I thought everyone else knew more than I did. I
really kept my opinions to myself.
 &HT;    ``Then I figured out that, whether you do something wrong or
even stupid, it's all right _ it's all part of growing,'' Graham
says. ``I think that really helped me.
 &HT;    ``I only wish I had figured it out earlier.''

GOTTA DANCE: AMANDA SCHULL TAKES `CENTER STAGE'

 (Includes a color slide of Amanda Schull dancing with Ethan Stiefel
and Sascha Radetsky in a scene from ``Center Stage.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's not exactly Lana Turner being plucked from obscurity while
sipping soda at Schwab's Drugstore, but ...
 &HT;    Barely 12 months ago, aspiring ballerina Amanda Schull was at
the San Francisco Ballet School, rehearsing for an end-of-the-year
performance. Her most ambitious dream was to plie her way to a
contract with the school's parent company, the San Francisco
Ballet.
 &HT;    By chance, she encountered one of many casting agents dispatched
across the country by the producers of the upcoming dance movie
``Center Stage,'' assigned to scout both professional and student
dancers for the pivotal role of Jody Sawyer. The agent invited
Schull to read for the part.
 &HT;    ``I read the next morning,'' Schull says. ``I'd just come from a
rehearsal. She had a little camcorder, and I was beet-red, dripping
with sweat, out of breath and inarticulate. I was beside myself. I
was too excited.
 &HT;    ``She said, `We'll speak to you in about three weeks,''' the
21-year-old recalls, ``and I heard from her in three days. I got
flown down to Los Angeles to read for the director, Nicholas
Hytner, and I met the producer. Then they flew me to New York to do
a screen test, and I got myself a movie.''
 &HT;    And so it is that Schull, a Hawaiian-born blonde with blue eyes,
a lithe dancer's body and precious little attitude, came to head
the cast of ``Center Stage,'' which opens nationwide on May 12 and
is best described as a cross between ``Rocky'' (1976) and ``Fame''
(1980), set in the world of ballet.
 &HT;    Though the film focuses on three young hopefuls _ Schull as the
naive newcomer, Zoe Saldana as a girl with an attitude and Susan
May Pratt as a self-destructive prima donna _ it also makes time
for a smug star (Ethan Stiefel), the pompous artistic director
(Peter Gallagher) threatened by the smug star, a respected teacher
(Donna Murphy), a gay black dancer (Shakiem Evans), Jody's two
would-be boyfriends (Sascha Radetsky and Eion Bailey) and a stage
mother (Debra Monk) vicariously living a dream through her
daughter.
 &HT;    ``I think it's very realistic,'' Schull says during an interview
at New York's Regency Hotel. ``For the screen test they only gave
me a couple of scenes, and they were realistic to me. I had no idea
what to expect and, of course, I thought, `Hollywood is going to
glam it up. It's going to be totally outlandish.'
 &HT;    ``But when I read the whole thing,'' Schull recalls, ``I was
really impressed. They touched on so many different things that it
gives a really general view of all the elements that go into the
life of a dancer, the whole process of becoming a dancer.
 &HT;    ``Nick Hytner was very instrumental in the authenticity,'' she
adds. ``He was constantly asking us for our perspective. `Would you
do this? Would you say this? Would you wear this?' He was always
making sure that we confirmed every single element of the whole
film.''
 &HT;    That's a lot of elements _ backstabbing, underhanded alliances
between competitors, stage mothers from hell, bulimia ...
 &HT;    ``I've seen everything this movie touches on, to the umpteenth
degree,'' Schull says. ``I've seen anorexia, I've seen bulimia,
I've seen stage moms. I've dealt with jealousy and backstabbing.
It's unfortunate, but because there are so many dancers and so few
roles, there is a lot of backstabbing and a lot of unfortunate
experiences.
 &HT;    ``That's another reason the film was nice,'' she says, ``because
they didn't try to hide any of the unglamorous parts. The curtain
goes up and you see all the pretty ballerinas in their tutus and
you think, `Wow, that was just beautiful. Wow, they're just
beautiful.'
 &HT;    ``But you have no idea what goes into the day of a dancer _ you
have no idea what we put our minds through, what we put our bodies
through, what we put our lives through.
 &HT;    ``It's really nice to bring that to a larger audience,'' Schull
concludes, ``so people will hopefully be able to appreciate and
respect our art more.''
 &HT;    Making the film, the young dancer says, was pretty painless.
Acting came fairly easily, because she had her personal experience,
her co-stars and Hytner to draw on for guidance.
 &HT;    Watching herself, though, was another matter.
 &HT;    ``It was me, on the screen,'' she says, cringing. ``I'd never
seen myself dance on a screen that big.
 &HT;    ``Artists always criticize their own work,'' she says with a
grimace. ``Of course, I found little things wrong, with my
shoulders off that way or my foot not pointed right.''
 &HT;    After completing ``Center Stage,'' Schull returned to the San
Francisco Ballet, with which she has a one-year contract. However,
she's not center stage there _ simply a member of the corps de
ballet, one of the unheralded dancers who help make the star look
great.
 &HT;    ``It could have been a lot harder if the people in San Francisco
weren't so amazing,'' Schull says. ``They're very supportive, and
they're curious and interested.
 &HT;    ``I had people say during the movie, `You're so spoiled here,
and when you go back you're just going to be an apprentice,''' she
adds. ``But it wasn't like I was expecting flowers to be thrown at
my feet. It hasn't been hard.''
 &HT;    In part, that's because Schull still thinks of herself as a
dancer, not an actress.
 &HT;    ``I have no idea what the future holds for me, but I've been
working really hard my whole life to be a dancer,'' she says. ``I
started at the age of 4, and I've overcome a lot of obstacles. If I
were to give everything up right now on the off chance I had a
possibility in Hollywood, I wouldn't be paying myself any justice.
 &HT;    ``It's also my first year as a professional dancer,'' Schull
says. ``It's not like I'm jaded or anything. The dancing is still
new and interesting to me. But of course this was an amazing
experience, and I'm not going to close any doors.
 &HT;    ``I just don't want to count my chickens, I guess.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't believe the hype _ ``Star Trek'' is not dead.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impending end of television's ``Star Trek:
Voyager,'' the lag in the creation of a new series and problems at
the feature-film box office, the ``Star Trek'' franchise is doing
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a baseball manager might say, this is a rebuilding
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Voyager'' will air its season finale on May 24.
``Unimatrix Zero'' marks the return of the Borg and its queen,
played by ``Once and Again's'' Susanna Thompson. However, if
Internet reports are to be believed _ and we're not saying they are
_ Part One may also feature the assimilation of one or more main
characters, a plot used to huge success by ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' for its season-ender 10 years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, is that the conclusion of this week's
episode, airing some time next fall, will mark the beginning of the
end for ``Voyager'': Paramount has confirmed that next season, the
show's seventh, will be its last.
</P>
<P>
   That begs a question that fans have been asking since ... well,
since the show debuted in 1995: When will the Voyager make it home?
</P>
<P>
   In a word, soon _ maybe even sooner than expected. While many
have assumed that the Voyager's return to earth would highlight the
final episode, ``Trek'' analysts and at least one cast member _
Robert Picardo _ are speculating that the voyage home will end
sometime next November, with the sweeps-week airing of a previously
announced, two-hour-long ``Trek'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   The timing would be perfect, after all, leaving half a season
for the characters to readjust to Earth and rejoin the Federation,
setting up possible future ``Voyager'' television movies or feature
films.
</P>
<P>
   But that brings up another nagging question: Just what are the
plans for future television movies and feature films?
</P>
<P>
   After ``Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' ended last year, there were
rumors that the cast would reunite for a television movie, as
happened with ``Babylon 5.'' So far, however, no launching pad has
been erected.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, there hasn't been a peep from
Paramount regarding a 10th ``Star Trek'' feature film. Indeed,
Majel Barrett Roddenberry, widow of ``Star Trek'' creator Gene
Roddenberry, recently told Cinescape magazine that she wouldn't be
surprised if there were no immediate plans for a new film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think there is going to be another movie
for a bit,'' she said. ``There are just so many questions about
what cast they want to use or if they want to start over with a new
group of actors.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the last movie, ``Star Trek: Insurrection''
(1999), garnered poor reviews and a paltry $70 million at the
American box office. Some have suggested that the feature-film
goose may have laid its last golden eggs for now.
</P>
<P>
   There's definitely a future for ``Star Trek'' on the small
screen, however. Paramount and ``Trek'' bigwigs Rick Berman and
Brannon Braga are even now mulling over ideas for the long-promised
fifth television series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you much about the new `Star Trek' series, except
that there will be one,'' Braga told fans at the Star Trek Grand
Slam Convention in California last month. ``We haven't nailed down
a concept yet, but we intend to do something that captures the
essence of `Star Trek,' but is completely original and new.''
</P>
<P>
   Braga and Berman are shooting for an early-2001 launch date for
the new series, which would enable it to build on what is expected
to be substantial buzz over ``Voyager's'' grand finale in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In short, even without anything official on future ``Star Trek''
movie or television projects, the development wheel is turning. No
one is ready to give up on a billion-dollar industry just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the low ratings, diminished box office and perceived
creative snags. ``Star Trek,'' in all its forms, is alive and well
and will undoubtedly live long and prosper. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: `STAR TREK: RUMORVILLE' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Television has a new, unnamed ``Star Trek'' series in
development, but so far the powers that be are keeping their cards
very close to the vest as to what the setting for that series might
be, whether it would involve existing characters or even in what
time frame it might be set.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, however, that hasn't stopped Internet-based
Trekkers from speculating and offering their own ideas. Here are
seven of the hottest rumors, presented with the understanding that
_ like almost anything on the Internet _ they probably aren't worth
the screens they're downloaded onto. &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: EXCELSIOR.'
</P>
<P>
   There's a strong fan movement afoot to create a series around
Captain Sulu (George Takei) and his U.S.S. Excelsior crew, as seen
in ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country'' (1991) and the
``Voyager'' episode ``Flashback.''
</P>
<P>
   Takei is all for it, of course.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: THE PREQUEL'
</P>
<P>
   One early scenario involved a series that would serve as a
prequel to the original ``Star Trek,'' featuring the very first
crew of the Enterprise, which is established as having been led by
Capt. Robert April.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: ACADEMY'
</P>
<P>
   Imagine seeing Kirk, Spock and McCoy as Starfleet Academy
cadets. That would be the idea behind a widely disseminated
scenario called ``Star Trek: Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of the ``Next Generation'' episode ``Tapestry.'' But
casting the three lead roles/cultural icons would be
extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: FLIGHT ACADEMY'
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Top Gun'' (1986) in outer space. That's the idea
behind this projected scenario, which would star hotshot
wannabe-Starfleet pilots in a style much like the ``Next
Generation'' episode ``The First Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: SECTION 31'
</P>
<P>
   5) Another scenario, one of the most removed from the basic
``Trek'' format, has a group of top-secret Starfleet investigators
solving crimes and thwarting conspiracies in the previously
established Section 31. Something like the ``DS9'' episode
``Inquisition,'' in short.
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: YOUNG GUNS'
</P>
<P>
   Young Starfleet officers commanding a ship is another approach
being tossed around, taking inspiration from the ``Next
Generation'' episode ``Lower Decks'' and the ``DS9'' episode
``Valiant.''
</P>
<P>
   + `STAR TREK: ALIENS'
</P>
<P>
   Two other theories postulate entire shows being based around
either Klingons or Ferengis.

MORE JOURNALISTS PAYING FOR COVERAGE WITH THEIR LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Veton Surroi was an ethnic Albanian and
Slavko Curuvija a Serb, but still they had a lot in common. Both
were journalists who believed a free, robust press was the most
powerful weapon against tyranny. Both used their talents to report
on the repressive regime of Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the difference between the two courageous
journalists could not be greater.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi, who publishes the paper most read by ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, lives in a society run by international peacekeepers and
enjoys freedoms unthinkable a year ago. Curuvija, who published a
magazine and newspaper critical of Milosevic in a capital full of
Serb secret police and paramilitaries, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   And while Serbian journalists endure continuing intimidation,
harassment, and fines, the only people Surroi has to fear are the
ethnic Albanian extremists who threatened him after he called for
an end to revenge killings against the few Serb civilians left in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The fates of these two men, and of the societies in which they
operate, provide a particularly clear-cut example of the
consequences that flow from attempts to repress, and to protect,
free expression. But in Russia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, and
numerous other countries, journalists are paying with their lives
for reporting on official corruption and civil strife.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths of working journalists rose last year to their highest
level since 1994, according to the Vienna-based International Press
Institute, which is holding its world congress in Boston this week.
According to the institute, 65 journalists and 21 support staff
were killed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Committee to Protect Reporters had somewhat
lower totals but also registered its first sharp upswing in
killings of journalists since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the old movies. People nowdays are deliberately
targeted,'' said Johann P. Fritz, director of the institute. ``If
you use an armband or marked car that says press, this will insure
they kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   In countries where corruption and civil strife are rampant,
``drug dealers, corrupt military men, corrupt people in public
administration or civil business _ they really fear the
investigative journalist,'' Fritz said. ``It starts with
harassment, proceeds to intimidation, and if that doesn't succeed
in repressing you, it ends up in murder.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his point, Fritz noted that more than 200
journalists have been killed since the breakdown of the Soviet
Union _ compared with about 100 killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for a free press in Russia say the trend has been
toward greater government control of the media since the rise of
President-elect Vladimir V. Putin, a former officer of the covert
intelligence agency. Oleg Panfilov, of the Russian Journalists'
Union, said the government's desire to control information about
the war in Chechnya, in particular, has led to a marked decrease in
press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The number of journalists imprisoned for their work worldwide
declined last year, to 87 from 118 in 1998, according to a tally by
the Committee to Protect Journalists. But this does not indicate
improving conditions, just a shift in tactics, as authoritarian
regimes turn to trumped-up civil charges and fines to stifle
critical inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Ann K. Cooper, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists,
said authoritarian regimes are increasingly using tax laws,
controls on newsprint and access to printing houses, and influence
on advertisers to pressure critical journals and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be just as effective as burning down the office or
throwing the reporters and editors in jail,'' Cooper said. ``It
makes (the repression) not look so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In Serbia, intimidation and prosecution of journalists is part
of a wider campaign aimed at students, intellectuals, opposition
politicians, and anyone else the government deems to be a potential
dissident, says Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights
Watch's Europe and Central Asia division.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Neier, president of the Soros Foundation network of
organizations promoting open, civil societies, says ``freedom of
the press is one of the most sensitive barometers for the situation
in a country generally. When a country is very dangerous to the
media, it tends to be very bad for freedom and human rights
generally.''
</P>
<P>
   Such danger is evident throughout much of the world, among them
the following three areas:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern Africa &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Press freedoms have been increasingly under threat as war and
political uncertainty have shaken countries across southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Swaziland, where a constitutional reform process stalled in
December, the country's main newspaper was shut down in February
after a contentious battle with the state. The Swazi Observer had a
reputation for exposing corruption and police brutality. The
closure followed efforts by police and government officials to
force two reporters and two editors to reveal their sources behind
a series of stories about police investigations into a 1998 bomb
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time the Observer was shut down, nearly 30
editors in neighboring South Africa were issued subpoenas to answer
allegations of racism in the media. The summonses, which carried
the threat of six months in jail, were repealed following an
international outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the region have been especially and
increasingly intolerant of press freedoms. On March 31, reporter
Rafael Marques was convicted of defaming Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and sentenced to six months in prison. The
proceedings were closed to the public, and Marques was denied legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists also face increasing threats in Zimbabwe as
President Robert Mugabe struggles to hold on to power through
violence. Local and foreign reporters and television news crews
have been harassed, intimidated, and beaten up by government
supporters who have invaded white-owned farms and disrupted
opposition political rallies. The country's only independent
newspaper, the Daily News, was rattled by a bomb attack last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe's most troubling case, journalists from the weekly
Independent, Ray Choto and Mark Chavunduka, were abducted and
tortured by police in January 1999 after refusing to reveal their
sources behind a story indicating a possible military coup attempt.
More than a year later, the two remain charged under the Law and
Order Maintenance Act, a relic of the colonial era that allows the
president wide latitude to act against dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Middle East &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In much of the Middle East _ outside of Israel, which has an
almost totally free domestic media _ journalists are constrained by
official regulations, unofficial harassment, and self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria and Iraq, all media are state-run, and criticism is
banned. Other countries, like Egypt, tightly restrict the media not
only by licensing news outlets but also by controlling newspaper
printing and distribution. Yemen, Jordan, and the Palestinian
Authority maintain strict press laws, employ criminal, libel, and
``state security'' regulations or rely on threatening visits and
phone calls by security men to keep the media compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in the region between advocates of a freer press and
backers of continued tight controls have been exemplified in Iran,
where President Mohammad Khatami is trying to open up the media and
allow critical voices to emerge. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, calls such media ``bases of the enemy,'' and since
last summer, 16 pro-reform publications have been shut down by the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority may be the newest government in the
region, but so far it has employed old methods when it comes to the
media. Press monitors say that Yasser Arafat's administration does
not tolerate dissent or criticism by the press. Reporters and
editors who critically touch on sensitive issues _ like official
corruption, human rights violations, Arafat himself, and the peace
process _ face the threat of arrest or having the media outlet
closed down.
</P>
<P>
   Television, especially from satellite stations, is the one area
in the region where the old restrictions no longer apply. The most
popular station in the Middle East is al-Jazeera, a Qatari
satellite station that offers uncensored, independent news coverage
of the region. Its programs are watched throughout the Arab world
and offer people the chance to hear views and news that are not
reported in their own countries. Its coverage of the Middle East is
so hard-hitting that its reporters have been at times barred from
some Arab countries, including from Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colombia &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm one more. Like the intellectual, like the reporter, like the
human-rights activist, like the displaced person. Like Pacheco.
Nothing more and nothing less. I have to abandon my native land, my
life, my soul, my country.''
</P>
<P>
   So began the March 12 column of Francisco Santos, news editor of
El Tiempo, Bogota's largest daily. Santos wrote the piece as he was
preparing to leave Colombia following threats on his life. A vocal
critic of human rights violations, Santos had been followed by
hired assassins for days, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   His departure followed days after the flight of a popular
television personality, Fernando Pacheco, and several weeks after
the kidnapping of Pacheco's cousin, a television news director.
They are the most recent in a long list of Colombian journalists
caught in the unforgiving gears of the 36-year conflict that has
grown more complicated and more violent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the seven journalists killed there in 1999, 24
were kidnapped and 15 forced to flee the country, acording to the
Bogota-based Press Freedom Foundation.

NEW REPORT SHOWS RACISM IN JUVENILE JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (Editor's note: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, received awards from the National
Council on Crime and Delinquency in 1998 and 1999.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Across this nation, race plays a major role in who's locked up
in juvenile detention centers and for how long. If a teen-ager
belongs to a racial or ethnic minority, he has a much greater
chance of spending time in a detention center or adult prison than
his white counterpart, according to a new report released on April
25.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD), the
nation's oldest criminal justice think tank, prepared the report
for a group of organizations affiliated under the name Building
Blocks for Youth. These organizations include the Youth Law Center,
the Juvenile Law Center, the Justice Policy Institute and the
American Bar Association's Juvenile Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``And Justice for Some: Differential Treatment of
Minority Youth in the Justice System,'' presents a devastating
picture of how racial prejudice at every level of the juvenile
justice system weighs against minority youth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, when white and minority teen-agers with
no prior arrests are charged with the same offenses, blacks are six
times more likely to be incarcerated in public facilities than
whites. And although the figures are somewhat muddy because those
with Hispanic backgrounds are often not listed by ethnicity, Latino
teens are at least three times more likely to be incarcerated than
white teens.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schindler, staff attorney for the Youth Law Center in
Washington, D.C., considers the figures regarding comparable
offenses by teens who had not been arrested before to be startling.
Those statistics had not been reported before, he said. ``And if
you look at the breakdown by offense, for instance, for drug cases
particularly, African Americans are 48 times more likely to be
incarcerated than white kids for the same offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers leave no argument that black and brown kids are
just committing more crimes and therefore more are locked up. These
disparities are so glaring that there's no way that can explain the
disparity. There's something else going on here. The obvious factor
appears to be the race impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Black teens represent the largest racial/ethnic proportion of
youth held behind locked doors. And they are confined for longer
periods of time than white teens for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   Minority youth represented only 34 percent of the total U.S.
population in 1997 _ yet they represented 62 percent of the youth
incarcerated in adult and juvenile facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Currently all 50 states and the District of Columbia allow
juveniles to be incarcerated in adult jails for some crimes. And
between 1992 and 1997, the District of Columbia and all but three
states made it easier to transfer teen-agers as young as 13 from
the juvenile justice system into the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, under the ``get tough on crime'' standard, 7,400 minors
were sent to adult prisons. Three-quarters of those young people
belonged to racial or ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler considers sending young teen-agers to adult prisons
``analogous to a death penalty for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we transfer a youngster into the adult criminal justice
system,'' Schindler said, ``and then subsequently incarcerate them
in adult prisons, we have thrown those kids away. We have ended
their lives as children, some as young as 13, 14 and 15 years old.
We are essentially saying that we, as a society, are giving up on
13- or 14-year-olds, that nothing can be done other than put them
in an adult prison. That's a terrible, terrible indictment on our
society _ to say we can't do anything about those kids. That
they're unredeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   The report points out that minority children are more likely
than their white counterparts to be involved in the juvenile
justice system and that their over representation will increase at
each stage of the process. For the same offenses, a higher
proportion of minority children will be arrested than whites; a
higher proportion of minority children will be charged with crimes
than their white counterparts and a higher proportion of minority
kids than whites will end up incarcerated in public detention
centers than private ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, in every category of criminal offenses
_ against a person, against property, drug dealing, and against
public order _ a substantially greater percentage of black children
were detained by police than white children.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile justice system is tilted dramatically against those
of color in our society. Not surprising, unfortunately. Now, with
this report, we cannot close our eyes to it and pretend it doesn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention Act of 1974 to include a mandate for states to study and
attempt to correct the problem of disproportionate minority
confinement (DMC). These studies were used to prepare the NCCD
report. Without these state statistics, the problem of racial bias
in the treatment of juvenile offenders would have been impossible
to quantify or even define properly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last year, Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Jeff Sessions,
R-Ala., introduced a juvenile crime bill that would have eliminated
the requirement that states keep records on disproportionate
minority confinement.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the Senate, Hatch stated that racism has nothing
to do with the disproportionate arrest rates for minority teens.
Those are the kids who are selling drugs to our children, he said.
``Those'' meaning black or brown kids, ``our'' meaning white kids.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be a surprise that the NCCD report shows that in
Utah one out of 12 black children will be incarcerated by the age
of 18. That's the highest rate of confinement for a minority group
anywhere in this nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch-Session's bill did not pass last year; however, it is
still pending in a Senate-House conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the findings of the NCCD report, the Building Blocks
for Youth coalition asks Congress to strengthen the
disproportionate minority confinement mandate to address the stark
racial and ethnic disparities in confinement. The coalition also
asks that Congress appropriate at least an addition $100 million
for the Department of Justice to address this issue throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The report should be a call to action for anyone of social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is an ugly reality anywhere it is met, but it is
especially monstrous when it parades as a system of justice.

A COMICAL, YET DISTURBING, TAKE ON BRITISH NATIONALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LONDON _ Al Murray was only a few minutes into his routine, but
a trio of middle-aged Americans had heard enough, interrupting the
show as they made a hasty and conspicuous exit from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, sir, you all right?'' Murray asked solicitously from
the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're fine,'' came back the unmistakably American
monotone. ``But we're leaving. There's too much profanity. We
didn't expect this kind of language.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray nodded sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' Murray said. As the Americans got to the door,
Murray waved, saying, ``Ciao, mother (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   To Al Murray, cursing is a form of intercourse. In fact, he uses
the vulgar word for sexual intercourse as a noun, verb, adjective
and, somehow, an adverb in his show, dispensing the outrageous
views of an English pub owner.
</P>
<P>
   His one-man show ``The Pub Landlord'' has been lauded by critics
and audiences alike, and is currently on an extended run in the
West End's Playhouse Theatre. Last year, his show led him to being
named comedian of the year at the Edinburgh Arts Festival, the most
prestigious award for comics in Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Part comedy, part social commentary, Murray's rant is both
hilarious and disturbing. The audience laughs, sometimes
uncomfortably, at his sexist, racist, Neanderthal diatribes. But
behind the practiced ignorance is a savage attack on the xenophobia
and bigotry that parades itself as British nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, sometimes appears
self-righteous when he regularly denounces ``the forces of
conservatism,'' as if anyone with right-leaning sympathies is
immoral and responsible for all of Britain's woes.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray's pub commentary is a far more revealing, and funny,
take on modern Britain. As Archie Bunker once held up a mirror to
American society, the pub landlord's prejudices are actually a
scathing indictment of British intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   As Shay Duffin did in his one-man play on Brendan Behan, the
Irish playwright who drank himself to death at 41, Murray manages
to consume prodigious amounts of beer during his performance. If he
got intoxicated, it only added to the effect. He started to spit
his p's, literally, showering the front row with saliva that made
him appear rabid. Some of his characters' opinions are: Foreigners
are hopelessly inferior to the English, he maintains. The Germans
are passionless automatons, prone to dominating their fellow
Europeans. Murray underscored this point by screaming ``I love
you!'' in German, in a maniacal voice that made it sound more like
``I'm going to kill you!''
</P>
<P>
   The pub landlord's wife left him for a Frenchman, which added an
especially vicious streak to the antipathy that many Englishmen
feel for their neighbors across the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do the French have a Foreign Legion when they're all
foreigners anyway?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the suit jacket and tie he wore on stage, Murray's bald
pate and virulent ignorance made him resemble the archtypical
English soccer hooligan, who, despite stereotypes, is as often
educated and middle-class as a no-hoper from some desolate housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   He was a vision of modern British hell. Check that. English.
Because as Murray said, when people say British, 90 percent of the
time they mean English, because the English make up about 90
percent of Britain's population.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you'd know it living here, he said. The English are
self-loathing wimps, he said. They've let their empire disintegrate
all in the name of being nicey-nicey to foreigners. Why, he asked,
didn't the Brits colonize the moon? And why don't Brits call it
``Great'' Britain anymore? Wimps, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Murray picked on people in the audience, reserving particular
venom for those 20- and 30-somethings making big money in the
Internet industry. The pub landlord is not on line.
</P>
<P>
   While the audience was allowed to have drinks at their seats,
Murray insisted that women refrain from drinking beer. Men drank
pints. Women didn't. The subtitle to his show is ``And A Glass Of
White Wine For The Lady,'' which is what many paternalistic
Englishmen order for their women companions.
</P>
<P>
   When Mary Swanick, a Pennsylvania native living in London with
her husband and three children, dared to sip a beer in the second
row, Murray climbed down from the stage and confiscated it,
chastising her, ``Ladies don't drink beer.'' He compensated her by
pouring a white wine from the makeshift bar on stage, carrying it
to her with his thumb holding the inside of the glass. Swanick
walked to the back of the theater, bought another beer for herself,
then marched back to her seat, defying Murray to try to take it
again. Murray, who had spoken to her earlier, just nodded, almost
approvingly, accepting defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put up with this?'' Murray asked Swanick's husband
incredulously. Mike Swanick, an accountant, shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans,'' Murray said, rolling his eyes, and then he was
off again.

POLITICIANS FACE TEST ON CHINA VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four weeks from now, when the US Congress considers
whether to normalize trade relations with China, Representative
Michael E. Capuano will join the majority of the Massachusetts
delegation in voting no.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vote that doesn't add up. Capuano says so himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 250 high-tech firms employing thousands in
his Bay State district. Yet Capuano will oppose lifting
restrictions on technology exports to China. If the curbs are
lifted, the Massachusetts high-tech industry could add hundreds of
millions of dollars in sales a year because of China's huge,
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   His district is home to Lotus Development Corp., the
3,000-employee Cambridge firm, which is counting on the trade pact
to help it sell software in China without fear that its products
will be illegally copied and pirated. Cambridge is also home to
Polaroid, which covets unlimited access to the vast Chinese
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Capuano is resolute. China's continuing restraints on
individual freedom, its exploitation of prison labor, and other
human rights abuses are too much to ignore. It is, he says, a
``knee-jerk thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably economically better for my district,'' the
Democrat said. ``But I've always believed that America should be
more than just the bottom line. Human rights is important to me.
And I do think it is important America stand for something more
than the almighty buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano has plenty of company in his willingness to go against
the economic interests of his district and vote against the
agreement. Seven of the 12 people in the Massachusetts delegation
are expected to vote no when the matter comes to a roll call in
late May, even though by some estimates there is no state in the
nation better positioned to take advantage of expanded China trade.
The Boston Chamber of Commerce has predicted that a pact could
nearly triple, to $900 million, business with China among
Massachusetts firms.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Bay State delegation call themselves
undecided and are being courted heavily by both sides of the vote,
which is expected to rise or fall by a razor-thin margin in the
House. Among the undecided in the Senate, where the measure is
viewed more favorably, is Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is
expected to vote yes in the end. Only the state's junior senator,
John F. Kerry, has committed himself to the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a one-sided agreement in favor of the United
States,'' Kerry said in an interview, his first official
announcement that he will favor the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and policy analysts overwhelmingly agree. The
measure, known as permanent normalization of trade relations, makes
numerous demands of China, among them lowering harsh tariffs,
eliminating quotas, and adhering to intellectual property laws. All
the United States must deliver is a guarantee: that it will
maintain normal trade relations permanently, instead of requiring
Congress to vote on it every year as it does now. For that, the
Congressional Research Service predicts, the United States could
reap a $11.5 billion economic windfall.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, like Capuano, money is only part of the equation.
Underlying the debate is the complex nature of globalization
itself. And as lawmakers grapple with a trend in which some see
great advantages and others serious negative side-effects, many in
the delegation are finding themselves pulled in the direction of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such caution among business leaders like Stephen L.
Brown, chairman and CEO of John Hancock Financial Services in
Boston, who envisions a sea of potential life insurance clients
across the horizon. Currently, the company has a joint venture in
Shanghai, a city of 13 million; if the pact passes, insurance firms
could branch out almost anywhere in China, competing in an industry
that, in some Chinese cities, is doubling every year.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown also sees the business and job potential back home in
Massachusetts. John Hancock employs 5,000 people in the state, and
contributed $700 million to the local economy in 1998. An insurance
boom in China, with US firms in the vanguard, would create jobs and
greater wealth at home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy lobbying by the insurance industry, however, that
business proposition has left most of the delegation unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that the state have healthy, growing
companies,'' Brown said. ``I guess they don't agree with my
long-range philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican who is firmly
behind President Clinton on this issue, puts it more bluntly. ``In
my view, this is a no-brainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Cellucci's alliance with the White House, against
the majority of the delegation, is lost on no one. Administration
advisers have been calling undecided members for months. When US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Agilent
Technologies in Andover this month, Cellucci half-jokingly promised
to help, saying: ``I'll talk to the Democratic congressmen from
Massachusetts, but they don't always listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The undecided congressmen _ Martin T. Meehan, Edward J. Markey
and Richard E. Neal _ find themselves on the receiving end of a
cacophony of concerns _ to their great political discomfort. Labor
groups have been especially vocal, arguing that free trade with
China will only encourage US firms to move their factories
overseas, at the expense of exploited workers there and lost jobs
here. To make their point, the AFL-CIO staged a rally outside the
Massachusetts office of Markey last week, under the motto: ``No
Blank Check for China!''
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials do not know exactly how many union jobs are in
peril. They make their case using the North American Free Trade
Agreement as an example. Before NAFTA, in 1989, there were 22,500
apparel and clothing manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. Six years
after NAFTA took effect, less than half still exist. Labor's
concern is not that new jobs will be created by expanded trade, but
that established workers in older industries will be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are only about 135 textile mills left in
Massachusetts leads traders to urge that the state should be
focusing on areas of growth, such as technology. ``The textile
industry has been fading away in Massachusetts since the 1920s,''
said Andre Mayer of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, an
employer association representing some 2,500 manufacturing firms.
``What's left are companies that can effectively compete with
anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But some congressmen say it is wrong to ignore the concerns of
even a dwindling manufacturing minority, regardless of the overall
economic prospects for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the state's governor and senators, Representative Barney
Frank answers directly to manufacturing workers in New Bedford and
Fall River, even if there are only 18 textile mills left in his
district. Frank, one of the most ardent students of globalization
in Congress, does not oppose free trade with China on economic
grounds; he agrees it could benefit the nation as a whole. And he
realizes that includes businesses in the northern part of his
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people in the south need me more,'' Frank said. Without
protections for low-wage workers, such as guaranteed health care
coverage, Frank said, he cannot vote for the China trade opening.
``I represent people who lose jobs because of trade. For the
country as a whole, it creates more winners than losers. And the
wealthy people gain more at the expense of working people, and I am
not going to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zandi, an economist at the Regional Financial Association,
explained the delegation's predicament this way: ``Increased trade
with China will be an unambiguous positive for the Massachusetts
economy. . . . The problem is that in any economic change, it's
much easier to identify the losers than the winners. The losers are
much more vocal than the winners. That's why trade policy is so
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several technology firms admitted they have not lobbied
as persuasively as their labor counterparts. In general, the
high-tech community is still finding its political bearings; many
have only recently begun to participate in government affairs. One
official at the Massachusetts Ocean Technology Network, a trade
association representing 17 companies that export to China, said
she had not heard of the trade opening legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the high-tech community has ridden the
boom to great personal advantage, and has not yet taken the
responsibility that goes with that,'' said Chris Gabrieli, chairman
of the New Democrat Network, a centrist political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it built a reservoir of influence with the delegation,
which has thrived for years on a combination of heavy donations
from labor unions and a liberal political climate. In Capuano's
case, voting against the measure seems an obvious choice: Activists
are everywhere in his Cambridge district, and labor unions have
donated more than $73,000 to his campaign this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the issue of human rights. Agreeing to
permanent trade relations would end the annual votes in Congress on
whether to grant China trading rights similar to those of other
nations, a vote often accompanied by a scathing review of China's
human rights transgressions. Activists argue that passing the trade
opening would speed China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, eliminating any US human rights oversight. And
Capuano, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Dartmouth
College, said he is unconvinced by the free trade argument: that
simply trading with China will encourage democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk about how we're going to change China has been
told a thousand times in Chinese history,'' he said. ``It has never
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But China is likely to win entry into the WTO with or without a
deal, trade analysts said. If an agreement with the United States
is not in place, many advocates of the deal worry that other
foreign firms will sweep into the giant Chinese market without the
regard for human rights that many US companies press for.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what worries David Lu, a Chelmsford, Mass. businessman.
A native of China, he says greater economic opportunity _ and
contact with Western businesses _ will help spur democratization in
China.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer who launched a firm to help companies sell technical
equipment over the Internet, Lu sees huge opportunties for his
business in China. But he is equally encouraged by what his
business could do for China. He has already hired two employees in
his office outside Beijing; with lowered trade limitations, he
said, he could hire many more. ``It is not only business, it is
democratic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get exposed to how we work, and how we think. I believe
that is going to help the Chinese democratic process,'' he said.
Then he added: ``If we can lower the barriers on both sides . . .
our business would boom.''

FRIENDS UNDERSTAND DEVOTED FATHER'S SUICIDE

<P>
   SANDWICH, Mass. _ Family friends will tell you that William
Stewart was the most devoted of fathers long before his son David
came down with a rare and deadly form of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, a carpenter, was the dad who created the coolest tree
house, the biggest sandbox, and the giant yellow model propeller
plane so large it scared the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He was the dad who brought home bunnies and chicks and even a
goat for his four children to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Once his son David was sick, he became the dad who dropped his
job to become the boy's constant caretaker and companion, to talk
his son to sleep every night, to run to the store for chips in the
middle of the night if David had a craving.
</P>
<P>
   When David lost his battle with cancer and died in his father's
arms, Stewart became the dad who refused to leave his son's side,
even in death.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the 12-year-old passed away at home on Friday,
Stewart, 43, reportedly hanged himself in a friend's backyard on
Cape Cod, leaving a hastily written note for his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wanted David to be alone,'' said Bob Peredna,
a close family friend. ``This was his way to be with David, and
who's to say that's wrong? Certainly not me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnstable district attorney's office confirmed it is
investigating Stewart's death as a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just got so close to David that they were one,''
said Peredna. ``I think I can understand why this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Peredna, a builder in Hanover, is a longtime neighbor whose son
was a close friend of David's. The Stewart family moved from
Hanover to Sandwich about a year ago, to be near relatives during
David's illness, Peredna said.
</P>
<P>
   Peredna and his family described Stewart as a quiet, reserved
man who did not often share his emotions. However, they said the
father did not seem depressed. Stewart always clung to signs that
David's condition was improving, they said, rarely entertaining the
possibility that experimental treatments would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was divorced, was on his own raising David and his
three siblings: Talia, 8; Rita, 13; and Duncan, 15. The children
are currently with their mother, Linda Stewart, Mary Peredna said.
The mother has been involved in the children's lives and hopes to
be able to take care of them, said Peredna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he felt the rest of the kids would be taken care of _
it's not as if they would be alone,'' Mary Peredna said. ``I
wouldn't say it was the right thing, but it's almost like a more
relaxing feeling knowing the two of them are together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``David was afraid of dying, and you could see where Bill wanted
to be with him,'' Mary Peredna said. ``It's not like you would ever
see it coming, but you would know Bill wouldn't let David go by
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Peredna's son Michael spoke to David by phone just days before
his death, and visited him on Cape Cod about a month ago. When they
spoke last week, David sounded sad, explaining that he could no
longer walk on his own, Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other family members, William Stewart was an
aggressive advocate for his son's medical care. The state Medicaid
program refused to pay $93,000 for an experimental chemotherapy
regimen that doctors said was David's only hope for survival after
conventional treatments, such as radiation and a bone marrow
transplant, failed.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was able to fly to Seattle and receive the chemotherapy,
thanks to a fund-raising drive that garnered $160,000 from
corporate executives to elementary school children pitching in
their lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Robert J. Nyman, a Hanover Democrat, saw
William Stewart testify before a state Medicaid hearing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I witnessed that man fighting for his son, and we could all
see that he was going to do everything he could to make David
better,'' Nyman said Sunday. ``I guess that fight took its toll on
him as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle told the
family that even with an experimental cancer drug, CMA-676, David's
chances for survival were slim.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart refused to focus on the negative as he gave David
his unwavering attention, Bob and Mary Peredna said, sleeping by
the boy's side every night and encouraging him to get up and play
every morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He devoted himself to the point that he was going to cure
David,'' Bob Peredna said. ``He was going to find a way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, just as he was boarding a plane for Seattle, Stewart
said, ``As long as there is a little bit of hope there, I can make
it into all the hope in the world, even if it's just a little bit
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Pending on Beacon Hill is the ``David Stewart bill,'' which
would set aside $2.5 million a year to fund experimental health
care for children with catastrophic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   David Stewart was a boy who laughed readily, and loved to play
outside, build models with his father, and watch the television
show ``The Simpsons,'' said 10-year-old Michael Peredna. In his
last month of life, the boy cried in pain just from standing up,
Michael said. But David still went outside to play whenever he
could, even though it meant layering on four jackets and wearing a
hospital facemask.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral for both father and son was scheduled for Monday
morning at St. John the Evangelist Church in Pocasset.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart suffered a rare form of childhood cancer called acute
myeloid leukemia. Only 40 percent of victims with this type of
cancer survive, while 70 percent of children with a more common
strain of childhood leukemia survive.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he knew the prognosis, William Stewart may not have
been entirely prepared to deal with his son's death, Peredna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're close to someone and you hear that something bad
might happen, you always say this won't happen to them,'' Peredna
said, ``and when the inevitable happens I think your window of
reality is very narrow.''

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ My social isolation is about to become
complete.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer spend much time at the gas station standing in line
behind the lottery players and listening to the guys around the
coffee pot. I pay at the pump, pump my own and am out in two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't go to the post office very often. Almost all my
correspondence is in the form of e-mail and some of my bills are
now automatically deducted from my bank account.
</P>
<P>
   I don't go inside my bank's office anymore. My paycheck is
automatically deposited and I don't believe I've ever seen the
bank's lobby unlocked. For all I know, it never opens. It might
just be there for show. Instead, my financial dealings occur
exclusively through bank machines or on financial auto-pilot.
Tellers are dim childhood memories along with barred teller windows
on marble counter tops.
</P>
<P>
   Government offices? Haven't seen one in years except when I'm
working on a story. I renew my auto tag by mail and get a postcard
</P>
<P>
   from the county that tells me my homestead exemption has been
renewed. I receive tax forms on the Internet and update my address
</P>
<P>
   on Web sites. I sigh over my checkbook and pay manifestly unjust
traffic tickets by mail.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom see movies in theaters. I wait for the tape.
</P>
<P>
   I can even do much of my work on a home computer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm to the point where there's hardly a reason to get dressed
and leave the house in the morning. Except for one thing. The
grocery store. It's the last remaining place where I bump into
people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the grocery store may recede from my life.
</P>
<P>
   Publix Super Markets Inc. last week said it plans to launch a
system for Internet grocery shopping in Florida and Georgia. Not
this minute, but sometime around 2001. (Open the frozen-food door,
Hal.)
</P>
<P>
   You'd click around on the cereal, milk and cat-food icons, click
the plastic or paper bag symbols, hit return, and the bag will be
delivered to your door or waiting for you at a store. This would
shave hours off a week of running errands.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it seems wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   No more falling into a supermarket-aisle trance and forgetting
what you need to buy.
</P>
<P>
   No more cursing people who can't maneuver their supersized SUVs
in supermarket parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   No more frustration because the supermarket systematically moves
every last can on every shelf just to confuse and annoy you.
</P>
<P>
   No more arguing with children who want to buy colorfully
packaged things they will never really eat.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, it would give you the ability to tell kids,
``If you don't let me on the computer right now, nobody will eat
tonight!''
</P>
<P>
   I do not consider shopping to be recreation. This is progress.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. There's always a catch.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery store ranks up there with libraries, churches, $2.99
breakfast places and hardware stores on Saturdays for running into
</P>
<P>
   people at random.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers, neighbors, the schoolmate of the kids who has taken
to wearing three earrings per ear but whom I still remember as the
</P>
<P>
   cute kid in the preschool photographs, the guy who always shouts
``hustle!'' at softball games, the pretty woman who used to live a
few apartments over, folks I only half remember from somewhere,
maybe high school ... the Internet would make them all disappear
from my life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there's the problem of starving to death should my
phone line go dead. After years of shopping on-line, I surely will
have lost
</P>
<P>
   the ability to count change, find out where milk bottles are or
know for sure whether I want plastic bags or paper. (Both have
definite
</P>
<P>
   advantages, you know.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd be thrown into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   But apart from safety considerations, I know I'm just not social
enough to go out and track people down. That's why I value chance
</P>
<P>
   encounters.
</P>
<P>
   But I frequent fewer places these days because it's faster to
get things done on-line or by mail. Don't get around much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Publix's ambitious plans for the Internet haven't been launched
yet, but already I'm feeling my world shrink.

<P>
   Heart surgeon Ralph Damiano's hands move with practiced
precision as he prepares to open the chest of 62-year-old David
Jones for a double-bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano makes a 12-inch incision between Jones' neck and abdomen
with a scalpel, then cuts through Jones' sternum with an electric
saw and cracks the bone apart to expose the diseased heart.
</P>
<P>
   To create a clear field for his surgical maneuvers, he inserts a
drainage tube into the right atrium and diverts the flow of blood
to a heart-lung machine the size of a truck engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we're going all the way,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   He injects a mixture of blood and potassium _ which alters the
flow of electrochemical impulses into the heart, causing it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   On the video screens, multicolored lines measuring
electrocardiograph activity are flat. Jones' burly chest is still.
</P>
<P>
   Time is now of the essence. Damiano deftly sews a piece of
healthy artery harvested from Jones' left arm above and below one
blockage, completing the first bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Then he does something completely out of the ordinary for a
heart surgeon: He unhooks the power to his forehead light; takes
off his magnifying glasses; leaves behind dozens of scalpels,
scissors and clamps; and walks away from his patient.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, he settles into an office chair in front of
a squat black-and-gray computer console positioned five feet from
the operating table and dons an unsterilized headset equipped with
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   So goes an endoscope _ a camera attached to a robotic arm and
inserted in Jones' body before the operation _ scanning to the
left, illuminating for Damiano a brightly lit landscape of pink,
glistening flesh magnified 10 to 12 times on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano then grasps the silvery ends of elbowed computer
joysticks, which allow him to maneuver two additional robotic arms
that hover over the operating table like brooding black cranes.
</P>
<P>
   As Damiano manipulates the joysticks like a master puppeteer, a
pair of surgical graspers and the needle driver he will use to help
sew the second bypass graft loom into view on his monitor. Once
that's done, the procedure is complete.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fantasy; this is real. It is the operating room of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Hershey Medical
Center at Penn State University, is one of a handful of doctors
using computer assistance and robotic tools in an attempt to
revolutionize heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history we're interposing a computer
between the surgeon and the patient,'' says Damiano, 45, a tall man
with thick eyebrows, a mustache, a ready smile and thoroughgoing
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   He believes these robotic tools will set a new standard in
minimally invasive surgery _ and eliminate a good deal of the
terrible physical trauma associated with opening the heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology fulfills its promise, there will be no need to
cut the sternum and no need to stop the heart. Patients may leave
the hospital sooner, wearing three Band-Aids instead of a long line
of heavy metal staples.
</P>
<P>
   For now, because the Food and Drug Administration considers
computer-assisted bypass operations experimental, doctors in the
United States are also required to open the patient's chest and
hook him up to a heart-lung machine so that the surgery can be
completed by hand if something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But last September, Canadian surgeon Douglas Boyd provided a
glimpse of the future of computer-assisted surgery when he inserted
tiny robotic tools through four keyhole-sized ports in a patient's
chest and successfully performed the first closed-chest,
beating-heart bypass operation without the aid of a heart-lung
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Damiano both use a computer-driven robotics system
called Zeus, which was developed and manufactured by Computer
Motion in Santa Barbara, Calif. The computer hardware that drives
Zeus is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires about the same horsepower as a high-performance
home desktop,'' says Computer Motion founder Yulun Wang. And yet
commands travel from the console to each robotic joint at a rate of
up to 400 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Zeus lies in its software _ the 200,000 lines of
computer code that harness the machine's processors to pick up the
hand movements of the surgeon as he handles the computer joysticks.
Instantly, the circuits sense and filter out tremors, the nemesis
of every microsurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system smoothes out my hand motions in much the same way
you can filter an image in digital photography and make it
perfect,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also capable of scaling hand movements down to
whatever size the surgeon chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the digital connection between surgeon and patient
might someday extend well beyond five feet, a possibility that
intrigues the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the U.S. military has spent $3 million to design a
battlefield surgical system stocked with robotic arms and cameras
and housed in an armored vehicle. Surgeons stationed safely behind
front lines would manipulate tools to stitch up the most serious
wounds so soldiers could arrive alive at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers developing remote techniques at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., say it
will be at least 10 years before tests on cadavers and dummies pay
off with ready-for-combat equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge will be to figure out how to transmit the flood of
3D video signals from the field _ about 45 megabits of data per
second, roughly the equivalent of three Zip disks a minute _
especially when generals need bandwidth to communicate during
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a doctor in Chicago using robotic servants to sew
up an astronaut on the moon may be limited by the speed of light,
which lags the movements of the surgeon's hands over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes more than five-thousandths of a second for the
signal to travel to a robot, ``it begins to feel like you're
working in molasses,'' says Joel Jensen, a program manager at SRI
International, a nonprofit institute that has done groundbreaking
work in remote surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen estimates the maximum distance between the surgeon and
the patient should be less than 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano says that, even if these problems can be solved, it's
still doubtful that surgeons will use remote systems over long
distances unless a second surgeon is on the scene, ready to handle
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be relatively unethical,'' he says. ``You need to be
next to your patient. This is an enabling device for surgery that
doesn't replace the surgeon in any way. If a clamp came off an
artery, for example, you'd have only about 10 minutes maximum to
stop the flow'' while trying to find your way onscreen through a
rising pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Much more likely, he says, is using the system to share
expertise by satellite or fiber-optic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the potential of robotic tools is just beginning to be
explored, progress may come quickly. Yulun Wang of Computer Motion
believes this is only the beginning of a profound transformation in
the way surgery is done.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Heart surgeon Ralph Damiano's hands move with practiced
precision as he prepares to open the chest of 62-year-old David
Jones for a double-bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano makes a 12-inch incision between Jones' neck and abdomen
with a scalpel, then cuts through Jones' sternum with an electric
saw and cracks the bone apart to expose the diseased heart.
</P>
<P>
   To create a clear field for his surgical maneuvers, he inserts a
drainage tube into the right atrium and diverts the flow of blood
to a heart-lung machine the size of a truck engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we're going all the way,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   He injects a mixture of blood and potassium _ which alters the
flow of electrochemical impulses into the heart, causing it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   On the video screens, multicolored lines measuring
electrocardiograph activity are flat. Jones' burly chest is still.
</P>
<P>
   Time is now of the essence. Damiano deftly sews a piece of
healthy artery harvested from Jones' left arm above and below one
blockage, completing the first bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Then he does something completely out of the ordinary for a
heart surgeon: He unhooks the power to his forehead light; takes
off his magnifying glasses; leaves behind dozens of scalpels,
scissors and clamps; and walks away from his patient.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, he settles into an office chair in front of
a squat black-and-gray computer console positioned five feet from
the operating table and dons an unsterilized headset equipped with
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   So goes an endoscope _ a camera attached to a robotic arm and
inserted in Jones' body before the operation _ scanning to the
left, illuminating for Damiano a brightly lit landscape of pink,
glistening flesh magnified 10 to 12 times on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano then grasps the silvery ends of elbowed computer
joysticks, which allow him to maneuver two additional robotic arms
that hover over the operating table like brooding black cranes.
</P>
<P>
   As Damiano manipulates the joysticks like a master puppeteer, a
pair of surgical graspers and the needle driver he will use to help
sew the second bypass graft loom into view on his monitor. Once
that's done, the procedure is complete.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fantasy; this is real. It is the operating room of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Hershey Medical
Center at Penn State University, is one of a handful of doctors
using computer assistance and robotic tools in an attempt to
revolutionize heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history we're interposing a computer
between the surgeon and the patient,'' says Damiano, 45, a tall man
with thick eyebrows, a mustache, a ready smile and thoroughgoing
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   He believes these robotic tools will set a new standard in
minimally invasive surgery _ and eliminate a good deal of the
terrible physical trauma associated with opening the heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology fulfills its promise, there will be no need to
cut the sternum and no need to stop the heart. Patients may leave
the hospital sooner, wearing three Band-Aids instead of a long line
of heavy metal staples.
</P>
<P>
   For now, because the Food and Drug Administration considers
computer-assisted bypass operations experimental, doctors in the
United States are also required to open the patient's chest and
hook him up to a heart-lung machine so that the surgery can be
completed by hand if something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But last September, Canadian surgeon Douglas Boyd provided a
glimpse of the future of computer-assisted surgery when he inserted
tiny robotic tools through four keyhole-sized ports in a patient's
chest and successfully performed the first closed-chest,
beating-heart bypass operation without the aid of a heart-lung
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Damiano both use a computer-driven robotics system
called Zeus, which was developed and manufactured by Computer
Motion in Santa Barbara, Calif. The computer hardware that drives
Zeus is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires about the same horsepower as a high-performance
home desktop,'' says Computer Motion founder Yulun Wang. And yet
commands travel from the console to each robotic joint at a rate of
up to 400 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Zeus lies in its software _ the 200,000 lines of
computer code that harness the machine's processors to pick up the
hand movements of the surgeon as he handles the computer joysticks.
Instantly, the circuits sense and filter out tremors, the nemesis
of every microsurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system smoothes out my hand motions in much the same way
you can filter an image in digital photography and make it
perfect,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also capable of scaling hand movements down to
whatever size the surgeon chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the digital connection between surgeon and patient
might someday extend well beyond five feet, a possibility that
intrigues the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the U.S. military has spent $3 million to design a
battlefield surgical system stocked with robotic arms and cameras
and housed in an armored vehicle. Surgeons stationed safely behind
front lines would manipulate tools to stitch up the most serious
wounds so soldiers could arrive alive at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers developing remote techniques at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., say it
will be at least 10 years before tests on cadavers and dummies pay
off with ready-for-combat equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge will be to figure out how to transmit the flood of
3D video signals from the field _ about 45 megabits of data per
second, roughly the equivalent of three Zip disks a minute _
especially when generals need bandwidth to communicate during
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a doctor in Chicago using robotic servants to sew
up an astronaut on the moon may be limited by the speed of light,
which lags the movements of the surgeon's hands over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes more than five-thousandths of a second for the
signal to travel to a robot, ``it begins to feel like you're
working in molasses,'' says Joel Jensen, a program manager at SRI
International, a nonprofit institute that has done groundbreaking
work in remote surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen estimates the maximum distance between the surgeon and
the patient should be less than 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano says that, even if these problems can be solved, it's
still doubtful that surgeons will use remote systems over long
distances unless a second surgeon is on the scene, ready to handle
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be relatively unethical,'' he says. ``You need to be

<P>
   People who combine certain herbal medicines with prescription
drugs may be putting themselves at considerable risk. So says
Adriane Fugh-Berman, a physician at George Washington University
School of Medicine who has been collecting case reports and studies
of hazardous herb-drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Fugh-Berman has learned that Saint-John's-wort, a popular
mood-lifting herbal remedy, may increase the risk of confusion,
nausea and diarrhea _ symptoms of an excess of the neurotransmitter
serotonin in the brain _ when taken with antidepressants such as
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo biloba can trigger bleeding in people taking warfarin, a
drug that reduces the risk of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Yohimbine, an anti-impotence herb, can provoke hypertension when
combined with tricyclic antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicines alone can be trouble as well, Fugh-Berman
warns. Asian herbal medicaments have been found to be contaminated
with lead or arsenic, and some have even been ``doctored'' with
drugs such as steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the use or
sale of herbs. But Fugh-Berman, who proffers herbs in her own
practice, isn't counseling avoidance _ just awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbs with known interactions should have to be labeled, as
should herbs with adverse effects. Right now, that's optional,
which is nuts,'' she says.

 &UR; EARLE OF THE SEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, marine biologist Sylvia Earle spent two weeks
underwater heading the first women's team of aquanauts.
</P>
<P>
   Later she became chief scientist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, founded a company to build undersea
vehicles and worked to preserve the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Today she leads the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a five-year
project to explore the 12 marine sanctuaries along America's
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What first inspired your studies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ocean got my attention when I was 3 years old. I was
knocked over by a wave, and I found it exhilarating rather than
frightening. Once I found my feet and plunged back in, I thought
the water that flowed all around me was the greatest, most powerful
substance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why protect the oceans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  They are the foundation of life on Earth. More than 70
percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by life in the
sea, which also absorbs carbon dioxide. The oceans are in trouble _
and if they are, we are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What are the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We're poisoning the oceans with pesticides and heavy
metals. There are red tides and dead zones, and in the last decade
we've seen a great increase in waterborne diseases, such as cholera
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exterminating wildlife in the sea on an unprecedented
scale. Nearly 100 million tons of fish, mollusks, squid and
crustaceans are extracted from the ocean every year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Do you eat fish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I used to, but I know too much now. Chilean sea bass, for
example, live a long time and reproduce slowly, yet we're simply
mining them. This is also true of swordfish, monkfish and orange
roughy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be as unpopular to eat them as it is to wear a
leopard-skin coat. I think we should farm more, but we should be
careful what we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are caught to feed carnivorous domesticated fish like
salmon, which is like catching wild quail to feed chickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  That humankind will go the way of the dinosaurs in the
not-too-distant future, because we did ourselves in through
complacency and greed.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; OPEN SESAME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting therapeutic drugs into the brain is difficult because of
a firewall of cells that line the capillaries there. But Alessio
Fasano, a gastroenterologist at the University of Maryland, may
have found a way through.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while studying cholera vaccines, Fasano
stumbled across a protein that made victims' intestines dangerously
leaky. He later found similar molecules that unlock tightly sealed
barricades throughout the body, including the one in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on brain tissue have confirmed that some of these
molecules can open the blood-brain barrier, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many brain tumors are highly susceptible to drugs, but we
can't get the drugs across the barrier. Now we have a key,'' he
says.

 &UR; A RAT'S BEST FRIEND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks enough like a rat to fool real rats, but Atsuo
Takanishi's creation is actually a miniature robot.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trial, he and his colleagues at Waseda University in
Japan placed rat and rat-bot together in an enclosure and
programmed the robot to head straight for a dish of food.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rat began chasing its doppelganger as if it were a real
animal and reached the food much faster than it would have on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Takanishi plans to see what happens when rats live with
rat-bots for an extended duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the rats become lazy or selfish if the robots make things
too convenient for them?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to figure out how to avoid such behavioral changes
before humans begin interacting with personal robots.

   Heart surgeon Ralph Damiano's hands move with practiced
precision as he prepares to open the chest of 62-year-old David
Jones for a double-bypass operation.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano makes a 12-inch incision between Jones' neck and abdomen
with a scalpel, then cuts through Jones' sternum with an electric
saw and cracks the bone apart to expose the diseased heart.
</P>
<P>
   To create a clear field for his surgical maneuvers, he inserts a
drainage tube into the right atrium and diverts the flow of blood
to a heart-lung machine the size of a truck engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we're going all the way,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   He injects a mixture of blood and potassium _ which alters the
flow of electrochemical impulses into the heart, causing it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   On the video screens, multicolored lines measuring
electrocardiograph activity are flat. Jones' burly chest is still.
</P>
<P>
   Time is now of the essence. Damiano deftly sews a piece of
healthy artery harvested from Jones' left arm above and below one
blockage, completing the first bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Then he does something completely out of the ordinary for a
heart surgeon: He unhooks the power to his forehead light; takes
off his magnifying glasses; leaves behind dozens of scalpels,
scissors and clamps; and walks away from his patient.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, he settles into an office chair in front of
a squat black-and-gray computer console positioned five feet from
the operating table and dons an unsterilized headset equipped with
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   So goes an endoscope _ a camera attached to a robotic arm and
inserted in Jones' body before the operation _ scanning to the
left, illuminating for Damiano a brightly lit landscape of pink,
glistening flesh magnified 10 to 12 times on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano then grasps the silvery ends of elbowed computer
joysticks, which allow him to maneuver two additional robotic arms
that hover over the operating table like brooding black cranes.
</P>
<P>
   As Damiano manipulates the joysticks like a master puppeteer, a
pair of surgical graspers and the needle driver he will use to help
sew the second bypass graft loom into view on his monitor. Once
that's done, the procedure is complete.
</P>
<P>
   This is no fantasy; this is real. It is the operating room of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Hershey Medical
Center at Penn State University, is one of a handful of doctors
using computer assistance and robotic tools in an attempt to
revolutionize heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history we're interposing a computer
between the surgeon and the patient,'' says Damiano, 45, a tall man
with thick eyebrows, a mustache, a ready smile and thoroughgoing
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   He believes these robotic tools will set a new standard in
minimally invasive surgery _ and eliminate a good deal of the
terrible physical trauma associated with opening the heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the technology fulfills its promise, there will be no need to
cut the sternum and no need to stop the heart. Patients may leave
the hospital sooner, wearing three Band-Aids instead of a long line
of heavy metal staples.
</P>
<P>
   For now, because the Food and Drug Administration considers
computer-assisted bypass operations experimental, doctors in the
United States are also required to open the patient's chest and
hook him up to a heart-lung machine so that the surgery can be
completed by hand if something goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But last September, Canadian surgeon Douglas Boyd provided a
glimpse of the future of computer-assisted surgery when he inserted
tiny robotic tools through four keyhole-sized ports in a patient's
chest and successfully performed the first closed-chest,
beating-heart bypass operation without the aid of a heart-lung
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd and Damiano both use a computer-driven robotics system
called Zeus, which was developed and manufactured by Computer
Motion in Santa Barbara, Calif. The computer hardware that drives
Zeus is modest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires about the same horsepower as a high-performance
home desktop,'' says Computer Motion founder Yulun Wang. And yet
commands travel from the console to each robotic joint at a rate of
up to 400 times per second.
</P>
<P>
   The power of Zeus lies in its software _ the 200,000 lines of
computer code that harness the machine's processors to pick up the
hand movements of the surgeon as he handles the computer joysticks.
Instantly, the circuits sense and filter out tremors, the nemesis
of every microsurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system smoothes out my hand motions in much the same way
you can filter an image in digital photography and make it
perfect,'' Damiano says.
</P>
<P>
   The system is also capable of scaling hand movements down to
whatever size the surgeon chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the digital connection between surgeon and patient
might someday extend well beyond five feet, a possibility that
intrigues the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the U.S. military has spent $3 million to design a
battlefield surgical system stocked with robotic arms and cameras
and housed in an armored vehicle. Surgeons stationed safely behind
front lines would manipulate tools to stitch up the most serious
wounds so soldiers could arrive alive at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers developing remote techniques at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., say it
will be at least 10 years before tests on cadavers and dummies pay
off with ready-for-combat equipment.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge will be to figure out how to transmit the flood of
3D video signals from the field _ about 45 megabits of data per
second, roughly the equivalent of three Zip disks a minute _
especially when generals need bandwidth to communicate during
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a doctor in Chicago using robotic servants to sew
up an astronaut on the moon may be limited by the speed of light,
which lags the movements of the surgeon's hands over long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   If it takes more than five-thousandths of a second for the
signal to travel to a robot, ``it begins to feel like you're
working in molasses,'' says Joel Jensen, a program manager at SRI
International, a nonprofit institute that has done groundbreaking
work in remote surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen estimates the maximum distance between the surgeon and
the patient should be less than 3,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Damiano says that, even if these problems can be solved, it's
still doubtful that surgeons will use remote systems over long
distances unless a second surgeon is on the scene, ready to handle
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be relatively unethical,'' he says. ``You need to be
next to your patient. This is an enabling device for surgery that
doesn't replace the surgeon in any way. If a clamp came off an
artery, for example, you'd have only about 10 minutes maximum to
stop the flow'' while trying to find your way onscreen through a
rising pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Much more likely, he says, is using the system to share
expertise by satellite or fiber-optic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the potential of robotic tools is just beginning to be
explored, progress may come quickly. Yulun Wang of Computer Motion
believes this is only the beginning of a profound transformation in
the way surgery is done.

   Heart surgeon Ralph Damiano's hands move with practiced
precision as he prepares to open the chest of 62-year-old David
Jones for a double-bypass operation.

   People who combine certain herbal medicines with prescription
drugs may be putting themselves at considerable risk. So says
Adriane Fugh-Berman, a physician at George Washington University
School of Medicine who has been collecting case reports and studies
of hazardous herb-drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Fugh-Berman has learned that Saint-John's-wort, a popular
mood-lifting herbal remedy, may increase the risk of confusion,
nausea and diarrhea _ symptoms of an excess of the neurotransmitter
serotonin in the brain _ when taken with antidepressants such as
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo biloba can trigger bleeding in people taking warfarin, a
drug that reduces the risk of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   Yohimbine, an anti-impotence herb, can provoke hypertension when
combined with tricyclic antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Herbal medicines alone can be trouble as well, Fugh-Berman
warns. Asian herbal medicaments have been found to be contaminated
with lead or arsenic, and some have even been ``doctored'' with
drugs such as steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the use or
sale of herbs. But Fugh-Berman, who proffers herbs in her own
practice, isn't counseling avoidance _ just awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbs with known interactions should have to be labeled, as
should herbs with adverse effects. Right now, that's optional,
which is nuts,'' she says.

 &UR; EARLE OF THE SEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July 1970, marine biologist Sylvia Earle spent two weeks
underwater heading the first women's team of aquanauts.
</P>
<P>
   Later she became chief scientist at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, founded a company to build undersea
vehicles and worked to preserve the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Today she leads the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a five-year
project to explore the 12 marine sanctuaries along America's
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What first inspired your studies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ocean got my attention when I was 3 years old. I was
knocked over by a wave, and I found it exhilarating rather than
frightening. Once I found my feet and plunged back in, I thought
the water that flowed all around me was the greatest, most powerful
substance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why protect the oceans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  They are the foundation of life on Earth. More than 70
percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by life in the
sea, which also absorbs carbon dioxide. The oceans are in trouble _
and if they are, we are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What are the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We're poisoning the oceans with pesticides and heavy
metals. There are red tides and dead zones, and in the last decade
we've seen a great increase in waterborne diseases, such as cholera
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exterminating wildlife in the sea on an unprecedented
scale. Nearly 100 million tons of fish, mollusks, squid and
crustaceans are extracted from the ocean every year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Do you eat fish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I used to, but I know too much now. Chilean sea bass, for
example, live a long time and reproduce slowly, yet we're simply
mining them. This is also true of swordfish, monkfish and orange
roughy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be as unpopular to eat them as it is to wear a
leopard-skin coat. I think we should farm more, but we should be
careful what we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are caught to feed carnivorous domesticated fish like
salmon, which is like catching wild quail to feed chickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  That humankind will go the way of the dinosaurs in the
not-too-distant future, because we did ourselves in through
complacency and greed.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; OPEN SESAME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting therapeutic drugs into the brain is difficult because of
a firewall of cells that line the capillaries there. But Alessio
Fasano, a gastroenterologist at the University of Maryland, may
have found a way through.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while studying cholera vaccines, Fasano
stumbled across a protein that made victims' intestines dangerously
leaky. He later found similar molecules that unlock tightly sealed
barricades throughout the body, including the one in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on brain tissue have confirmed that some of these
molecules can open the blood-brain barrier, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many brain tumors are highly susceptible to drugs, but we
can't get the drugs across the barrier. Now we have a key,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; A RAT'S BEST FRIEND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks enough like a rat to fool real rats, but Atsuo
Takanishi's creation is actually a miniature robot.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trial, he and his colleagues at Waseda University in
Japan placed rat and rat-bot together in an enclosure and
programmed the robot to head straight for a dish of food.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rat began chasing its doppelganger as if it were a real
animal and reached the food much faster than it would have on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Takanishi plans to see what happens when rats live with
rat-bots for an extended duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the rats become lazy or selfish if the robots make things
too convenient for them?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to figure out how to avoid such behavioral changes
before humans begin interacting with personal robots.

   &UR; Q: &LR;  What first inspired your studies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The ocean got my attention when I was 3 years old. I was
knocked over by a wave, and I found it exhilarating rather than
frightening. Once I found my feet and plunged back in, I thought
the water that flowed all around me was the greatest, most powerful
substance in the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Why protect the oceans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  They are the foundation of life on Earth. More than 70
percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by life in the
sea, which also absorbs carbon dioxide. The oceans are in trouble _
and if they are, we are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What are the problems?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  We're poisoning the oceans with pesticides and heavy
metals. There are red tides and dead zones, and in the last decade
we've seen a great increase in waterborne diseases, such as cholera
outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   We're also exterminating wildlife in the sea on an unprecedented
scale. Nearly 100 million tons of fish, mollusks, squid and
crustaceans are extracted from the ocean every year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  Do you eat fish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  I used to, but I know too much now. Chilean sea bass, for
example, live a long time and reproduce slowly, yet we're simply
mining them. This is also true of swordfish, monkfish and orange
roughy.
</P>
<P>
   It should be as unpopular to eat them as it is to wear a
leopard-skin coat. I think we should farm more, but we should be
careful what we grow.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are caught to feed carnivorous domesticated fish like
salmon, which is like catching wild quail to feed chickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;  What is your greatest fear?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  That humankind will go the way of the dinosaurs in the
not-too-distant future, because we did ourselves in through
complacency and greed.
</P>

 &UR; OPEN SESAME &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting therapeutic drugs into the brain is difficult because of
a firewall of cells that line the capillaries there. But Alessio
Fasano, a gastroenterologist at the University of Maryland, may
have found a way through.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while studying cholera vaccines, Fasano
stumbled across a protein that made victims' intestines dangerously
leaky. He later found similar molecules that unlock tightly sealed
barricades throughout the body, including the one in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on brain tissue have confirmed that some of these
molecules can open the blood-brain barrier, at least briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many brain tumors are highly susceptible to drugs, but we
can't get the drugs across the barrier. Now we have a key,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; A RAT'S BEST FRIEND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks enough like a rat to fool real rats, but Atsuo
Takanishi's creation is actually a miniature robot.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent trial, he and his colleagues at Waseda University in
Japan placed rat and rat-bot together in an enclosure and
programmed the robot to head straight for a dish of food.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the rat began chasing its doppelganger as if it were a real
animal and reached the food much faster than it would have on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Takanishi plans to see what happens when rats live with
rat-bots for an extended duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the rats become lazy or selfish if the robots make things
too convenient for them?'' he wonders.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to figure out how to avoid such behavioral changes
before humans begin interacting with personal robots.

<P>
   The first question Kuki Gallmann asks when she learns I have
seen ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' the Kim Basinger movie based on
Gallmann's best-selling memoir, is, ``Do you think people will want
to come to Africa?''
</P>
<P>
   For Gallmann, Italian by birth, Kenyan by choice, it is really
the only question.
</P>
<P>
   When she sat down to write ``I Dreamed of Africa,'' she had no
intention of seeing her story turned into a big-budget Hollywood
movie. She didn't even plan to have it published. She says she
simply needed to ``exorcise my ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the United States go a lot to psychoanalysts, and
they talk,'' Gallmann says over lunch in an Italian cafe near her
London flat. ``I also talk _ all Italians talk _ but in general,
the empty page is my psychoanalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   She filled the pages of the book with lyrical memories of
recovering from a devastating car accident in Venice _ doctors had
held out little hope she'd walk again _ and beginning life anew in
Kenya with her young son, Emanuele, and second husband, Paolo, in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the Laikipia region, they bought the Ol Ari Nyiro
ranch and struggled to make it viable. But the deeper she fell in
love with Africa, the more it seemed to extract from her as
payment.
</P>
<P>
   First, Paolo was killed in a car accident driving back from
Mombasa with a cradle for their unborn daughter. Three years later,
Emanuele, a passionate collector and scholar of snakes, was bitten
by one of his puff adders and died in Gallmann's arms. He was only
17, due to leave shortly for college in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her second loss, Gallmann gave no thought to
returning to the comforts of Italy. She raised her daughter, Sveva,
on the ranch and started a foundation in memory of Paolo and
Emanuele.
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann agreed to publish the memoir only after a friend
convinced her it could help other parents whose children had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only mother who has lost a son,'' she says.
``Children die all the time everywhere. But I wanted to transform
something negative, something immensely sad, because Emanuele was a
very intelligent, gifted, extraordinary human being. I wanted to
make sure his passing was not in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she resisted offers to sell the film rights. Gallmann
dreaded seeing the tragedies of her life played out on screen _ and
since she typically sees movies only on airplanes, she also had
doubts about the medium itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said no to everybody because there is a different dignity
about something written that you read alone,'' she says, ``as
opposed to something on the big screen that you share with people
chewing gum and eating peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But then friends introduced her to Stanley Jaffe, the producer
of ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Fatal Attraction.'' Jaffe had read
her book after a year of prodding from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like it was going to be _ not in a pejorative or
sexist sense _ more for a woman,'' Jaffe recalls. ``But I got to
the last eulogy, and I was awash in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann decided to let Jaffe make the movie, with Hugh Hudson
(``Chariots of Fire'') directing, but not without trepidation. When
we first meet, in the fall of 1998, filming is under way, and
Gallmann is clearly uneasy. Most of the movie is being shot in
South Africa, the terrain of which, she frets, ``is as different
from Laikipia as Sweden is from Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   She regrets not trying to write the screenplay herself and
worries about the star, Kim Basinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put it this way: If I'd been given the task of interpreting
you in a movie, I would have come and met you,'' Gallmann says. ``I
would have made it my business.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year later, however, she is somewhat
relieved after attending a private screening with her daughter,
saying Basinger ``did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, though, was still difficult to watch, particularly
the first scene in which the teen-aged Emanuele appears, because
the actor bears such a striking resemblance to her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' she recalls. ``We cried for two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Larry Ashmead, executive editor and vice president of
HarperCollins, says, Gallmann is not a ``weeping widow.'' For one
thing, she has too much work to do. HarperCollins is publishing her
latest book, ``African Nights,'' a collection of autobiographical
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gallmann is also busy planning Sveva's wedding for Laikipia in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Much of her time, though, is spent on the Gallmann Memorial
Foundation, which supports education and wildlife conservation.
Every year, more than 1,000 schoolchildren visit Ol Ari Nyiro,
which is teeming with elephant, buffalo and the largest population
of black rhino on private land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Africans have never seen a wild elephant,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, each child receives an indigenous tree to plant at
home. Many of those trees have grown from seeds collected from the
acacia trees Gallmann planted on the graves of her husband and son.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's often likened to a modern-day Isak Dinesen,
Gallmann says the biggest difference between her and the author of
``Out of Africa'' is that she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never leave Africa,'' she says. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Flowers have long been admired in paintings and verse for their
physical beauty, but they also work their art on the olfactory
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, they've been rediscovered on the beauty scene. Dedicated
sybarites and wishful escapists looking to unwind after a hard day
at the office swear by the scent of blossoms and the curative
effects of petals. Stated simply: Blooms are primo when it comes to
pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Immerse yourself in flowers or their essence and you will truly
be transported. Spa treatments that use flowers to envelop the
senses _ if not literally, then figuratively _ abound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aqua Spa in Santa Monica, Calif., the aromatherapy
manicure and pedicure start off with a blissful soak in lavender,
rose or geranium oil.
</P>
<P>
   The ``aromatic facial'' at Spa Internazionale at Fisher Island
in Florida features custom-blended oils from plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's cozy and quiet Carapan Urban Spa, many of the
treatments use the spa's new body collection called Plateau, which
contains luxurious oils of lavender, patchouli and bergamot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Plateau Body Massage, for example, Carapan's clients get
to experience the Plateau Body &AMP; Massage Oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Aida Thibiant European Day Spa in Beverly Hills, one of the
most requested body treatments is a stress-melting soak in a 47-jet
hydrotherapy tub with Tahitian Milk Bath, a sumptuous product with
Monoi de Tahiti, a medley of petals from the rare tiare flower
soaked in oils.
</P>
<P>
   Tahitian Milk Bath is also sold at the spa for at-home revelry,
as are several newer products with Monoi de Tahiti, including a
sensuous dry oil spray and exfoliating and moisturizing body scrub.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was ever any doubt that flowers are among the most
luxurious treats in the world, consider that Christian Dior's new
skin-care line, Dior Prestige, features the nectar, or the sap, of
100 kniphofia buds, a flower that blooms on the island of
Madagascar only during June and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will transport you to another place,'' says Robert
Isabell, the florist and party planner who launched Perfumes
Isabell, a collection of body products and candles based solely on
flowers. ``They calm and bring great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mastermind behind such lavish bashes as the recent
Costume Institute party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
society weddings including those of Caroline Kennedy and Aerin
Lauder, the subject of flowers is very dear to his heart. Isabell
counts water lilies, tuberose and jasmine among his favorites
because of their intoxicatingly powerful scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers simply capture all the senses,'' he says. ``I know a
woman who always has fresh ones by her bedside. She treats them
like friends.''
</P>
<P>
   While the physical beauty of flowers has never been in question,
the therapeutic benefits are also impressive _ and well documented
throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, the Romans would spritz dinner guests between
courses with rose water from tiny pipes installed under the table.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the 19th century, rose was the prominent ingredient in
remedies that treated everything from depression to infertility.
</P>
<P>
   In Renaissance Italy, rose water was used for rinsing the hands
and some even drank alcohol-based perfumes as breath fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were also commonly used for beauty purposes _ crushed
rose petals are a centuries-old secret for rosy, glowing skin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology has taken over most of these tasks, but this
does not mean that flowers should be relegated to the garden. Far
from it. Flowers contribute plenty to the pampering process and
spas and beauty firms are always looking for new ways to exploit
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Close, owner of the Naturopathica Spa and Holistic
Health Center in East Hampton, N.Y., has built both her day spa and
product line on the premise that botanicals, including flowers, are
a vital ingredient in the quest for beauty and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   One of the line's cult products, a rose-water facial spritz
called Rose Hydrolat, is ideal for sensitive, irritated skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' declares Scarlett Messina, owner of the
Scarlett Beauty Emporium in New Hope, Penn., which also sells
Close's Orange Blossom Hydrolat and Lavender Hydrolat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is perfect for calming sensitive skin,'' Close says. ``I
recommend it for people with ruddy complexions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her spa is a veritable haven for those seeking natural beauty.
There's even a computer system that explains the benefits of
various floral ingredients and a custom blending bar that allows
customers to spike their favorite shampoo or body lotion with a
specific essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   These oils can be pretty pricy, Close says, but they're worth it
when you consider that approximately 2,000 pounds of rose petals
are needed to make just one pound of essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   If rose appears to be one of the most popular flowers among
beauty aficionados, it's no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rose is known in the flower kingdom as the queen,'' says
perfumer Sarah Horowitz, whose company, Creative Scentualization,
creates custom fragrances. ``Rose is used in aromatherapy for many
things, including skin replenishing. It's also used as an
aphrodisiac and to open the heart chakra promoting love.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetually beautiful rose is at the center of other
skin-care products and spa treatments. The popular French treatment
line Guinot has added musk rose oil, which balances the complexion
and works as an anti-inflammatory, to its new Refreshing Cleansing
Milk and Refreshing Toning Lotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Guinot, our philosophy is to coax the skin back to a state
of homeostasis, to an ideal state of health,'' says Remy DeVere,
director of education for Guinot.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Bulgarian rose is the main ingredient in the
ultra-expensive Joy fragrance from Patou. It also features
prominently in new night creams created by Thibiant.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett's Messina considers the rose soap from the Two Girls
Brand to be the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scents the whole room and creates an experience,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Equinox Spa in Manhattan, a new treatment
called the Yogi Scrub combines rose water and rose oil with yogurt
for maximum exfoliation and softening.
</P>
<P>
   Equinox also uses the Floral Mask from a professional French spa
line called Phalgo that is a mix of white clay, rose and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers may also be beneficial when ingested. Roses are said to
be higher in vitamin C than citrus fruits.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people in countries like Pakistan and India have
been drinking flowered teas. (A modern example is the trendy chai
tea that is sold alongside cafe latte at Starbucks. Its main
ingredient: rose.)
</P>
<P>
   Yael Alkalay and Victor Silveira, the founders of a line of
candles and teas called Red Flower, consider flowers a ``life force
that you can smell and breathe,'' adding, ``flowers encourage the
enjoyment of simple experiences in a beautiful way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their teas features roses from Spain, bilberries and
hibiscus. The other is a lavender tea with rosemary, spearmint and
peppermint. Both varieties are pretty enough to display.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile, another flower that reigns supreme for its
anti-allergenic properties, is better known as a soothing tea. But
it, too, is being discovered by aestheticians and beauty companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian skin-care line Jurlique is ripe with chamomile,
as is Nectar of the Gods, an Italian collection of hair care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Essentiel Elements, the line of natural spa products, has
created three separate skin-care collections around chamomile,
lavender and geranium.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile was chosen for its calming effect on inflamed and
irritated skin, lavender for its ability to detoxify and geranium
for its super-hydration abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The star product of the Essentiel Elements skin-care collection
is Intensive, pure essential oil of either chamomile, lavender or
geranium, blended with almond oil. Several drops massaged lightly
on pressure points, namely the temple, behind the ear lobes and on
the bridge of your nose, can do wonders for a weary soul.
</P>
<P>
   Eradicating stress and its irritating symptoms is yet another
benefit of the essential oils of flowers. Lavender and chamomile
are probably the most recognized in this area, but many others are
beneficial as well.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive but potent jasmine has a calming and uplifting effect
on the nervous system, while neroli, or orange blossom oil, helps
with many kinds of stress, including insomnia and panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For even more severe cases of malaise, those in the medical
profession have prescribed bergamot essential oil for help with
drug withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a treatment at Manhattan's Paul Labrecque Salon &AMP;
Spa called the ``antidepressant facial.'' Administered with the
Gisele Delorme skin-care line, the active ingredient is petitgrain
oil, a woodier version of neroli that is known to reduce tension
headaches and treat less serious depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   It makes perfect sense that flowers would give the skin a boost.
Beautiful blooms, so naturally intoxicating, have been lifting the
psyche since Eve discovered them in the Garden of Eden. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Flowers have long been admired in paintings and verse for their
physical beauty, but they also work their art on the olfactory
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, they've been rediscovered on the beauty scene. Dedicated
sybarites and wishful escapists looking to unwind after a hard day
at the office swear by the scent of blossoms and the curative
effects of petals. Stated simply: Blooms are primo when it comes to
pampering.
</P>
<P>
   Immerse yourself in flowers or their essence and you will truly
be transported. Spa treatments that use flowers to envelop the
senses _ if not literally, then figuratively _ abound.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aqua Spa in Santa Monica, Calif., the aromatherapy
manicure and pedicure start off with a blissful soak in lavender,
rose or geranium oil.
</P>
<P>
   The ``aromatic facial'' at Spa Internazionale at Fisher Island
in Florida features custom-blended oils from plants and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's cozy and quiet Carapan Urban Spa, many of the
treatments use the spa's new body collection called Plateau, which
contains luxurious oils of lavender, patchouli and bergamot.
</P>
<P>
   For the Plateau Body Massage, for example, Carapan's clients get
to experience the Plateau Body &AMP; Massage Oil.
</P>
<P>
   At Aida Thibiant European Day Spa in Beverly Hills, one of the
most requested body treatments is a stress-melting soak in a 47-jet
hydrotherapy tub with Tahitian Milk Bath, a sumptuous product with
Monoi de Tahiti, a medley of petals from the rare tiare flower
soaked in oils.
</P>
<P>
   Tahitian Milk Bath is also sold at the spa for at-home revelry,
as are several newer products with Monoi de Tahiti, including a
sensuous dry oil spray and exfoliating and moisturizing body scrub.
</P>
<P>
   And if there was ever any doubt that flowers are among the most
luxurious treats in the world, consider that Christian Dior's new
skin-care line, Dior Prestige, features the nectar, or the sap, of
100 kniphofia buds, a flower that blooms on the island of
Madagascar only during June and July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers will transport you to another place,'' says Robert
Isabell, the florist and party planner who launched Perfumes
Isabell, a collection of body products and candles based solely on
flowers. ``They calm and bring great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   As the mastermind behind such lavish bashes as the recent
Costume Institute party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and
society weddings including those of Caroline Kennedy and Aerin
Lauder, the subject of flowers is very dear to his heart. Isabell
counts water lilies, tuberose and jasmine among his favorites
because of their intoxicatingly powerful scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers simply capture all the senses,'' he says. ``I know a
woman who always has fresh ones by her bedside. She treats them
like friends.''
</P>
<P>
   While the physical beauty of flowers has never been in question,
the therapeutic benefits are also impressive _ and well documented
throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient times, the Romans would spritz dinner guests between
courses with rose water from tiny pipes installed under the table.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the 19th century, rose was the prominent ingredient in
remedies that treated everything from depression to infertility.
</P>
<P>
   In Renaissance Italy, rose water was used for rinsing the hands
and some even drank alcohol-based perfumes as breath fresheners.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers were also commonly used for beauty purposes _ crushed
rose petals are a centuries-old secret for rosy, glowing skin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, technology has taken over most of these tasks, but this
does not mean that flowers should be relegated to the garden. Far
from it. Flowers contribute plenty to the pampering process and
spas and beauty firms are always looking for new ways to exploit
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Close, owner of the Naturopathica Spa and Holistic
Health Center in East Hampton, N.Y., has built both her day spa and
product line on the premise that botanicals, including flowers, are
a vital ingredient in the quest for beauty and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   One of the line's cult products, a rose-water facial spritz
called Rose Hydrolat, is ideal for sensitive, irritated skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous,'' declares Scarlett Messina, owner of the
Scarlett Beauty Emporium in New Hope, Penn., which also sells
Close's Orange Blossom Hydrolat and Lavender Hydrolat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose is perfect for calming sensitive skin,'' Close says. ``I
recommend it for people with ruddy complexions.''
</P>
<P>
   Her spa is a veritable haven for those seeking natural beauty.
There's even a computer system that explains the benefits of
various floral ingredients and a custom blending bar that allows
customers to spike their favorite shampoo or body lotion with a
specific essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   These oils can be pretty pricy, Close says, but they're worth it
when you consider that approximately 2,000 pounds of rose petals
are needed to make just one pound of essential oil.
</P>
<P>
   If rose appears to be one of the most popular flowers among
beauty aficionados, it's no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rose is known in the flower kingdom as the queen,'' says
perfumer Sarah Horowitz, whose company, Creative Scentualization,
creates custom fragrances. ``Rose is used in aromatherapy for many
things, including skin replenishing. It's also used as an
aphrodisiac and to open the heart chakra promoting love.''
</P>
<P>
   The perpetually beautiful rose is at the center of other
skin-care products and spa treatments. The popular French treatment
line Guinot has added musk rose oil, which balances the complexion
and works as an anti-inflammatory, to its new Refreshing Cleansing
Milk and Refreshing Toning Lotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Guinot, our philosophy is to coax the skin back to a state
of homeostasis, to an ideal state of health,'' says Remy DeVere,
director of education for Guinot.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Bulgarian rose is the main ingredient in the
ultra-expensive Joy fragrance from Patou. It also features
prominently in new night creams created by Thibiant.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett's Messina considers the rose soap from the Two Girls
Brand to be the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scents the whole room and creates an experience,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Equinox Spa in Manhattan, a new treatment
called the Yogi Scrub combines rose water and rose oil with yogurt
for maximum exfoliation and softening.
</P>
<P>
   Equinox also uses the Floral Mask from a professional French spa
line called Phalgo that is a mix of white clay, rose and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers may also be beneficial when ingested. Roses are said to
be higher in vitamin C than citrus fruits.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, people in countries like Pakistan and India have
been drinking flowered teas. (A modern example is the trendy chai
tea that is sold alongside cafe latte at Starbucks. Its main
ingredient: rose.)
</P>
<P>
   Yael Alkalay and Victor Silveira, the founders of a line of
candles and teas called Red Flower, consider flowers a ``life force
that you can smell and breathe,'' adding, ``flowers encourage the
enjoyment of simple experiences in a beautiful way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of their teas features roses from Spain, bilberries and
hibiscus. The other is a lavender tea with rosemary, spearmint and
peppermint. Both varieties are pretty enough to display.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile, another flower that reigns supreme for its
anti-allergenic properties, is better known as a soothing tea. But
it, too, is being discovered by aestheticians and beauty companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian skin-care line Jurlique is ripe with chamomile,
as is Nectar of the Gods, an Italian collection of hair care
products.
</P>
<P>
   Essentiel Elements, the line of natural spa products, has
created three separate skin-care collections around chamomile,
lavender and geranium.
</P>
<P>
   Chamomile was chosen for its calming effect on inflamed and
irritated skin, lavender for its ability to detoxify and geranium
for its super-hydration abilities.
</P>
<P>
   The star product of the Essentiel Elements skin-care collection
is Intensive, pure essential oil of either chamomile, lavender or
geranium, blended with almond oil. Several drops massaged lightly
on pressure points, namely the temple, behind the ear lobes and on
the bridge of your nose, can do wonders for a weary soul.
</P>
<P>
   Eradicating stress and its irritating symptoms is yet another
benefit of the essential oils of flowers. Lavender and chamomile
are probably the most recognized in this area, but many others are
beneficial as well.
</P>
<P>
   Expensive but potent jasmine has a calming and uplifting effect
on the nervous system, while neroli, or orange blossom oil, helps
with many kinds of stress, including insomnia and panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   For even more severe cases of malaise, those in the medical
profession have prescribed bergamot essential oil for help with
drug withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a treatment at Manhattan's Paul Labrecque Salon &AMP;

Gisele Delorme skin-care line, the active ingredient is petitgrain

SHOPPING AROUND: RENTING A EUROPEAN HOUSE

``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Anyone who has enjoyed Frances Mayes' best-selling book, ``Under
the Tuscan Sun'' (Broadway, 1997; $14) has probably fantasized
about living in a European house or apartment. The good news is
that it's easy enough to live like an expatriate, for a week, a
month or longer, thanks to a large network of European rentals.
 &HT;    Whether the fantasy is a villa set in the hills of Tuscany, a
small cottage in Provence in the south of France or a Swiss chalet
overlooking Lake Geneva, European house rentals are surprisingly
affordable and easy to organize.
 &HT;    Romance, location and atmosphere loom large as prime reasons to
consider a rental. Travelers can awaken to their own clock, not a
hotel's.
 &HT;    Markets and shops, particularly in countries like France and
Italy, become more than mere scenery. Shopping with locals is a way
to experience a country in a manner that the average tourist never
really does.
 &HT;    A European rental is not about rushing around to cathedrals,
restaurants and museums. It's a surefire way to slow down and smell
the espresso.
 &HT;    Space, that final frontier of travel, is also a reason to rent.
Even the smallest studio apartment in Paris has more room than most
four-star hotel rooms in a city known for its tiny spaces. In
Scotland or Ireland, a rural cottage bestows a living room, a
dining room and bedrooms, as well as a garden.
 &HT;    Saving money is also one of the greatest benefits of renting.
The rule of thumb for rentals is that the savings can amount to 30
percent or more off the cost of a comparable hotel room.
 &HT;    For example, Paris Sejours Reservations has studio apartments in
the Marais district of Paris from 350 to 900 French Francs per
night, about $51 to $130 per night, or about what one would pay for
a one- or two-star hotel.
 &HT;    For a longer stay, a one-bedroom apartment can offer the kind of
space and luxury that one couldn't touch in a hotel at twice the
price. Since every rental comes with a kitchen or kitchenette,
dining out is an option, not a requirement.
 &HT;    Rentals are especially ideal for families or couples traveling
together. With four or even six people, the savings are even
greater.
 &HT;    The Parker Company has properties like Il Colombaiolo, in
Montepulciano, Tuscany. This luxurious three-bedroom house sleeps
six and is priced from $1,800 to $2,070 per week, which costs out
from $257 to $296 per night. Split among three couples, it's a
modest amount.
 &HT;    Group rentals also permit travelers to extend their buying
power, not merely save money. Those fabled villas with pools,
tennis courts and vast gardens become a reasonable buy, not a mere
romantic indulgence.
 &HT;    To find a rental, contact an agency by phone or visit their Web
site. When choosing a property, note that location is crucial. For
a city apartment, a quiet residential neighborhood can be a bonus,
especially for the noise-conscious, who may not want a rental on a
main city street. In rural areas, rental cars are essential, and
have to be factored into the overall cost.
 &HT;    Every good rental agent should provide a checklist of amenities
that are included with the rental, from linens to access to a
washer and dryer.
 &HT;    It's important to know how frequently the unit will be cleaned
and whether a deposit is required for the telephone. It's also
essential to have a nearby contact in case a pipe bursts or the
stove won't work, preferably someone who speaks some English.
 &HT;    Note that the minimum rental period is usually one week and that
prime properties in Italy and France should be booked months in
advance of high season.
 &HT;    Shoulder season is usually 20 to 30 percent less, and low season
can offer great value. But don't forget to factor in the weather.
November brings the chilly Mistral wind to Provence, while rural
England is not as delightful when it's cold and rainy.
 &HT;    Here are some major rentals companies.
 &HT;     At Home in France  (P.O. Box 643, Ashland, Ore., 97520;
541-488-9467; www.athomeinfrance.com/ahif.htm) focuses exclusively
on France.
 &HT;     The French Experience  (370 Lexington Ave., Suite 812, New
York, N.Y. 10017; 212-986-3800; www.frenchexperience.com) has
hundreds of ``gites,'' rural French vacation homes, as well as
Paris apartments.
 &HT;     Homes Away  (34 Park Road, Toronto M4W 2N4, Ontario, Canada;
800-374-6637; www.homesaway.com) offers a handful of carefully
chosen properties in Italy and France.
 &HT;     Italian Villas  (8 Knight St., Suite 205, Norwalk, Conn. 06851;
800-700-9549; www.italianvillas.com) specializes in Italy.
 &HT;     The Landmark Trust  (707 Kipling Road, Dummerston, Vt. 05301;
802-254-6868) offers rentals in restored historic residences
throughout Britain.
 &HT;     Paris Sejours Reservations  (875 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 3214,
Chicago, Ill. 60611; 800-582-7274; www.psryourhomeinParis.com) is a
specialist in Paris apartments.
 &HT;     The Parker Company  (Seaport Landing, 152 Lynnway, Lynn, Mass.
01902; 800-280-2811; www.parkercompany.com) is devoted exclusively
to Italy.
 &HT;     Vacation Rentals by Owner  (PMB308, 4255 South Buckley Road,
Aurora, Colo. 80013; http://vrbo.com/) is an Internet rental site
that brings independent homeowners together from around the world.
They have extensive European listings, from Swiss apartments to
Italian villas.
 &HT;     WIMCO  (P.O. Box 1461, Newport, R.I. 02840; 800-932-3222;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monument Valley has been used as a backdrop for so many movies,
car commercials and magazine advertisements that its rock
cathedrals, craggy spires and wind-sculptured buttes are
immediately recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the credit goes to the director John Ford, who filmed
the 1939 western classic ``Stagecoach'' there and returned to make
seven more westerns.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, I watched so many of those old movies that Monument
Valley came to symbolize the West for me. The valley's stark
landscape, with its looming red-rock monoliths, some of which rise
1,000 feet from the desert floor, haunted me for years. They looked
like giant pawns scattered on an ancient god's chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   I had to see the place, which I did for the first time in the
mid-1980s. And then I had to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, I had viewed Monument Valley from a distance.
My vacations in the Four Corners have tended to be jampacked:
Durango, Colo., one day, then Mesa Verde National Park, then Canyon
de Chelly. There's so much to see and do in the area that my
husband, Dan Malone, and I would make a quick run in our car to
Monument Valley's edge, take some photographs of the famous
outlines of spires and buttes and head on to other destinations in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Those small tastes, though, left me hungry to see more. In early
March, we finally made a sojourn into the valley's heart for a
two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Monument Valley, on Navajo land, straddles the Utah-Arizona
border. Until recent decades, the 2,000-square-mile area was hard
on travelers, with mostly dirt roads and rough accommodations.
Goulding's Lodge, where Harry Goulding, a Federal sheep inspector
from Mancos, Colo., and his wife, Leone (nicknamed Mike), settled
in 1923 on the Utah side of the border, was originally just a
trading post with a spectacular view over the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Gouldings and their Navajo neighbors suffered terrible
hardships, including a lack of food and cash during the Great
Depression. So when the Gouldings heard in 1938 that Ford was about
to make a new western, they went to Hollywood to persuade him to
shoot ``Stagecoach'' in Monument Valley and bring jobs to the
impoverished area. They were successful, and Goulding's became the
headquarters for Ford's films. At the time, it had the only
accommodations in the valley _ tents.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and I had originally planned to stay in the largest town
close to Monument Valley _ Kayenta, Ariz., 24 miles south _ until a
friend in Durango told us that Goulding's had expanded into a
full-fledged motel and lodge with modern accommodations. We changed
our plans and had no trouble getting a room in the early spring
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   One begins to appreciate Monument Valley's remoteness when
planning how to get there. We started our trip in Durango, 188
miles to the northeast, and drove a leisurely five hours to the
valley, stopping to take photographs and investigate shops selling
silver and turquoise jewelry and kitschy souvenirs in the scattered
small towns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   We arrived in Monument Valley on a blustery afternoon. A light
snow dusted the russet rocks. The spires shimmered in golden
sunlight and cast long dark shadows on the red earth.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's Lodge is about a mile off U.S. Highway 163, near the
turnoff to the Navajo Tribal Park headquarters, the official
entrance to Monument Valley. Situated at the base of towering
sandstone cliffs, the long, two-storied coral adobe motel faces
east, toward the formations. In the off-season, it was quiet, with
only a few guests, many of them Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The original two-story stone trading post has been turned into a
museum that gives a feel for the history of Goulding's. The cabin
occupied by John Wayne's character in Ford's ``She Wore a Yellow
Ribbon'' (1949), Capt. Nathan Brittles, has been preserved, too,
behind the old post. There's also a campground, a convenience store
and a gas station adjacent to the motel.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge was expanded and modernized in 1985; it is still the
only large accommodation in Monument Valley. Our room (like all of
Goulding's 62 rooms) opened onto a small balcony, overlooking
formations about five miles away with colorful names like Eagle
Mesa, the Stagecoach and the Bear and the Rabbit. It had a
king-size bed, a television with VCR, a small refrigerator and a
coffeemaker. The bedroom was decorated in the same desert hues we
saw through the sliding glass doors to the balcony.
</P>
<P>
   That evening we dined on grilled trout at the lodge's Stagecoach
Dining Room, which has a long picture window facing the valley.
It's staffed by Navajos and decorated with pottery and native
weavings.
</P>
<P>
   The food is basic _ steaks, hamburgers, chicken, a salad bar _
but quite good. Navajo tacos _ shredded beef, chilies, lettuce,
tomatoes and cheese in a big round piece of fry bread (like a puffy
tortilla) _ are a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Monument Valley is a sacred place to the Navajo Nation, the
largest American Indian tribe, with about 155,000 members and a
reservation of almost 16 million acres, including the Four Corners
area, larger than West Virginia. The Navajo are believed to be
descendants of Athabascan-speaking tribes from the Pacific Coast,
Canada and Alaska that arrived in the Southwest at least 1,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known exactly when the Navajo first settled Monument
Valley. Others came before them: Anasazi sites and ruins in the
valley date from before 1300. Navajos have lived in the valley for
generations, herding sheep and livestock and raising small crops.
</P>
<P>
   Religious ceremonies and practices are an essential part of
traditional Navajo daily life. There is no worship center: the
people consider the world around them holy.
</P>
<P>
   That belief is reflected in the names the Navajos gave to
Monument Valley's formations. One wind-sculptured monolith is
called the Yei-Bi-Chei, an important holy figure among Navajos. Cly
Butte is named for a chieftain buried there with his worldly
possessions, including his cattle, goats, sheep, horse and saddle.
</P>
<P>
   There's even the core of an ancient volcano that the Navajo call
Agathlan, renamed El Capitan by Kit Carson, the cavalry soldier who
starting in 1863 waged what some historians call a ``war of
extermination'' against the Navajo people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864, 8,000 Navajo were marched across New Mexico to Fort
Sumner on the New Mexico-Texas border and imprisoned for four
years; the survivors _ about 25 percent are believed to have died
on the march _ were allowed to occupy part of their old homeland
under a treaty signed in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1940s, when Hollywood discovered Monument Valley and
tourism started to become a business, Monument Valley was
primitive, largely empty and a difficult place for living or
traveling.
</P>
<P>
   While the area is more accessible now in terms of paved roads
and comfortable accommodations, a non-Navajo faces restrictions
seeing it. There are basically two options: going on a guided tour
or driving a self-guided 17-mile loop that starts at the Tribal
Park headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's and several independent Navajo guides offer daylong
or half-day tours in open-air sightseeing vehicles, in
four-wheel-drive jeeps or on horseback. Some tours take visitors to
Mystery Valley, a section of southwestern Monument Valley with
natural arches, pictographs and Anasazi ruins.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer to explore places on our own and at our own pace, so
we decided to take the self-guided drive. After paying $2.50 each
at the park entrance (the fee has since gone to $3) and receiving a
map of the loop, we headed off on the rutted dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   We had rented a Ford Explorer, but the road was dry and not so
bumpy that we needed to engage the four-wheel-drive (although it
might be needed if the roads were muddy).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors aren't allowed to go beyond marked roads and designated
points for viewing the landscape, except with a Navajo guide, to
protect tribal burial grounds and holy places. There are no hiking
trails, although hiking can be arranged with a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was the off-season, we passed only a few vehicles as we
wound around the mesas and buttes. Some of the formations have been
photographed so often that they seemed familiar _ like the Mittens,
two eroded buttes with thumblike spires.
</P>
<P>
   Other monoliths and pillars sport colorful and descriptive
names, too, like Castle Butte, the Sitting Hen, the Three Sisters
(a trio of spires standing close together, almost gossiping;
they're said to resemble three Catholic nuns in habits) or the Big
W, Totem Pole and the King on his Throne.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through the desert landscape with its sculptured rocks
was a sharp contrast to our trip from Durango through the snowy,
heavily forested Rocky Mountains. Yet Monument Valley was formed
from the Rockies, or, more specifically, their detritus.
</P>
<P>
   As material eroded from the Rockies millions of years ago, it
was deposited in layers and cemented into sandstone. Underground
pressure produced an uplift that made the surface bulge and crack,
forming canyons. Over millenniums, wind and water carved the hard
and soft rock into the striated orange and red natural wonders that
seem to pop out of the desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   We got out at several points and walked around a bit at the
designated viewing points. One of the most dramatic views came near
the end of the trip, at a place called the North Window.
</P>
<P>
   The loop drive consumed several hours because we stopped at all
11 scenic viewing points. At John Ford's Point, we parked in a lot
where several Navajo families had set up tables to sell silver and
turquoise jewelry. We followed a short trail to a finger of rock
jutting into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The director supposedly liked to film from this vantage point
with its sweeping views of the valley. On the day we visited, the
cameras were still rolling at John Ford's Point _ only now they
were video cameras held by French and German tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But to visit Monument Valley is also to realize that the
big-screen images and Technicolor can't do the place justice. It
takes the human eye to capture the 360-degree views and record the
way the valley changes color during the day, turning from lavender
and pink at dawn to gold and terra cotta in the late afternoon. Or
the way the monoliths cast long, ghostly shadows at dusk and become
otherworldly silhouettes against the blue twilight.
</P>
<P>
   For a place that has remained the same for so long, Monument
Valley remakes itself with every take.
</P>

and soft rock into the striated orange and red natural wonders that
seem to pop out of the desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   We got out at several points and walked around a bit at the
designated viewing points. One of the most dramatic views came near
the end of the trip, at a place called the North Window.
</P>
<P>
   The loop drive consumed several hours because we stopped at all
11 scenic viewing points. At John Ford's Point, we parked in a lot
where several Navajo families had set up tables to sell silver and
turquoise jewelry. We followed a short trail to a finger of rock
jutting into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The director supposedly liked to film from this vantage point
with its sweeping views of the valley. On the day we visited, the
cameras were still rolling at John Ford's Point _ only now they
were video cameras held by French and German tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But to visit Monument Valley is also to realize that the
big-screen images and Technicolor can't do the place justice. It
takes the human eye to capture the 360-degree views and record the
way the valley changes color during the day, turning from lavender
and pink at dawn to gold and terra cotta in the late afternoon. Or
the way the monoliths cast long, ghostly shadows at dusk and become
otherworldly silhouettes against the blue twilight.
</P>
<P>
   For a place that has remained the same for so long, Monument
Valley remakes itself with every take.

 &UR; SIDEBAR A SACRED LAND, AND NOT BECAUSE JOHN WAYNE SLEPT HERE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to Monument Valley is at the Monument Valley Navajo
Tribal Park headquarters, 22 miles north of Kayenta, Ariz., off
Route 163 just over the border in Utah. It is open daily except
Christmas Day, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., till 5 p.m. in winter; (435)
727-3287.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, low temperatures are generally in the 20's and 30s,
with highs of 50s and 60s. In summer, temperatures get into the
80's and fall near 60 at night. There are few trees in Monument
Valley and the sun is intense reflecting off the rock and sand, so
protection is important.
 &UR; GETTING THERE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The closest airport to Monument Valley served by major airlines
is in Phoenix, 310 miles away. America West, (800) 235-9292, and
United Airlines, (800) 241-6522, serve Durango, Colo., 190 miles
away. Major car rental agencies operate at both airports.
 &UR; HOW TO SEE THE SIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It costs $3 a person to drive the 17-mile loop road for a
self-guided tour. The visitors center at the tribal park has a
complete list of tour operators and road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Goulding's Lodge offers tours lasting two and a half hours to a
full day with Navajo guides, costing $25.50 to $60.50. Information:
(800) 874-0902, or www.gouldings.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sacred Monument Tours leads guided hiking tours, as well as
tours by jeep or horseback; a four-hour jeep tour is $45, a
full-day tour $100. Group rates available; (435) 727-3218 or
www.sacredtoursmv.com.
</P>
<P>
   Scenic Airlines, (800) 634-6801, flies from Las Vegas daily at 6
a.m. to Monument Valley for a tour and lunch, with a stop at the
Grand Canyon. Tickets are $423.

those companies are among the fragments of Standard Oil, broken up

   (UNDATED) _ Revenge is a dish best eaten cold. But this is
ridiculous. A full 14 years after Margaret Thatcher abolished the
Greater London Council, thinking she had consigned its leader to
history, ``Red'' Ken Livingstone is poised to take his place again
as the public face of London. Much to the chagrin of Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Livingstone is expected to become London's first-ever
directly elected mayor, the closest thing that Britain has had to
an American-style big-city boss. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ In the rich world, AIDS, though still incurable,
seldom nowadays means imminent death, and malaria kills hardly
anyone. In the poor world, however, AIDS kills about 2.5 million
people a year and malaria another 2 million, perhaps more. Most of
the deaths are in Africa, and they are increasing in number. Alas,
they would be attacked with far greater energy and effectiveness if
most of their victims lived not in Africa but in Europe or
America. &QL;

<P>
   American courts do not much like breaking up successful
companies. But when they do, the results are not always dire.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, Chevron: those companies, with a
long and valuable history, are among the fragments of Standard Oil,
broken up in 1911. In the subsequent decade, the value of Standard
Oil's divided assets rose fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Rockefeller, lucky man, thus made more money in
retirement than during his working life.
</P>
<P>
   That example may not cheer Bill Gates, as he waits to hear how
the courts react to the Justice Department's forthcoming
recommendation on Microsoft's future.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market as a whole was rising in the early 1910s.
Moreover, today's stock market, which has marked down the value of
Microsoft's shares by almost half since the start of the year,
seems to dislike the idea of multi-Microsofts (although it also
dislikes the slowdown in Microsoft's earnings growth).
</P>
<P>
   And yet a Standard Oil approach to the company could well be
best not only for consumers but also, in the long run, for
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department seems likely to propose splitting
Microsoft into at least two parts: one company would own the
various versions of the Windows operating system, the other the
Office applications software.
</P>
<P>
   During the lengthy antitrust investigations, one of the main
themes of the Justice Department's complaints was the barrier to
entry created by the reinforcing links between these two halves of
the business. The fact that Microsoft Office works best on a
Windows operating system has strengthened the dominance of each
component part.
</P>
<P>
   Its latest (extremely profitable) version of Office for the
Macintosh was produced only on condition that Apple made
Microsoft's Internet Explorer its default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Given the determination of the Justice Department to break the
power of this link, Microsoft faces only two realistic options _
unless most of the charges against it are thrown out on appeal. One
is to become a regulated private-sector monopoly. The other is to
split itself up.
</P>
<P>
   Life as a regulated monopoly would be unattractive _ and would
surely exacerbate the difficulties Microsoft has already begun to
have in attracting and retaining its best people.
</P>
<P>
   For the two mini-Microsofts, on the other hand, exciting new
opportunities would emerge.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the applications company would have an incentive
to create versions that could be run on other operating systems,
including Linux and the growing range of handheld gadgets that will
probably be the most remarkable technologies of the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   The two new businesses would doubtless cooperate, as Microsoft
already cooperates with Intel, the dominant producer of
microprocessors. But they would also encourage each other's
competitors, as those two companies also do.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-Microsofts would thus have incentives to compete, to
innovate and to develop new markets. Indeed, if Gates were wise, he
would snatch the initiative and make his own split.
</P>
<P>
   Both the divided companies would still overwhelmingly dominate
their respective markets. But dominance is not, in itself, a
problem. Several high-tech companies have 80 percent or more of
their markets: think of Cisco, Intel, or eBay.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately matters is not market clout, but the way it is
used or abused. As Microsoft's shares have slid, so those of
Oracle, another software giant, have remained steady, with the
result that Larry Ellison, Oracle's boss, is now the world's
richest man.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's renaissance has been built less on market dominance
than on innovation and on open rather than proprietary standards.
</P>
<P>
   Only by following that route will Gates recapture his claim to
be the Rockefeller of the 21st century. &QL;

<P>
   Revenge is a dish best eaten cold. But this is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   A full 14 years after former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council, thinking she had
consigned its leader to history, ``Red'' Ken Livingstone is poised
to take his place again as the public face of London.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he is not just getting his old job back. Thanks to
Prime Minister Tony Blair's fondness for constitutional experiment,
he is about to become London's first-ever directly elected mayor,
the closest thing that Britain has had to an American-style city
boss.
</P>
<P>
   If, as the polls currently suggest, he coasts to victory on May
4, Livingstone will be entitled to reflect that while Mrs. Thatcher
has become history, he is making it again.
</P>
<P>
   Not even this conveys the whole sweetness of his coming triumph.
For the present prime minister will be grinding his teeth just as
much as Lady Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Blair wanted when he gave London a mayor was for
the job to go to Livingstone. In Blair's book, Livingstone is the
epitome of the ``loony left,'' a gesture politician who made Labour
unelectable for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor of the ``New'' Labour Party tried his utmost to
drive a stake through the candidature of this ghost from the old
one.
</P>
<P>
   By rigging the nomination for his own man, Frank Dobson, Blair
forced Livingstone to run as an independent. Independents don't win
elections in Britain _ do they?
</P>
<P>
   Londoners are a bloody-minded lot. Many will feel good about
throwing a spanner into Blair's over-tidy works. But will a Mayor
Ken do much good for them? Probably not _ though it is oddly
difficult to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is that Livingstone is both a masterful populist
and, on policy, a master of ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   He has published a long, bland manifesto on the Internet,
designed to reassure voters that the ``Red Ken'' of the 1980s,
having grown up into ``Citizen Ken,'' can now be trusted to take
command of one of global capitalism's capital cities.
</P>
<P>
   He is as well liked by the City types who roar at his genuine
wit as by the social workers of Camden, who expect him to wage war
on inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is the pedestrian's friend (he has travelled by foot
and subway for years), he is not necessarily the motorist's enemy
(a threat to levy charges on cars entering inner London has grown
vaguer as the election has approached).
</P>
<P>
   If voters held pre-election ambiguity against politicians,
parliaments everywhere would be half-empty. The worrying thing is
not what Livingstone says he will do but where he is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his ideas are admirable. He is a longtime champion of
sexual and racial equality. But he also wishes members of the IMF a
painful death, blames the financial system for killing more people
than Hitler and jokes about putting delegates of the World Trade
Organization in stocks if this ``arrogant'' body ever meets in
London. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It is telling that one policy he has spelled out clearly is his
plan to increase investment in the Tube (subway) by issuing bonds
and not, as Blair wants, by means of a public-private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   A preference for raising money by issuing municipal bonds is
hardly evidence of Trotskyism. But by blaming the privatization of
the overground railways for last year's train crash in Paddington,
and by willfully misinterpreting Blair's scheme as a plan to
privatize the Tube, Livingstone has shown a cynical (and
politically brilliant) willingness to pander to popular prejudices,
while keeping the left on his side.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, the Greater London Authority, the new body
the new mayor will lead, is not supposed to have any say over how
the Tube is financed. If Mayor Ken wants to stop the government's
plan, he will have to challenge it in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Blair has taken care to give the mayor relatively weak
formal powers. The mayor will have fewer tax-raising powers than
the existing 33 boroughs, which remain in being as they are.
</P>
<P>
   He will have no responsibility for London's schools and
hospitals. His job is to act as the impresario of London's many
councils, boards and agencies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 975) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   He is bound to have great influence. But he will owe this less
to what he is allowed to do than to the fact of his popular
election.
</P>
<P>
   This may be comforting for London. It is scarier for Blair. If
Livingstone becomes mayor on May 4, he will have a perfect right to
claim a direct personal mandate from some 5 million London voters.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's direct personal mandate comes from the
65,000 voters of Sedgefield. To give a populist such as Livingstone
a mandate such as this is like giving Archimedes a firm place to
stand: he will try to use it to lever the whole of British politics
to the left _ perhaps even eventually to challenge Blair's grip on
the Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it has been such a mistake for Blair to have backed
a middleweight like Dobson, and for the other main political
parties to have made so little of London's election.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dobson, nor the Conservatives' Steven Norris, nor the
Liberal Democrats' Susan Kramer, would be disastrous. All might do
a better practical job of running London than Livingstone. But none
was a big enough politician to take him on.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York, say, London is not just any great city. It is a
nation's political, financial and cultural capital rolled together
into one.
</P>
<P>
   If by next week Mayor Ken is organizing his red-green alliance
in the independent republic of London, Britain's political
establishment will have its own lack of imagination to blame. &QL;

<P>
   In the rich world, AIDS, though still incurable, seldom nowadays
means imminent death, and malaria kills hardly anyone. In the poor
world, however, AIDS kills about 2.5 million people a year and
malaria another 2 million, maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the deaths are in Africa, and they are increasing in
number. In the wars against these two pestilences, the bugs are
winning.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS and malaria are different diseases, with different causes,
but they have this in common: they cause dreadful human misery,
with huge economic costs.
</P>
<P>
   And they would be attacked with far greater energy and
effectiveness if most of their victims lived not in Africa but in
Europe or America.
</P>
<P>
   Few Africans can afford the expensive medicines that mitigate
the effects of AIDS; and few drug companies will spend the
quantities of money necessary to develop a malaria vaccine if most
of the people likely to want it are too poor to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is a market for the medicines that can already be
produced, and the certainty that it will still exist if and when
new drugs or vaccines are discovered.
</P>
<P>
   This idea _ the creation of a market _ is not new. Jeffrey
Sachs, of Harvard University, suggested it in The Economist last
August, and it has won praise from, among others, U.S. President
Bill Clinton and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to the World Health Organization, now at last
playing a useful role under the leadership of Gro Harlem
Brundtland, a Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization has been
set up, with backing, financial as well as verbal, from
philanthropists such as Microsoft's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is welcome. The market, however, remains an idea,
not a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs argues that, were the rich countries to provide $1 billion
a year for an indefinite period, they could help to pay not just
for drugs, insecticides and bed nets _ one of the most effective
means of combating malaria _ but also for a fund that could be
drawn upon once any malaria vaccine were developed.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits in saving lives would be huge. So would the
economic gains.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term costs of malaria, Sachs believes, are greater
than the 1 percent or so of GDP traditionally attributed to the
disease, and the compounded costs over 15 years are therefore
nearly 20 percent. An annual flow of $1 billion in anti-malaria aid
would, he says, benefit sub-Saharan Africa's combined GDP by $3
billion-12 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Two changes are needed. One is the recognition by donors that
this would be money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria this week, there were signs that
the World Bank might indeed find $300 million-500 million a year to
fight malaria, which would at least be a start. But even that would
achieve little if it were not spent in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the second needed change: a readiness by African
governments to agree on programs regionally, not state by state,
and a willingness to pursue tried-and-tested methods that work.
</P>
<P>
   Here the evidence is mixed. Some countries, such as Senegal and
Uganda, have put in place conventional anti-AIDS programs to
dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet South Africa _ a late-comer to the war on AIDS, with the
result that it has more new infections than any other country _
remains skeptical about the treatments that have been used
successfully elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only this month President Thabo Mbeki wrote to Clinton and other
western leaders to defend his willingness to contemplate heterodox
theories about AIDS and to seek African solutions to a ``uniquely
African catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the mood in Abuja this week was very different. No
one got a bigger round of applause there than Ghana's president,
Jerry Rawlings, when he reminded delegates that public health was
once taken far more seriously in Africa; indeed, in colonial days,
householders would be liable to fines if they allowed pools of
water to collect in which malaria-carrying mosquitoes could breed.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to bring back colonialism _ but everyone should
want to see AIDS and malaria rendered no more lethal in Africa than
in richer places. &QL;

<P>
   Just how compassionate can a Republican get before he has to
leave the GOP and join Vegans for Global Justice? George W. Bush
seems bent on finding out.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he is holding a get-to-know-you meeting with a bunch
of gay Republicans. The next he is holding forth on education or
the environment or some other squishy-squashy crowd-pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to make a red-blooded conservative choke on his
spotted-owl drumstick.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago compassionate conservatism lay slaughtered on
that great red carpet at Bob Jones University. Now it is enjoying a
second life.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is not only insistently telling Americans that he is a
``uniter, not a divider.'' He has also produced a wodge of policy
statements and five-year plans, a concept for which he has more
enthusiasm than anyone since Uncle Joe Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about housing for the poor? Bush has a five-year plan to
encourage private developers to build in poor areas. Worried about
the future of Medicare? There's a five-year plan for that too.
</P>
<P>
   This compassion offensive is discombobulating people at both
ends of the political spectrum. Bush is sidelining the sort of
Republicans who seized control of Congress in 1994. And he is
challenging the Democrats on their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   He is not just willing to talk about subjects _ notably
education _ that escaped Bob Dole's attention in 1996. He is even
willing to sanction the expansion of the dreaded federal government
if that helps America's poor.
</P>
<P>
   So far it is paying off. Several opinion polls put Bush back
ahead of Al Gore, a position he lost when he moved to the right
during the primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One poll even puts him in front of Gore on the core Democratic
subject of education. And the Los Angeles Times reckons he is
beating Gore among women by 41 percent to 39 percent (Dole lost the
fairer sex by a landslide).
</P>
<P>
   Can Bush sustain his compassionate image? The Democrats will
keep replaying the film of Bush embracing Bob Jones III until it is
burned into America's subconscious. And, even if he holds steady,
can he really drag the party of Rush Limbaugh back to the left
without causing a revolt?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the first question is mixed. Bush has time on his
side: when America goes to the polls in November, it will be nine
months since that foolish embrace on the red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   He also has his less-than-weighty-intellectual reputation:
trying to paint the jovial frat boy as a dour moral conservative
could backfire, just as it did with the smiling Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But against that you have to reckon two things. The first is the
country's ingrained suspicion of Republicans when it comes to
social reform, particularly when they offer to cut taxes by $483
billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The polls still show Bush trailing Gore on most social issues,
and Gore is blasting his rival's ``casino economics'' on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the fact that Bush is governor of the state that
happens to be the country's pollution and execution pacesetter.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Bush is likely to spend almost as much time dealing
with ``bigot eruptions'' as Candidate Clinton once spent dealing
with ``bimbo eruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks he has been embarrassed by a Texan police chief
who referred to blacks as ``porch monkeys'' and a health chief who
despaired about Hispanics' proficiency at breeding.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is on safer ground when it comes to avoiding the
intra-Republican feuding that plagued his father in 1992 and Bob
Dole four years later. So far, conservative leaders have bitten
their tongues as he has fudged on abortion and strayed on federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made it clear all along that he is a middle-of-the-road
conservative rather than a right-wing messiah. And the fact that
his party is desperate for the White House after eight years
outside it helps him to redefine conservatism as he sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Bush sees fit to redefine conservatism as just
another sort of Clintonism? The Republican Party might be in danger
of making itself electable only at the price of losing its soul.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between compassionate conservatism and
Clintonism are indeed remarkable. Clinton talked tough on
``Republican'' subjects such as defense and law-and-order. Bush is
talking compassionately on ``Democratic'' subjects like education
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton burnished his image as a moderate by denouncing the far
left. Bush waggles his eyebrows at the right-wing cavemen of
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been so successfully vague about abortion that
abortion-rights advocates have had to remind people that he is a
right-to-life man.
</P>
<P>
   He has also shown Clintonian zeal in borrowing ideas from his
opponents. His suggestions on a whole range of social issues _ from
tax credits to help the uninsured buy medical coverage to
individual retirement accounts for workers _ have been lifted
straight from the Progressive Policy Institute, a think-tank that
helped Clinton's New Democrats rise to power. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But it is necessary to be careful about pushing the comparison
too far: there is both less and more to compassionate conservatism
than there is to Clintonism.
</P>
<P>
   There is less because Bush has been pretty meek in taking on
entrenched interests. There was no Sister Souljah moment over the
Confederate flag or the Miami Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is so unreconstructed on the subject of guns that he
supported a measure to legalize the carrying of concealed handguns
in his state.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also more, because compassionate conservatism is
not quite the self-contradiction it sounds. The New Democrats have
had to fight bare-knuckled against a tradition in their party that
worships big government and bureaucratic planning.
</P>
<P>
   But compassionate conservatism reaches back to one of the oldest
conservative principles in the book: the belief that voluntary
organizations _ what Edmund Burke called ``the little battalions''
_ are often better at solving social problems than distant
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   It tries to use markets rather than governments to solve these
problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is an imperfect carrier of the message, of course, and all
his schemes may yet turn to dust. But at least he is trying to
fashion a conservative case on social policy rather than losing the
argument by default, as his two unfortunate predecessors did. &QL;

<P>
   MIAMI _ A screaming boy, policemen pointing guns,
Cuban-Americans burning flags. The Elian Gonzalez affair reached a
new crescendo with the removal of the six-year-old boy from the
home of his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Elian has been reunited with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, in Maryland, you might expect a speedy conclusion to the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   It may not happen, because of the three forces that conspired to
keep Elian from his father in the first place: Cuban-American
hatred of Fidel Castro, the cleverness of expensive lawyers, and
the venom of American politics in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   With Cuban exiles still smarting from a mixture of tear gas,
pepper spray and public humiliation, lawyers for the boy's Miami
relatives are already planning to erect new legal obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals-court ruling earlier this month, which prevented
Elian's father from returning immediately to Cuba, requires father
and son to remain in the United States until the Eleventh Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta hears the Miami family's case on May
11.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose, the relatives say they will fight the case all the
way to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It should not come to that. Possession being nine-tenths of the
law, legal experts say the balance of the case has now shifted
overwhelmingly in the father's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives had based their case on the argument that
Elian enjoyed the right to political asylum. They even went as far
as presenting an asylum petition signed by Elian, drawn up in
English (a language Elian cannot read) and with a signature
carefully done in a child's block capitals.
</P>
<P>
   In an 83-page brief filed with the appeals court on April 24,
the Justice Department argued that the asylum application was
clearly not the boy's doing. Instead, they called it a
``substantial intrusion into the realm of parental authority for a
distant relative to be able to trigger government procedures
concerning the parent's six-year-old son.''
</P>
<P>
   This follows an earlier ruling in a federal court that only the
father could speak for a boy of such tender years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Miami family reply that, given the choice, no
child in his right mind would want to be brought up under Fidel
Castro's communist system. His father, by implication, is a
creature of Castro and should be stripped of his parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami lawyers this week took legal action seeking to prevent
Cuban government officials from having any further contact with
Elian's father. They also sought to have an independent guardian
appointed, and visiting rights for the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Juan Miguel has made it clear that, for the
time being, he wants nothing to do with the Miami relatives, whom
he accuses of betraying his trust (when Elian was rescued at sea
last November, it was he who telephoned them to ask them to look
after his child). Instead, Elian will soon be joined by four
classmates from Cuba to keep him company.
</P>
<P>
   A family that was once famously close-knit, despite living in
different countries, now seems to have been wrenched apart.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel is being advised by Gregory Craig, one of Bill
Clinton's lawyers in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Craig will quickly
move to withdraw the previous asylum petitions filed on the boy's
behalf by the Miami relatives. This would appear to make the May
hearing rather meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   At present, despite the shock of seeing Elian seized at gunpoint
by federal agents, American public opinion remains solidly behind
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a losing proposition. It was a crusade that was
destined to fail, given international and family norms,'' says
Damian Fernandez, a Cuba expert at Florida International
University. ``Moral and political capital has been misspent in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some even think the Elian affair may end up softening American
attitudes to Cuba. ``It is like planting seeds in a garden,'' says
John Kavulich, head of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council,
which represents business interests.
</P>
<P>
   One seed is a forthcoming congressional bill that would allow
food and medical sales to Cuba. It is due to receive a new hearing
soon in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose conservative
chairman, Jesse Helms, has dropped his once-firm opposition to the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the political signs are not hopeful.
Republicans are demanding Senate hearings on Elian's case.
Republican politicians, from George W. Bush to Rudy Giuliani, are
heaping scorn on the pro-Castro Democrats and on Al Gore (even
though the vice president rallied to the Miami Cubans' cause).
</P>
<P>
   In Miami itself, the exiles' leaders point out that the Elian
affair has helped to galvanize the flagging anti-Castro cause. The
hard-liners say they are recruiting new followers.
</P>
<P>
   There are even stories of Cuban-American voters in Miami
registering to change their voter affiliation to the Republican
Party. The exiles have vowed to punish the Democrats in November.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, Elian will know his fate by then. &QL;

   DAMASCUS _ High above the lights of Damascus, a huge neon sign
announces the Information Exhibition, the Syrian government's
latest initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the town, at a fairground once used to tout the output
of state-owned factories, veiled women and mustachioed men skitter
from pavilion to pavilion, ogling the latest DVD players, comparing
new makes of mobile phones and trying their hands at surfing the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers ooh and aah as the brave pioneers call up English
football results, an American Christian dating page and a site
devoted to a feminist version of Japanese kabuki theatre.
</P>
<P>
   What might sound standard elsewhere is revolutionary in Syria,
whose authoritarian regime has steadfastly skirted the information
highway.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite dishes, although ubiquitous, were illegal. And Syria
remained one of the few countries in the world without Internet
connections or a mobile-phone network.
</P>
<P>
   All that began changing in 1998, when the government first
introduced the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In typical Syrian style, the regime has slowly extended access:
first to scientific institutes, then to universities and eventually
to private businessmen. So far, ordinary citizens have caught
glimpses of cyberspace only at special events like the current
exhibition, but that too could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar way, the government introduced mobile phones on a
trial basis in Damascus and Aleppo earlier this year, with plans to
expand the network to the rest of the country in due course.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the glacial pace of past years, Syria has seen a
whirlwind of economic reforms in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The government has abolished jail terms for those caught dealing
in foreign currency, offered extra incentives for private
investment and brought the official exchange rate closer to the
black-market one.
</P>
<P>
   It has also sacked several corrupt officials in the state
telecoms company and the customs department.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Miro, made prime minister a month ago, is the first
from outside the top ranks of the ruling party. Although many
ministers remain the same, he has given them permission to hire and
fire staff without consulting him _ a big step in Syria's
impossibly centralized system.
</P>
<P>
   Change of this sort was probably inevitable. The creaking state
sector can no longer provide a livelihood for Syria's rapidly
growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Many businessmen were already tapping into the Internet by
telephoning service providers in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands of Syrian soldiers and
workers live, mobile phones and web cafes are a way of life. Within
Syria itself, satellite dishes have given millions of Syrians a
tantalizing glimpse of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria's rulers have not always bowed to the inevitable with
such good grace. It took many years and several futile crackdowns
for the government to accept the proliferation of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's cyber-revolution has fared better since it has been led
by Bashar Assad, the son of President Hafez Assad and head of the
body that is introducing computers to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Assad senior plucked his son from an ophthalmology course in
London and brought him to Syria as heir-apparent on the death of
his brother, Basil, in 1994. The official press now casts him as
the country's ``hope and future.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ammar Sinan, a local businessman, ``Dr. Bashar has
initiated all the recent positive changes.'' He has certainly
encouraged a relatively open debate on the economy. But, so far,
his reforms only tinker with the prevailing economic order.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has there been much progress on the political front, beyond
the release of a few political prisoners and an easing of
restrictions on foreign travel. His father, a cautious man, will
certainly block radical reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, even talking about reform is a radical step in
Syria. &QL;

<P>
   WARSAW _ The Blue Cactus, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Warsaw that
makes a fair stab at serving the real thing, has long been a prime
lunch spot for the Polish capital's corporate movers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be an expat hang out,'' says a Scottish
venture-capitalist, poking at his tortilla. ``But now it's mostly
Polish.'' A glance around the room shows that he is right.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Warsaw rises, square-jawed and grey. It is stupendously
ugly. Almost every building is less than 50 years old: the entire
city was virtually wiped off the face of the earth in the Second
World War, leaving 600,000 Poles dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Warsaw has been largely reborn, a Polish capital with Polish
attributes: indomitable, disorderly, above all dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-sized skyscrapers punching skyward along John Paul
Avenue confirm Warsaw's place as the undisputed business capital of
Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The city is now the continent's second-largest building site
after Berlin, yet, back in 1990, its dominance seemed unlikely.
Prague and Budapest were cheaper, exquisitely beautiful, and their
infrastructure worked much better.
</P>
<P>
   But the grimness seems, oddly, to have helped Warsaw: there were
no distracting tourists, no romantics, just bottom-line businessmen
and plenty of prime development land, which is far harder to get
hold of in Prague or Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destruction made us more pliable,'' says Pawel Piskorski, the
city's mayor, who, like many of his fellow Warsovians, relentlessly
boosts the place.
</P>
<P>
   He plays up the city's cultured past as home of _ among others _
Chopin, then points to a string of projects, from an amusement park
that the American singer Michael Jackson wants to build, to a
gathering this June of most of the world's foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Boosterism only gets you so far, however. Warsaw's success is
driven, above all, by money.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign and local bankers say that investors in Warsaw can get
their money back, and more, in seven years or so. Put it into Paris
or Berlin and it could take 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Poles' rollicking economy, which has grown by nearly a third
in the past five years, is now almost four times as big as
Ukraine's, over three times Hungary's and nearly three times the
Czech Republic's.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of early entry into the European Union should
tempt more foreign businessmen to set up shop in Poland _ with the
advantage of much lower costs, especially of labor, than elsewhere
in the Union.
</P>
<P>
   According to a poll of international businessmen conducted by
A.T. Kearney, an American consulting company, Poland may, in the
next three years, become the world's fifth-largest recipient of
foreign direct investment _ after the United States, Britain, China
and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's foreign investment agency says it expects some $12
billion to flow in this year, compared with last year's estimated
record of $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to U.N. figures, would give Poland roughly 40
percent of last year's total foreign direct investment in the
entire swathe of Europe, including Russia itself, that was once
controlled by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   More buildings seem destined to sweep the sky in Warsaw. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ If this is victory, what would a stalemate look like?
</P>
<P>
   Even in winter, when the Chechen fighters were at their most
vulnerable _ cold, hungry and visible through the bare trees _ the
Russian forces, which outnumber them at least tenfold, failed to
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Now spring is making conditions in the mountains friendlier for
the Chechens. The war goes on.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, Russia reported ten dead from a Chechen ambush;
another one the day before killed 15. The fighting is in areas
which Russia claims to have controlled for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and helicopters fly dozens of sorties a day _
130, for example, on April 27 _ but have been unable to stop the
rebels moving about.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chechens have suffered heavy losses _ 13,500 dead
according to the Russians, 1,300 by their own count _ they can
still do what matters: kill Russians and escape.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next? The last war ended in 1996 with the Chechens
retaking the capital, Grozny. The Russians withdrew in humiliation.
An ominous echo of that came with the news, from Russian
commanders, that some 500 rebels had returned to the ruined city.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officers are speaking nervously of a new guerrilla
offensive in the first half of May.
</P>
<P>
   A general complained this week that ``500 foreign mercenaries''
were poised to infiltrate Chechnya from Georgia, its edgily neutral
southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   There have, at least, been feelers towards a negotiated peace.
Russia's president-elect, Vladimir Putin, confirmed last week that
he had exchanged ideas with the Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   As the generals growled that any talks with the terrorists would
be betrayal, Putin was characteristically ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   He floated the idea that Maskhadov, though a ``criminal,'' could
be pardoned if he surrendered. Yet he also dismissed him as someone
who ``decides nothing and will never decide anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kommersant, a daily paper, had earlier quoted Maskhadov as
saying that he had ordered the release of all Russian prisoners of
war, and a unilateral cease-fire. In a later radio interview, he
said he had been misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   This week another Russian newspaper, Segodnya, reported that
Maskhadov would soon fly to Moscow for a combined surrender, pardon
and peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these confusing signals led to something, it would not
stop the war soon. The tough Islamist commanders in Chechnya, whose
forces outnumber Maskhadov's, have already denounced any idea of
negotiation with Russia's leaders, who plainly want the Islamists
dead or in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's diplomacy, so far, looks as unlikely to bring a solid
peace as the military onslaught that began last autumn. &QL;

MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL RACE GETS `MUY CALIENTE' AFTER ALL

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The vote is not until July 2, but as the campaign
for Mexico's presidential election got under way in earnest this
week, two things confirmed that it will be unlike any other in the
country's history.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an opinion poll showing that Vicente Fox, the
candidate of the opposition National Action Party (PAN), seems
close to drawing level with Francisco Labastida of the long-ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   The second was a television debate between the candidates in
which it was Labastida, not Fox, who behaved like the challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Routine stuff for democracies, even Latin American ones. But not
for Mexico, where the PRI has held power since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Mexican campaigns were lengthy processions. Since
the outcome was rarely in doubt, their purpose was to introduce the
outgoing president's chosen successor to the PRI's grass roots and
to the country.
</P>
<P>
   When all else failed, the PRI could rely on a government-run
electoral system: many Mexicans believe that in 1988 fraud secured
victory for Carlos Salinas against Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a left-wing
PRI dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's successor, Ernesto Zedillo, won an undisputed victory
in 1994, but the size of his vote may have been inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, things are different. For a start, the PRI has chosen its
candidate openly, in a primary. Secondly, thanks to a reform put in
place by Zedillo, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) is now
autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot papers will have anti-forgery features, and voting booths
will have proper privacy. Results from each ballot box _ verified
by all the parties' representatives at the polling station _ will
go straight to the Internet for all to see, to prevent the
``electoral alchemy'' of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, back in November, the outcome of this year's election
seemed the familiar foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, Zedillo's grey former interior minister, stood at 50
percent in the polls. The opposition vote was split between the
PAN's Fox, a feisty campaigner who is less conservative than his
party, and Cardenas, making his third bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's rating, boosted by the publicity surrounding the
PRI's primary last November, proved to be temporary. Though
individual polls vary, the trend has been clear.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has slowly drooped; Fox has risen; and Cardenas has
stayed a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published this week by Reforma, a Mexico City newspaper,
showed Fox within three points of Labastida. That underlines Fox's
success in turning the campaign into a referendum on the PRI's
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Little divides the two front-runners on the big issues of
policy, such as education, crime and poverty. Fox's macroeconomic
goals are more ambitious, but also less credible.
</P>
<P>
   Both men play the same nationalist tune, Fox having hastily
retreated from a proposal to privatize Pemex, the creaking state
oil monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Fox, a former Coca-Cola manager, portrays himself as
the man to end a corrupt system. He promises a government of
national unity, to complete the transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's droop has forced him to indulge in some conventional
electioneering. Hitherto, he has played on the voters' fear of the
unknown after seven decades of one-party rule.
</P>
<P>
   But in the televised debate on April he awkwardly tried to
present himself as standing both for stability and for change. He
criticised Fox's vulgarity, and his habit of resorting to personal
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The towering Fox has poked fun at his opponent by calling him el
chaparrito (shorty) and la vestida (the drag queen). He could drop
such epithets, Fox replied, ``but you and yours will never stop
being devious, bad governors, and corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant telephone polls showed that Fox ``won'' the debate.
However, such polls tend to reflect the views of the better-off,
whereas the PRI has the edge among poor and rural voters.
</P>
<P>
   A second debate due next month, this one uncluttered by minor
candidates, may help Fox more. Many voters remain undecided. Some
polls indicate that most of those who have made a choice this year
have plumped for the PAN.
</P>
<P>
   But several factors still help the PRI. Labastida can play up
the government's recent achievements; the PAN has no record except
those of a few state governors.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Labastida, Mexico's steady economic growth _ 5
percent a year, on average, since 1996 _ is at last starting to put
cash in voters' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Real wages have been rising since late last year, though they
are still below their level before 1994's peso crash.
</P>
<P>
   A second advantage is media coverage. This is fairer than in
previous elections. According to IFE's monitoring of television and
radio news, all three leading candidates get roughly equal
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   But Mund Opinion Services, a polling company, which did its own
independent monitoring in February, found that Labastida got about
four times as much news coverage as his opponents that month on TV
Azteca, one of the two biggest television stations, and in general
was more favorably portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party's other advantage is more nefarious.
Traditionally, it has co-opted voters through its intricate
grass-roots network, using a mixture of gifts and threats.
</P>
<P>
   The government's anti-poverty and agricultural-subsidy programs,
which involve small payments to millions of people, lend themselves
to subtle pressure: PRI officials in some districts have already
been accused of threatening to withhold payments to anyone who
votes for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The IFE is encouraging voters to denounce such tricks. But it
cannot do much: illegally pressing voters is a matter for the
courts, not the IFE.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how many cases of voter coercion have been
denounced to the attorney-general's office, investigated, tried and
convicted in the past three years?'' asks Juan Molinar, one of the
IFE's nine councillors. He answers his own question by putting his
thumb and forefinger together in a big round 0.
</P>
<P>
   A study of local elections in Tlaxcala state last year estimated
that voter coercion, of one kind or another, had inflated the PRI's
vote by 3-5 percent. Fox has claimed that he will not accept defeat
with a margin of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, he might be more flexible. But a truly close result
would certainly be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake for Mexico's incipient democracy in the next
two months. &QL;

<P>
   HAVANA _ Now that Elian Gonzalez has been reunited with his
father, in keeping with the main aim of the huge protest rallies
orchestrated by Fidel Castro over the past five months, political
life in communist Cuba might be expected to return to a rather dull
normality. Yet that looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for a start, the Jose Marti Anti-Imperialist Platform.
This massive new $2 million concrete stage has high-tech lighting
and sound.
</P>
<P>
   At one end, stylized metal palm trees shade a statue of Cuba's
independence hero, Jose Marti, in his arms a small boy who looks
remarkably like Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Erected outside the United States' Interest Section in Havana,
this structure shows every sign of having been built for permanent
harangues.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. federal agents snatched Elian from his Miami
relations on April 22, Castro declared a ``truce'' with the United
States government _ but only for a day. He has a long list of other
alleged injustices against his revolution in his sights.
</P>
<P>
   His targets include the Helms-Burton law, which tightened the
American embargo against the island, the invasion of United States'
culture and the European countries that last week backed the U.N.
Human Rights Committee's annual condemnation of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just beginning,'' Castro told a rally of tens of
thousands, within hours of the Miami raid. ``There are 160 more
municipalities to rally, and many more issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of those issues is the U.N. vote. Some 100,000 Cubans
were mobilized to march past the Czech Embassy after the
committee's censure shouting ``traitors, lackeys, puppets'' because
Cuba's former socialist ally had co-sponsored the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, the vote also prompted Cuba to cancel a visit
by European Union officials, jeopardizing several years of work
aimed at including the island in the next Lome agreement, a
trade-and-aid pact due to be completed in June between Europe and
more than 70 poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   Daily three-hour television discussion programs have switched
their focus from Elian to the human-rights crimes of ``hypocritical
and racist'' Europeans and Canadians, and character assassinations
of the island's leading dissidents. For several months there has
been a general crackdown on government opponents.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Castro after?
</P>
<P>
   He has long been trying to wrestle America's policy from the
grip of the Cuban-American lobby in Miami, and to persuade the
American authorities that cooperation over illegal immigration and
drugs are in their own interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities were not paying much attention _ until Elian
came along. Appropriately enough, the Miami raid came on the day
that Cuba's president had organized a rally to celebrate the
anniversary, a few days earlier, of his first great triumph over
the Cuban-Americans, at the Bay of Pigs in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was held at the sugar mill Castro had used as his
headquarters when he defeated the invasion, with a tank from that
battle behind him, and a giant poster of Elian in front.
</P>
<P>
   His real victory, he thus implied, is the shift in America's
position: in 1961, the American government had supported the
invading exiles, but this time it was on Cuba's side.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls showing that over half of Americans would like
normal relations with Cuba have been widely publicized.
</P>
<P>
   So why, at this crucial moment, is Castro apparently shooting
himself in the foot by clamping down internally, and picking a
fight with his main trading partners in Europe and Canada?
</P>
<P>
   He himself has played down the possibility of better relations
with the United States in the short term, and has attacked both the
main American presidential candidates as ``unscrupulous'' in their
support of Elian's relations in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And some Cuba-watchers have long argued that Castro does not in
fact want the American trade embargo lifted, preferring to have a
convenient bogeyman.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he might have threatened to end cooperation with the
United States over immigration, something he has avoided.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely hypothesis is that Castro believes that the United
States may soon relax the embargo. That would create new threats to
his regime's political control.
</P>
<P>
   An influx of American tourists, their dollars and their culture
would further strain the ``revolutionary values'' of Cuba's young
people. After all, Europeans who want Cuba to sign the Lome Accord
argue that it will provide a forum to press for human rights and
political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Castro does not want that pressure. Instead, officials stress a
desire for closer bilateral relations with European countries,
where, usually, no strings are attached.
</P>
<P>
   Castro probably hopes that his victory over Elian will lead in
time to a relaxation of American policy. But he is not going to
give an inch in return. Just watch that Jose Marti platform. &QL;

   DELHI _ The death of distance is throwing up a lot of new
opportunities for India. Indians are animating movies and
transcribing foreigners' medical records without consumers in the
West being any the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural distance, however, is a bit harder to kill, especially
when company and customer are talking to each other on the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happens at call centers, where agents handle
everything from late credit-card payments to complaints about
software.
</P>
<P>
   Indian entrepreneurs, who can draw on a large pool of
English-speaking labor at much lower than western wages, have
spotted an opportunity here, too. ``I hear of a new (call center)
starting every second week,'' says an executive at one of the
better-established firms.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing seamless connections to customers in Britain or the
United States takes more than telephonic engineering. Putting
customers at their ease means talking like them and, if possible
for a few hours a day, thinking like them.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, you'll be hearing from Barbara (not Bhavana), even

baseball may surprise you.

   Ravi Sikund, who has spent most of his career representing Owens
Corning and other firms in India, thinks there is money to be made
from training Indians to talk like Britons or Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He has started what is probably India's first school for
aspiring call-center agents, the Call Center College in Noida,
which opens its doors in May.
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning call-center business is recruiting English
speakers at monthly salaries of 8,000-10,000 rupees ($180-230).
</P>
<P>
   Sikund reckons that there are plenty of people, especially
housewives and recent college graduates, who will pay 3,300 rupees
for a 240-hour course that will give them an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sikund learned all he knows about call centers from a
school in London (which licensed him its name as well), he offers
something the British institute does not: entry-level training.
</P>
<P>
   That includes teaching technical skills, such as how to
``co-browse'' Web pages with a customer, but also ``soft skills,''
like how to speak English in a way that foreigners can understand.
</P>
<P>
   Sikund has developed ``culture capsules'' to familiarize his
students with foreign ways. They will learn that Rhode Island is
called ``little Rhodey,'' and that George Washington's wife was
born Martha Dandridge Custis.
</P>
<P>
   It may not matter that these trivia are too abstruse for the
typical chat between a help desk and a perplexed software user.
</P>
<P>
   The call-center executive says he plans to recruit at Sikund's
school. That is not because he expects the students to learn much.
Rather, he is hoping that Sikund will do much of his screening for
him, mainly by rejecting candidates whose English is not up to
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Other skills, soft and hard, can be taught on the job. If so,
Sikund's success may depend on how many would-be Barbaras he turns
away. &QL;

<P>
   BARBADOS _ On Good Friday, on Tobago's most popular beach, a
41-year-old man got into an argument with a security guard about
access to a private beach. He was shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a painful illustration of the political difficulties that
are aggravating the Caribbean tourism industry's many problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean's 33 island nations may have the world's most
beautiful beaches, but they do not have the world's most thriving
tourism business.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, the most important kind of Caribbean tourists, are
finding other places to go. Domestic destinations such as Las
Vegas, Hawaii and Florida are top of the list, and abroad, they are
looking to places other than the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   American trips to the Caribbean grew by 1.8 percent a year in
1994-98, those to Europe grew by 7.8 percent a year and those to
other destinations grew by 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, highly prized since they tend to stay longer, spend
more and arrive in bigger parties, are being tempted to new
destinations such as Dubai, which benefits from the world's first
six-star hotel, and a clever marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean is bottom of the tourism growth league at the
moment. Local attitudes to tourism lie behind some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams, Trinidad and Tobago's independence leader, once
said he would rather have ``black oil than white tourists'' and
even though not enough of the black stuff turned up to keep the
region afloat, the attitude persists. Many people see tourism as
``a rather grubby business,'' says Ian Court, a local businessman
and the former British Consul in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of private beaches that led to the Good Friday killing
is troubling many governments. Because of high levels of crime and
harassment on many islands, hotels tend to herd their guests on to
private beaches in ``all-inclusive'' hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean's coastline is therefore fast being enclosed, and
locals don't like it. Barbados is considering a constitutional
amendment to protect public access to beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, everything below the high-water mark is public
property. But many beaches can be reached only by crossing private
land, and tariffs are often high. In Jamaica, for instance, many
hotels charge around $50 for the privilege, and exclusive
``all-inclusive'' places charge up to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Local hostility to hotel groups makes it harder for governments
to work at developing tourism. Their failure to do so, the industry
complains, is constraining growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean is not, for instance, marketing itself as well as
the competition. Hawaii, with six islands but one government,
benefits from a coordinated public-relations effort, while the
Caribbean islands' governments bicker.
</P>
<P>
   Some governments argue that building a common brand identity
threatens to detract from their island's individuality, a view that
exasperates Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean Tourism
Organization, the local trade body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a European public-relations campaign to sell
Britain _ people know where it is. That is not true of many of our
islands and most cannot afford to market themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean's last coordinated marketing drive, the 1992
``Beach Boys'' campaign, he says, reversed a six-year decline in
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel groups, as a result, run their own international marketing
campaigns. Some have been highly successful. In the early 1980s,
when a crime wave threatened to wipe out Jamaica's tourist
industry, it was rescued by Sandals, a locally-owned chain, which
marketed its all-inclusive hotels as a safe way to visit the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel operators might not mind spending money on marketing so
much if the Caribbean were otherwise a cheap and easy place to
build and run hotels. It isn't.
</P>
<P>
   In America, cement costs $70 a cubic yard. On the Cayman
Islands, import taxes push the price up to $200.
</P>
<P>
   With taxes and transport costs, local building costs are 15-30
percent higher than in America. As a result, two big projects in
the Bahamas imported fully-fitted rooms from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Ward, head of Caribbean and South American development at
Marriott International, one of the biggest hotel managers in the
region, also points to the burden of employment laws that force
hotel companies to keep on staff out of season and to import taxes
on fixtures and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Airport facilities are old-fashioned in the region. American
Airlines is often the only American carrier to many islands and
tends to cut unprofitable routes with little warning.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless's monopoly makes telephone costs staggeringly
high. Even electricity can still prove unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   A conference in April in Barbados to discuss the region's
tourism problems was hit by a power cut _ though locals point out
this was such a rarity it was front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes and harassment add to the hassles. The Dutch side of
St. Maarten has still not recovered from Hurricane Luis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 survey in Barbados, 88 percent of tourists said they
had been bothered by souvenir-salesmen, more than half of tourists
said they had been offered drugs, and a quarter said they had been
sexually harassed.
</P>
<P>
   The consequence of these cumulative problems is that Puerto
Rico, the Caribbean's best-marketed island, has just 9,000 hotel
rooms, compared with 80,000 in Hawaii, a place of similar size.
Barbados has no branded hotel chains now in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Local hotel groups have trouble filling the gap, because they
cannot get ready access to capital. The risks are too high for the
banks, while the returns are too low for venture capitalists, and
the tiny size and illiquidity of single island stock markets makes
it difficult for them to cash out again.
</P>
<P>
   For locals looking for jobs, it is a shame that the region's
tourism is not developing faster. But then if it was, even more of
their beaches would be fenced off. &QL;

   GAZIANTEP, TURKEY _ A coral-pink prawn, a frolicking dolphin.
With each gentle prod of the pick, another brilliantly colored sea
creature springs from the earth to reveal an elaborate mosaic floor
featuring Oceanus, a mythological god of the seas.
</P>
<P>
   The mosaic lies within the atrium of a lavish villa in Zeugma, a
strategic port city of the classical period that was built on a
terraced hillside overlooking the Euphrates River.
</P>
<P>
   With a bit of luck, and much painstaking work, the small clutch
of archaeologists that is working on the site will soon lift the
panel and remove it to the museum in the southern city of
Gaziantep.
</P>
<P>
   But countless other treasures _ some recorded, others still
awaiting discovery _ will be buried under the waters of the
Euphrates when the newly completed Birecik Dam, just 500 meters
(1,650 feet) downstream, starts filling up on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   At least 82 other sites, some dating as far back as the
Paleolithic period, will also be engulfed. So, too, will nine
villages, displacing thousands of local inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists who have studied Zeugma believe that the size and
richness of the site make it unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about to witness a great tragedy,'' says Catherine
Abadie Reynal, a French archaeologist who has been digging there
since 1996. ``A second Ephesus is about to be lost. And no one
seems to have lifted a finger to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Reynal and her fellow archaeologist, Daniel Frascone, are
speaking, Hakki Alhan, director of the Gaziantep Museum, is
furiously working the telephones to secure official permission for
the pair to join the Turkish excavation team for a last-minute
effort at salvaging what they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their papers are in order, the foreign ministry has them, our
(culture) ministry has them, but the security directorate in Ankara
says they don't,'' Alhan explains, throwing his hands up in
despair.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the French team was given 15 days to work in
Zeugma; five have gone already.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is an example of the sort of bureaucratic inertia
which has allowed so many of Turkey's historical riches to
disappear, including the remains of Samosata, the glorious regional
capital of the Roman kings, which was submerged in the early 1990s
under another Euphrates dam, the Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Ankara, Guzen Koksal, a culture-ministry official,
insists that the ``real problem'' is not red tape and negligence,
but a shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me why,'' she said. ``But our budget is shrinking
all the time, and nobody ever consults us before they decide to
build dams.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry's share of the national budget has been reduced
this year to an all-time low of 0.02 percent. ``We can barely
afford to pay our employees let alone finance excavations,'' said
Koksal. ``We are helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeugma has attracted little international attention over the
years; few Turks, let alone foreigners, are even aware that it
exists. The only recent Turkish reference to its imminent demise
appeared last month on the back article of a little-read Islamic
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet western scholars have known for more than two centuries that
Zeugma was built by Seleucus I (358-280 B.C.), one of Alexander the
Great's successors, as the site of a crucial bridge linking
Anatolia and Mesopotamia on the silk route to China.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT XXX) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   To secure the bridge, he also founded another city on the
river's opposite bank, naming it Apamea after his Persian queen.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Zeugma (a Greek word for ``bridge'') was taken over by
the Romans and turned into an opulent fortress city that housed
5,000 soldiers and stretched across an expanse twice the size of
Roman London and three-and-a-half times that of Pompeii. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, looters began removing Zeugma's mosaics,
some of which are now to be found in museums in Berlin and St.
Petersburg. Ironically, it was not until 1992, when a local peasant
discovered a looter's tunnel leading to the remains of a Roman
villa, that the Turkish authorities were alerted to the
significance of the site.
</P>
<P>
   The splendor of the mosaic floor depicting the ``Wedding of
Dionysus and Ariadne,'' which was stolen six years later,
galvanized the Gaziantep Museum into action. Three more villas were
uncovered when the first official excavations were begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around that time that we heard the dam would be
built,'' recalls Rifat Ergec, a former director of the Gaziantep
Museum and an archaeologist who has worked at Zeugma. ``We were
horrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls for additional funds to speed up and broaden the
excavations, it was not until 1996, when the dam began to be built,
that the culture ministry launched an international appeal to help
save Zeugma's treasures. Reynal was among the first to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, more than 15 mosaic panels have been
rescued, together with scores of bronze figurines, tens of
thousands of clay seals and other artefacts now on display at
Gaziantep.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new treasures still being uncovered is a voluptuous
ivory statuette of Aphrodite. ``The big question now,'' says Ergec,
``is whether the tragedy will be repeated.'' He is referring to
Hasankeyf, a medieval town straddling the Tigris River.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a citadel and some troglodyte dwellings,
much of the site, including the remains of a stone bridge that once
linked the two parts of the town, is set to vanish once a proposed
dam four times the size of Birecik is built there by a British-led
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Zeugma, Hasankeyf has elicited a flood of international
sympathy, in part because it lies within the Kurdish heartlands. A
widely publicized campaign mounted by Kurdish activists and British
environmentalists, and expediently embraced by a group of British
Conservative MPs, is already causing a stir.
</P>
<P>
   The Labour government recently indicated that British export
credits for the multibillion pound project would not be released
unless the Turkish government first submitted ``a detailed plan to
preserve as much of the architectural heritage of Hasankeyf as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cansen Akkaya, a senior Turkish official linked to the project,
says: ``We fully accept that condition. Preserving what we can of
Hasankeyf has become a matter of our national pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is not true of Zeugma. &QL;

&HT;     NISSAN RACES AHEAD OF SUV COMPETITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good luck finding one.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can, and the dealer isn't adding several thousand
dollars to the sticker as some California dealers have, then you
might find that the all-new Nissan Xterra sport-utility vehicle is
a real bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced last spring, the Xterra is about to enter its second
year of production, and sales continue to be brisk _ beyond plant
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   I know that the Xterra's affordable price is driving the
majority of sales, but there is more to this new SUV.
</P>
<P>
   And for Nissan dealers, the Xterra is a godsend. Beleaguered
dealers have seen their sales slide for the past several years as
Nissan fell on hard times and failed to roll out interesting new
vehicles. Now, though, they are having to take orders for the
Xterra and explain to customers that they must wait their turn to
get one.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like just yesterday that Nissan dealers were having a
hard time getting anyone into their showrooms, even though there
was a good (if not great) lineup of vehicles to choose from. That
has changed too, as Nissan has introduced a variety of outstanding
new vehicles in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Many prospective customers who don't buy the SUV are turning to
the other new products, including the excellent Maxima and Altima
sedans, the Frontier Crew Cab pickup and, now arriving, the 2001
Pathfinder sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't afford a Pathfinder or one of its
competitors, such as the Toyota 4Runner and Ford Explorer, the
Xterra is a great choice, with prices under $18,000 for a basic
two-wheel-drive model.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the chassis of the Frontier compact pickup, the Xterra
combines the roominess of a midsize sport-utility with the prices
you would pay for one of those little toys, such as the Toyota RAV4
or Honda CRV.
</P>
<P>
   And let me tell you from my experience driving these SUVs on-
and off-road that there is no comparison. The four-wheel-drive
Xterra is a true go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle, rugged enough
for California's Rubicon Trail and refined enough to drive to
suburban soccer practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Xterra isn't short on space, either. It is the same length
as the Pathfinder, Explorer and Mitsubishi Montero Sport and longer
than the Jeep Cherokee, Isuzu Rodeo/Honda Passport and Chevrolet
Blazer/GMC Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   And even the stripped-down model really isn't stripped. It's so
well-equipped that many of us could live with it if we didn't need
four-wheel drive for serious off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   The base two-wheel-drive XE model, complete with
air-conditioning, antilock brakes and a nice AM/FM/cassette audio
system, lists for just $17,349 with a 143-horsepower, 2.4-liter
four-cylinder engine (with five-speed manual transmission), or
$18,499 with the same 170-horsepower, 3.3-liter V-6 that comes in
the Pathfinder and Infiniti QX4, Nissan's luxury SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can buy a stripped-down Jeep Cherokee four-door with
four-cylinder engine for about the same price, and a base
four-cylinder Isuzu Rodeo is configured about the same way as the
base Xterra for just over $18,000. But the Cherokee doesn't have
the best reputation for reliability and longevity, and the Rodeo's
price quickly escalates to more than $21,000 when you upgrade to a
V-6 engine. The comparable Xterra V-6 model is nearly $3,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   If you do need four-wheel drive _ and I heartily recommend it if
you plan to have some fun off the beaten track _ prices start at
just $20,499.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry that you're getting something cheap here. This is no
$17,000 Kia Sportage. It's a Nissan, and it is built tough and
solid. Its muscular styling turns heads everywhere it goes, and it
comes with a variety of options that let consumers tailor it to a
lot of different needs, such as carrying mountain bikes, ski
equipment or kayaks. It even has a first-aid kit built into the
rear door.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you doll one of these up with lots of extras, it's a
bargain when compared with a similarly priced Explorer or
Pathfinder. The completely loaded two-wheel-drive model, the SE,
lists for just $23,549 with automatic transmission, and the same
vehicle in four-wheel drive is priced at $25,549. You would pay
more than $30,000 for the Explorer, Pathfinder, 4Runner and others
in this class.
</P>
<P>
   We tested one of the high-end models, the SE-V6 four-wheel-drive
version (base price $25,549 plus $520 transportation), and it came
with only one option, floor mats for $79. Total sticker was a very
reasonable $26,148 (including transportation).
</P>
<P>
   But nothing was lacking. Ours came with the V-6 engine,
four-speed automatic transmission, four-wheel antilock brakes,
air-conditioning, power steering/windows/mirrors/door locks,
limited-slip differential, four-wheel drive with automatic locking
front hubs, tubular roof rack with removable gear basket, flip-up
sun roof, premium AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo with six
speakers, cruise control, leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel, and
lots more.
</P>
<P>
   You will appreciate the way Nissan has configured all of the
Xterras for rugged use. Every model _ even the two-wheel-drives _
has underbody skid plates to protect the transmission, oil pan and
fuel tank. The two-wheel-drive models have even higher ground
clearance than the four-by-fours _ well over nine inches in the
uplevel SE model and 8.7 inches in the base version.
</P>
<P>
   Why call it Xterra? The name was chosen to ``reinforce the
connection to Earth (terrain) and the adventurous lifestyle of its
target buyers,'' Nissan says.
</P>
<P>
   The Xterra is aimed at people with active lifestyles. Those of
you with kids who play soccer and such will like the ample cargo
space. The cargo area behind the rear seat holds more than that of
most of the competition, and among the options are mountain-bike
racks for inside the car and the roof rack that came on our test
vehicle, complete with a special removable basket that holds up to
30 pounds of wet or dirty gear under a protective net.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, there are bucket seats with a center console, complete
with functional cup holders. The rear seat is stadium style, which
means it rises above the front seats so rear passengers have a
clear view ahead. The overall design and interior seating
arrangement are similar to those of the $38,000-plus Land Rover
Discovery II.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-6 model with automatic
transmission are 15 mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway. The
tank holds 19.4 gallons of gasoline.

   ``Four real doors. No real competition.''
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen that statement on billboards advertising
Nissan's new Frontier Crew-Cab pickup.
</P>
<P>
   And for a while, the statement was true.
</P>
<P>
   But in the auto world, like many other highly competitive
industries, exclusivity can be a fleeting thing.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan introduced the Frontier Crew-Cab at the Los Angeles Auto
Show in January 1999, and the truck went on sale in late spring '99
as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first compact pickup to offer a real bench seat in
the rear, with normal-size doors for the rear-seat passengers to
use _ one on each side of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the best we had seen from the compact segment were
the three-door models that most brands have been offering the past
three or four years. But the third door offered on some of the
extended-cab compacts is narrower than a real door, and opens to
the rear, like the suicide doors on older Lincoln Continentals.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had Nissan rolled out the Frontier Crew-Cab, and
paid for a zillion of those billboards, than DaimlerChrysler
introduced the Dakota Quad Cab, its own version of the compact
pickup with four _ count 'em, four _ real doors. The Dakota Quad
Cab went on sale in December as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be left behind in the Frontier and Dakota's dust,
Chevrolet and GMC Trucks introduced their new crew-cab compact
pickups, the S-10 and Sonoma, respectively, at the Chicago Auto
Show in February. These two new trucks will go on sale late this
year as 2001 models, and they will have four real doors, too.
</P>
<P>
   For now, consumers who want a big back seat and four regular
doors in a compact pickup must choose between the Dakota and the
Frontier, and it is a tough choice to make. Both are outstanding
products, and both have their own lists of attributes.
</P>
<P>
   What they have in common is a real back seat, with normal doors
that allow for easy entry and exit.
</P>
<P>
   In some pickups, adding the little third door meant you lost one
of the tiny jump seats in the extended area of the cab, because
those jump seats fold down from the side of the cab. The door left
no place to put a jump seat.
</P>
<P>
   Many people buy compact pickups because of their low prices and
versatility. It's often cheaper to buy a small pickup than a
compact car, and for a lot of consumers, the compact pickup offered
a chance to buy an affordable new vehicle. First-time car buyers
have flocked to the compact truck just for that reason, and many of
them had no real need for a truly usable back seat _ they were
either single or young married couples with no children.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, of course, that children do come along, and
people who found themselves with a small truck with no room for the
kids had to trade up to a bigger truck or a traditional car,
sport-utility or minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan solved that problem by becoming the first to offer a
compact pickup with a real back seat, large enough even to haul big
kids or adults around (those jump seats in the extended-cab
compacts never were intended for adults).
</P>
<P>
   But if roominess and power are your top priorities, the Dakota
Quad Cab offers the most space and the most horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota's wide-opening rear doors have full roll-down
windows, and the seating area offers more shoulder and hip room
than the Frontier or the new Chevy/GMC models.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dakota is offered with the broadest range of engine
choices in its class. They include the standard 3.9-liter V-6
Magnum with 175 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque, and two
optional V-8 engines. The 4.7-liter Magnum V-8 is rated at 235
horsepower and 285 foot-pounds of torque. For even more power, a
5.9-liter Magnum V-8 has 245 horsepower and a whopping 335
foot-pounds of torque. This is the most powerful engine in the
compact class.
</P>
<P>
   Some people claim that the Dakota really is in a class by
itself, too large to be a compact and too small to be considered
full-size. Some of DaimlerChrysler's own advertising touts that
idea, calling the Dakota a midsize pickup. But the company also
refers to the Dakota as a compact in ads comparing it with the
Frontier and others in the compact segment.
</P>
<P>
   Base price of the four-wheel-drive Dakota Quad Cab is $21,615
(plus $520 transportation), which takes it out of the realm of the
affordable compact, however. We drove one whose sticker topped out
at $28,010, which included the 5.9-liter Magnum V-8. The
two-wheel-drive models start at $18,970 (plus transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the Frontier Crew Cab, which comes only with a
170-horsepower V-6 engine, begin at $17,290 (plus $520
transportation) for the two-wheel-drive model and $19,890 (plus
transportation) for the four-wheel-drive version.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota Quad Cab comes in two-wheel drive or a choice of
part-time or full-time four-wheel-drive models. Dakota's full-time
four-wheel drive system delivers power to all four wheels for
maximum traction in dry or wet conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we built the Dakota Quad Cab, we were already working
with the underpinnings of a best-in-class compact truck,'' said
John Felice, vice president for truck-platform engineering at
DaimlerChrysler. ``But because Quad Cab will appeal to a wider
range of buyers than conventional trucks, including many first-time
truck buyers, we wanted to make sure it had the performance and
features they're accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck holds five full-size adults in relative comfort, and
those in the back seat can sit there for an extended trip without
cramping up, DaimlerChrysler says.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantage is the decreased maneuverability of the Dakota
Quad Cab when compared with the smaller Frontier, S-10 and Sonoma.
The Frontier is 193.1 inches long vs. 214.8 inches for the Dakota.
The Frontier also benefits from the established, outstanding
durability of Nissan's line of compact pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, little separates the fuel-economy ratings of the
5.9-liter V-8 Dakota Quad Cab and the V-6 Frontier Crew Cab. The
Dakota is rated at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway,
while the Frontier is just marginally better at 15 mpg in the city
and 19 on the highway for the four-wheel-drive models.
</P>
<P>
   All Frontier Crew-Cabs are built on the heavy-duty four-wheel
drive Frontier chassis, giving the two-wheel drive versions the
same structural rigidity, ride height and ground clearance as the
four-wheel-drives. The bed is about 18 inches shorter than the
standard Frontier bed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Frontier Crew-Cab combines the comfort and
convenience of a pickup, with many qualities of a sedan. It offers
more rear passenger room than any extra-cab compact truck.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dakota and Frontier allow for the installation of a
child safety seat in the rear passenger area, something lacking in
today's extended-cab compact trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Frontier, no V-8 engine will be offered in the Sonoma
or S-10 crew cab. Both will be powered by General Motors' 4.3-liter
Vortec V-6 engine, cranking out 190 horsepower and 250 foot-pounds
of torque.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the Dakota and Frontier, the S-10 and Sonoma crew
cabs will be offered only with four-wheel drive. They will be
equipped with the GM Insta-Trac system, which besides its handy
push-button actuation includes low-range gearing for climbing or
descending steep grades or driving through deep snow or mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chevy S-10 Crew Cab pickup complements and enables
virtually any active lifestyle,'' said Debra Kelly-Ennis, GM's S-10
pickup brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike most full-size crew-cab pickups, the new compact crew
cabs are designed to fit easily into the average residential
garage.

 &HT;    CHINA INVITES RIGHTS ACTIVIST IN TO DISCUSS POLITICAL PRISONERS
 &HT;    (600&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By JULIE CHAO 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Just a few weeks before Congress is to vote on
permanent normal trade relations with China, Beijing has for the
first time invited an American non-profit organization for a visit
to discuss the plight of political prisoners in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although it suspended official dialogue with the United States
on human rights last year after the bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia, in late March China quietly resumed responding to
the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation's requests for
information on prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Executive director John Kamm has made more than 50 visits to
Beijing over the past 10 years to ask officials about prisoners of
conscience, but for the first time, he said, China has given him a
formal invitation to do so. An April 29 fax from the Ministry of
Justice invited him to Beijing May 18-20 for an ``exchange of
views.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about it,'' Kamm said in a telephone
interview from Washington, D.C., where he is to testify Wednesday
before the House Ways and Means Committee urging the normalization
of trade ties with China. ``In some respects it's something I've
been waiting 10 years for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said Chinese also confirmed in the letter that two
laborers, Chen Gang and Zhang Jingsheng, who took part in
pro-democracy demonstrations 11 years ago are in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He said the explained their prison terms and said when both are
due to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Justice letter was the first direct comment from
the government on the two men's cases since they were jailed _
along with many others _ for demonstrations centered on Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said the letter explained that Chen and Zhang were arrested
in separate incidents in southern Hunan province in 1989 and that
both men are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Kamm, a businessman who lived in Hong Kong for 23
years before moving to San Francisco, has used a
non-confrontational approach to ask the Ministry of Justice for
information on hundreds of political prisoners, then sought to meet
with officials in Beijing. Sometimes he was rebuffed. Other times,
they responded with detailed accounting of a prisoners' status.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with grants from the Smith Richardson Foundation and
the International Republican Institute, Kamm created the Dui Hua
Foundation, which means ``dialogue'' in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Other human rights groups praised Kamm's work but suggested that
Beijing's timing, so close to the controversial trade vote in
Congress _ a major hurdle to membership in the World Trade
Organization _ made its motives suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think John would be the first to say that this is certainly
connected to the fact that he has good relations with members of
Congress, and this is likely to be seen positively over there,''
said Sophia Woodman, a Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Human
Rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Although she thought Kamm's trip would be a positive step, she
said it was more important for the Chinese government to have a
dialogue with human rights activists in its own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they raise their voices and ask to engage with the
government in a peaceful manner, what happens is they get
arrested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm, who was a vice president at Occidental Chemical Co. in
Hong Kong and now does consulting in industrial raw materials, said
the annual debate over trade with China is not an effective tool to
influence China's human rights situation. He said they view the
debate merely as an irritant and, although Congress threatens to
revoke its trade privileges every year, China has grown confident
that it won't lose them.
</P>
<P>
   Kamm said he knows China's communist government may be willing
to make some concessions for PNTR but said the United States can
use that to its own benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a developing country, a poor country. They're always
going to want something,'' he said. ``We need to figure out how can
we use that to prompt them in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his upcoming visit, Kamm intends to submit a new list of 51
prisoners. To come up with the names, Kamm, along with three
researchers in Hong Kong, combs through libraries, bookstores and
other publicly available sources. They focus on four crimes:
endangering the social order; endangering state security; revealing
state secrets and counterrevolution; which was abolished in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the last eight months, Kamm said he had uncovered about 1000
names, more than three-quarters of which were previously unknown by
anyone outside China. Prisoners include labor and democracy
activists, as well as Christian evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told Kamm at the end of 1997 that China has more than
1,900 prisoners convicted of counter-revolution. He estimated less
than one-fifth are known to foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's considered mundane and often denigrated, what I do, the
prisoner list business,'' said Kamm.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the lists have had an effect. Of 100 names he
submitted in 1995, he has received information on 47. Of those, 31
were in prison at the time, but 17 have since been released on
parole or had their sentence reduced.

&HT;     YOUNG VISITS 49ERS CAMP, BUT QB'S FUTURE STILL MURKY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Never mind the lack of a formal
invitation. Steve Young was a surprise visitor at last weekend's
San Francisco 49ers minicamp, making it clear that he still sees
himself as very much a part of this team, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Players had been on the field for an hour and 10 minutes Sunday
when Young, wearing gray sweatpants and a wrinkled T-shirt,
strolled out of the locker room gripping a football in his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers quarterback didn't actually take part in practice, but
greeted teammates, the few he recognized, and visited with coaches
on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here 15 years ago Eddie hugged me and said `You're
home,'' Young said, referring to former owner Edward DeBartolo. ``I
have felt that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's visit did little to clear up his status with the team.
He said he met with general manager Bill Walsh on Thursday and was
to have talked with coach Steve Mariucci later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, hasn't played since Sept. 27, when he incurred his
fourth concussion in three years during a game against the Arizona
Cardinals. Walsh has made it clear the team is prepared to move on
without Young, and the quarterback was not asked to join the 106
players at the three-day minicamp that ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to stop me?'' Young said of his surprise visit.
Not Walsh, who wasn't at the team's practice facility Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh hasn't ruled out Young's returning, but has repeatedly
hinted that _ with difficult salary cap issues as well as the need
to rebuild the faltering team _ life would be simpler without Young
and 37-year-old Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Bill has postured a lot in the spring, without any
input from me,'' Young said, adding, ``I probably made a mistake in
not conversing with him earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said last week's meeting was productive and
marked the beginning of a serious dialogue on his football future.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have is a sense we're going to be able to talk it
out,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Walsh had expressed concern about his two aging
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill doesn't want to have Jerry and I flopping around the last
few years of our careers,'' he said, noting Walsh had referred to a
number of players in other sports who ``played too long and their
careers idled or fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he agreed. ``That's an important part of it. That's
something I'd have to answer with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Young also said he shared Walsh's concern about his health but
that medical tests show he has recovered from his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With so many new faces on the team, Young said he didn't
recognize many of the younger players. But he did spot a few
familiar faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The group of guys you recognize are the (offensive) linemen,''
he said. ``We've played together before and we're all friends.``
</P>
<P>
   He declined to criticize the 49ers recent draft, which
essentially ignored the team's needs along that aging line _ a unit
critical to Young's well-being should he return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft needed to go that way,'' he said, referring to the
need for immediate help on the defensive side.
</P>
<P>
   Without much coaxing, Young was able to see a place for himself
on this young team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is in a different place,'' he said. ``It needs
leadership. This team is devoid of leadership, save a couple guys.
... One scenario has Jerry and I finishing our careers and showing
leadership and sharing with a boatload of players, if not more,
what the 49er mystique was all about, helping bridge the past and
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who played in 11 postseasons with the 49ers and led them
to one Super Bowl championship, was asked how he'd feel about
playing for a team that probably will fall well short of those
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those philosophical questions are some of the things
I'll be brooding on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for repeated rumors he would go to the Denver Broncos or
become a television commentator on Monday Night Football, Young
laughed without commenting specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I catch wind of it every once in a while,'' he said of the
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Young is clear on one issue: he still relishes the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juices flow,'' he said. ``It's a complex issue, being
older and the team is in a place it hasn't been before.''

ANIL'S GHOST 
By Michael Ondaatje. Knopf. 
311 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Ondaatje's fierce and tragic vision is made bearable,
even transcendent, by his suppleness of form. He is a choreographer
of images, finding within the darkening plain of history a forest
of infinite possibility _ evidence of dreams turned into anguish,
of innocence tarnished into action. Heir-unapparent to Faulkner and
Garcia Marquez, he delivers stories that often seem like collisions
in time and space _ four strangers in an abandoned, war-torn villa;
an Englishman alone in the desert, clutching Herodotus to keep him
warm. What gives Ondaatje's writing (four novels and 11 books of
poetry) its particular weight and magic is the labyrinthine
consciousness at its center. This is a man beholden to the Greeks
but partial to American Westerns; he has written with equal agility
about jazz, Billy the Kid, a bomb-disposal squad in World War II.
In ``Anil's Ghost,'' he returns for the first time in his fiction
to his birthplace of Sri Lanka, and the resulting novel feels as
specifically wrenching as it is both mythic and doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Ondaatje was a boy when he left Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon)
for England, and then Canada. He wrote about his verdant, chaotic
homeland in a 1982 memoir, ``Running in the Family''; the work is
so steeped in geographically lush surrealism that it partly
explains Ondaatje's affinity with the South American magical
realists. ``Anil's Ghost'' has about it a similarly fecund mystique
from the moment its namesake and protagonist, Anil Tissera, lands
in the predawn heat of the airport near Colombo. Having left Sri
Lanka when she was 15, Anil is now a Western-trained forensic
anthropologist, returning as part of a human-rights commission to
investigate murders on the island: rumors of missing citizens and
mass graves. It is the late 1980s, when Sri Lanka's civil war was
dictated by three distinctly unpredictable forces: the insurgents
in the south, the separatist guerrillas in the north, and a
government who detached purported death squads _ sanctioned and
illegal both _ to hunt down its detractors.
</P>
<P>
   But if politics are always the present-tense manifestation of a
moral universe, archeology holds the summary truth about its past,
and it is here that the great, dark core of ``Anil's Ghost'' lies.
Ondaatje wisely sketches the outlines of Sri Lanka's civil strife,
then moves quickly to the heart of the matter: the young men who
disappear from schoolyards, the grieving families who cannot bury
their all-but-certainly dead, the hideous warnings for the living _
murdered victims' heads on stakes _ to stop their inquiries about
lost relatives. Anil is slotted to work with a state-sponsored
archeologist, Sarath Diyasena, but she doesn't know if she can
trust him. For Anil, the truth is permanently recorded in the
bullet wounds and broken bones of the skeletons she examines,
``same for Colombo as for Troy.'' Older and wiser, balancing on the
sharp rocks of survival, Sarath fears that Anil's blessed truth is
but ``a flame against a sleeping lake of petrol.'' They are both
right, the idealist poised against the fallen hero, with the
ensuing tension between them providing the pivotal nexus for their
shared journey into the past.
</P>
<P>
   The not-too-distant past, as it turns out. Studying the
skeletons from a government-guarded burial site, Anil discovers the
remains of what seems to be a recent victim of murder; if she can
determine his identity, she believes, she will have some palpable
proof of the state's culpability. This is the outline of action for
``Anil's Ghost,'' which barely hints at the tributaries, moral as
well as geographical, that Anil and Sarath will have to travel. And
if ``Sailor,'' as they call their nameless skeleton, is the first
ghost of the novel's title, both Anil and Sarath have others to
contend with _ old lovers and broken pacts and, always, the dead
and legacies of the dead that surround them. Ondaatje's characters
tend to be both besieged by the past and in awe of it; their most
intense relationships belong either to memory or to a platonic,
nonromantic present. Burdened by yesterday, they rarely move
unfettered through the world; instead, they stagger beneath the
weight of history and then, for a moment, try to dance under its
waning light.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this small patch of understanding (an ironic spin
on ``The truth shall make you free'') is a mythic place outside of
time, much like the realm inhabited by the four lost souls of
Ondaatje's last novel, ``The English Patient.'' Here it's an
abandoned monastery in the forest where Sarath's old teacher has
gone to die: the ``grove of ascetics'' where only the rocks and the
memories they hold can stand up against the eternal facts of death.
Counseled against graven images by the old man, Sarath and Anil
find their clues and half-truths through the maps and symbols
wrought upon the natural world, and ``Anil's Ghost'' is full of
them _ pietas of mother and child, brother and brother, a woman's
shoulder stilled by grief. And staying awake for the impact _
whether of a bomb or of a work of art _ may be the only common
denominator. ``The important thing,'' says one crisis connoisseur,
``is to be able to live in a place or situation where you must use
your sixth sense all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vastly sensual, ``Anil's Ghost'' is nonetheless an unsettling
novel. Like its predecessors, it offers imagery of terrible beauty
_ a corpse with hands frozen in a position of prayer _ and depths
of such gravitas that it is difficult to argue with anything about
it. And yet there's something oddly evasive about the entire story.
One of its rich corridors of detail is the description of the
ancient ritual of eye-painting in Sri Lanka, where an honored
artisan must paint the eyes of the Buddha image only by viewing it
through a mirror _ no human can look upon the Buddha directly while
it is being given life. Ondaatje's vision, too, feels rendered here
as a devout but sidelong glance. Meeting Anil at the airport, an
official comments on her coming home after 15 years: ``The return
of the prodigal.'' Half-awake, she snaps back at him, ``I'm not a
prodigal.'' Neither is her creator, we are immediately reminded,
and that resolute distance may be what Ondaatje needed to approach
his homeland at all. In any event, it has given him a novel of
exquisite refractions and angles: gorgeous but circumspect, trying
to capture the essential truth by always looking first to its
reflection.

VIETNAM ADOPTEES REVEL IN THEIR COMMON BOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ One by one, they took the microphone, just to tell
everyone their names and hometowns. And one by one, they found
themselves choking on their words, or fighting back tears, or
recounting their stories.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time most of the young men and women assembled
at a church in downtown Baltimore Saturday had ever been with so
many of their own _ fellow adoptees who had been flown out of
Vietnam during Operation Babylift 25 years ago _ and, for most, the
experience was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, maybe for the first time, I really feel like I really
fit in,'' said Tia Keevil, 28, who was 3 1/2 when she left an
orphanage in Saigon for a new life as Charles and Hannah Teevil's
daughter in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came because I was curious, to be honest,'' agreed
Jamie Dooley, 25, of Tewksbury, Mass. ``But I discovered all these
people who I have a common bond with, who have a story similar to
mine. . . .It's a first for me, definitely; it's a feeling of
connection that's different from any I've had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Keevil, Dooley, and about 100 other 20-somethings came to
Baltimore from all over the country for a weekend billed as ``The
Reunion of the First Generation of Vietnamese Adoptees.'' Also
attending were dozens of the adoptees' parents, officials from the
orphanages and adoption agencies that dealt with them as babies in
Vietnam and the United States, and military personnel, nurses, and
others involved in the airlift _ most of whom also were seeing each
other for the first time in a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers put together a formal program, with sentimental
presentations and evocative ceremonies including a visit to the
Vietnam War Memorial in Washington. It was less a sense of history
than the simple act of interacting with other people who innately
understood them, however, that the adoptees generally cited as
having had the most profound effect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some participants who have visited their homeland, or
even found their birth mothers, said that coming together with so
many other Vietnamese refugees was at least as powerful an
experience. At the same time, like a growing number of adoptees of
all nationalities in the United States, the ones here said that
greater openness and fewer stigmas about adoption today _ as
evidenced by the celebratory nature of the reunion _ made them want
to know even more about their native culture and their biological
families.
</P>
<P>
   Kara Delahunt, for example, was among a dozen Vietnamese
babylift orphans who returned to Vietnam this month for the first
time. Her parents, US Representative William Delahunt of Quincy,
Mass. and his former wife, Kati, had long urged her to reconnect
with her roots, but their daughter wasn't sure she wanted to do
much more than see Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotionally turbulent visit to such sites as the
hospital where she was born and the orphanage in which she lived
the first 4 1/2 months of her life, and then getting the
unlikeliest infusion of support this weekend in Baltimore,
Delahunt, 25, quietly yearned for more. ``I will do a search for my
biological parents,'' she said. Asked to compare her two-week trip
to Vietnam with the hours she'd spent with her fellow adoptees, she
added, ``In a way, it is more overwhelming to be here. . . . It's
such an important time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese adoptees' reunion was organized by
Pennsylvania-based Tressler Adoption Services, Holt International
Children's Services of Eugene, Ore., and the Evan B. Donaldson
Adoption Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion for this weekend's activities was the 25th
anniversary of one of the most heartening and heartbreaking aspects
of the US departure from Vietnam: Operation Babylift, in which
about 2,000 orphans were flown out of Saigon; approximately 90 of
them, along with about 50 adults, died when their transport plane
crashed in a rice paddy soon after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Aune, who was the medical crew director on that flight
and was among 178 survivors, recalled the moments after the C-130
transport went down. Aune said she was too busy rescuing screaming
babies to even think about what was happening at the time, and she
said that she had often recounted the episode with the same sense
of detachment.
</P>
<P>
   Then she walked into a reception at the Lutheran Center across
the street from Baltimore's Inner Harbor. There, milling around,
she said, were many adult adoptees _ some Vietnamese, others the
mixed-race offspring of black or white American soldiers who had
long since gone home to other other families and other lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started to cry,'' said Aune. ``I was totally surprised
by that.'' The sight of the adoptees helped her understand, she
said, after the inglorious US exit from Vietnam and all the pain
that preceded it, ``that, for their sake, it was all worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of these adoptees, like their counterparts
from other nations, were adopted by Caucasian couples and grew up
in predominantly white neighborhoods. As a result, most said they
experienced racism growing up and wrestled with identity problems
related not only to their adoptions but also to culture or race.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their most jarring experiences, many said, have come
during trips back to Vietnam. While they agreed that their journeys
had been worthwhile, even transforming for some, they also said
that the Vietnamese sometimes viewed them as odd _ either because
they were of mixed race or because they looked Vietnamese but acted
like foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People looked at me, how should I put this, in an intriguing
way,'' said Joshua Baschnagel, who grew up in Hanover, N.H., and
now lives in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the attendees, whatever their experiences or
desires to reconnect with their pasts, said they viewed their
American families as their ``real'' families. During their
self-introductions in the church, one after the other expressed
love and gratitude to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the adoptive mothers and fathers who traveled
here unanimously said they had taught their children about their
backgrounds and had encouraged them to do their own explorations,
to visit their homeland, and even search for their biological
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a normal, natural fact of life . . . for parents
to want their kids to know who they are and where they come from,''
said Karen Santella of Malden, who came to Baltimore with her
husband, Edward, and son Joshua.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gracing the cover of ``The Bell Jar'' is a fuzzy picture of
Sylvia Plath, a girl in white who looks as though she is about to
disappear into the mists of history. The jacket of ``Girl,
Interrupted'' is more modern, featuring a close-up of a model's
face, cut in half by type and somehow reminiscent of the bare
midriffs so popular among teenage girls today.
</P>
<P>
   These jackets, of course, don't explain why Susanna Kaysen's
``Girl, Interrupted'' is fast replacing Plath's ``The Bell Jar'' as
a must-read for young women in high school and college. But they
offer a compelling metaphor for how _ and why _ the newer book is
finding a place on more and more high school and college reading
lists.
</P>
<P>
   Considered a classic, ``The Bell Jar,'' published in 1963, is
mostly assigned these days in college-level history or American
studies classes as a window on the late '50s, just prior to the
women's movement. ``Girl, Interrupted,'' as contemporary in outlook
as its cover, is capturing a broader niche. It shows up in English,
psychology, and creative writing courses, from a yearlong
psychology seminar at Brandeis University to a memoir-writing class
at Wellesley College to an English class in Newton South High
School's Turnaround program for troubled students.
</P>
<P>
   Many teenagers read the book long before they encounter it in
class, just as a previous generation of young women were drawn to
``The Bell Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both books provide evidence of the struggle to craft an
identity for a young woman in our culture,'' agrees Joe Cunningham,
chairman of the psychology department at Brandeis, who uses ``Girl,
Interrupted'' in a seminar. ``Susanna's experience of not fitting
in may speak to more teenagers today. But they both say something
about the courage to be honest about who you are, even when it
doesn't fit in with how people want you to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can identify with what Susanna is going through,'' says Mia
Medina, 21, a Brandeis senior from Istanbul who is in Cunningham's
seminar. ``Her book is the equivalent of `The Bell Jar,' but for
this day and age.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Bell Jar,'' Plath was rebelling against the strictures
of the '50s, which prohibited her from inviting young men to her
dorm room and required that she wear gloves to afternoon tea in
college. The novel chronicles a young woman (a stand-in for Plath)
as she plunges into mental illness, attempts suicide, and
eventually recovers. As the world knows, Plath went on to become a
brilliant poet, then killed herself at the age of 30 just as her
poems were achieving renown.
</P>
<P>
   Kaysen, the real-life protagonist of ``Girl, Interrupted,'' is a
misfit of the '60s who rebels against her academic parents (her
father was an MIT professor) by flunking out of school. She is
barely 18 when, after a 20-minute interview with a psychiatrist,
she ends up hospitalized at McLean Hospital in Belmont for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't happen nowadays,'' says Ayelet Lipton, 17, a
senior at Newton South High School, adding that she has read
``Girl, Interrupted'' ``three or four times'' and considers herself
an authority on the book. ``Two years is way too long to be
hospitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton first read the book for an assignment in her English
class, which spent some time discussing how the mental health care
system has changed since 1967. But the reason she ``loves'' the
book has more to do with the universal themes of adolescence that
Kaysen explores. ``It's so close to home,'' she says. ``I think all
teenagers get confused at some point in their lives and (Kaysen)
lets you understand what's behind it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipton moved from a small kibbutz in Israel to Newton four years
ago. Like Kaysen, she says she wasn't sure she wanted to go to
college. At first, she thought about enlisting in the Israeli army
after graduation in June. But instead, she has decided to
participate in an Outward Bound program next year and then go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lipton and her classmate Victoria Francis, 18, say they
have friends who have experienced depression or been hospitalized.
``Girl, Interrupted,'' they say, gave them an insider's view of
what it's like to be hospitalized. ``It taught me not to judge
people,'' says Francis, who is also graduating in June from Newton
South. ``I didn't understand before like, why my friends had to be
put in the hospital. After reading the book, she adds, ``I could be
a better friend to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bell Jar'' also gives readers an inside look at a mental
institution, and Plath's depiction of her character's suicide
attempt is haunting. But perhaps because it was written so soon
after Plath's breakdown, her book does not explore the kind of
inner psychic conflict that is a hallmark of Kaysen's memoir, which
was published in 1993, more than two decades after her
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sylvia Plath was really a lot sicker than Susanna Kaysen
was,'' says Janice Bryan, a psychologist in Lexington who uses
``Girl, Interrupted'' in the continuing education psychology
seminar she teaches at Radcliffe. ``She may not have had the
ability to reflect on her own experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan has used both books in her Radcliffe seminar, which she
has taught for more than 20 years _ and for much the same reason.
They both show how dramatically the therapeutic environment has
changed since Plath and Kaysen were hospitalized. She says she uses
``Girl, Interrupted'' instead of ``The Bell Jar'' today, mainly
because the former is of a more recent vintage.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the HMO model we have in place now, both women would have
been hospitalized but only for three days at the most,'' Bryan
says. ``And they probably would have been put on meds and not have
received psychotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kaysen is critical of the hospital staff who cared for
her, and the way in which she was essentially tricked into
hospitalization, her readers come away with the clear impression
that in the end, ``she actually appreciated that period of time in
McLean Hospital,'' says Cunningham, the Brandeis psychologist.
``She sort of regathered herself and came out with a different
sense of acceptance about who she was.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the way Kaysen explores that inner process of change that
young readers seem to appreciate most. ``I really liked the way she
described the parallel universe that she saw, and the situations
she had to face,'' says Ani Yanachkova, 18, a Newton South student
who moved here from Bulgaria when she was 10. ``A lot of problems
she faced are problems that teenagers today face. And she admitted
it and was a lot better off for it.''

&HT;     FUR FLIES OVER `CAT INDOORS DAY' 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A major observance for American bird lovers is just around the
corner: National Keep Your Cat Indoors Day.
</P>
<P>
   The cat lobby supports the May 13 event in principle, but is
somewhat ambivalent: It conveys a negative image of Fluffy as the
murderer of Tweety Bird, they say.
</P>
<P>
   National Keep Your Cat Indoors Day is the brainchild of the
American Bird Conservancy of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to raise consciousness among cat owners that
free-roaming cats kill birds and other wildlife,'' said Linda
Winter, director of the Conservancy's Cats Indoors program.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the United States and Britain have shown that
cats, both feral and domestic, kill birds, but they disagree on how
many. The best guess is that birds comprise about 20 percent of the
diet of free-ranging cats.
</P>
<P>
   The Cats Indoors program has the support of the National Audubon
Society, humane societies, animal shelters and bird conservation
groups. Curiously, it also has some support among major
organizations of registered cat lovers, but not because they are
worried about the fate of our feathered friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common sense, really,'' said Susie Page, director of the
American Cat Association of Panorama City, Calif., the nation's
oldest cat registry. ``With all the cars and trucks and
insecticides and antifreeze and dogs and kids, it's unsafe out
there for cats.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the birds? ``I don't care if they kill birds. That, to
me, is nature, part of a natural thing,'' Page said. Besides,
``birds have a short shelf life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is to keep cats indoors,'' said Juanita
Voorhees, recorder of registrations for the Cat Fanciers Federation
of Cincinnati. Keeping cats indoors ``isn't just for the birds.
It's best for the safety of cats (and) they're perfectly happy
indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming cats for the disappearance of birds is simplistic, said
Carole Hyde, a founder of the Stanford Cat Network, which has
worked to reduce the feral cat population on the Stanford
University campus since 1989. The decline of bird species is a
function of ``the spread of human development,'' including
urbanization and the destruction of the rain forest, she said.
``The Audubon Society is not scientific on the subject. Its
position is facile.''

MILES AND TRANE: IMPROVISING ON MELODY, GOING ON FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to everything that Miles Davis and John Coltrane
recorded together is probably the most pleasurable way of grasping
the changes that overtook modern jazz in one of its most vital and
pivotal eras.
</P>
<P>
   A new box set, ``Miles Davis &AMP; John Coltrane: The Complete
Columbia Recordings, 1955-1961'' (six CDs on Sony or nine LPs on
Mosaic), goes a good distance toward providing both the pleasure
and the understanding.
</P>
<P>
   From their first session (for the album ``Round About
Midnight''), which extended the pulse of be-bop, to their
penultimate (for ``Kind of Blue''), which opened up whole new
realms of freedom, the sonic saga of Miles and Trane is the story
of how jazz evolved and reinvented itself just as the tried and
true formulas turned stale.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were not quite 30 when their collaboration began. (So
much for the hyped novelty of today's ``young lions.'') Davis had
already played a role in two revolutions _ in 1947-48, as the
trumpeter in Charlie Parker's quintet; then, in 1949, as the leader
of a nonet that marked ``the birth of the cool.'' In 1955, as this
box begins, he had just kicked a heroin habit, and staged such a
hot comeback at the Newport Jazz Festival that Columbia Records
signed him up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Coltrane, at the time, was an obscure tenor-sax sideman, the
first of many demonstrations of Miles's brilliance as a talent
scout.
</P>
<P>
   The two formed a perfect pair _ not, in the usual manner, for
how closely they meshed, but rather for how tensely they clashed:
Miles, the walking-on-eggshells economizer, stretching and spacing
each note for its maximum purity of essence; Trane, the
sheets-of-sound expressionist, probing and twisting a phrase in as
many ways as his restless mind could conceive.
</P>
<P>
   A larger canvas was needed to accommodate the conflicting
contrasts, and Miles found it in a musical form called modalism.
The be-bop of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, from which Miles
(and every other modern jazzman) sprang, was built around the
chords of a ballad or blues. Modalism, on the other hand, worked
off the patterns of a scale or a melody.
</P>
<P>
   Miles himself spelled out the implications in an interview with
Nat Hentoff: ``When you're based on chords, you know at the end of
32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but
repeat what you've just done, with variations.'' But when you
improvised on melody, he added, ``you can go on forever.'' Less
emphasis was placed on speed and technique _ more on mood and
timbral colors.
</P>
<P>
   This box set documents, above all, the playing-out of this new
approach and _ as the musicians gradually realized its implications
_ the evolution of a new kind of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The music is presented in the order in which it was recorded,
which is often different from its order on the original albums.
This is the case with many box sets on the Mosaic label, and it is
a much-criticized practice. Albums, after all, are artistic
packages in their own right; simply reproducing the tapes
chronologically often violates artistic intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of Blue,'' one of the greatest jazz albums ever, is
certainly a package; to hear ``Freddie Freeloader'' before ``So
What'' (the original album has the order reversed) is
disconcerting. Then again, it is also one of the best-selling jazz
albums ever; 41 years after its release, it remains on the jazz
top-10 charts. How many people who bother to buy this box _ how
many who have bothered to read this far _ don't already own a copy?
A different perspective is hardly a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And the stunning thing is that this box lets me hear ``Kind of
Blue'' _ which I've heard hundreds of times _ in a new way: not as
a miracle dropped from the sky, but as a logical culmination of
what Miles and his band were doing the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a museum retrospective, where you not only enjoy
the paintings but gain insights into how the artist's style
evolved. You hear Miles and Trane settle into their differences,
hone the contrasts, and bounce off them to ever-riskier heights.
</P>
<P>
   The pinnacle of their risk-taking comes with the 1958 sessions,
``Jazz Track'' and ``Jazz at the Plaza,'' where Coltrane starts to
experiment with the ultra-fast, play-everything style that he would
perfect on his own a few years later. In this light, ``Kind of
Blue,'' recorded in 1959, comes as a simmering after the boil,
where the idiosyncrasies of each band member have been sifted into
a distinctive group sound and they can all now move to the next
step _ pure modalism _ in effortless synch.
</P>
<P>
   (The box's producers made one serious mistake by
uncharacteristically placing the '58 sessions after the cuts from
``Kind of Blue'' and the 1961 ``Some Day My Prince Will Come.''
They should be heard before, in chronological order.)
</P>
<P>
   One new discovery from this box _ we've all known it, but not to
this degree _ is the supremely crucial role played by the pianist,
Bill Evans, whose Ravelian flair for colors and tone clusters
pushed, and allowed, Miles to abandon his Charlie Parker patterns
altogether. He could not have done this with Red Garland or Wynton
Kelly, the straight-ahead bop pianists whom Evans (briefly)
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   A key moment is heard one minute into a false start of ``Freddie
Freeloader,'' the first tune recorded for ``Kind of Blue.'' Miles
stops the music, turns to Kelly (who started as the date's
pianist), and barks, ``Look, Wyn, you don't play no chords going
into A-flat.'' The band started over and finished the tune, but
Miles put Evans on the rest of the album.
</P>
<P>
   Other new things in this box: the ``Milestones'' album in real
stereo for the first time (the stereo master tapes had long been
lost); a snatch of dialogue in which Miles makes merciless fun of
Leonard Bernstein; and a dozen previously unissued alternate takes,
none of them better than the issued versions, but hey, we are
talking a dozen new Miles and Trane solos here.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint about these alternates: They should have been put
at the end, all together on a final disc; as is, they disrupt the
flow, especially for those who aren't interested in museums and
just want to hear the music.
</P>

HIDING PLACES 
A Father and His Sons Retrace Their Family's Escape from the
Holocaust 
By Daniel Asa Rose. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 380 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his book ``Hiding Places,'' Daniel Asa Rose sets out to do
something very brave, or some might say foolhardy. That is, write a
kind of Holocaust memoir without having experienced the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Rose grew up in the 1950s, a privileged Jewish boy from a WASP
town in Connecticut. His family was thoroughly assimilated: his
father a psychoanalyst at Yale, his mother a gallery owner who
filled their home with every kind of art except Jewish. Daniel went
on neighborhood Easter egg hunts, listened to music through his
radio earpiece during High Holy Day services, and remembered the
Jewish year was 57-something only because Joe DiMaggio wore number
5 and Mickey Mantle 7 for the New York Yankees. But there were
distant dark shadows in his family, in the form of a number of
great-aunts and uncles who had escaped Hitler's Europe, tattooed
arms and all. They lived 40 miles away in Manhattan, and served as
a nagging but frightening reminder to young Daniel that life was
more than the World Series _ it was world horror.
</P>
<P>
   There were shadows, too, in the form of tales told by his mother
that ``seeped out of her by accident'' about her Belgian relatives
with names like Shasha and J. P. He heard about relatives who,
while hiding from the Nazis, had to make impossible choices like
smothering an infant to keep from being found and killed, or had to
live in a chimney all winter while people dropped food down the
flue. They were people, he writes, who ``were still hobbling around
Europe with backs crooked from bending and with hearts broken from
smothering their babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Daniel grows up, becomes a writer (he is a former
travel columnist for Esquire and currently travel editor of Madison
magazine). He marries a WASP, has two sons, gets divorced. And
that's when it all starts to hit him. He has no center, no
historical identity, no religious ties. He is terrified of being
disconnected from his sons, ages 7 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   So he takes the boys on a roots trip that is also the Ultimate
Travel Story _ a trip to Europe to rediscover the connections that
haunted his childhood memories. They actually track down J. P.
(born Jacov Pesach Morganstern), a doleful but lovable old Brussels
diamond dealer, his mother's second cousin, and use his journal to
guide them through his war experiences in Belgium and France. They
found his hiding places and relived _ at least in their
imaginations _ the horror J. P. must have known when his beloved
twin daughters were killed by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's travel writing background serves him well in his quest.
His eye is sharp, his wit and humor acute, his curiosity hard to
satisfy. His prose actually manages to sustain itself for nearly
400 pages, though at times his Connecticut boyhood stories seem a
touch overworked, and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, somewhat predictably, Rose finds what he was looking
for. A connection. An affiliation. ``I haven't felt such clarity
for decades,'' he writes. And his boys? They seemed to weather the
trip well, with curiosity and enthusiasm and even humor. (We'll
leave it to their autobiographies, in 30 years or so, to assess the
deeper effects of the adventure.) Their father, for his part,
admits to some anxiety on this point: ``What kind of father,'' he
asks himself, ``would shove his sons' noses in the most terrifying
experience of the century?''
</P>
<P>
   A daring one, that's for certain. Rose has delivered what might
be called an alternative kind of Holocaust book _ a deliberate
attempt, as he has said in an interview, not to affect the tone of
other Holocaust books. ``I had to lighten it for a new generation,
while at the same time pay homage,'' he has said. ``I set myself an
almost impossible challenge _ to walk the razor's edge between
irreverence (in the form of two rambunctious pre-teenage American
kids) and dolefulness (the traditional approach to the
Holocaust).''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, you have to applaud Rose. ``Hiding Places'' has
broken new ground in at least one way: It demonstrates that the
effects of the Holocaust are playing themselves out in unexpected
ways, in unlikely individuals still one generation further removed
from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand: yikes. Lightening it for the next generation?
What next? Holocaust: The Video Game. Consider this excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to sleep in this inn where J. P. hid from the Nazis,
amid imagery that's twisted Grimm's into Hieronymus Bosch, I admit
to myself that I'm Jewed out at last. Jewed to the gills! I'm so
sick of subtlety! Of acuity! The curse of Jewish brainpower! I
can't take the alertness anymore! It's the alertness of the weak
and frightened, of small darting animals in the woods, breathing
with their entire bodies. Their fervency has gotten under my
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice prose, but you know something? Passages like this make me
think: Who cares about Rose and his clever perceptions? Best to
leave the Holocaust legacy where it belongs: in the hands of those
who truly knew it. Not people who are looking for a clever device
for telling a story, who are reaching for a link to the Holocaust
via their mothers' distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiding Places'' is in many ways a compelling story,
effectively delivered. But in some ways Rose is breaking ground I'm
not sure really needs to be broken.

   NEW RELEASES: ``Being John Malkovich'' _ Movie art is
momentarily rescued from the marketers with this wacky,
idiosyncratic, ingenious comedy with John Cusack and, yes, John
Malkovich. Think ``Alice in Wonderland,'' an amusement park on
psychedelic drugs, tall people, low ceilings, and a whole lot of
inventive fun. If you liked ``Brazil,'' you'll love this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' _ This hilarious parody of a ``Star Trek''-type
cast was a surprise hit last year. It's better on the DVD, which
includes an entire track in the alien's language.

   Image Entertainment, the company that supported the ill-fated
laserdisc format, is riding the DVD market to expansion and
profitability. President Martin Greenwald has signed an agreement
with Black Entertainment Television to coproduce a series of jazz

Danish author whose memoirs were the basis for the film, and an
informative commentary by the director. Pollack, talking his way

HOW CHESS BROTHERS' MOVES PUT EARLY ROCK ON RADIO

SPINNING BLUES INTO GOLD 
The Chess Brothers and the Legendary Chess Records 
By Nadine Cohodas 
St. Martin's, 358 pp., illustrated, $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History has it that in 1948, when Leonard Chess first heard
Muddy Waters sing, he just didn't get it. In a honey-thick
Mississippi drawl, indecipherable to the unseasoned ear, the
singer-guitarist poured out his heart in a blue torrent of passion
and pain in such songs as ``I Can't Be Satisfied'' and ``I Feel
Like Going Home.'' Chess, then a partner for the tiny Aristocrat
label, stared in confusion and annoyance, asking, ``What's he
saying? What's he saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Chess may not have appreciated this music, he did _ as
a onetime Chicago nightclub owner _ know its lure and recognize its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't understand the music he was hearing . . . he did
understand a few important things,'' writes Nadine Cohodas in her
smart, entertaining history of Chess Records, the legendary label
that Leonard founded with his younger brother, Phil, in 1950.
``People loved music, and they would spend money for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spinning Blues Into Gold'' tells the improbable,
only-in-America tale of two Polish immigrants who made their
fortune selling black rhythm and blues, music fostered in the deep
South, carried north, and raised proper in Chicago. As Cohodas
writes it, Chess was a company built ``on the convergence of
outsiders'': Jewish immigants and black Southerners such as Chuck
Berry, Bo Diddley, Etta James, Willie Dixon, and Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Lejzor (Leonard) and Fiszel (Phil) Czyz (their father Joseph,
born Yasef, Americanized the family name to Chess), came to Chicago
in 1928, part of a wave of European Jews seeking a better life in
America. The city was also a prime destination for blacks seeking
sanctuary from segregation (although they would soon discover it
was one of the nation's most racially divided cities), as well as
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, Chess and his sons operated a junkyard
across the street from a small black church, and the brothers often
heard the jubilant music from ``the hand clappers,'' as Phil called
them. When Leonard grew weary of the junk business, he bought a
liquor store with a bar and jukebox, and soon opened the Macomba
Lounge, which became a favorite nightspot in the city's ``black
belt.'' The popularity of live music convinced Leonard that
producing records could be even more lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of their deals involved both Chess brothers, it
was Leonard who drove the business. He was a profane, hardcharging
man who was involved in just about every aspect of their burgeoning
enterprise. He handled bookings, distribution, and promotion of his
latest releases _ which eventually landed Chess Records in the
middle of the payola scandals of the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It was common practice for label chiefs not only to pay disc
jockeys to play their records, but to give them writing credits,
ensuring them a cut of the royalties; hence, they had a vested
interest in helping the song become a hit. For example, Alan Freed,
once one of the country's most influential disc jockeys, was listed
as a cosongwriter on Chuck Berry's ``Maybelline'' _ without Berry's
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Leonard was making deals in the service of success, he
apparently did not tell the individuals most affected _ the
recording artists _ what he was doing,'' Cohodas writes. ``This was
paternalistic at best, deceitful at worst, even if neither was
Leonard's intent.''
</P>
<P>
   While never descending into stereotypes, Cohodas deals directly
with the racial realities of an industry where, overwhelmingly,
company owners were white, the talent was black, and ``deals
between the two parties were not the negotiations of peers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Chess brothers prospered, the same could not be said for
their artists, whose salaries sometimes resembled allowances.
Several artists _ including Waters, Diddley, and Dixon _ would
later file lawsuits demanding back royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Cohodas's greatest feat is, for all the detail she's
unearthed, she never overlooks her book's true heartbeat _ that
brawny, beautiful music born in cotton fields: from the incessant
throb of ``Bo Diddley'' to Berry's playful ``School Days'' to
James's gutsy, insinuating ``Tell Mama.'' It's a story of luck and
chutzpah, of immigrants carving out their piece of the American
dream. But it also witnesses the raucous birth of rock 'n' roll,
and celebrates the artists who ushered it from South Side juke
joints to the rest of the world.

TRENT REZNOR HAMMERS OUT HIS OWN TURF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thumbing through a recent Billboard magazine proved to be a real
downer for Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Reznor has never been
known as rock's resident optimist, but he was genuinely depressed
upon seeing the number of mindless, lowest-common-denominator rock
bands and teen acts that rule the top of the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a terrible situation right now,'' says Reznor,
whose continued effort to bring an artistic sensibility to rock 'n'
roll comes at a time when artlessness is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to sound like the bitter, crotchety guy whose
record didn't sell as well as somebody projected it would,'' says
Reznor, ``but the lack of intelligent music or challenging music or
anything that is risk-taking is really frustrating, aside from the
occasional hip-hop track that is inventive, then is ripped off by
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything in rock that has excited me
lately,'' he adds. ``The bands that are somewhat exciting seem to
be playing it safe and repeating themselves. I'd say Rage Against
the Machine is an example of that. They're a really good band, but
they keep writing the same song. I hold them in high regard, but I
don't hear anything that's really making people think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And, sadly, the business climate that bands have to deal with
now is horrible for creativity. Creativity is not encouraged and
it's certainly not rewarded. It's all about finding your niche in
the demographic of the people that you're going to sell your
product to. It has nothing to do with art or integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   And then comes this verbal coup de grace:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public likes what's on MTV and on the charts right now,
then I don't want to appeal to those people,'' says Reznor.
``That's not the demographic that I care to ship units to. I want
to appeal to people who demand and expect more.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznor's art/industrial rock machine, Nine Inch Nails, is still
selling concert tickets in high numbers _ witness a sold-out date
at the Worcester (Mass.) Centrum Centre this Tuesday. But its
record sales have tapered off with ``The Fragile,'' a stunning, if
sometimes confusing, double album that has sold less than a million
copies, versus the 4 million of NIN's previous disc, ``The Downward
Spiral'' (1994), and 3 million of its debut, ``Pretty Hate
Machine'' (1989).
</P>
<P>
   Critics have generally embraced ``The Fragile'' _ Spin magazine
dubbed it the album of the year in 1999 _ but many consumers have
been standoffish. They are apparently unwilling to wade into the
dark despair of some of Reznor's musings, even though the lyrics,
overall, are more positive than on the wrenching ``Downward
Spiral.'' While there are songs like ``The Big Come Down'' and
``Into the Void'' (``tried to save myself but my self kept slipping
away''), there also are rays of hope in the single, ``We're in This
Together'' (``we will make it though somehow''), and the title
track, which declares, ``I won't let you fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know as a person I was in a much better, healthier mind
space than I was when I did `Downward Spiral,' '' says Reznor,
speaking from a tour stop in Grand Rapids, Mich. ``Every record has
just been a mirror of where I've been at the time I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Reznor, who grew up in a small town in
Pennsylvania but now lives in New Orleans, where he operates his
famed Nothing Studio, realizes that some people might find him to
be a ``pretentious ass.'' He admits, ``I struggled with that when I
was finishing `Fragile.' I thought, `Is this palatable? Is this
intriguing? Will someone give it a chance? Or is it just a load of
self-indulgent crap?' I was trying to check myself on that. I'll
let others be the judge on how well I've succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Reznor sticks by his instincts. When asked if it
might have been wise to shorten the record to a single album
instead of a double album, he refuses to budge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could do it again, I would keep it the way it is,'' he
says. ``There is an argument that could be made that a more concise
record that is more focused and more song-oriented rather than
spatial may have been easier for a short-attention-span public to
bite into. But that's not what I chose to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have maintained that ``The Fragile,'' with its
grand, techno-rock sweep balanced by heart-piercing ballads and
instrumental interludes, was Reznor's attempt to update Pink
Floyd's ``The Wall'' for the new millennium. He even brought in
producer Bob Ezrin, who had worked with Pink Floyd, to sequence the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Pink Floyd has been an influence,'' he says. ``To
me, `The Wall' was kind of the blueprint for the concept album. And
people are still interested in that record because it had a pretty
cohesive and interesting plot. But with `Fragile,' I really went at
it from a purely subconscious level and that's what flowed out of
me. `The Downward Spiral' was more of an attempt to make a
plot-line album, a concept album.
</P>
<P>
   ``But `Fragile' was more sprawling. I wanted to see what was in
me and let it come out. But it was Ezrin who said, `Oh, by the way,
there is a narrative to a degree going on here _ and here are some
themes that you keep repeating.' It was interesting to be analyzed
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Reznor is now grappling with how many songs from ``The Fragile''
to include in NIN's live show. ``We're doing a pretty good chunk of
it _ I'd say seven, eight, or nine songs. But I now have to judge
`Fragile' from its commercial performance. I have to think, `OK, do
people want to hear stuff from this album or should it be a
greatest-hits show?' But, really, I love this album and it's the
reason I'm out touring right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned every song on the record and really could perform
it, but there are a lot of songs in the same tempo range that
wouldn't work in a live environment. I'm just trying to figure out
how much to do, because I've also been a fan who goes to see shows
and thinks of the band, `Oh, God, more stuff off the new album? I
want to hear your old favorites.' So I try to make it a satisfying
balance for all.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known studio perfectionist, Reznor tries to translate
that same work ethic to NIN's concerts. The set design was done by
Mark Brickman, who has also worked with Pink Floyd, though it was
completed by Roy Bennett, who worked on NIN's ``Downward Spiral''
tour. ``We've had some personnel changes,'' admits Reznor.
``Brickman is a talented guy, but his sensibility was in sharp
contrast to mine.''

   The visual highlights of the show, for Reznor, are the mid-set
videos done by Bill Viola, an acclaimed figure who does not do rock
videos, but instead specializes in video installations in museums
and art galleries. This is his first partnership with a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just like to elevate the concept of a rock performance,
rather than have it be the same thing all the time in a venue
designed for sporting events,'' says Reznor. ``I'm just trying to
notch up the intellect a couple of levels. That's what appeals to
me.''

FILMS RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE

<TEXT>
<P>
   !! ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' It's as cheesy as the
first ``Flintstones,'' but no less cheerfully campy. What story
there is in this prequel, about the courtship of Mark Addy's
lunchbucket Fred and Kristen Johnson's upper-crust Wilma, seems
lifted from old movies. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! ``Frequency'' It risks disaster, but this thriller about a
sad cop who makes contact via ham radio with his firefighter dad
(who died 30 years before) and rewrites their lives is both
original enough and emotional enough to survive a diminishingly
ordinary serial-killer showdown. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Last September'' Gorgeously autumnal evocation of a world
about to vanish _ the estate-based life of English gentry living in
Ireland in 1920. One could wish that the great Michael Gambon and
Maggie Smith had more to do as lord and lady of the manor about to
be reclaimed by Irish freedom fighters, but Fiona Shaw's worldly
houseguest is sublime. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FL) !! ``Where the Heart Is'' Pallid adaptation of Billie Letts's
novel about a young woman who journeys from Tennessee to a Wal-Mart
in Oklahoma, where she gives birth to a baby after being ditched.
Her growth into self-empowerment, aided by two big-hearted older
women, is rendered with disappointing superficiality. Natalie
Portman is too cultivated to project that trailer-park je ne sais
quoi. Matt Williams's direction is only sitcom-deep. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Winter Sleepers'' This film by ``Run, Lola, Run''
director Tom Tykwer has the same theme _ the role of chance in the
criss-crossings of five lives _ but it plays out quite differently
in a Bavarian Alpine resort. Its dreamy, luxuriant patterns of
fatefulness falling into place recalls Kieslowski's ``Red,'' and is
just as engrossingly rendered. (Unrated)

KEITH LOCKHART PREVIEWS THE POPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Keith Lockhart, wearing a shirt as blue as his eyes,
leaned forward and talked seriously about the Pops.
</P>
<P>
   The Pops conductor, now 40 and about to begin his sixth season
in that role, has never been one to resist the peripherals of his
position _ the onstage jokes and the outrageous album covers. He
didn't balk for an instant at a photographer's recent request to go
up on the Symphony Hall roof and stand behind a Pops sign. Like the
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, Lockhart works hard to be popular
because he knows that popularity is the lever he needs to make it
possible to do the things he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change at the Pops is a very slow process,'' Lockhart admits.
``The Pops is only one cog in a very large machine _ although it is
a highly successful cog. The logic always seems to be not to tamper
with the status quo because the status quo has become so remarkably
successful. But the Pops has never been about rehashing what it did
last year; it can't afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart is justifiably proud that he and his colleagues have
succeeded in continuing the Pops' prominence in recording, five
albums to date, plus a compilation of greatest hits, despite the
general collapse of the classical record business. ``Runnin' Wild''
has sold a very respectable 250,000 copies since its release in
1996; his least popular record, unsurpisingly, is his most serious,
``American Visions'' (1997), which has sold 50,000, still
substantially more than most orchestral recordings sell these days.
</P>
<P>
   RCA/BMG, which records Lockhart and the Pops, is in the middle
of a major upheaval, and no one can confirm whether such successful
long-term recording stars as Evgeny Kissin, James Galway, and
Richard Stoltzman will be able to continue with the label. Lockhart
and the Pops, however, will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pops cannot afford to take too many risks,'' Lockhart
says. ``But in terms of content, our recordings are very different
from what the Pops was doing before. Our job is to keep coming up
with projects that will keep us in the position of putting out
things people want to buy. We knew the trouble at BMG was going to
happen, but we were assured that we would be fine because our
recordings are still profitable. These days the costs of making an
orchestral recording are so prohibitive that for a non-crossover
disc like `American Visions' to sell 50,000 copies is nothing short
of a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of what does sell in the crossover category,
it's terrifying _ look at Charlotte Church, for example, the
teenage Welsh soprano. What's happened to her is almost child
abuse, and it is certainly music abuse; there's something about
that story that's very dark. And that's what most people today
think classical music is _ Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman. In
a world where people admire performers like that, where do Renee
Fleming and Bryn Terfel fit in? Believe me, we will not feature
Charlotte Church or Sarah Brightman at the Boston Pops.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart is excited about this season's recording project, a
Latin album that he hopes will be as successful as the Celtic album
recorded two years ago. ``We are still working on getting
arrangements of everything we want to use; we'll be recording the
album at the end of May and the beginning of June. There will be
music by Copland, `El salon Mexico,' which I conducted on one of my
audition concerts for the Pops back in 1994, and music by such
South American composers as (Alberto) Ginastera and Batuque and a
composer with a great name, Mozart Camargo! We'll be joined by
Peruvian folk musicians, a mariachi band, and Afro-Cuban
percussionists.''
</P>
<P>
   The album will also return to the first Pops recording to sell 1
million copies, back in 1935, ``Jalousie,'' by Jacob Gade. ``Arthur
Fiedler made that piece known all over the world, and it's even
been adopted in Argentina, where the musicians thought it was a
pretty good tango, even if it did come from Denmark. We've
commissioned a new arrangement of `Jalousie' for this season that
bridges two eras _ it pays homage to the Pops' historic version,
but it also places the piece in the context of authentic
Argentinian tango.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the actual Pops season, which opens Tuesday
night at Symphony Hall, Lockhart says, ``One of the big things for
me is the season-long tribute to Aaron Copland on his 100th
birthday. We will also have a Copland program for `Evening at Pops'
that will stretch the envelope a little bit, the way our
Shakespeare show did last year. Jubilant Sykes will be with us to
sing the `Old American Songs' and Dawn Upshaw is coming up to sing
Laurie's aria from `The Tender Land.' We also will use some footage
we have of `Hoedown' from `Rodeo.' I hope the whole package will be
instructive and entertaining. During the convention of the American
Symphony Orchestra League, which is in Boston this spring, we will
be performing a new work, Robert Maggio's `Skylines,' which has
been written as a musical tribute to Copland.''
</P>
<P>
   The other season-long event will be a ``Tribute to the Great
American Songbook.'' ``We were looking for something else to run
through the entire season, and this was one area in which our
library of arrangements was very strong. We can bring out a lot of
old things and we're also adding something new, a Paul Simon
tribute that will continue to add a link to the chain.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Copland program, the television events
include ``Elmo and the Wolf,'' a project with the creators of
``Sesame Street.'' ``The music is pretty much our old friend,
Prokofiev's `Peter and the Wolf.' `Sesame Street' is taped in a
studio in Queens, and I've already been there to tape some of the
backstage bits; the amount of talent in that room is amazing,'' he
says. ``In our version, Papa Bear will bring Baby Bear to Symphony
Hall and she will show how music can tell a story. The show will
combine Symphony Hall scenes with Baby Bear's fantasy journey. This
will ultimately become a commercial video release.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pops conductorship, of course, is now a part-time job for
Lockhart, as it was for his predecessor, John Williams. Lockhart
just finished his second season as music director of the Utah
Symphony with a concert and television show featuring Andre Watts.
``I also got to meet our principal guest conductor, Pavel Kogan,
and talk to him for more than five minutes for the first time _
he's the son of the famous violinist Leonid Kogan, and he conducted
the orchestra for the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow when my
wife, Lucia Lin, was there. This season we did some great stuff in
Utah, like Britten's `War Requiem.' Hilary Hahn came and played the
Brahms Violin Concerto, and I conducted Strauss's `Also sprach
Zarathustra' for the first time. Next season, I will lead Mahler's
Third Symphony and the Verdi Requiem. Opportunities like these make
me feel like a kid in a candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart has bought a home in Salt Lake City. ``This was very
important to the community there, and it's nice to live in your own
home rather than in a hotel suite, especially when you are there
for 17 weeks a year. And you can say that houses are cheaper out
there than they are here! My house is a beautiful place, about 15
minutes away from the (concert) hall and 25 minutes away from the
good skiing. The audiences are strong and we are pushing the
envelope in programming _ next season will be our first Mahler in
23 seasons, and we will do Corigliano's First Symphony. For me, it
has been a tremendous growth opportunity; four rehearsals for every
concert is a very different process than trying to do 80 concerts
on 2 1/2 rehearsals, or whatever we are able to do at the Pops!''
</P>
<P>
   One disadvantage is that Lin is occupied most of the time by her
job in the violin section of the Boston Symphony and therefore not
able to spend much time in Salt Lake City. ``That's too bad because
Salt Lake City is a very family-oriented place, but she comes out
when she can, and we try to make sure that's there's some couple
time and some skiing time as well as orchestra time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart and Lin remain active in their chamber ensemble,
Innuendo, which once again will play in the Stockbridge Chamber
Series this summer. ``I've learned another piano quintet,
Dohnanyi's, which we will play this season instead of the Dvorak,
and we will also play a chamber version of Milhaud's `La Creation
du Monde.' At some point, we would like to play closer to town than
Stockbridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the Pops future, Lockhart says, ``I would love
to find more opportunities to do multimedia things. One of our
major donors would like to give us a plasma projection screen, and
we could do some exciting things with that. And I would like to do
more collaborative projects. In 2001, I would like to do a concert
version of a major American musical, something like `Sweeney Todd,'
for example. There is a philanthropist who is eager to help us do
that, and then maybe we could run it out to Tanglewood. It is a
good thing to break out of the box from time to time _ nice as the
box is.''

<P>
   Place and pace, these are what matter to me most in judging a
mystery novel or spy thriller. Character is important, of course,
though in this genre a reader often must suspend disbelief, since
the exigencies of plot frequently demand that a person prove to be
unlike the personality paraded before us through most of a book.
Effective writing is also important, though here one must often be
forgiving, since so many writers first hone their talents on a
mystery or thriller and do not improve.
</P>
<P>
   One who has improved is Paul Bishop, whose place, in ``Chalk
Whispers'' (Scribner, $24), is Los Angeles, and whose pace is fast,
hard, and compelling. An earlier Bishop book sported one of the
best titles in a long while _ ``Tequila Mockingbird'' _ and now
Bishop's prose has caught up with his imagination. ``Chalk
Whispers'' is a first-rate crime novel about police corruption,
child abuse, illegal immigration, and murder, and in it Bishop's
series figure, Fey Croaker, emerges as a convincing, gutsy,
vulnerable figure _ a person of character the reader can bank on.
As with many LAPD crime novels, there is an ensemble at work here,
each figure playing a well-defined and yet somehow fresh role. The
comparisons of Bishop to Joseph Wambaugh that have been proposed
ring true; indeed, I think Bishop is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remembrance Day'' by Henry Porter (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25),
also has plenty of pace and well-constructed places _ the action
moves from London to Ireland to the Allagash in Maine and back
again. Constantine Lindow, Irish but now taking up a post in
Britain after a stint making money as a research scientist in
America, sets out to meet with his brother outside a London tube
station, only to see him killed in an exploding bus. Held by the
police, who suspect he is working for the IRA, Lindow realizes he
must find out why his brother has been killed if he is to prove his
innocence. One copper takes a gamble on Lindow, partly because
British intelligence clearly wants to wrap the entire incident up
by blaming him. With these premises Porter constructs a careful,
logical narrative about terrorism that turns on the use of cell
phones _ one will never unthinkingly call back to an unidentified
number after reading this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places in the Dark'' by Thomas H. Cook (Bantam, $23.95), also
takes place in Maine, in a small, wintery, coastal town where
everyone knows everybody. Cook writes very well; his tone is sad,
even foreboding, yet almost elegiac, as he weaves tiny bits of
cloth from here, there, and down below into an intricate fabric of
tragedy. One knows the what of the conclusion at the outset; it is
the why that is unraveled for us, concisely, almost in snapshots,
with surprises along the way. Here character is developed and
matters: Two brothers, one a lawyer, the other a newspaper editor,
close and yet quite different, become obsessed with a woman who
appears in their village one day in autumn 1937, and with an
exquisite sense of pace, Cook takes us down the road to the
terminus of those obsessions. Forget the usual comparisons to other
writers, for Cook is sui generis.
</P>
<P>
   So is Harold Adams, who also writes of a time when life seemed
slower and simpler, and who uses pace to keep action in check so
that we can experience the Great Depression as Carl and Hazel
Wilcox do in the upper Midwest, along the St. Croix River between
Minnesota and Wisconsin. The mystery is slim, the people are tired,
and yet Adams makes Carl so real, one realizes that he is giving us
crimes as they really happen. ``Lead, So I Can Follow'' (Walker,
$22.95) is nicely representative of this low-key writer. He slowly
sneaks up on the reader, until one cares more about a body that has
fallen from a riverside bluff than about a terrorist bomb in a
London street.
</P>
<P>
   New to this reviewer, Jessica Speart also uses place to good
effect. Nevada Barr has given us Anna Pigeon, a National Park
Service ranger who encounters death in our national parks; now
Speart creates a US Fish and Wildlife Service special agent,
Rachael Porter, who works to protect endangered species and put an
end to illegal traffic in the nation's wildlife. From New Orleans
(in ``Gator Aide'') through Miami (in ``Bird Brained'') to her
fourth book, ``Border Prey'' (Avon, $5.99 paperback), set on the
Texas/Mexico border near El Paso, Speart tells us a lot why we
ought to care about endangered species _ and along the way provides
a rattling good yarn. Rachel Porter has a mouth on her, as they
say, and she is a very good traveling companion.

POLITICIANS FACE TEST ON CHINA VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four weeks from now, when the US Congress considers
whether to normalize trade relations with China, Representative
Michael E. Capuano will join the majority of the Massachusetts
delegation in voting no.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vote that doesn't add up. Capuano says so himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 250 high-tech firms employing thousands in
his Bay State district. Yet Capuano will oppose lifting
restrictions on technology exports to China. If the curbs are
lifted, the Massachusetts high-tech industry could add hundreds of
millions of dollars in sales a year because of China's huge,
emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   His district is home to Lotus Development Corp., the
3,000-employee Cambridge firm, which is counting on the trade pact
to help it sell software in China without fear that its products
will be illegally copied and pirated. Cambridge is also home to
Polaroid, which covets unlimited access to the vast Chinese
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Capuano is resolute. China's continuing restraints on
individual freedom, its exploitation of prison labor, and other
human rights abuses are too much to ignore. It is, he says, a
``knee-jerk thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably economically better for my district,'' the
Democrat said. ``But I've always believed that America should be
more than just the bottom line. Human rights is important to me.
And I do think it is important America stand for something more
than the almighty buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Capuano has plenty of company in his willingness to go against
the economic interests of his district and vote against the
agreement. Seven of the 12 people in the Massachusetts delegation
are expected to vote no when the matter comes to a roll call in
late May, even though by some estimates there is no state in the
nation better positioned to take advantage of expanded China trade.
The Boston Chamber of Commerce has predicted that a pact could
nearly triple, to $900 million, business with China among
Massachusetts firms.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Bay State delegation call themselves
undecided and are being courted heavily by both sides of the vote,
which is expected to rise or fall by a razor-thin margin in the
House. Among the undecided in the Senate, where the measure is
viewed more favorably, is Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who is
expected to vote yes in the end. Only the state's junior senator,
John F. Kerry, has committed himself to the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a one-sided agreement in favor of the United
States,'' Kerry said in an interview, his first official
announcement that he will favor the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and policy analysts overwhelmingly agree. The
measure, known as permanent normalization of trade relations, makes
numerous demands of China, among them lowering harsh tariffs,
eliminating quotas, and adhering to intellectual property laws. All
the United States must deliver is a guarantee: that it will
maintain normal trade relations permanently, instead of requiring
Congress to vote on it every year as it does now. For that, the
Congressional Research Service predicts, the United States could
reap a $11.5 billion economic windfall.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, like Capuano, money is only part of the equation.
Underlying the debate is the complex nature of globalization
itself. And as lawmakers grapple with a trend in which some see
great advantages and others serious negative side-effects, many in
the delegation are finding themselves pulled in the direction of
caution.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such caution among business leaders like Stephen L.
Brown, chairman and CEO of John Hancock Financial Services in
Boston, who envisions a sea of potential life insurance clients
across the horizon. Currently, the company has a joint venture in
Shanghai, a city of 13 million; if the pact passes, insurance firms
could branch out almost anywhere in China, competing in an industry
that, in some Chinese cities, is doubling every year.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown also sees the business and job potential back home in
Massachusetts. John Hancock employs 5,000 people in the state, and
contributed $700 million to the local economy in 1998. An insurance
boom in China, with US firms in the vanguard, would create jobs and
greater wealth at home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heavy lobbying by the insurance industry, however, that
business proposition has left most of the delegation unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that the state have healthy, growing
companies,'' Brown said. ``I guess they don't agree with my
long-range philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, a Republican who is firmly
behind President Clinton on this issue, puts it more bluntly. ``In
my view, this is a no-brainer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Cellucci's alliance with the White House, against
the majority of the delegation, is lost on no one. Administration
advisers have been calling undecided members for months. When US
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Agilent
Technologies in Andover this month, Cellucci half-jokingly promised
to help, saying: ``I'll talk to the Democratic congressmen from
Massachusetts, but they don't always listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The undecided congressmen _ Martin T. Meehan, Edward J. Markey
and Richard E. Neal _ find themselves on the receiving end of a
cacophony of concerns _ to their great political discomfort. Labor
groups have been especially vocal, arguing that free trade with
China will only encourage US firms to move their factories
overseas, at the expense of exploited workers there and lost jobs
here. To make their point, the AFL-CIO staged a rally outside the
Massachusetts office of Markey last week, under the motto: ``No
Blank Check for China!''
</P>
<P>
   Labor officials do not know exactly how many union jobs are in
peril. They make their case using the North American Free Trade
Agreement as an example. Before NAFTA, in 1989, there were 22,500
apparel and clothing manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. Six years
after NAFTA took effect, less than half still exist. Labor's
concern is not that new jobs will be created by expanded trade, but
that established workers in older industries will be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there are only about 135 textile mills left in
Massachusetts leads traders to urge that the state should be
focusing on areas of growth, such as technology. ``The textile
industry has been fading away in Massachusetts since the 1920s,''
said Andre Mayer of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, an
employer association representing some 2,500 manufacturing firms.
``What's left are companies that can effectively compete with
anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But some congressmen say it is wrong to ignore the concerns of
even a dwindling manufacturing minority, regardless of the overall
economic prospects for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the state's governor and senators, Representative Barney
Frank answers directly to manufacturing workers in New Bedford and
Fall River, even if there are only 18 textile mills left in his
district. Frank, one of the most ardent students of globalization
in Congress, does not oppose free trade with China on economic
grounds; he agrees it could benefit the nation as a whole. And he
realizes that includes businesses in the northern part of his
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people in the south need me more,'' Frank said. Without
protections for low-wage workers, such as guaranteed health care
coverage, Frank said, he cannot vote for the China trade opening.
``I represent people who lose jobs because of trade. For the
country as a whole, it creates more winners than losers. And the
wealthy people gain more at the expense of working people, and I am
not going to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zandi, an economist at the Regional Financial Association,
explained the delegation's predicament this way: ``Increased trade
with China will be an unambiguous positive for the Massachusetts
economy. . . . The problem is that in any economic change, it's
much easier to identify the losers than the winners. The losers are
much more vocal than the winners. That's why trade policy is so
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several technology firms admitted they have not lobbied
as persuasively as their labor counterparts. In general, the
high-tech community is still finding its political bearings; many
have only recently begun to participate in government affairs. One
official at the Massachusetts Ocean Technology Network, a trade
association representing 17 companies that export to China, said
she had not heard of the trade opening legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the high-tech community has ridden the
boom to great personal advantage, and has not yet taken the
responsibility that goes with that,'' said Chris Gabrieli, chairman
of the New Democrat Network, a centrist political organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has it built a reservoir of influence with the delegation,
which has thrived for years on a combination of heavy donations
from labor unions and a liberal political climate. In Capuano's
case, voting against the measure seems an obvious choice: Activists
are everywhere in his Cambridge district, and labor unions have
donated more than $73,000 to his campaign this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the issue of human rights. Agreeing to
permanent trade relations would end the annual votes in Congress on
whether to grant China trading rights similar to those of other
nations, a vote often accompanied by a scathing review of China's
human rights transgressions. Activists argue that passing the trade
opening would speed China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, eliminating any US human rights oversight. And
Capuano, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Dartmouth
College, said he is unconvinced by the free trade argument: that
simply trading with China will encourage democratic progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk about how we're going to change China has been
told a thousand times in Chinese history,'' he said. ``It has never
worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But China is likely to win entry into the WTO with or without a
deal, trade analysts said. If an agreement with the United States
is not in place, many advocates of the deal worry that other
foreign firms will sweep into the giant Chinese market without the
regard for human rights that many US companies press for.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what worries David Lu, a Chelmsford, Mass. businessman.
A native of China, he says greater economic opportunity _ and
contact with Western businesses _ will help spur democratization in
China.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer who launched a firm to help companies sell technical
equipment over the Internet, Lu sees huge opportunties for his
business in China. But he is equally encouraged by what his
business could do for China. He has already hired two employees in
his office outside Beijing; with lowered trade limitations, he
said, he could hire many more. ``It is not only business, it is
democratic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get exposed to how we work, and how we think. I believe
that is going to help the Chinese democratic process,'' he said.
Then he added: ``If we can lower the barriers on both sides . . .
our business would boom.''

EXPOSED IN THE SUPREME COURT: `PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION' LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The State of Nebraska got caught red-handed here
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The exposure was technically legal in nature, and because it was
before the Supreme Court there was enough of a veneer of gentility
to cushion the blow's humiliating severity.
</P>
<P>
   But in getting caught in several acts of out-and-out deception,
Nebraska's effort to argue for its statute banning ``partial-birth
abortion'' was not only unmasked as fraudulent in open court; the
equally important politics of ``partial-birth abortion'' were
changed utterly.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, no slogan-spouting antiabortion politician can
responsibly say he opposes ``partial-birth abortion'' without
answering the simple question, ``What's that?'' What was
demonstrated last week is that the question cannot be answered,
which turns out to have been the deceptive purpose of this six-year
political farce all along. George W. Bush, to pick one example, has
had a free ride on this dishonest formulation long enough.
</P>
<P>
   The problem poor Donald Stenberg, Nebraska's attorney general,
faced in oral argument before the court was how to explain why the
statute avoided specifying the act it purported to criminalize.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in none of the 31 state statutes enacted to date (plus
a bill passed twice by Congress and vetoed twice by President
Clinton) is ``partial-birth abortion'' the actual target. By now,
presumably a few people have gotten past the evasions to learn that
the term is entirely a public relations fabrication and has no
medical meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska statute at issue is typical, criminalizing any
procedure ``in which the person performing the abortion partially
delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the child
and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   What tripped Stenberg up and unmasked the nefarious purpose
behind the law is the fact that doctors say that the language can
cover two kinds of procedures.
</P>
<P>
   One _ dilation and extraction _ is used very late in pregnancy
and involves dilating the cervix so the fetus comes into the vagina
feet first. Collapsing the skull and suctioning out the brain
allows the head's delivery. This is the stuff of the antiabortion
movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ``baby'' right out of
a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. In
reality, the fetus involved is often brain-dead or otherwise
hopelessly flawed, and the procedure protects the woman's health,
including her ability to have children in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The other _ dilation and evacuation _ is used commonly in the
second trimester of pregnancy. It involves removing the fetus in
sections from the uterus, during which it is common, for example,
for the arm or leg of a living fetus to be pulled into the vagina.
</P>
<P>
   Stenberg tried to argue that criminalizing only the former was
the state's intent, claiming a valid state interest in ``drawing a
bright line between infanticide and abortion.'' He then claimed
that it was no big deal anyway because the procedure is used so
rarely that banning it would have no impact on the choices of the
vast majority of pregnant women. That was the first clue to the
deception, since when this fight was just beginning, the
antiabortion movement was claiming just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But if outlawing dilation and extractions is the intent, as
Stenberg claimed, why not specifically outlaw them by name? His
failure to answer was bad enough, but the legislative history in
Nebraska three years ago is much worse. It turns out that an effort
was made in the state Senate to amend the bill to ban dilation and
extractions specifically, and it was defeated in a 27-11 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bill's chief sponsor opposed the amendment because,
he said, it would change ``what the bill is designed to do,''
namely, to ban both procedures and breach Roe v. Wade's wall
between allowable regulations during the second trimester (for
safety only) and during the third (when abortions can be banned as
long as there are exceptions to protect the life and health of the
woman). The absence of a health exception in all the phony
antiabortion statutes is flagrant icing on the factual cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just glaring here,'' said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
of Stenberg's twisted presentation, for which dissembling would be
a mild adjective.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for his two antiabortion colleagues _ Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas _ Antonin Scalia sounded less
like a jurist and more like a pol. Since he acknowledges no right
to choose under Roe, any pregnancy regulation is permissible.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Nebraska's argument foreshadows the collapse of
the political case as well after nearly a decade of fraudulent
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not ``partial-birth abortion.'' It's the right to
choose, and if he wins the right to make two appointments to the
court, Governor Bush is a dagger aimed straight at it.

SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY SUES OVER THE MARKETING OF THE MILKY WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trillions of miles away in the Cancer constellation, Krystal
Fransen's namesake radiates.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts woman has always been the center of her
boyfriend's universe, but he paid the Name a Star company $50 last
month to change the name of star number 098139 to ``Krystal,''
guaranteeing her a more public place in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   But Fransen's and thousands of others' place in celestial
immortality is being threatened by one of the nastiest star wars to
hit this corner of the universe in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The International Astronomical Union says that only its
organization is allowed to name anything in the sky, and that the
star-naming business is a scam that real astronomers refuse to
recognize. Nonetheless, more and more buy-a-star companies are
popping up on the Web, raising suspicions that certain star names
are being sold twice. Meanwhile, the star namers have turned on
themselves, as the biggest firm sues Name a Star for allegedly
stealing their trademarked name to market Milky Way real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be sitting in the courtroom for that case,'' said
Dennis di Cicco, associate editor for Sky &AMP; Telescope magazine in
Cambridge, Mass. ``It's sort of amusing because it's a fight over
who has the right to dupe the public. There are very few people who
stand neutral on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been naming things after themselves at least
since Christopher Columbus visited in 1492, but the battle over
star-naming rights is a singularly modern form of colonialism.
These days, Americans buy the right to name everything from
stadiums to insects in the tropical rainforest, and they can even
petition the US government to name any landscape feature _ even a
mound of earth _ in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with naming things began extending heavenward in
the late 1970s, as novelty entrepreneurs capitalizing on the `pet
rock' craze discovered a seemingly infinite supply of free
merchandise in the cosmos. Now, more than 1 million star names have
been ``sold'' and the rest are going fast. Hundreds, if not
thousands, are being sold every month. But even if sales sped up,
there are billions of stars in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the supreme form of ego,'' said Joe Boskin, professor of
social history at Boston University. ``And in America, it's
crucial. Immigrants came here and reinvented themselves. Their
names conveyed power and identity in a new place. We are a wealthy
nation, and in the history of mankind the wealthy people want to
leave a legacy. That means their name. Anywhere they can.''
</P>
<P>
   For the average folk, the legacy doesn't have to cost the
millions often required to attach a family name to a college dorm
or hospital wing. It usually costs around $50 to name a star that
is virtually guaranteed to last a good 5 billion years more than
its namesake.
</P>
<P>
   All star-naming companies allow customers to choose a star in
the constellation of their choice, selecting the often faint
pinpricks of light using Hubble telescope technology or
astronomical catalogs. The International Star Registry even places
star names in a book and locks it in a Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually none of the named stars are visible to the naked eye,
but the companies promise that almost all can be seen with
binoculars or telescopes. And the purchase comes with a map that
identifies the named star's position in the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the star-naming boomlet, the once august business
of naming celestial bodies after the gods of mythology or giving
them precise catalog numbers has been replaced by a new aesthetic:
</P>
<P>
   The Elvis star shines down from the Cepheus constellation and
more than 10 Princess Dianas now dot the sky from Orion to
Andromeda. Stars named for Billy Ray Cyrus, Dolly Parton, Sammy
Davis Jr., members of the Space Shuttle Challenger crew, and the
``Star Trek'' crew twinkle in the night sky. Actor Billy Baldwin
even named a star after John F. Kennedy Jr. when he died, according
to the International Star Registry.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the International Astronomical Union say no
astronomer is going to acknowledge these names when charting or
analyzing star light.
</P>
<P>
   The union, made up of professional astronomers around the world,
is responsible for naming celestial bodies and the rules are
strict: Virtually no stars are given names anymore; there are
simply too many. When new stars are discovered, they are given
numbers that note only their celestial coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Features on planets and their moons are named, but often have to
follow a theme, according to the astronomical union. The craters of
Mercury have to be named for dead artists, painters, musicians, or
authors, while only the dead and famous get moon craters named
after them. Asteroids can be named after regular folks but there
are so many restrictions it rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that these companies are out there making a
profit and people think they are for real. They lead people to
think they are actually naming a star,'' said Dan Green, an
astronomer with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in
Cambridge. The astronomical union's Web site jokingly urges
potential star buyers to visit the real estate they are buying
before forking over money.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people buy these stars for sentimental reasons for
people who are dying or who died. Give the money to the American
Cancer Society,'' he said. ``It will be better spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelty, not science, is the star-naming companies' defense.
They say it is a gag gift that translates only into a certificate,
a name in a database, and a huge smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novelty gift and that's all,'' said Cort Vaughan, of
Name a Star in Oregon. ``Even though it has no scientific basis,
it's something people love. They name them after loved ones, to
commemorate someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fransen's boyfriend, Patrick McCarthy, a student at Suffolk
University in Boston, agreed. He bought her the present as a
one-year anniversary gift. ``I know it's not real, the name isn't
etched in stone,'' said McCarthy. ``It's just a unique gift. She
was really surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a gag stab at eternity, however, translates into big money.
While Name a Star says it has sold about 10,000 star names since it
began, the firm is dwarfed by the International Star Registry, a
conglomerate with 15 worldwide offices that says it has named close
to a million stars. In 1998 alone, the company sold more than $4
million worth of star names.
</P>
<P>
   International Star Registry filed suit in October in Illinois
Federal Court against Name a Star, saying that the company was
using its federally registered name to sell star names on its Web
site. But International Star Registry uses the phrase `name a star'
on its Web site too. Both companies declined to discuss the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   If the International Star Registry wins, Name a Star _ which has
for now removed mention of the registry from its Web site _ cannot
call itself a star registry. Without that ring of authenticity,
sales could suffer.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the two oldest name-a-star firms duke it out in
court, new competitors are getting in on the action _ with the help
of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   A quick browse of the Web turned up a Universal Star Listing,
Celestial Registry, and a Ministry of Federal Star Registration,
among others. A consumer can even send $50 to a Brookfield, Mass.,
post office box and Chris Schell, ``astronomer since 1953,'' will
pick a star and put it in ``Schell's Astronomical Index.'' He notes
on the Web site, ``There is considerable work and experience
involved in such an undertaking.''

   WARWICK, R.I. _ On April 20, a police officer knocked on the
door of 512 Roundhill Court, a condominium unit set in golf-course
green lawn, and ended the Caldwell family's long flight from the
world's attention.
</P>
<P>
   What he found inside was less a home than a filthy nest,
crawling with the sinewy bodies of cats and spattered with feces,
littered with wrecked antiques and wads of dollar bills. The fumes
were so strong that animal control officers wearing bodysuits and
respirators could only enter the place for 10-minute intervals.
Thirty cats would be removed that weekend, not including the dead
ones.
</P>
<P>
   There were also human contents: a 62-year-old woman opened the
door, covered with insect bites. Behind her on a couch lay a
dark-haired boy who, for nine years, had been kept a virtual secret
from the world. The stench of waste had been seeping through the
walls into adjoining units since the fall, neighbors said, and
neither Gretchen Caldwell nor the boy, Nicholas, had been spotted
outside for months.
</P>
<P>
   How the Caldwells passed the days behind their drapes remains a
mystery, as do the impulses that drove them into desperate
isolation. As authorities search for the boy's mother, Denise
Caldwell, 32 _ who allegedly left the family to buy milk three
weeks before, and never returned _ the biggest mystery of all is
how, despite a scaffolding of social services and well-meaning
neighbors, they could have gone unnoticed for so long. What is
becoming clear, though, is how the family routinely deflected
outsiders' attention, and how tragically easy it sometimes was.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever social service agencies, curious neighbors, truant
officers, or anyone outside the family came close to prying open
the Caldwells' secrets, ``the family was able to evaporate in front
of everyone's eyes,'' said Scott Avedisian, the mayor of Warwick.
``What's troubling is you have a 9-year-old, unschooled boy. There
is no trace whatever of this child.''
</P>
<P>
   But seven miles away, five months earlier, it had happened
before. There, in the West Warwick development of River's Edge,
police had broken into an apartment rented by Gretchen Caldwell
after fumes from inside grew so strong that they set off the fire
alarm. What they found inside was remarkably similar to the scene
at 512 Roundhill Court. According to an officer's report, the
apartment had no working plumbing, and ``was covered in feces and
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the family had vanished. Neighbors knew this about
them: Gretchen Caldwell, 62, the only child of a prominent Warwick
executive, had raised Denise as a foster child, and the two had
lived together at least since the time of Nicholas's birth. As
Thomas Iannitti, West Warwick's director of human services, picked
his way through the reeking apartment, he found disturbing
intimations about the boy's life _ especially a roomful of Michael
Jordan memorabilia he knew no child would willingly abandon. He
said it looked to him ``like someone was being held hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Domingues, a neighbor whose children had played with
Nicholas occasionally, reported that Gretchen Caldwell had run from
the house once, saying her daughter was trying to kill her.
Domingues remembers Nicholas looking down at her from the window of
the bedroom where he spent most of his time _ or throwing down toys
for her children that were smeared with feces. And she remembers
the moment she realized that when she saw him in the parking lot
every day, it wasn't because he had come home from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think, well, everybody has something to do during
the day,'' Domingues said. ``Then I realized, this is when this
little boy is let out of this room.''
</P>
<P>
   When Iannitti tried to find school records for the boy, he
discovered, to his amazement, that Nicholas appeared never to have
been enrolled in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't exist,'' Iannitti said.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, the Department of Children, Youth and Family
was contacted by someone concerned about the child's educational
status. The agency investigated the complaint and found enough to
substantiate it _ a status given to about a third of the 8,500
complaints that are investigated every year, according to the
agency's associate director, Thomas Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   The agency then assigned the case to a social worker from a
private agency in November, but because of ``difficulties in
following up'' _ which could mean the family did not cooperate,
Dwyer said _ the case was sent back to the Department of Children,
Youth and Family in February. On Feb. 29, a social worker from the
department contacted Denise Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother found a simple enough way to resolve concerns
about the child. Within days, she had received approval from the
Warwick School Department to home-school her son. Even though her
son apparently had never attended school before, school department
officials approved the arrangement without ever asking to meet the
child or the parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school department really can't make a decision about who
is a reliable educator and who is not, based on the current law,''
said Robert Shapiro, Warwick's superintendant of schools. ``When we
received information about home instruction, we follow it, but we
don't go into backgrounds of the parents.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the letter of approval on March 2, Denise
Caldwell passed it on to the social worker from the Department of
Children, Youth and Family, Dwyer said, and the matter was
considered resolved. The social worker made no home visit.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be almost two months before yet another anonymous
tip to the Department of Children brought police to the door at
Roundhill Court. The scene was so horrifying that the police
officers, animal control officers, child welfare advocates, housing
officials and, finally, attorneys who marched through the place
over the course of the weekend could only explain it in terms of
how many years they have been walking into strangers' houses: Not
in 12 years doing this, or not in 35 years, had they seen a
household gone so terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cats were crawling over the feces-spattered countertop, and in
and out of the open refrigerator, where they defecated, over wads
of stained bedding and the bare mattress where it appeared the boy
and his grandmother slept. Half-eaten food lay everywhere, rotting,
along with fistfuls of forgotten cash, costume jewelry, broken
toys, urine-soaked upholstery, an upside-down television, a litter
of dead kittens. Against a far wall, someone had carefully lined up
a row of baby dolls. Richard Gallant, an animal control officer,
spent Easter Sunday trying to forget the sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just expect that people live a certain way,'' said
Gallant, slowly. ``You think when you go home, people are all going
home to the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wethersfield Commons, a development much admired for its
units' fastidious exterior, neighbors said the residents of 512
Roundhill Court seemed to have disappeared. The three Caldwells had
moved in during the late summer shortly after Gretchen Caldwell's
mother, Gladys Tracy, left the address for a nursing home. They
still spent some time in the West Warwick apartment, according to
neighbors there.
</P>
<P>
   The family kept to themselves in the new neighborhood. Ryan
Miller, 18, remembers answering the door to Nicholas, who came over
asking to play with his little brother. Although other neighbors
said Nicholas was a normal boy, Miller remembered him as being very
strange. ``He wouldn't talk, but he'd yell, he'd make sounds''
while riding his bicycle around, Miller said. ``You could barely
understand him.''
</P>
<P>
   But even when the people stopped appearing, the smell was
impossible to ignore. Property manager Joseph Mirra received a
written complaint from the residents of one adjoining unit about
the smell in November, and the residents of another adjoining unit
also complained. Mirra said he offered to help Gretchen Caldwell
remove garbage from her garage, and although he could not recall
whether she accepted the offer, he said the neighbors' complaints
had been resolved. ``This is a private home. If we see water coming
out of the door, or smoke, or loud music, or if someone had alerted
us to some kind of problem with the child,'' the management company
would certainly have responded, Mirra said. ``You can't just go
banging on people's doors who may be in ill health.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Mirra said, the condominium was put up for
sale, but when realtors knocked on the door, hoping to show the
apartment, they were turned away. A sign on the door read,
``ILLNESS Please Do Not Disturb Thank You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious (Gretchen Caldwell) didn't want anyone in the
house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The house is boarded up now, condemned as unfit for habitation
less than two days after the first knock on the door from a police
officer. And Gretchen and Nicholas Caldwell are back in the world:
Gretchen is in a mental hospital, according to her mother's
attorney, Robert Gates, and the boy is in state custody, where he
is to be examined by doctors and psychologists. Denise Caldwell has
not surfaced, but Warwick police believe she is in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Others are left to wonder whether, in a state where every
citizen is required by law to report suspicions of child abuse,
anyone in particular is to blame for not learning what lay behind
the Caldwells' curtains. The state Child's Advocate has requested
records relating to the child from the Department of Children,
Youth and Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing is tragic. To have a minor child, that
nonverbal, who's not been schooled, is just tragic for our entire
city,'' said Avedisian. ``Any time we have a situation where a
9-year-old boy is basically unknown to anyone is enough to suggest
that there should be reform.''

   CHINA-HUMANRIGHTS _ BEIJING _ Almost a year after China
suspended official dialogue with the United States on human rights,
it has invited a private American businessman to Beijing to discuss
the status of political prisoners. Although John Kamm has visited
China dozens of times in the last few years for talks with the
Ministry of Justice, this is the first time China has formally
invited him to do so. Some say Beijing timed the visit next month
to influence Congress' vote on normalizing trade relations. (Chao,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   PUERTORICO-VIEQUES _ VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ With the dust still
flying from the Elian Gonzalez case, federal officials are
preparing for another controversial confrontation with protestors,
this time at the U.S. Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques,
near Puerto Rico. The long-simmering dispute over the range flared
a year ago when a wayward bomb killed a Puerto Rican security
guard, prompting protestors to occupy part of the range. That
prompted massive protests in San Juan and near unanimity among the
island's fractured political parties that the Navy must leave
Vieques for good. A deal brokered between the Clinton
Administration and P.R. Gov. Pedro Rossello calls for a phased
withdrawal and a referendum, but protestors have rejected the deal
and vow to stay until they are forcibly removed. (Williams, Cox
News Service) WITH PHOTOS.

   MOZAMBIQUE _The lake below their helicopter was littered with
treetops pointing straight up. But it wasn't a lake. The emergency
medicine residents from Wright State University knew that. The
repeated flooding in Mozambique was the reason they went to this
country in southeastern Africa. They interrupted their lives for
nearly three weeks last month to address the desperate need for
doctors, food and medical supplies in a country that is one of the
world's poorest and least healthy in the best of times. (Dayton

large and dangerous activity could take place under student
supervision. It's tradition, Aggies explain. Students and graduates

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, May 2:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIRST-HUMANS (undated) _ Genesis mentions three of Adam and
Eve's children: Cain, Abel and Seth. But geneticists, by tracing
the DNA patterns found in people throughout the world, have now
identified lineages descended from 10 sons of a genetic Adam and 20
daughters of Eve. The human genome is turning out to be a rich
archive for historians and pre-historians. Explorers of the
archives have recently found evidence for a prehistoric human
migration from Europe to North America; identified the people who
seem closest to the ancestral human population; and given weight to
whispers that Thomas Jefferson fathered a family with his slave
mistress Sally Hemings. By Nicholas Wade. (1860 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROSTATE-TEST (Undated) _ Mayor Giuliani urged all men to
have the P.S.A. test after announcing that he had prostate cancer.
But experts are divided on the value of the test for the
slow-advancing cancer. In some cases, the test forces men to endure
painful therapy that is not always merited. But in other cases, the
test clearly allows early intervention to prevent what is some
cases becomes deadly. By Kenneth Chang. (1425 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Experiments described in three
forthcoming papers in the journal Physical Review Letters show how
Einstein's thought experiments on quantum mechanics missed their
mark. The studies showed again that that measuring one particle
could instantaneously change the properties of another particle, no
matter how far apart they were (known as entanglement) was true.
But it also demonstrated that the process might be used to create
unbreakable codes for the secure transmission of bank transactions
and diplomatic communiques. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ARMPIT-EFFECT (Undated) _ Experiments in golden hamsters
show strong evidence for the ``armpit effect,'' in which animals,
and perhaps even humans, screen out potential breeding partners,
eliminating by smell those whose odors are closest to their own.
Thus, they eliminate possible mates from the same genetic lines and
improve the chance of advancing their own genes. Experiments also
seem to show that the animals do it based on their own scents, not
those of family members they were raised with. By Carol Kaesuk
Yoon. (1305 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FROZEN-METEORITE (Undated) _ A meteorite that was
refrigerated by a quick-thinking local resident may give scientists
fresh insights into the primordial solar system. Although the fiery
journey through the atmosphere heated up the outside of the
surviving rocks, the inside would have remained cold, giving
researchers hope that delicate organic molecules trapped within the
meteorite remained intact. By Kenneth Chang (350 words)

   SCI-PARTICLE-PHYSICS (Undated) _ The United States, long a
leader in particle physics, is losing its edge in the field, with
the demise of the superconducting super collider. Soon, serious
American physicists will need to travel to Geneva or elsewhere to
conduct cutting edge research, and this at a time when the essence

   SCI-FUCHS-ECONOMICS (Undated) _ A conversation with Dr. Victor
Fuchs, an economist who also sees himself as a humanist, a person

Economics, he explains, is about choice. It asks how people respond
to incentives, how they respond to constraints. And so, Fuchs
observes, ``economics is the quintessential policy science.'' He
discusses managed care and proposed changes. By Gina Kolata.

   SCI-FIRST-HUMANS (undated) _ Genesis mentions three of Adam and
Eve's children: Cain, Abel and Seth. But geneticists, by tracing
the DNA patterns found in people throughout the world, have now
identified lineages descended from 10 sons of a genetic Adam and 20
daughters of Eve. The human genome is turning out to be a rich
archive for historians and pre-historians. Explorers of the
archives have recently found evidence for a prehistoric human
migration from Europe to North America; identified the people who
seem closest to the ancestral human population; and given weight to
whispers that Thomas Jefferson fathered a family with his slave
mistress Sally Hemings. By Nicholas Wade. (1860 words)

   SCI-PROSTATE-TEST (Undated) _ Mayor Giuliani urged all men to
have the P.S.A. test after announcing that he had prostate cancer.
But experts are divided on the value of the test for the
slow-advancing cancer. In some cases, the test forces men to endure
painful therapy that is not always merited. But in other cases, the
test clearly allows early intervention to prevent what is some
cases becomes deadly. By Kenneth Chang. (1425 words)

<P>
   SCI-QUANTUM-PHYSICS (Undated) _ Experiments described in three
forthcoming papers in the journal Physical Review Letters show how
Einstein's thought experiments on quantum mechanics missed their
mark. The studies showed again that that measuring one particle
could instantaneously change the properties of another particle, no
matter how far apart they were (known as entanglement) was true.
But it also demonstrated that the process might be used to create
unbreakable codes for the secure transmission of bank transactions

<P>
   SCI-ARMPIT-EFFECT (Undated) _ Experiments in golden hamsters
show strong evidence for the ``armpit effect,'' in which animals,
and perhaps even humans, screen out potential breeding partners,
eliminating by smell those whose odors are closest to their own.
Thus, they eliminate possible mates from the same genetic lines and
improve the chance of advancing their own genes. Experiments also
seem to show that the animals do it based on their own scents, not
those of family members they were raised with. By Carol Kaesuk

SIEMENS TO BUY SHARED MEDICAL FOR $2.1 BILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER FRIEDLIN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ German industrial giant Siemens (SMAWY:NASDAQ) said
on Monday that it had agreed to purchase Shared Medical Systems
(SMS:NYSE), a developer of services and information technology
systems for the health care industry, in a cash deal valued at $2.1
billion
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Siemens will pay $73 per share in
cash, a 76 percent premium over Shared Medical Systems' closing
price of 41 7/16 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens of Munich said the acquisition would help the company to
expand the range of information technology services it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strategic perspective, our competencies in medical
technologies and SMS' strength in health care information
technology and networking makes this an optimal fit,'' Erich
Reinhardt, president of Siemens Medical Engineering Group, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens Medical Engineering provides a full range of products
and services for the health care industry. A division of Siemens,
Siemens Medical Engineering employs 4,500 people in the U.S. and
has annual sales of about $1.8 billion. Siemens Medical Systems is
its U.S. affiliate and is based in Iselin, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Shared Medical of Malvern, Pa., specializes in developing
information technology systems for hospitals. The company has 7,600
employees and generates annual sales of about $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens and Shared Medical expect the tender offer to be
launched within the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Eclipsys (ECLP:NASDAQ) made a $2 billion unsolicited bid to buy
Shared Medical earlier this year but dropped the offer after being
acquired by Neoforma.com (NEOF:NASDAQ).

DISNEY-TIME WARNER BRAWL ESCALATES AS ABC PROGRAMMING PULLED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN DINI   
 TheStreet.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A squabble over transmission rights between Time
Warner's (TWX:NYSE) Time Warner Cable and Walt Disney's (DIS:NYSE)
ABC television network has escalated into a nationwide dispute that
has left 11 Disney-owned stations off local cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the dispute couldn't be worse for Disney and ABC.
The May ``sweeps'' _ the ratings period during which advertising
rates for the next television season are set _ began last week, and
ABC, like its competitors, has scheduled numerous TV specials to
strengthen ratings. As a result of the brawl with Time Warner, ABC
programming will not be broadcast via cable in much of New York and
Los Angeles, the two biggest TV markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the fight has left 3.5 million homes without cable
access to ABC programming. In addition to New York and Los Angeles,
ABC stations in Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and
small parts of Time Warner systems in Fresno, Calif., and
Philadelphia have been affected by the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The quarrel centers around negotiations between Time Warner
Cable and Disney-ABC for a new agreement to transmit ABC over Time
Warner's cable systems. The main point of disagreement has been
Disney-ABC's desire to move the Disney Channel from premium to
basic service and to add two new cable networks, SoapNet and Toon
Disney. Time Warner says such a move would increase its costs by
more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31, 1999,
and Disney-ABC offered five deadline extensions since then. The
most recent deadline, offered in March, gave Disney-ABC the
authority to withhold its programming from Time Warner cable
systems if no deal was reached by 12:01 a.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney-ABC said Monday that it gave Time Warner its consent to
carry its programming until May 24, when the sweeps period will
end, but that Time Warner ``unilaterally pulled ABC off its
systems.'' Disney-ABC called the move illegal and blamed Time
Warner's pending merger with America Online (AOL:NYSE) for the
escalation of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blackout is a frightening foreshadowing of the
implications of the Time Warner/AOL merger,'' said Arnold J.
Kleiner, president and general manager of ABC's Los Angeles
affiliate, KABC-TV, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner wants to duck the issues of monopoly control and
consumer access while their merger is pending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Time Warner Cable representative did not immediately return a
call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The highly public nature of the dispute is nettlesome for
Disney, which historically has tried to maintain a great deal of
control over its family-friendly image.

suggested that the broader economy may be losing a bit of momentum,
the group of executives who do the buying for U.S. factories said
Monday in a widely followed monthly survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey results from the National Association of Purchasing
Management, considered some of the freshest non-government data on
how the economy is performing, were slightly weaker than expected.
A main reason for the weakness was a heavy reduction in
inventories, which meant factories were not producing as much.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers survey is seen largely as a barometer
for broader economic growth, and the April results highlight the
ever-so-slight slowing trend for manufacturers in recent months
that has come as interest rates have risen. An index calculated
from the survey results has declined three out of the past four
months.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall pace of growth remains high, and is likely to
offer little comfort for Federal Reserve policymakers, who have
been raising interest rates out of concern that elements of the
vibrant economy are sowing the seeds of inflation. Higher rates
tend to slow the economy by making it more expensive for consumers
and businesses to borrow and spend.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing managers' April data suggest a 4.5 percent
annualized rate of gross domestic product growth, slower than the
5.4 percent annual GDP pace that Commerce Department reported for
the first quarter, but still above the 3 percent to 4 percent pace
that would likely ease the Federal Reserve's inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   The survey composite index slipped to 54.9 in April, compared to
55.8 in March. A reading above 50 denotes growth, while a below-50
reading indicates a contraction. The index for factory production
rates slowed to 58.2 from 61.8 in March, but the index for
inventories fell to 45.2 from 48.4 in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it appears that we've lost a bit of the vigor that has
been there for manufacturers, this doesn't represent any sort of
warning flag that manufacturing is starting to falter,'' said
Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The growing rate of hiring in the sector and still-robust levels
of production and new orders are hints that manufacturing is not
about to start contracting any time soon. The report's employment
index increased to 53.2 from 51.5, showing that payrolls in the
sector continue to grow even as the nation's low unemployment rate
makes workers harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms are hiring and given that order books remain in good
shape the manufacturing sector should remain in excellent shape for
the rest of the year,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff
Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials and energy
continued to rise in April, but at a slower pace due to a dip in
energy prices as most oil-producing nations agreed to increase
production following March's 10-year high for oil prices. While
some economists still fear that prices for raw materials will
eventually be passed on to finished-goods prices, resulting in
inflation, the fall is seen as a promising sign that the intensity
of cost pressures might be easing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fed policymakers may be troubled by recent signs that
inflation at the consumer level has started to accelerate and that
employee wages and benefits have started to rise faster. In an
attempt to avert inflation by slowing economic activity, the Fed
has raised short-term interest rates five times in 0.25 percentage
point increments since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, higher rates slow economic growth by making it more
costly for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, but the
Fed's efforts so far have had little obvious impact. GDP grew at a
7.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1999, and a
preliminary reading showed 5.4 percent GDP growth for the first
quarter. Meanwhile, inflation has started to show itself more
prominently, as the Consumer Price Index rose 0.7 percent in March,
following a 0.5 percent increase in February.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists are expecting the Fed to continue raising rates
when its policymaking committee meets May 16, but they are split on
whether the Fed might up the magnitude of a hike to 0.50 percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   A moderation to the 4.5% GDP pace hinted at by the purchasing
managers survey Monday might be enough to dissuade the Fed from
upping the magnitude of a rate increase, said Moran. But he and
others said the Labor Department's report on April employment, to
be released this Friday, will likely have more influence.

ING GROUP TO BUY RELIASTAR FINANCIAL IN A $6.1 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 TheStreet.com   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ING Group (ING:NYSE ADR) agreed Monday to acquire ReliaStar
Financial (RLR:NYSE), one of the largest publicly held U.S. life
insurers, for $5.1 billion in cash and the assumption of $1 billion
in debt, substantially expanding the U.S. operations of the Dutch
financial services conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, ING will pay $54 in cash for each
share of ReliaStar. The price is a 75 percent premium over the
company's closing price Thursday of 30 13/16 before the shares rose
40 percent on Friday on acquisition rumors to close at 43.
</P>

&HT;     EX-POWS RECALL THE HORROR OF WARTIME CAPTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Retired Brig. Gen. Robbie Risner hasn't forgotten
the ``meat room,'' the metal cylinder covered with a bloody rag
dubbed the ``bridle bit,'' the thin soup containing sewer-grown
greens or the weevil-infested bread.
</P>
<P>
   As a prisoner of war in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton,'' Risner
knew survival called for swallowing pride.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after the fall of Saigon, Risner and other
ex-POWs are proud of their days as prisoners dressed in black
pajama uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a deep anger burns.
</P>
<P>
   Their sacrifice, the men assert, wouldn't have been wasted if
the generals had fought the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose that war, we were forced to give it up by the
people who were running the war back in the White House,'' Risner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the political will to start a war, but they didn't
have the political will to see it to victory,'' said Mike McGrath
of Monument, Colo., who spent five years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was tragic, but I didn't go out and cry and have
a beer,'' retired Vice Adm. James Stockdale, Ross Perot's former
vice presidential running mate and one of just two Vietnam POWs to
receive the Medal of Honor, said of Saigon's fall on April 30,
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it was inevitable the way the government had responded
to the war, and that dated back to Johnson and McNamara, because
they didn't know how to fight a war. We inherited the whirlwind for
reasons of ignorance,'' said Stockdale, referring to President
Lyndon Johnson and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.
</P>
<P>
   The senior-ranking American POW for five of the seven years he
was held at Hoa Lo Prison, Risner, 75, wonders what might have been
if U.S. forces had fought to win. It's a common refrain for these
POWs, who fought under several restrictions _ among them a
prohibition against attacking ships in Haiphong Harbor during most
of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Force pilots and Navy pilots knew we were fighting with
our hands tied behind our backs,'' said McGrath, a retired Navy
captain and president of NAM-POWs, a group for former Vietnam
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara declined to comment, but former Johnson press secretary
George Christian, now a consultant in Austin, Texas, said the war
in Vietnam had been limited from the beginning in hopes of avoiding
a wider conflict. Still, Christian said he understood why some POWs
remain bewildered, saying, ``It's hard to blame them for being
unhappy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that China might join the Vietnam War if the United
States drove into the North, as it did in Korea in 1950, Johnson
confined American troops to the South. At times during the conflict
U.S. pilots were not allowed to attack trains, troop convoys or
ships in North Vietnam. The pilots faced court-martial if they
violated those rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese people were fighting their way, and had we been
allowed to fight ours, I think we would have won,'' said retired
Air Force Col. John Stavist, who talked with Risner through a
window at one point in his 5 1/2 years as a POW.
</P>
<P>
   Others have labeled those views revisionist and say the United
States should have pulled out of the war years earlier. The United
States, which sent more than 8 million troops into the war, was
unable to defeat North Vietnam despite a bombing campaign that was
about four times larger than the combined U.S.-British bombing of
Germany in World War II. The United States also failed in its
``secret war'' in Cambodia that attempted to destroy the Ho Chi
Minh Trail, used by the North to supply troops and funnel supplies
to Viet Cong guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, at least 84 of the POWs captured by the North
Vietnamese died in captivity. The true number likely was in the
hundreds, with most dying at the hands of communist troops in the
South, said McGrath, whose group represents an estimated 590
surviving former prisoners of war it says served honorably. Another
20 ex-POWs accepted early release or were believed to have
collaborated with the enemy or deserted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stockdale, 76, of Coronado, Calif., said as many as 15 fellow
POWs died while being tortured, but the issue is a matter of
conjecture. Risner said he knew of only two, while McGrath said up
to a half-dozen may have died under torture.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care for wounded prisoners in the North's dozen-plus
prison camps was virtually nonexistent, and offers of treatment
were dangled in a bid to draw confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast and dinner generally consisted of rice, cabbage,
pumpkin and turnips. When those staples were not available, the
Americans ate green weeds dubbed ``sewer grass'' or ``sewer weeds''
because they had been harvested from sewage ponds. Weevils and mold
often contaminated the bread.
</P>
<P>
   There were other privations.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners were given a 1 1/2-gallon metal pail as a toilet,
using sandals made of tire rubber as a makeshift seat. Baths were
taken from a bucket dropped into a water well.
</P>
<P>
   Risner, Stockdale and retired Air Force Col. Tom Madison, 71, of
Austin, sat alone in isolation for years, communicating via ``tap
code,'' rapping their hands on prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, whose F-105 was downed by a surface-to-air missile, was
caged in a 4-by-8-foot room for 22 months and received no mail for
3 1/2years. With no television, radio or writing materials, he
became an expert in studying ants and spiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent many days doing research on ants,'' Madison said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Physical torture, if less subtle, was a common tool, used either
to discipline those breaking the rules or to net statements for the
North's never-ending propaganda war. Survival at times required the
appearance of cooperation, such as writing ``confessions'' that
seemed sincere but were clearly phony to those back home. One
technique was to change handwriting styles.
</P>
<P>
   A Korean war ace shot down over Thanh Hoa on Sept. 16, 1965,
Risner became familiar with the ``bridle bit,'' a bloody rag
wrapped around a 1-inch diameter metal tube that was stuffed into
the mouth. Cloth on both sides of the bit would be wrapped into a
tourniquet around the prisoner's head. Then the bit tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners were forced to stand with their hands above their
head, sometimes up to 20 hours. A rifle butt to the kidneys was the
punishment when a POW's arms fell.
</P>
<P>
   Stavist, 73, of Austin, said his captors fractured his skull,
right arm, right shoulder and left leg during his first days in
prison. He lost the use of his right ear from judo chops to the
head. It was zero-tolerance, North Vietnamese-style. ``I had a very
bad attitude,'' Stavist said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 60, McGrath was an A-4C Skyhawk pilot on the carrier USS
Constellation when he was shot down June 30, 1967, just south of
Hanoi on his 179th mission. Captured within minutes, he had a
broken back, broken left leg, broken left arm and dislocated
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he deprived of medical aid, McGrath also saw his
captors deliberately hurt limbs that had escaped damage in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the myriad horrors of POW life, there was humor and
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Wallingford, a 52-year-old ex-Army sergeant from Austin,
said his guards granted Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings,
complete with extra rations of food, even though he was chained
inside a small tiger cage in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   In Hanoi, Risner once told the younger POWs not to anger their
guards, saying they'd ``catch more flies with honey than vinegar.''
Then his guards found a note conveying the order, prompting one
interrogator to say, ``We know what you think: We're a bunch of
flies.''
</P>
<P>
   Risner laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prison is another place you continue to fight,'' Stockdale
said. ``If you go into a prison, you've just got a new battlefield
and they've got a new battlefield. They've got to try to break us
so we'll do things that will help their side, and we've got to do
the opposite so we can hold up our heads when we come home.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Risner said, they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintained that we were never broken,'' he said, ``that we
were bent badly but never broken.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: A CASE FOR EXPANDING THE DOCTOR'S CHECKLIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What should your doctor know about you even before you have
donned that unglamorous gown and related the reason for your visit?
On a recent first visit to an internist, I was handed a medical
history form that struck me as unusually thorough in exploring
factors that could affect my health or influence any symptoms I
might have. The form reflected some of the most pressing
medical-social issues of our day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual questions about my personal and family
medical history, current symptoms or complaints about my health,
allergies, operations, immunizations and personal habits like
smoking and drinking, I was asked:
</P>
<P>
   _Do you wear seat belts?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you wear a bike helmet?
</P>
<P>
   _If there is a gun in your home, is it out of children's reach
and unloaded?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you use drugs (marijuana, cocaine, crack, etc.)?
</P>
<P>
   _Have you ever engaged in any activity which has put you at risk
of getting AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you wish to be tested for AIDS?
</P>
<P>
   _Have you worked with chemicals, paints, asbestos or other
hazardous materials?
</P>
<P>
   _Are you in a relationship in which you have been physically
hurt (e.g. slapped, kicked, punched, bruised) by your partner?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you ever feel afraid of your partner?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you have a ``living will''?
</P>
<P>
   _Do you have a donor card?
</P>
<P>
   Also, in questioning me about the medicines I take, the form
asks about over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbs and other
supplements. Many people treat themselves for all kinds of problems
with over-the-counter supplements, often failing to realize that a
substance with a druglike effect is a drug and can have side
effects, including bad interactions with prescriptions. Also, those
who take megadoses of nutrients may be distorting their metabolism
and inducing deficiencies of important nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Never had I been asked about such matters: the kinds of
questions that should make patients think about how they may put
themselves or their families at risk and what they can do to
improve their chances of living healthfully, ending life peacefully
and passing on their viable organs to others.
</P>
<P>
   As impressed as I was about these queries, I was surprised by
the absence of others. I was asked about coffee, tea and alcohol
consumption, but not about diet or weight-related issues. Nor were
there any questions about exercise or stress reduction.
</P>
<P>
   So while I was delighted to see doctors taking note of items
like seat belts and guns, I was dismayed by the seeming lack of
concern about eating, exercise and stress reduction. Excess stress
can undermine the immune system and render a person susceptible to
conditions like frequent infections, cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that I am asking a lot from doctors. Not only must
they know about symptoms, tests, medicines and a 2,700-page book of
ailments, but also about matters rarely discussed in training. But
evidence shows that the foods people eat, how much they exercise,
whether they are chronically stressed and how well they cope with
stress can affect their health and well-being, including their risk
of developing heart disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes,
osteoporosis and depression. Thus, it becomes increasingly
important for doctors to bone up on these matters and start asking
about them.
</P>
<P>
   And while doctors may not feel competent to offer nutrition or
exercise advice or tips on stress reduction, they should be able to
refer patients to dietitians, exercise physiologists or mental
health professionals trained to handle such problems.
</P>
<P>
   The medical history questionnaire I completed did ask some other
important questions: the dates of my last Pap smear, my last
mammogram and breast exam, cholesterol check and stool check for
blood. Of course, the question about a prostate exam was not
relevant to me, but is certainly important to every white man over
50 and every black man over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Also important were the questions about family medical history,
particularly health problems with hereditary components. The form
also asked whether any members of my family _ parents, grandparents
and siblings _ ever had the following disorders and at about what
age: cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, strokes,
mental disease, drug or alcohol addiction, glaucoma, bleeding
disorders or any other significant problems.
</P>
<P>
   Although I had long thought I came from pretty hardy stock,
completing this portion of the questionnaire got me thinking twice
about my potential medical vulnerability. My father and grandfather
had heart disease, first diagnosed in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   My mother died from ovarian cancer at 49; her father died of
prostate cancer at 60, and her mother died of esophageal cancer in
her 70s. My paternal grandmother had adult-onset diabetes,
diagnosed in her 50s, and had strokes in her 80s and 90s. My
brother at age 54 has high blood pressure and moderately high
cholesterol, which he is wisely getting treated so that he does not
suffer the same fates.
</P>
<P>
   So, all in all, it was a good idea for me to get a checkup.
Answering those questions reinforced my determination to live a
health-promoting life, which includes a diet rich in vegetables and
fruits and whole grains, the use of olive and canola oils in place
of saturated fats like butter and hydrogenated vegetable oils
(found mainly in processed foods) and moderate amounts of animal
protein, including some lean red meat but also lots of fish.
</P>
<P>
   I do not need encouragement to exercise. I do a brisk three-mile
walk and swim half a mile or more daily and play tennis three or
four times a week. Depending on the season, I ice-skate,
cross-country ski, hike and cycle, and I use my bike whenever
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I even got a shorter haircut so my bike helmet would cause less
havoc. Regular physical activity is my primary means of coping with
the stresses of modern life. I do not meditate or do yoga, but
these are two other effective stress reducers for those who need
some extra calming down.

   PHOENIX _ It reminded me of a place far away and a time when
Benny Barnes wasn't the best cornerback in the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   But he was the toughest and clearly the hardest working.
</P>
<P>
   Benny had blown out an ankle, but he wasn't about to let Lynn
Swann score. This happened on a cold day at Three Rivers Stadium
when the Cowboys and the Steelers had the hottest rivalry going in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Down on both knees, Benny started crawling toward Swann, and
managed to tackle him 3 yards short of the goal. It made you want
to shout.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw David Robinson on Saturday afternoon against the
Phoenix Suns, I thought of Benny.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it wasn't the 37 points or the 13 rebounds or the 43 minutes
that he logged. It was the relentless effort.
</P>
<P>
   I had scribbled on my game notes ``powerful'' and ``a real
force'' and ``I can't believe this is David.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a place they call the Valley of the Sun, I hereby title
him the Desert Ox.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't David Robinson dilly-dallying with that pretty
16-foot jumper. This was the Desert Ox in the paint, in your face,
on top of the rim.
</P>
<P>
   This was the San Antonio Spurs center with four guys around him,
each trying to pound his bones into desert sand.
</P>
<P>
   This clearly was a man trying to carry a team, a city and a
championship trophy on his wide shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   This was David Robinson with the hammer down.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, during that 32-15 comeback run, the Suns
didn't take the game away from the Spurs. They had to wrest it from
the fingers of Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I suggested to Robinson: I told him that it wasn't
his greatest statistical game, and certainly it was the most
important contest that he had ever graced.
</P>
<P>
   But in the real big picture, it might have been his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best game ever?'' he said. ``I don't know about ever. It
was a good all-around game.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and relented. ``It's my best game of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the comparisons to Benny Barnes end with the mettle
both men displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Benny was sent packing in the early 1980s, never to be heard
from again. At least by me.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, when he retires, is headed for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked Suns coach Scott Skiles if he was surprised about
David's big game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised?'' he said with a touch of salt. ``How can I be
surprised about David Robinson? He is one of the greatest players
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Suns are trying to do is pound Robinson until he pulls
out of the paint. That's why he attempted 18 free throws. To the
Suns' chagrin, he made 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do with David is make him work for
everything he gets and therefore he will be a little tired by the
end of the game,'' Skiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he scored only four points in the fourth quarter as the
Suns blew past the Spurs like a racehorse past an ox.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same strategy they will employ Tuesday night in Game
4. I submit that Avery Johnson and Antonio Daniels need to be on
the floor at the same time in order to increase the offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
   Let A.J. run the offense, let Daniels blow past the Suns with
that quick first step.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, by the way, is not coming back this season. We can
all forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sunday: ``I want to be out there when I feel good. I
want to be out there on the floor when I don't think I will hurt
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So it will be David vs. Goliath on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That might sound trite. But true.

   PATTERNS: The Brain Cells That Make You Sleepy
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in France and Switzerland have isolated the brain
cells that may bring on sleepiness and traced part of an intricate
chemical back-and-forth between substances that promotes alertness
or lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's issue of Nature, the researchers described the
``sleep-producing neurons'' as standing out from the surrounding
tissue through their triangular shape, unusual cycle of electrical
activity and, most importantly, through their unusual reactions to
certain brain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have shown that the region at the base of the
brain where these neurons are found is active whenever the brain is
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the team, Thierry Gallopin, a neurobiologist in
Lyon, determined that for the brain to wake, these neurons had to
be suppressed by the action of noradrenaline and other substances
known to excite brain activity. At other times, the action of the
sleep-producing neurons appears, in turn, to suppress the release
of those ``wakeful'' substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sleep-producing cells and those in the waking systems are
able to inhibit each other,'' said Professor Michel Muehlethaler of
Geneva. ``A person will fall asleep as soon as the sleep neurons
become activated and inhibit the neurons in the waking systems.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the deeper mystery _ what causes the balance to
swing toward sleep or alertness _ remained.
</P>
<P>
   REACTIONS: The Blanket Approach to Pediatrics
</P>
<P>
   A child's favorite blanket can be as effective as a parent in
comforting a 3-year-old on a visit to the doctor, a study published
last month in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians sometimes prefer to examine a child without a
parent present. But that raises the problem of managing the natural
anxiety reaction among small children left alone with a relative
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gabriel Ybarra and Dr. Richard Passman, researchers at the
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, randomly assigned 64 children
to doctor visits accompanied by their blankets for comfort, their
mothers, both and neither.
</P>
<P>
   They found that blankets for children known to be attached to
them appeared to mitigate anxiety as much as a mother's presence
and that there was no additional benefit when a child had both.
</P>
<P>
   For moderately upsetting medical procedures, the researchers
wrote, ``blankets can function as appropriate maternal
substitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDS: When the Label Doesn't Measure Up
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of ephedra supplements, an herbal remedy sold as a
decongestant, energy booster or diet aid, found significant
differences between what their label said and their actual contents
in half the samples examined, according to researchers, who also
found that some contained hazardous combinations of substances.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, from the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences, tested 20 supplements with ephedra alkaloids, which they
said had been linked to hundreds of adverse reactions and several
deaths. They found that in 10 cases, the discrepancy between the
label and the contents was greater than 20 percent, far more than
the amount that would set off a recall of regulated medications.
One product contained no ephedra alkaloids; one had 154 percent of
the amount listed, the researchers reported in May in the American
Journal of Health-System Pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead researcher, Bill Gurley, concluded that the
survey showed that ``poor quality control may contribute to the
problems associated with the safety and efficacy of ephedra
supplements.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Blumenthal, executive director of the American Botanical
Council, said he questioned some study methods and thought
ephedra's potential danger was exaggerated, but he agreed that a
clear ``lack of quality control'' existed in much of the
supplements industry.
</P>
<P>
   Until the government establishes guidelines, he recommended that
consumers buy supplements from well-respected companies,
particularly those linked to companies in Europe, where herbal
products are more rigorously regulated.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTION: Putting On the Sunblock, the Right Way
</P>
<P>
   A survey presented last week to a conference of the American
Academy of Dermatology found that many parents applied sunblock to
their children then left them in the sun longer than they normally
would have, the equivalent of a driver going faster because a car
has antilock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. June Robinson of Loyola University in Chicago, said the
survey she conducted identified other common mistakes and
misperceptions about sunblock. In an interview, she offered these
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _Sunblock is not enough. Even with it, try to limit time in the
sun to no more than two to three hours during the peak sunburn
hours, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _Use enough. Most parents surveyed used half the recommended
amount _ one ounce to cover exposed skin _ sharply cutting the
protection, Robinson said. Colored sunblocks may be easier to apply
evenly. Remember the easily overlooked spots, like the tops of ears
or feet.
</P>
<P>
   _Put it on before leaving the house. Sunblock takes 20 to 30
minutes to bind properly with skin, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   _Reapply it every two hours, or after the skin gets wet from
swimming or sweating.
</P>
<P>
   _Use a broad spectrum block that protects against ultraviolet A
and B rays.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not use sunblock on children younger than 6 months. Because
they dehydrate quickly, they should not be exposed to direct sun
for any extended time.
</P>
<P>
   _Set an example. Children who see their parents wearing hats and
remembering the umbrella are more likely to develop habits to
reduce their risk of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to hide under the porch,'' Robinson said, ``but
seek shade whenever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   TREATMENTS: Guidelines for Attacking Migraine Pain
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can do more now to help migraine sufferers, but the
condition still goes underdiagnosed and undertreated, the American
Academy of Neurology said last week in announcing new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Silberstein, a neurologist in Philadelphia and
co-director of the U.S. Headache Consortium, which developed the
guidelines, called migraine an extraordinarily common disorder
affecting 18 percent of women and 6 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Silberstein said the first misconception the
guidelines intended to dispel was that people had to be ``seeing
flashing lights or be bedridden for a headache to be migraine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a disabling headache _ one that interferes
with the ability to function _ particularly if accompanied by
nausea or sensitivity to sound, light or odor, should be considered
migraine until proven otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also say that expensive brain scans used to rule
out more serious headache causes are usually unneeded in otherwise
healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Once a diagnosis is made, Silberstein said, a doctor should
educate the patient about the condition, now considered to result
from changes in blood flow in the brain caused by improperly
functioning nerves. Then a treatment should be developed,
alternating medicines until the most effective are found.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, doctors should work with patients to change their
habits to lessen contributing factors, like fatigue or stress, and
to use techniques like biofeedback and exercise to help keep the
headaches from coming on in the first place.

   Hope for Old Abba Discs
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart's got nothing on the researchers at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm. They've come up with a novel
home crafts project: turning that old Monkees' Greatest Hits album
into a lens for an X-ray microscope.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays, particularly the higher energy kind known as hard
X-rays, can be bent _ or refracted _ by a lens, just as light beams
can (though X-ray lenses are not made of glass). X-rays are
refracted only slightly, though, so the only practicable refractive
lenses have been compound ones, made up of many lenses in a line.
And these lenses have parabolic surfaces, which can make them
difficult to fabricate.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish researchers, writing in the journal Nature, have
described a new way of making a lens that has straight surfaces. In
theory, the lens could be made of two two-inch strips cut from a
vinyl LP, joined at one end and separated slightly at the other so
that the strips with their grooves resemble the open jaw of an
alligator, viewed from the side. X-rays entering at the closed end
would skim across the hills and valleys of the grooves, refracting
slightly as they passed through each succeeding hill and eventually
coming to a common focus.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, the researchers found that the grooves on
a record were too shallow (about 25 microns deep), and that there
was too much material between them, to make a useful lens. So they
made their own record, with a uniform groove that is 90 microns
deep, about four times as deep as those on an LP. But don't look
for it in record stores anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mangle That Tune
</P>
<P>
   In the old television game show ``Name That Tune,'' contestants
vied to see who could identify a popular melody faster (``I can
name that tune in five notes, Tom,'' a contestant would tell Tom
Kennedy, the host of the 1970s version of the show).
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Cambridge in England haven't
been competing for cash prizes or even seven-piece bedroom sets,
but they have been using a nightmarish version of the game in order
to test a theory about how the brain recognizes a tune. Their
theory, as described in the journal Nature, is that when the brain
initially experiences a melody, a template of pitch and time is
formed that is then used as a basis for comparison when the melody
is heard again.
</P>
<P>
   The research subjects listened to some or all of the first 18
notes of Mozart's ``Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' with increasing
numbers of random notes _ tens to hundreds of them _ added. The
researchers, who noted that their results were only preliminary,
found that the subjects could tolerate greater numbers of ``noise''
notes (and still identify Mozart's melody) as the number of correct
notes increased. This supports the template idea, the researchers
said, in that the more notes that match the template, the better
the brain can name that tune.
</P>
<P>
   Physics With Mass Appeal
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are no doubt sleeping better these days, thanks to
some precision measurements by researchers at the University of
Washington. They've reduced the uncertainty in Newton's
gravitational constant, a fundamental value that enables
measurement of the mass of the Earth and other planets.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was first measured by Henry Cavendish in 1797, the
constant, represented as G, has been known only to varying levels
of uncertainty. The latest internationally accepted value had an
uncertainty of .15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For their measurements, which have an uncertainty of about .0015
percent, the University of Washington researchers used an improved
version of a torsion balance. It consists of a pendulum that
rotates on a turntable between a set of ``attractor'' masses,
precisely milled stainless steel balls.
</P>
<P>
   Using the result, the Washington scientists also announced a new
value of the Earth's mass: about 6 sextillion metric tons. That's a
6 with 21 zeros after it.

`THE HUMAN STAIN': MORE IN THE CHRONICLE OF AMERICAN INNOCENCE AND
DISILLUSION

 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Roth's Pulitzer-Prize winning 1997 novel, ``American
Pastoral'' _ the first installment, it would turn out, of a trilogy
devoted to postwar American life _ triumphantly demonstrated that
he could move beyond the solipsistic presentations of self he had
been practicing for years to create a capacious chronicle of
American innocence and disillusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the second installment of that trilogy (``I Married a
Communist,'' 1998) was something of a throwback to Roth's old
mirror games, his latest novel, ``The Human Stain,'' is not only a
philosophic bookend to ``Pastoral'' but another large and stirring
book as well. It is a book that shows how the public Zeitgeist can
shape, even destroy, an individual's life, a book that takes all of
Roth's favorite themes of identity and rebellion and generational
strife and refracts them not through the narrow prism of the self
but through a wide-angle lens that exposes the fissures and
discontinuities of 20th-century life.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance ``The Human Stain'' might seem to be a story
about political correctness and 1990s puritanism: There are lots of
gratuitous allusions to President Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, and one of the novel's central plot lines involves
accusations of racism and misogyny made against the hero, Coleman
Silk. We are told that the elderly Silk, a distinguished professor
of classics, has resigned from his post at a small New England
college after being accused by black students of using
inappropriate language in class. We also learn that he has been
pilloried by campus feminists for having an affair with one of the
college's janitors, an illiterate 34-year old woman who has a
history of being victimized by men.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, Roth _ or rather, his favorite narrator
and longtime alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman _ has a fine time ranting
against the ``piety binge'' he sees America indulging in at the
close of the century, and he deftly satirizes the ``ecstasy of
sanctimony'' practiced by campus commissars of political
correctness. Coleman Silk's story, however, turns out to have
resonance beyond these topical issues. As told (or reimagined) by
Nathan Zuckerman, it is the Gatsby-esque story of a man, who has
seized the American principle of freedom and used it to shuck off
the past and reinvent himself. It is the story of a black man who
decided to pass himself off as white.
</P>
<P>
   This premise seems to have been inspired by the life story of
Anatole Broyard _ a critic for The New York Times who died in 1990
_ at least as recounted by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his 1997 book
``13 Ways of Looking at a Black Man.'' But when stripped of its
racial overtones, Roth's book echoes a story he has told in novel
after novel. Indeed, it closely parallels the story of Nathan
Zuckerman, himself another dutiful, middle-class boy from New
Jersey who rebelled against his family and found himself exiled,
``unbound'' as it were, from his roots.
</P>
<P>
   In Nathan's case he wrote a scandalous book, was accused of
being a self-hating Jew and was disowned by his father. In
Coleman's case, he decided to jettison ``the whole ramified Negro
thing,'' disowned his mother and was accused by his brother of
being a self-hating black. Nathan aspired to join the emancipating
world of art; Coleman aspired to free himself from other people's
definitions; he wanted to be ``not black, not even white _ just on
his own and free.''
</P>
<P>
   After a stint in the Navy, the light-complexioned Coleman moved
to New York and began letting people think he was Jewish. He
married a woman named Iris (whose kinky hair, he figured, could
explain the texture of his progeny's hair), had four children and
spent the next four decades as an academic, leading a ``serious
life dedicated to serious things.'' That this life was all based on
a lie _ a lie to his wife, his children and his colleagues _ was
the trade-off, he supposed, for choosing ``to take the future into
his own hands rather than to leave it to an unenlightened society
to determine his fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth does a beautifully nuanced job _ by turns, unnerving,
hilarious and sad _ of showing how Coleman lived a double life, a
master of equivocation. Though there is the constant fear of
exposure, not to mention shame over repudiating his family, there
is also the exhilaration of keeping a secret in a ``grand and
elaborate way.'' It's a feeling, as Nathan observes, akin to what
he experiences when he sits down to write a novel, except that
Coleman's book happens to be his life: ``Once you set the thing in
motion, your art was being a white man. Being, in your brother's
words, `more white than the whites.' That was your singular act of
invention: every day you woke up to be what you had made
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   This is similar to what Roth has done throughout much of his
career, creating a series of alter egos (from Nathan Zuckerman in
the ``Zuckerman Bound'' novels to Peter Tarnopol in ``My Life as a
Man'' and Philip in ``Deception''), a gallery of ``cunning
self-concoctions'' who embody alternate fates. Like these Rothian
doppelgangers, Coleman demonstrates a taste for complicating his
life, and like them, he vacillates between two poles: between the
dutiful and the Dionysian, between the responsible and the
anarchic.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the brouhaha over his use of racist language, it
is the Dionysian side of Coleman's personality that suddenly
emerges. At age 71, with a little help from Viagra, the professor
suddenly throws himself into a torrid affair with one Faunia
Farley, an emotionally battered young woman, whose apparent
inability to read makes Coleman feel liberated from ``the
ridiculous quest for significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Faunia's illiteracy feels ridiculously contrived, and
though she is initially portrayed in the most patronizing of terms
( Roth goes so far as to write of ``the irreversible futility that
is her life''), she gradually emerges as plausible human being:
complicated, conflicted, even sympathetic in her defensive approach
to life.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, ``The Human Stain'' turns out to be peopled
with as rich and variegated a cast as ``American Pastoral.'' While
many of these characters start off as simple satiric types _
Faunia's husband, the rage-filled Vietnam vet; Coleman's academic
adversary, the snooty French structuralist _ Roth gradually fills
in their cartoonish outlines with painstakingly observed details,
allowing them to talk (and talk and talk) their way into becoming
people who are both recognizable individuals and embodiments of the
age in which Coleman so precipitously falls from grace.
</P>
<P>
   It is an era, as Nathan describes it, in which fate too often
feels accidental, personality can be reduced to gesture, and
``coherence and order'' are elusive: an era delineated in this
ample novel with uncommon insight and perception.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   It all started four summers ago, back in June 1996: the crushing
headache, a high fever, a circular rash under my armpit and
excruciating jaw pain every time I opened my mouth. After four or
five days of this agony, I went to see a nurse practitioner, who
diagnosed the jaw pain as sinusitis and prescribed an antibiotic.
She attributed the rash to an infected mole, which she removed.
Then, giving a thought to Lyme disease, she asked whether I had
been bitten by a tick. ``Not to the best of my knowledge,'' I
replied. Within 12 hours of starting the antibiotics, I was feeling
better.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, I was experiencing myriad small complaints _ a
stiff neck, unusual fatigue, general malaise. Burdened with
demanding work deadlines, I ignored these health concerns until
large, red circular rashes developed all over my skin _ a symptom,
I would later learn, indicating that Lyme-disease bacteria had
disseminated throughout my body.
</P>
<P>
   I was constantly thirsty and started having dizzy spells. At the
time, I was traveling in New Hampshire, where the disease is a
rarity, and I became quite a sensation when I showed up at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover. It was there that I
was finally diagnosed _ both clinically and with the traditional
antibody tests _ with Lyme.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered taking a walk in late May in the woods near my home
in Dutchess County, N.Y., one of the hot spots for the Lyme
epidemic. That's when I must have fallen prey to a deer tick, which
can transmit the Lyme-causing corkscrew-shaped spirochetal
bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Infection by this bacterium is especially tricky because it is
able to mimic symptoms of many other illnesses, which makes Lyme
difficult to diagnose and treat. And tiny as the ticks are in the
spring during their nymphal stage _ the size of a pinhead _ the
bite was easy to miss.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-day course of oral antibiotics often stops early-stage Lyme
if it is diagnosed and treated within two weeks of the bite.
Symptoms _ which include flulike aches, fever, jaw pain, headaches
and, in two-thirds of cases, a bull's-eye rash _ usually surface
within four to 30 days of a bite. The spirochetes, however, can
spread throughout the body within two weeks after symptoms first
appear, entering the joints and organs and making antibiotic
treatment more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that was the case for me. I developed painful
joints, crushing fatigue and debilitating short-term memory
problems. At my worst, I stuck Post-its to my sleeve to remind me
of what I needed to do.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of my official Lyme diagnosis, I had to go through
an 18-month regimen of antibiotic shots and pills. To support my
body during this time, I turned to alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Because high doses of antibiotics can disrupt friendly
intestinal flora _ and bring on yeast infections, an upset stomach
and diarrhea _ I took acidophilus, a ``probiotic'' supplement that
replenishes the body's stores of beneficial bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   I also refrained from eating sugar and such yeast-containing
foods as breads and vinegars whenever possible. In addition, I went
to an infrared sauna, used in hospitals and sports-medicine
facilities, for a 45-minute session every day for a year. This
sauna, which operates at temperatures lower than those in the
traditional type (102 degrees is said to be effective), mimics the
radiant heat of the sun and penetrates deep into the body.
</P>
<P>
   My doctor, Richard Horowitz, the assistant director of medicine
at Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and an internist
who specializes in treating Lyme, believes that raising body
temperature in this way increases the potency of antibiotics,
stimulates the immune system, can alleviate aches and pains and may
help destroy toxins created by the spirochetes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, tick-borne diseases don't end with Lyme, and
antibody tests confirmed that I also had both babesiosis and
ehrlichiosis, the two co-infections most commonly seen in Lyme
patients. Treating these co-infections is critical in helping
patients fully recover, Horowitz says, because they exacerbate Lyme
and make it harder to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms for these ailments _ which manifest themselves within
several weeks of a tick bite _ are similar to Lyme's and, if left
untreated, can persist for years: Ehrlichiosis, caused by the
ehrlichia bacterium, is marked by a high fever, headaches and neck
and/or joint pain. Babesiosis, caused by a malaria-like
red-blood-cell parasite, can bring on malaise, fever, muscular pain
and headaches. I had a particularly bad case of the latter
infection, which accounted for my exhaustion. Horowitz treated me
with more oral antibiotics for the ehrlichiosis, plus quinine and
other antimalarial drugs for the babesiosis.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about the effects of these pharmaceuticals on my body
and still suffering fatigue, joint pain and short-term-memory loss
when my antibiotic treatment was completed, I consulted Bonnie
Tarttier, M.S., a holistic nutritionist in New York's mid-Hudson
Valley. She tailored a treatment aimed at strengthening my immune
system so that it would have a better chance of fighting off the
host of diseases ticks can carry.
</P>
<P>
   To find the right supplements for me, she used an acubiofeedback
computer, which, she explained, detects viruses, heavy metals,
parasites, pesticides and other bodily stressors by measuring the
energy of the body at various acupuncture meridian points. My Lyme
disease, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis all registered on the
machine, whose database of natural remedies pinpointed the right
ones for me.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the computer's findings, Tarttier recommended
homeopathic remedies as well as homeovitic ones (vitamins given at
homeopathic dosages), to eradicate the parasites and bacteria;
horsetail tea, to strengthen my kidneys; and antioxidants
(including vitamin E and grapeseed extract), to enhance immunity.
She also prescribed an herbal formula specifically designed for
Lyme disease sufferers called Spirolyd (available through
health-care professionals). Containing sarsaparilla rhizome,
guiaiac wood, prickly-ash bark, hyssop herb and stillingia root,
Spirolyd acts as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent,
especially when taken in conjunction with a
body-temperature-elevating therapy such as the infrared sauna.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of being on these remedies, I experienced
dramatic improvements in terms of energy and the ability to focus
and was able to resume full-time work on a book project.
</P>
<P>
   Today, four years after I first fell ill, I feel absolutely
fine. I avoid walking in the woods in early spring when the deer
ticks are out in full force, sticking instead to pebbled paths
where grass won't brush against my legs. I don't want my family,
who watched my struggle with this illness, to live in fear of
ticks, so I encourage them to get outside often. And I check my
daughter and my dogs very carefully when they return home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEWARE THE BUG'S BITE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your best defense against Lyme disease is to avoid the deer
tick's primary habitat _ tall grass, brush, or woods. If you do go
for a wooded walk, take the following precautions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover up. Wear light colors (which make spotting a tick on
your body easier), long sleeves and long pants; tuck your pant legs
into your socks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a nontoxic tick repellent. To make your own: Place 10
drops of rose-geranium essential oil in an ounce of vegetable oil
and dab a few drops on your clothing and your dog's collar; be sure
to avoid eyes. If you're short on time, try Quantum's 100% Natural
Tick Repellent (800-348-0398), available in health-foods stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check your skin as soon as you return home. Do frequent spot
checks for ticks on yourself, your children and your pets. If you
find one, remove it immediately by pulling it up and out with
tweezers. Watch for symptoms of infection (bull's-eye rash, joint
pain or fever) and contact your physician immediately if any
develop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE LYME-LIGHT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reports of new Lyme disease cases remain abundant, but
innovative tests and therapies are making the condition easier to
treat. Some developments on the horizon:
</P>
<P>
   _ According to ``The Journal of the American Medical Society,''
a test that can detect the spirochetal bacterium itself should be
available this fall. (Traditional antibody tests are notorious for
false negatives, since it takes four to six weeks for antibodies to
develop _ and, in some cases, they may never develop at all.) The
new test can be used as early as a week after a tick bite,
distinguishes between active and past infection and is reported to
be 96 percent accurate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Still in the research stage, the use of hyperbaric (high
pressure) oxygen is showing promise as a therapy. A patient
breathes pure oxygen 60 minutes a day for two months. Researchers
speculate that the oxygen reaches and kills hidden bacteria that
have been left unaffected by antibiotics. Early results from tests
at Texas A&AMP;M University suggest that this therapy can relieve the
joint pain, neurological symptoms and other complications of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new Lyme disease vaccine may make sense for anyone who
spends a lot of time in the woods. Administered in three shots over
three to 12 months, LYMErix is 50 percent effective after the first
two doses and 78 percent effective after the third (an annual
booster is advised). The vaccine won't protect against other
tick-borne diseases, however. It is currently not generally
recommended for pregnant women or children under age 15.

WHAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE _ EDUCATION OR IGNORANCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush should begin a serious public
dialogue on how to reduce dramatically the financial burden of
escalating college tuition and fees, at least for medium- and
low-income American families.
</P>
<P>
   Never in history has spreading college education broadly been so
essential to a nation's future. Strength in the global society is
knowledge, not arms.
</P>
<P>
   America's cutting-edge businesses are importing educated
employees with technical skills from Asia and Europe while U.S.
youngsters go begging for the high-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Never has higher education been so indispensable to a young
person's future. Students graduating this spring with bachelor's
degrees will earn, on average, about $1 million more in their
lifetimes than their contemporaries with only high school diplomas.
Graduate degrees add even more.
</P>
<P>
   But never, sadly, has the price for obtaining higher education
in the United States risen so rapidly as since 1980. Even when
adjusted for inflation, the cost of four years in college has more
than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   During the past nine years, I've served on the board of trustees
for Texas Wesleyan University and taught a course at Texas
Christian University. I've watched two grandsons finish state
universities and two others graduate from private universities.
</P>
<P>
   In that decade I've lectured at 35 institutions of higher
learning _ from the University of Maine to San Diego State, from
Gonzaga to the University of Florida. I've talked with a lot of
college students.
</P>
<P>
   Varied student aid plans help many get the schooling that they
crave, but thousands of other desirous youths are falling through
the cracks each year, unable to meet higher education's rising
costs. The loss is not theirs alone, but the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   In one tax-supported Texas school, a professor laments: ``In the
last six years tuition has tripled, faculties have received no pay
raise, not even COLAs, and campuses have been physically
deteriorating for want of maintenance funding.''
</P>
<P>
   An award-winning Ph.D. professor with 25 years' experience tells
me that he makes $28,000 annually at a state-supported college and
cannot afford to send his own child to college.
</P>
<P>
   The share of family income required to pay college expenses has
increased markedly for middle-income families, and even more
frighteningly for those on the lower economic rung.
</P>
<P>
   According to the College Board, middle-income families paid
about 13 percent of their earnings to sustain one student in a
public four-year college in the 1970s, or 26 percent for a private
university that would cost 44 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   For working families that earn less than median income _ below
$35,000 annually _ the picture is even scarier. To maintain one
student in a state-supported university in the 1970s would have
cost such a family about 37 percent of its income (barely doable),
but a prohibitive 61 percent in the current school year.
</P>
<P>
   The average private university? Forget it! That would take 162
percent of the average low-income family's total earnings for one
student this semester.
</P>
<P>
   All this bodes ill for the future. It turns America's history in
a counterclockwise direction. Our distinguishing national
characteristic has been an ever-broadening field of opportunity and
an ever-improving lifestyle for the average American.
</P>
<P>
   The GI Bill of Rights that followed World War II provided
history's greatest single stimulus to upward mobility. From the
1940s to the early 1970s, the percent of our college-age generation
that was able to finish four years of college more than quadrupled,
growing from 4.5 percent to 21 percent. President Lyndon B.
Johnson's continuing insistence on expanding educational
opportunity kept that momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that upward spiral in America's educational level
was stymied beginning in 1981, when Reagan budget cuts began
hacking away at federal educational assistance. Through the 1990s,
federal support has inched upward almost imperceptibly but hasn't
recovered the slack caused from lost momentum in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton made an effort at the beginning of his
first term with AmeriCorps. That bold initiative was harshly
truncated by a penurious Congress, reduced to a tiny experimental
level and never allowed to approach its potential.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to give free tuition in exchange for specific
public service rendered on officially approved public projects
(similar to the Depression-era WPA or CCC, except that the payoff
would be education rather than wages).
</P>
<P>
   With the right start and enthusiastic support, that initiative
could have worked. It still might. Trading opportunity to ambitious
kids from working families, it could have been as big as the Peace
Corps _ almost as big as the GI Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly escalating tuition and fees across America are not the
results of poor university management or slothful spending, or of
declining philanthropic gifts. They're the unavoidable results of
shrinking state and federal financial participation.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical review presented by the College Board reveals
that private gifts and grants covered 5 percent of college costs in
1980 and 6 percent in 1996. Local government contributions remain
steady at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal role fell to only 12 percent, and state
governments reduced their share of university support from 31
percent down to 23 percent. The only thing left to take up the
slack has been to raise student-paid tuition and fees. That is
throttling the dramatic expansion of higher education that the
times increasingly demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, taxpayers collectively ante up about $42,000 a year
for each prisoner in our burgeoning penitentiaries, but only about
$3,200 for each student in our state institutions of higher
learning.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody once complained to then-Sen. Lloyd Bentsen that public
higher education was an expensive burden to the taxpayer. ``That's
right,'' replied Bentsen, ``but not half as expensive as
ignorance!''

COLUMN: PUTTING CANCER IN ITS PLACE AND FEELING IN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOYCE PURNICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will Mayor Rudolph Giuliani pursue his Senate
campaign now that he has prostate cancer?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question many are asking right now, and mostly the
matter is being analyzed in political terms. You have no doubt
heard the theories. The prevailing one: That maybe Giuliani will
not run because he was never all that fired up about being a
senator anyway. Others say that of course he will run, that he is
even stronger now, more sympathetic and acting more congenial. The
mayor will not decide about the campaign for a few weeks, after he
selects a course of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly do not presume to have any insights into his
thinking. But I will presume to make a few informed predictions,
the central one being that the mayor's decision will not be
political. It will be deeply personal. And if his prognosis remains
favorable and his cancer is treatable, as his doctors now say, then
for sure he will continue his campaign for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions can be risky. But I do not think this one is, for a
reason about as basic as you can get: the force of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with a life-threatening disease, people
overwhelmingly want to do precisely what they were doing before
that awful day in the doctor's office when they got the news.
</P>
<P>
   Unless hit with an incapacitating condition, most patients want
normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Some may choose to go on a world tour, or, as a friend did
temporarily, indulge a desire to write poetry. Some collapse under
the pressure. But most want things to be the way they were, because
that helps you feel normal at a time when nothing else does.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre went back to managing the Yankees after his treatment
for prostate cancer last year. Ed Koch went back to being mayor
after he had a minor stroke in 1987. David Letterman returned to
his television program after his quintuple bypass surgery in
January. A dear colleague who recently died of AIDS-related
pneumonia stayed on the job, choosing to work his regular night
shift as an editor, after his diagnosis years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, a freelance writer, celebrated when she got a
routine magazine assignment while she was in chemotherapy for
breast cancer. She could be herself again, she said.
</P>
<P>
   I remember feeling the same way when, after a lumpectomy for
breast cancer seven years ago, I continued to work while I
underwent radiation and chemotherapy. It's not that you want to be
heroic. It's that you want to prove _to yourself more than to
anyone else _ that you are still you.
</P>
<P>
   That a few errant cells wreaking havoc on your body had not
impeded your ability to function as ever you had.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, being resentful of the cancer's frightful
power. When you have a serious illness that you cannot control, you
want to control what you can, especially your daily life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working gives you strength, brings you back into the world,''
Barbara Barrie, the actress, said the other day. She appeared in a
starring role in Anne Meara's ``After-Play'' during her
chemotherapy treatments for colo-rectal cancer in 1994. ``I
instinctively knew that working would help my recovery,'' said
Barrie, who wrote about her illness in ``Don't Die of
Embarrassment'' (Scribner, 1999). ``George Bernard Shaw called it a
life force _ what you experience as a human being, a determination
to get back into life, be a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's life is politics. It is very possible that he does
not relish being one of 100 senators; that, facing the end of his
mayoral tenure next year because of term limits, he decided to run
for Senate by default. He would probably rather be governor,
running things. But Gov. George Pataki may run again in 2002 and
that would leave Giuliani in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   That was clearly the mayor's calculation when he decided to try
for the Senate. The betting here is that, prognosis permitting, he
will return to sparring with Hillary Rodham Clinton after he
recovers from his course of treatment _ not because his illness
changed the political calculus, though it might.
</P>
<P>
   But because, despite his often fierce demeanor, Giuliani is not
all that different from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, he, too, will want to thumb his nose at cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, will want to feel in control, connected to the world
and his prediagnosis life. When he got the bad news last Wednesday,
he was a politician running for office. He still is.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Rudy run.

 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   Once, all the experts advised us to ``obedience train'' our
dogs. Now, in a trend that stresses communication, they encourage
us to ``understand their minds'' and discover the depth and
richness possible in the human-animal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, training remains a necessity: For their own safety,
dogs must learn to sit, lie down, stay and come on request. They
also need to be taught to respect people and other pets so they can
participate comfortably within the structures of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   But training no longer requires a struggle for dominance. When
you have developed a rapport with a dog and established realistic
expectations, training becomes a lot more fun for both owner and
dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be predictable, but not rigid with our pets,'' says
Dr. Karen Overall, director of the Behavior Clinic at the
Veterinary Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in
Philadelphia. ``Why should we be so obsessed with walking our dogs
on a perfect heel? We ought to allow dogs some autonomy, to respect
their inherent needs. Let them sniff the sidewalk. All that yanking
and yelling just leads to problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Boss, owner of Best Friends Dog Obedience in Baltimore,
Md., supports the trend toward relaxing strict obedience standards.
``In the ideal situation,'' says Boss, ``we should be able to use
our voice and our body to communicate with our dogs in order to
shape their behavior without having to rely on clickers, treats,
extreme jerking or yelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs thrive on positive training,'' explains Boss. ``They like
knowing the rules, and they want to please you. Humans must take
the role of leader, but being the 'boss' doesn't mean being an
ogre.''
</P>
<P>
   Training a dog begins by delving into the workings of the canine
mind. From the bevy of books currently available, select and read
more than one. Once you've sorted through some of the prevailing
theories and have developed an educated point of view, consider a
class.
</P>
<P>
   Classes _ puppy kindergarten, basic obedience or the newer
companion-dog classes _ can add depth and dimension to your
new-found insight. While executing the theories and practices
you've read about, you'll have a professional on hand to guide you,
peers will encourage your progress and your dog will be interacting
with people and other dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Observe a class before signing up. ``If they won't let you sit
in,'' warns Boss, steer clear. Watch for any rough handling or
hitting. Praise should be emphasized over correction, because
successes lead to good habits.''
</P>
<P>
   Praise is an important element of any behavior modification.
You'll need to find the level that works best for your dog, so that
the dog is neither overstimulated (and loses focus) nor
underappreciated (and loses interest). If you can anticipate the
dog's behavior, and praise encouragingly while manipulating and
guiding it, rather than overcorrecting, you'll build that positive
and most rewarding foundation for appropriate behavior and a strong
bond.
</P>
<P>
   While starting a class with a newly acquired puppy is the
traditional wisdom, older dogs can learn new tricks in a basic
obedience or companion-dog class. ``We've had dogs that were 10
years old in our classes,'' says Boss, ``and today more and more
people are adopting 'secondhand dogs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs respond to training more quickly and easily than
others. For many, progress in training is cumulative, moving in
bits and pieces rather than in huge leaps _ a factor that often
leads to impatience or frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every dog should have some kind of manners training, but if a
class isn't working, don't force it,'' advises Overall. Some dogs
just aren't suited to certain settings. Many basic obedience or
companion-dog classes are becoming more flexible and incorporating
playtime into the lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Overall frequently advises dog owners to try agility classes,
where dogs utilize the basics of obedience training while engaged
in directed activities that will let them thrive and have fun. And
Boss is introducing practical lessons into her puppy classes, such
as ``polite walking'' (instead of formal heeling), sitting still
for vet exams and fetching as a positive outlet for all that puppy
energy.
</P>
<P>
   However we decide to train our dogs, they are observing us all
the time. Everything we do with, or to, our dogs affects their
attitude and behavior _ from the way we let them out in the morning
to where they sleep at night.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we look upon dogs as children, entertainers, equals or
heroes, dogs expect and ardently desire for us to become their
kindly leaders. Investigating and tapping into a dog's potential
can pay off in a long and rewarding relationship. But there's an
extra benefit, too. ``Making an effort to understand the dog,''
Overall believes, ``will make you into the kind of person your dog
already believes you to be.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEARNING BY THE BOOK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some books to get your understanding of dogs off on the
right foot. ``Kinship with All Life'' (HarperSanFrancisco; 1954;
$12), by J. Allen Boone, is a seminal book for animal lovers. Also
look for Desmond Morris' ``Dogwatching'' (Three Rivers; 1986; $8);
``Manners for the Modern Dog'' (Perfect Paws; 1994; $9.95), by Gwen
Bohnenkamp; ``Mother Knows Best or Second-Hand Dog'' (Howell; 1985
and 1988; $22.95 and $6, respectively), by Carol Lea Benjamin;
``The Tao of Bow Wow'' (Dell; 1998; $9.95), by Deborah Wood; ``The
Perfect Puppy'' (Readers Digest; 1995; $19.95), by Gwen Bailey;
and/or ``The Dog Whisperer'' (Adams Media; 1999; $10.95), by Paul
Owens.

<P>
   Three hundred and seven miles northeast of Los Angeles, smack
dab in the Sierra Nevadas, Mammoth Mountain is one of California's
premier ski resorts; 15,000 skiers swarm the slopes on a good
weekend, and anyone who has ever strapped on skis knows that all of
them would be standing ahead of you in line.
</P>
<P>
   Not today. Ahead, empty gondolas swing up to Mammoth's
11,053-foot summit. Below, the slopes are bereft of skiers, this
being mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   I share the gondola with a goateed, 20-something fellow who
doesn't say a word until we roll our mountain bikes out onto the
summit. A cool wind whips in our ears. Distant mountain ridges,
many of them still capped with snow, ring us.
</P>
<P>
   Now my fellow adventurer speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insane,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Had you approached ski resort owners 20 years ago and suggested
they open their slopes to mountain bikers in summer you might have
received the same assessment. Today, ski resorts have discovered
that summer has meaning too _ which is why there are currently over
150 resorts, including Mammoth, that entertain mountain bikers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a natural marriage. Lifts are already in place to ferry
bikers to various summits. Cross-country ski trails and access
roads already ribbon the slopes. Mammoth hosts professional
mountain bike contests and anywhere from 200 to 1,000 recreational
riders a day
</P>
<P>
   Bike rangers trained in emergency aid patrol the trails (there
are few serious injuries but lots of scrapes), and at the base of
the mountain, you can sip cappucino at the Gearhead Cafe, or buy a
trail pass, rent a bike, grab a trail map or poke through glitzy
bike gear at the Bike Center next door.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is nice. But in my mind, mountain biking's real
appeal is the chance to escape this stuff, to explore and see
supernatural beauty via two-wheel quiet _ and with 70-plus miles of
groomed single-track trails lacing 3,500 acres of slope and forest,
Mammoth offers plenty of opportunity for that.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, many of the trails can be negotiated by riders
with minimal off-road skills. Those that demand more are clearly
marked in black on the trail map and anointed with telltale names
such as Skid Marks, Brake Through and Kamikaze, the latter being a
legendary teary-eyed, snot-smearing, 4.5-mile fallaway from Mammoth
Mountain's summit that sees skilled riders hit speeds of 60-plus
mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that mountain biking was founded by adrenaline freaks.
But the sport has since been taken up by droves of conventional
folk who understand that life insurance policies don't cover
free-falling down crevices, and that's mostly who the
ski-cum-mountain bike resorts cater to.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to lure more business, they offer attractive packages,
too. You might enjoy a two-night hotel stay (including breakfast),
two days of mountain bike rental, a park pass and several hours
with a guide for under $300. My guide, Chris Hosking, was a
transplanted Englishman and one-time member of England's national
mountain bike team. It didn't take Hosking long to read my needs
and my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use your brakes as much as you want and take time to enjoy the
views,'' he said when we met in front of the Bike Center on a
Wednesday morning. ``Go slow, and if you get to something that's
too difficult, get off.''
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious Hosking knew teaching too. Rather than sit in
front of the Bike Center, we immediately set off down an easy
downhill trail called Paper Route so that he could judge my
prowess.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Hosking began reviewing basic off-road dos and
don'ts. Don't jam on the front brake (you'll go over the
handlebars). Don't attempt sudden directional changes in soft dirt
or mid-turn (you'll go down). Do move your butt out over your back
tire during steep descents to keep the rear wheel planted firmly on
the ground. Do scan the trail ahead (unaddressed rocks, tree roots
and drop-offs abruptly enliven a ride). Do exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   I tried hard to focus on what Hosking was saying, but I must
confess I found it difficult to pay attention. Single track is
roughly a foot wide (and often narrower), and most of Mammoth's
single track was well groomed, at points even cupped into a sort of
smooth half-pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Riding Paper Route, a long gradual decline, was like descending
a curvy luge track. We swooped down through a tunnel of pine,
piercing cool shadows and flickering sunlight. Well, Hosking
swooped. But even my liberal use of brakes didn't dilute the magic.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we found ourselves back at the base of the mountain.
It was time for Hosking to go, but before he did he nodded at the
summit and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can do it,'' he said, ``and now you know how to use
your brakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He surveyed the dark clouds planing overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'd ride the Kamikaze now. Those clouds are going to
build. There's a risk of the gondola being closed because of
thunder and lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   I squandered as much time as I could, but the weather refused to
cooperate _ which is how I found myself standing at the summit with
my goateed friend, our noses pointed into a black sign proclaiming
``You are at the start of the Kamikaze, the West's Most Outrageous
Ride''.
</P>
<P>
   This only served to heighten Goatee's enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radical,'' he grinned.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting up, he adjusted his helmet and nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you at the bottom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only if he pitched a tent. Because the important point is this _
no hill is terrifying if negotiated properly. And so my descent was
bereft of the shrieking of brakes except when I stopped, which I
did often. The view was shockingly wonderful, a head-spinning,
360-degree panorama of mountain crags and glinting lakes and great
green valleys, quilt-work squares of pine and forest and grass.
</P>
<P>
   It was so wonderful that I took the gondola back to the summit
first thing the next day. This time I descended via a tamer route
called ``Off The Top.'' I junked the map _ Mammoth's trails are
well marked with neat wooden signs _ and simply rode where my nose
led me.
</P>
<P>
   The sun warmed my face, a soft wind moved the pines. I crossed
white, bright sand and skirted tiny, round lakes, the bike's wheels
crunching merrily beneath me. I dropped through dark corridors of
pine and stopped to look at empty chairlifts swaying and creaking
in the sun. In four hours, I saw five other riders.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Chris had told me it would be hard to get lost but I
did, which is how I happened on a lovely trail, soft with pine
needles and split by streams edged with purple-flowered stalks and
forded by mossy, wooden footbridges.
</P>
<P>
   Even now I can't find the trail on the map _ which is precisely
the point.
</P>
<P>
   SKI SLOPES FOR BIKING
</P>
<P>
   Over 150 ski resorts entertain mountain bikers in the United
States alone. (For a state-by-state listing, visit the National Ski
Areas Association's Web site:
www.nsaa.org/MemberUpdate/mtnbiking.htm). Many offer mountain bike
packages, complete with hotel stay and bike rental. Or you can
bring your own bike and ride off for as little as $8 for a trail
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Mammoth Mountain, Mammoth Calif., in the Sierra Nevadas, with
70-plus miles of groomed trails, lives up to its name. There are
plenty of easy trails for the novice (even a shuttle service that
leaves every 30 minutes from the Daily Grind to run you, your bike
and your homemade muffin back up to the base of the mountain).
1-800-626-6684, or www.mammoth-mtn.com
</P>
<P>
   The Killington Ski Area, Killington, Vt., has 45 miles of
lift-serviced trails and five mountains from which to descend.
Pedal to the top of 4,241-foot Killington Peak (or save your wind
and take the K1 Express Gondola). Rent bikes, enjoy guided tours
with instruction. Killington Mountain Bike Center, 802-422-6232.
For mountain bike packages, 1-800-621-MTNS. Or
www.killington.com/summer/biking.html
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day, from the top of 11,000-foot Hidden Peak at the
Snowbird Ski Resort, Salt Lake City, Utah, you can see over 100
miles. It's a happy coincidence that the rugged Wasatch Mountains
fill much of that view. Enjoy cascading waterfalls and riots of
summer wildflowers. Also, this is your chance to preview this site
for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 801-742-2222, or www.snowbird.com
</P>
<P>
   At the Chestnut Mountain Resort, Galena, Ill., you may only be
able to pedal up to 3,500 feet (this is Illinois), but you can do
so while overlooking the mighty Mississippi. As a nice bonus, you
can also ride the Twilight, a diesel-powered Victorian-style
riverboat that plies the river. 1-800-397-1320, or

EXPERT TALK ABOUT BOY STIRS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ERICA GOODE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long after the courts untangle Elian Gonzalez's future, mental
health professionals may still be pondering the meaning of their
own involvement in the Cuban boy's American odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists and psychologists have taken an active, and often
very public, part in the unfolding drama, advising government
officials, voicing their opinions on talk shows and in news
accounts, escorting Elian on his flight to Washington and even, in
one case, assisting Diane Sawyer in her interview with the
6-year-old on ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the field are happy that their oft-maligned profession
is receiving serious notice. And they note that the experts helped
government officials make informed decisions and provided context
for a public riveted by Elian's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pressures of intense publicity and political interest,
others feel, at times led experts into uncharted and risky
territory.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the professionals directly involved were not
acting as Elian's doctors, bound by strict confidentiality
requirements, but as ``examiners'' or ``consultants'' hired by
third parties, a role similar to that of experts who testify in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Such functions, said Dr. Thomas Gutheil, an expert in psychiatry
and law at Harvard University Medical School, are governed by
different, often broader, ethical and clinical considerations.
</P>
<P>
   A medical escort, for example, like the government psychiatrist
who accompanied Elian on the airplane, is acting ``as a simple
observer, and is not incorporating a treatment relationship,''
Gutheil said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other mental health professionals argue that the public is
not always able to make such distinctions. And they worry that the
public discussion of Elian's case, while it may have fallen within
ethical bounds, may ultimately harm their profession.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Dr. Gunther Perdigao, a child psychoanalyst who
speaks Spanish, during the ``Good Morning America'' interview, for
instance, has stirred some controversy within the American
Psychoanalytic Association, which, at ABC's behest, recommended
Perdigao for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Perdigao said his role was to make sure Sawyer ``wasn't doing
anything that would be hurtful or damaging to the child.'' He
offered advice on how to talk to Elian, translated and suggested
the drawing exercise in which Elian drew pictures of his boat trip
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a child therapy session,'' Perdigao said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Robert Galatzer-Levy, a psychoanalyst in Chicago, said
that he was not sure the public could tell the difference and that
the analyst's presence might have lent authority to an interview
some criticized as exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that it is of the greatest importance that
people, when they are talking to a mental health professional, know
that their communications are confidential,'' Galatzer-Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leon Hoffman, chairman of the psychoanalytic association's
public information committee, said members would discuss the
decision to provide an expert for the program at meetings later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Public statements about Elian's situation by professionals who
had not interviewed him personally, including the team of experts
engaged by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, also raise
difficult questions, some observers feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly legitimate for the government to seek expert
advice in complex situations,'' said Dr. Paul Applebaum, chairman
of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in
Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not clear to me,'' Applebaum said, ``that there is
any substantial benefit to sharing those conclusions with the
public, and there may be harm _ harm to child and harm to the
integrity of the mental health profession, resulting in the false
impression that most professionals are so quick to draw conclusions
they are willing to do so even if they haven't laid eyes on the
person.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association
discourages psychiatrists from speaking publicly about cases
involving people they have not evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Irwin Redlener, the pediatrician who organized the team
of mental health experts for the INS, said that given what was at
stake for Elian, the fact that the consultants were acting as
government representatives and the extraordinary public scrutiny of
the case, the public comments made by the professionals were
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to be very, very careful about the words they
used,'' he said. ``And the opinions were critically germane at
virtually every step of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, many aspects of professionals' participation in
the case could benefit from some ``really thoughtful analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so far outside the norm,'' Redlener said. ``There was
a kind of tacit approval by society to allow this unbelievable
exposure of what should have been a private matter.''

<P>
   There's something heartwarming about a hand-lettered sign that
advertises farm-stand peaches, fresh eggs or a small town ice-cream
parlor's flavors of the day. Whether it's nostalgia for
old-fashioned goods or the simplicity of the message, these
colorful pieces of Americana have long been magnets for collectors
and for artisans who strive to replicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising is as American as apple pie _ and older than the
nation itself _ but Colonial trade signs relied more on symbols
than on words to relay their messages. As the nation flourished and
literacy spread, simple hand-lettered signs began to advertise the
staples of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most signs were made individually, so they're one of a kind,''
says Aarne Anton, president of the American Primitive Gallery, in
New York City. ``Each piece is a work of art. That's part of the
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The finest placards were the work of professional sign painters,
who found steady work as America became increasingly mobile
throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. When the Gold Rush
lured people out West in the 1840s, new saloons and other
enterprises created an explosion in sign making. Decades later,
automobile travel gave rise to roadside ads, and technical
developments like the ability to lithograph pictures and messages
on tin allowed signs to be mass-produced.
</P>
<P>
   Most signs were designed to hang outdoors, where they took a
real beating from the elements. But even indoor signs endured
scratches and discoloration over time. It is this aged appearance
that today's collectors crave, and which contemporary artisans go
to great lengths to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Wood fished out of Boston Harbor gives Massachusetts craftsman
Robert Stella's signs a weathered appearance. Mary Thompson, of the
Wyoming company, Games People Played, painstakingly ages her
agrarian-themed placards with elbow grease and ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apply paint by hand and then begin the aging process, using
everything from rainwater to mud,'' she says. ``I try to mimic the
wear that would appear on a sign that has been nailed to a fruit
stand for several seasons. Creating things that look old gives my
work a connection with the past.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many artisans like Stella and Thompson who pride
themselves on the care that they take to age each of their
old-fashioned signs. The drawback to their expertise is that
unscrupulous or uninformed dealers can pass off reproductions as
valuable antiques.
</P>
<P>
   To purchase antiques with confidence, deal only with trusted
sources and learn as much as you can about the look and feel of old
pieces. Examine the front and back of a sign. Each should bear
signs of age, but the back will typically be less worn than the
front, since it most likely hung against a wall. Vintage signs also
display nail holes, screw holes or special hardware that attached
them to a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's just a board with lettering on it, you have to
question how it was attached,'' antiques dealer Aarne Anton
advises.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat emptor. Buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUYER'S GUIDE ANTIQUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desirable hand-lettered signs from the 19th and early 20th
centuries range from about $200 to several thousand dollars,
depending on condition and graphics. Simple mid-20th century signs
can often be found for less than $100.

SNIFFING OUT THE RELATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the woes of Oedipus and cuckolds of every species attest,
there are many instances in which it would be useful to know just
how closely related other individuals are to oneself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so great are the evolutionary benefits of being able to
dole out goodies like food only to one's close relations or to
avoid inbreeding by choosing mates from among nonrelatives that
some biologists have predicted that animals may evolve the ability
to recognize kin with just a sniff or a look _ a phenomenon known
as the ``armpit effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in a new study from Cornell, researchers report what some
call the first solid evidence to support this controversial
phenomenon. In the paper, published last month in the Proceedings
of the Royal Society, Dr. Jill Mateo, an animal behaviorist, and
Dr. Robert Johnston, a psychologist, concluded that golden hamsters
could recognize relatives they had never met from a group of
hamster strangers, simply by giving them a good long sniff. Never
having smelled relatives before, the hamsters, researchers say,
appear to be using their own body odor as a reference for what
family smells like, exactly as the armpit effect predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say the logic behind the armpit effect is that some
characteristics, including smell, should reflect an animal's
genetic makeup. The closer the relationship, the more genes are
shared and the more similar, for example, the body bouquet of the
two parties should be. But the armpit effect has been difficult to
demonstrate and some experts dismissed it as impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most convincing demonstration that I've ever seen
of the armpit effect,'' said Dr. Wayne Getz, mathematical biologist
at University of California, who has looked for the armpit effect
in honeybees. The phenomenon got its colorful moniker when the
evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins suggested that humans would
most likely compare underarm odors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Sherman, behavioral ecologist at Cornell, who was not
involved with the new study but has looked for the armpit effect in
ground squirrels, said, ``This is exciting. It's a viable way of
recognizing relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists said the new work suggested that the armpit
effect _ in which animals can compare not only their own smells,
but appearances or sounds to that of others _ could be widespread
among animals, perhaps even humans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, researchers say the new study could help explain a
number of curious phenomena like the so-called T-shirt study. In
that experiment, women were shown to prefer the smells of T-shirts
of men who were more genetically dissimilar to them, possibly in
unconscious attempts to avoid inbreeding. Scientists now say these
women may have been comparing the T-shirt smells to their own as a
way of identifying unrelated mates.
</P>
<P>
   In the armpit effect _ an animal uses only itself as a reference
not the look or smell of family members. Previous studies had been
unable to rule out the possibility that animals might be using
their family's smells as the gold standard, rather than their own
in order to claim kin.
</P>
<P>
   To keep hamsters from experiencing the smells of their real
family, researchers removed the tiny hamster pups from their nest
within hours of birth, well before they were thought to be able to
smell. Having been raised with different-smelling stranger
hamsters, the hamsters were then presented with the smells of true
siblings or foster siblings. The hamsters only sniffed briefly, an
indication that they recognized the smells as family. In contrast,
they dashed over to and then lingered much longer at the smells of
unrelated strangers _ a typical response for hamsters in defensive
mode or in search of mates.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is astonishing that these hamsters were able to
distinguish smells of siblings at all because all the hamsters were
closely related to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all descended from four hamsters caught in the
1930s,'' said Mateo. ``If they can do it, natural populations
should be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had predicted that animals might evolve such keen
powers of discrimination because they allowed one to reap
potentially huge evolutionary benefits. Animals that can sniff out
or spy kin can then provide food or protection to their closest
relatives only, even in proportion to the blood-tie closeness.
</P>
<P>
   Because closer relatives share more genes, animals that provide
for their close kin are helping promote the survival and
reproduction of their own genes, exactly what natural selection is
all about. In addition, many animals _ including humans _ appear to
avoid inbreeding, making identifying nonrelatives critical.
</P>
<P>
   Just what golden hamsters are using their keen powers of
genealogical discrimination for in nature remains unknown.
Well-known as a laboratory species, golden hamsters have been
poorly studied in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The new study may also help explain a curious discovery in
peacocks. Male peacocks gather in groups to display to females to
entice females to mate. In other species, such cooperative males
have been found to be closely related, probably because often only
one male gets all the matings. But researchers studying peacocks in
Whipsnade Park in England, did not expect to find the birds to
gather with relatives, since these birds were not raised with
relatives and had no way of learning who their relatives were.
Somehow though, the peacocks recognized their kin and tended to
display with them _ something researchers say might now be chalked
up to the armpit effect.
</P>
<P>
   Other research suggesting that humans may use the armpit effect
include studies in small, closed religious groups showing that
people tend to avoid marrying genetically similar people. In
addition, those couples that were more genetically dissimilar also
tended to have fewer miscarriages, suggesting that humans do avoid
inbreeding _ perhaps with the help of the armpit effect _ and for
good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The only definitive way to test whether these people, or the
women in the T-shirt studies, were using their own smells as clues,
as opposed to the smells of their families, would be to do the
experiment as was done with the hamsters. Babies would need to be
removed at birth, raised with nonrelatives and then tested for
their ability to smell out a T-shirt or a mate. Such a study
clearly presents more than a few ethical and logistical
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much controversy about the armpit effect. Dr.
Richard Alexander, behavioral ecologist at the University of
Michigan, has repeatedly criticized past studies that tried to show
the effect, pointing out their weaknesses. And, he has suggested
that on theoretical grounds, such capabilities are unlikely to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander also questioned what the hamsters were doing when they
became excited by the smells of strangers, but not kin. Alexander
said they might be simply ignoring the smells of relatives,
thinking that those were just their own smells. ``They're just
making a mistake,'' he said. ``They think, `Oh, that's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   But other researchers say mistake is a misnomer. All that
matters, they say, is that the hamsters, for whatever reason,
distinguish between kin and nonkin solely by their own smells.
</P>
<P>
   The new study also raises interesting questions about smells and
recognizing relatives. For example, if smell figures so importantly
in keeping humans from inbreeding, why is it that humans spend so
much on things like deodorants, which hide their message-carrying
odors? &QL;

   The Cat's Mad Dash
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do cats periodically run around madly as if they were
chasing a fire engine?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``I think it is more evolutionary than anything physiological
like a melatonin drop,'' said Dr. Katherine Houpt, a veterinarian
with a Ph.D. in behavioral biology, who directs the Animal Behavior
Clinic at Cornell. ``I think it is a form of play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden sprint is possibly related to hunting techniques,
Houpt suggested. ``You don't usually see it in farm cats, who have
to work for a living,'' she said. ``Their predatory behavior
involves sitting beside a mouse hole for hours, then pouncing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mad dash is often seen among well-fed, secure,
happy house cats. ``They often seem to be stimulating themselves
like a child on a swing,'' Houpt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cats are crepuscular animals that hunt at dawn and dusk, and the
run around often coincides with the time they would ordinarily be
hunting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tearing rush ``is not a problem for most owners unless it is
associated with attacks on any moving foot or it culminates in a
run up the silk draperies,'' Houpt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a problem,'' she suggested, ``try interactive play
with a pouncing toy and see if doesn't stop or reduce the fire
engine behavior.''

ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL IS BECOMING THE COUNTRY MUSIC EQUIVALENT OF
SANTANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABILENE, Texas _ To appreciate the slice of fame Asleep at the
Wheel has carved for itself, it's a good idea to be standing here,
as the sun goes down and the band _ sequestered in its big, comfy
tour bus _ prepares to take the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A rock band that had been around 30 years and won eight Grammys
(including two this past February) would probably be preparing to
play Dallas' Starplex or Reunion Arena. There would be legions of
fans hoping for a glimpse, a lavish backstage buffet, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Wheel, though, can look forward to none of this. A gig is a
gig is a gig, and this one is headlining the Celebrate Abilene!
festival: One stage, a few booths, the locals sitting at rows of
tables, chomping on big plates of steak.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the Wheel is the most famous western swing band
working. Last year's ``Ride With Bob,'' a tribute to Bob Wills and
the Texas Playboys, has become their biggest record, and in
February the CD's leadoff track, ``Bob's Breakdowns,'' won the
Grammy Award for Country Instrumental of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep just finished opening several dates for Bob Dylan in the
Northwest, at Dylan's request. On Wednesday, they'll be up for two
awards (Album of the Year and Top Vocal Group) at the Academy of
Country Music Awards. And this summer, they'll be playing stadiums,
opening for big fan George Strait.
</P>
<P>
   And yet here they are: no buffet, no adoring fans at the
backstage gate, and only a too-small, windblown stage, congealing
food in takeout boxes and a long drive back to Austin after the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Such is mega-success, western swing-style.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, no complaining in the voice of the group's
founder, Ray Benson, as he sits on the bus and warms up on guitar.
A large man with a voice and hands to match, Benson is the band's
mouthpiece, lead singer, guitarist and mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   He's the guy who came up with the idea of teaming Asleep with 20
country and pop stars, from Merle Haggard to Don Walser to the
Squirrel Nut Zippers, and in the process did for his band what
``Supernatural'' did for Santana.
</P>
<P>
   Right now he's searching for a guitar tuner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's all show business,'' he says, tucked into a booth
and limbering up with some jazz riffs. ``Up and down, up and down,
or else up and down and you're out. We got into this to play music
and bring back older music that's been forgotten and I think we're
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson is taking success in stride _ probably because he's seen
so many years when Asleep at the Wheel was a cult act, loved by
hard-core western swing fans and unknown to everybody else. He can
say he never got into this to be famous without being disingenuous
because, frankly, no matter how influential western swing has been
on generations of musicians, it hasn't been country's hip sub-genre
since Wills and his Playboys.
</P>
<P>
   Benson and his band (steel guitarist Cindy Cashdollar, fiddler
Jason Roberts, bassist David Miller, drummer David Sanger, 20-year
vet Michael Francis on saxophone and newest member John Michael
Whitby on piano) may never be able to change that completely.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no question that by fusing the old tunes with young
hotshots such as the Dixie Chicks and established stars such as
Haggard, Willie, Tim McGraw and Reba McEntire, Asleep is
introducing western swing to a new audience, and rejuvenating
longtime fans.
</P>
<P>
   To Benson, this just makes sense. He grew up with country music
before falling under the spell of Wills (as well as Count Basie,
Big Joe Turner and Louis Jordan) as a teen; he formed Asleep at the
Wheel in 1970 in Virginia and, three years later, relocated to
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Texas, and it was Willie,'' he says. ``Willie said,
`Hey, you need to be down here' and boom, here we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Benson never regretted the decision: Gigs in Austin
were plentiful, and the band had arrived just as the outlaw-country
movement took over the town and changed the face of country music.
</P>
<P>
   Their third LP, 1975's ``Texas Gold,'' broke them to a national
audience with a mix of standards such as ``Trouble in Mind'' and
originals such as ``Bump Bounce Boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   But just five years later, bad times arrived. Slick country-pop
took over, and between 1981 and 1984 the band didn't have a label.
</P>
<P>
   Benson produced numerous artists, from Willie to Aaron Neville
to Bruce Hornsby, but those were lean years: People would bump into
him on the street and ask if the group had broken up, even while he
was doing 120 or so (mainly low-profile) gigs per year and
wondering when, or if, he'd get another shot.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, though, Asleep at the Wheel was, and is, a major
country act and influences numerous musicians, not just for its
music but because the band has shown real staying power as the
winds of country taste have blown this way and that.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Ray is like our uncle in the country music business,'' says
Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines. ``He's taught us so much
about the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Ann Womack, who grew up going to Alseep gigs in West Texas,
says the band is ``just so good at what they do _ they're not
chasing something anybody else is doing. That's why they're so
important. They've never changed what they do _ they stand for
something. And Ray taught me by example, the way Merle and Ray
Price did, about just being about the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Epic gave the band its second shot with 1987's ``Asleep at the
Wheel 10,'' which scored via two hits, ``House of Blue Lights'' and
``Way Down Texas Way.'' ``String of Pearls'' won the Grammy for
Best Country Instrumental Performance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the group released ``A Tribute to the Music of Bob
Wills &AMP; the Texas Playboys.'' The blueprint for ``Ride With Bob,''
it featured contributions from Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, Strait and
Dolly Parton, among others.
</P>
<P>
   And five years later, Benson picked up the phone and told
DreamWorks' general manager and head of label operations, Wayne
Halper, that he wanted to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `Let's do volume two' and I said, `I'm in, my
friend,''' Halper says. ``What Asleep at the Wheel does for country
music is put a smile on people's faces _ they're goodwill
ambassadors. I've known Ray for 20 years. I don't know anybody that
doesn't like Ray Benson and doesn't owe him a favor. I signed them
in the summer of '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson was aware of the changes in country music, and that
during the five years between records, there had been numerous new
acts on the rise, and numerous older ones, such as Don Walser,
finally getting some much-deserved attention. He'd be able to hit a
whole new audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create in our own little way the whole legacy of
western swing,'' he says. ``There were three criteria _ being
interested in western swing, being from Texas, being a friend of
mine. Preferably all three.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Benson began recruiting people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dixie Chicks did `Roly Poly' in their shows, so that was a
good fit,'' he says. ``Some of 'em I asked if there was a
particular song they wanted to sing and some of 'em I said, `This
is what I hear you doing _ how 'bout it?' And they all said yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack teamed with the band to cut the 1960 hit ``Heart to Heart
Talk'' because it was her father's favorite song.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd always wanted me to do that song,'' she says. ``I ran
into Ray somewhere and he asked if I would participate and I asked
if I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, two months after the Grammys, Benson plays down the
comparisons to Santana and how recruiting young blood was
instrumental in ``Supernatural'' selling 11 million copies and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think, `God, I wish I could sell as many records as he
does,''' he says of Santana. ``We both play guitar, we both wear a
hat, we've both been around 30 years. We both play the same 12
notes _ just a little different. And we're both still around.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Ride'' slots into the current landscape of country
music: The range of guests artists is wide enough to entice fans of
mainstream and alternative country; both camps can see it as hip,
and everyone can enjoy the kitschy cover and CD booklet, which won
the band a Grammy for Best Album Packaging.
</P>
<P>
   And back in Abilene, all that comes together where real country
music always does _ on the dance floor. The band starts off with
``Cherokee Maiden,'' with Benson, Roberts and Cashdollar trading
solos, and then moves through older material such as ``Miles and
Miles of Texas'' and ``Amarillo by Morning'' and the ``Bob'' cut
``Roly Poly.'' The band is tight, Benson's baritone is smooth, and
Cashdollar and Roberts shine as slyly inventive, playful soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Out in front, the street quickly fills with couples _ first the
over-40s, then younger folks, all circling the soundboard as they
two-step and waltz. Suddenly the wind doesn't seem so bad, and
there's a genuinely festive air to the proceedings. Asleep at the
Wheel will play better shows, and certainly ones in front of more
people, but they're giving at least three generations of country
fans the good time that they promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I feel like we've been rediscovered,'' Benson says. ``I
was 12 years old when I got into this stuff, so it just makes sense
to me now that a teen-ager would like it. I mean, it was old music
when I heard it for the first time, and I knew that I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academy of Country Music Awards'' will be broadcast 7 p.m.
CDT Wednesday on CBS. Hosted by Dolly Parton, the show will be
broadcast from the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles. Asleep at
the Wheel will perform ``Roly Poly'' on the program.

NOT IN AMERICA? OFFICIALS' SEIZURE OF ELIAN HITS CLOSE TO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez's words after federal agents seized Elian
from her home in Miami on Easter weekend hang like a weight on
Marylyn Daniel's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez reportedly yelled, ``To have a 6-year-old crying,
`Don't take me, don't take me.' ... This is not America.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can vouch for the fact that it happens in Texas,'' she said.
``When they took (Elian) out of that house, I could see my grandson
hollering for his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way between the Cuban-American neighborhood known
as Little Havana and Azle, just west of Fort Worth, where Daniel
lived with her daughter, Cynthia, and her two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   But the tears and anguish played out in the media over the five
months since Elian was plucked from the Atlantic have personal
significance for Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   Her own grandson, Michael, was snatched from her and her
daughter more than five years ago in a custody dispute with the
child's father.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he was playing in their back yard in Azle. ``And the
next, a constable was taking him from the our house, screaming just
like that little boy, Elian,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grabbed him, threw him in the police car, locked the
door, and came back and handed us court papers. I asked them where
were they taking him, and they said, `Here's the paper, get you a
lawyer.'''
</P>
<P>
   And they did.
</P>
<P>
   That was Feb. 1, 1994. Marylyn Daniel hasn't seen Michael since.
And his mother, Cynthia Daniel, has been allowed only supervised
visits. That is, when she can afford to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Like most custody disputes, the Daniel case is a tangled web of
charges and countercharges. The father accused Cynthia of
physically and emotionally abusing Michael, and the court granted
him custody. Cynthia Daniel denies the charges, but Michael has
been caught in the middle ever since.
</P>
<P>
   You may or may not recall reading about Daniel and her
daughter's fight to regain custody of the boy in this space more
than three years ago. Michael is 11 now; he was 7 then.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cynthia Daniel hadn't seen or talked to her son
since June 1996 because she couldn't afford to pay the $35-an-hour
fee charged by the Tyler agency that supervised her visits.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a whole other story.
</P>
<P>
   In another round of court battles soon after my first column,
the court granted Cynthia Daniel a reprieve. Now she pays $5 an
hour for up to a three-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
   But Cynthia Daniel faces more hurdles. When she reported the
father to Child Protective Services because she believed he failed
to get medical attention for Michael when he suffered a head injury
recently, the father decided to limit her visits to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a three-hour drive between Daniel's home in Fort Worth and
Tyler, where Michael lives, but for Cynthia, the trip is worth it.
Even for just one weekend a month. Even for just 30 minutes, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have much time to do much of nothing,'' she said.
``We play a little. We talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But in between the visits, there's nothing. No pictures, no
letters, no gifts. Michael's father won't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   And so Cynthia Daniel and her mother, Marylyn, just keep hiring
attorneys in an effort to regain custody of Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Daniel said that when she sees her little boy, he seems
happy to be with her, even for the short time they are together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells me that he loves me, and I tell him that I love
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marylyn Daniel wishes she could be so lucky.

SHERIFF ARPAIO RUNNING TV STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   about the harsh condition of his jails, Maricopa County Sheriff
Joe Arpaio often boasts that he's not running a country club.
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   He's running a TV studio.
</P>
<P>
   For three nights last month, anyway, when Bill Maher brought his
late-night comedy gabfest Politically Incorrect to town, filming
two shows from inside the lockdown at Estrella Jail and four inside
Tent City for the May ``sweeps'' rating period.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new there, as Arpaio proudly points out.
</P>
<P>
   `Everybody else has been here, around the world,` he said,
before taping the second of two shows on which he appears as a
guest. `Why should I discriminate? This is just another television
crew that's here.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not, not really. While topical and smart, the emphasis
of Maher's show is on comedy. This isn't an investigative look at
conditions inside Tent City, nor a cop show championing green
bologna, female chain gangs and pink underwear.
</P>
<P>
   It's a funny show set, for the next week anyway, inside a jail,
with prisoners serving as audience, topic of discussion and,
frequently, the butt of jokes. (`It's great to be here,'' Maher
told the inmates during one monologue. `I mean for me, not you.''
The inmates' response, heard often, went something like, `Ha-ha-ha
- hey, wait.`)
</P>
<P>
   So who, really, is being served here?
</P>
<P>
   In part, the answer's easy - viewers. The six episodes of
Politically Incorrect that will air over the next week are great
television. The razor wire encircling the guests might have been
for show, but the razor wire on top of the fences behind them
wasn't. That setting provided an energy not found inside a
Hollywood studio, and Maher and his guests, who included David
Spade, Paul Rodriguez and a host of inmates, fed off it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet watching the taping, I couldn't help pondering a basic
dilemma: Was this entertainment or exploitation?
</P>
<P>
   `Obviously someone could make that claim, that there is
exploitation going on,'' Maher said. `But I would say that it is
probably better for those on the inside to have their story get out
to the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a message out is the reason most everyone gave for
participating. For Arpaio, Politically Incorrect was a forum to
reach a different audience, he said. Ditto William Schulz, the
executive director of Amnesty International USA and a frequent
Arpaio critic, who jousts with the sheriff on one of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all they did - joust. Neither Arpaio nor Schulz
resolved anything. Which is fine. Politically Incorrect is, after
all, a funny TV show, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one group of guests managed to get its message across in a
meaningful way - the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   `It's absurd the way we have to live,'' John Conley, an inmate
and guest, said, to the predictable cheers of the incarcerated
audience. `We're in America, where people don't expect to be
treated the way we're treated in this jail system.''
</P>
<P>
   After the taping wrapped, Conley made it clear why he thought
Arpaio allowed Politically Incorrect in.
</P>
<P>
   `For Joe, it's just another opportunity for him to show his
animals,'' he said. `Because that's what they basically treat us
as.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing at all funny about that.

 &HT;    MANY HOMES NOT SUITED FOR OLDER RESIDENTS, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    With SENIORS-DATA.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly one-fourth of Americans age 45 and older
predict that they or someone they live with will have difficulty
getting around in their home within five years.
</P>
<P>
   As Baby Boomers and their parents age, more Americans face the
prospect of living longer in houses not designed to meet their
needs, according to the survey by AARP, the nation's largest
organization of people 50 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they built houses in the past, they're not built for
the way people live,'' said Leon Harper, AARP senior housing
specialist. ``The message you have to get to people is that 'it's
not you, it's the house.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 100 million housing units in America, fewer than
10 percent have significant features for universally accessible
usage such as wide doorways, entrances without steps, stairwell
handrails, grab bars in bathtubs, and light switches at the top and
bottom of stairs, said Richard Duncan, director of training for
North Carolina State University's Center for Universal Design.
</P>
<P>
   Among the largest impediments to elder-friendly housing are
bedrooms on a second floor, entryway steps, narrow doorways,
overhead kitchen cabinets, and high-sided bathtubs without grab
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such problems can greatly reduce the quality of life of older
people and increase the costs for society,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all older Americans have made minor modifications to make
their homes safer and more livable, such as installing night
lights, adding non-skid strips to the bathtub or shower, using
high-wattage light bulbs and using double-sided tape to secure rugs
and carpets.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP housing attitudes survey is the fifth such poll it has
conducted since 1986. Each time, it has gradually lowered the age
of those included. This telephone survey of 2,000 Americans 45 and
older also included an extra-large sampling of blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Older people generally have a greater desire to remain in
their current homes than younger people. Among those 45 to 54 years
old, 75 percent want to live in their present house as long as
possible. Among those 75 and older, 95 percent want to do so. That
may be because older people are more likely to have lived in their
current residence far longer than Baby Boomers, said Ada Helen
Bayer, AARP acting associate director of research.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among the three-fourths of Americans permitted to make changes
to their residences _ about a fourth cannot because they rent their
house or apartment _ seven out of 10 had made at least one
significant modification. Of those, two-thirds believe the
modifications will allow them to remain in their house for another
decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   _ The major reasons for not making wanted home modifications are
cost and the inability of homeowners to make the alterations
themselves. Other reasons include mistrust of home contractors,
inability to find anyone to make the repairs, and inability to go
to a store to purchase supplies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Minorities are less likely to want to remain in their current
residences for as long as possible and are more likely to live in a
place where they are concerned about themselves or a friend or
relative getting around.
</P>
<P>
   With the beginning of May marking both the federal Older
Americans' Month and AARP's ``Independent Living Week,'' the
organization for the elderly is waging a public information and
lobbying effort to convince builders to voluntarily make new houses
more friendly to an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Atlanta and Austin have both adopted
``visit-ability'' ordinances requiring any new housing built using
local subsidies _ such as city-owned public housing _ to have at
least one entrance way that meets wheelchair accessibility
standards, Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing for a model ordinance along those lines for
other localities to adopt,'' he said. ``Getting state or national
(laws) right now is practically out of the question.''

AN ECONOMIST'S VIEW OF HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>

 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Victor Fuchs is an economist who also sees himself as a
humanist, a person who is interested in values and who inquires how
economics can help people to think about social problems and arrive
at solutions. Economics, he explains, is about choice. It asks how
people respond to incentives, how they respond to constraints. So,
Fuchs observes, ``economics is the quintessential policy science.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs, an emeritus professor of economics, holds half a dozen
titles at Stanford University and is continuing his research while
serving on the steering committee of Stanford's Center for
Biomedical Ethics and as a research associate of the National
Bureau of Economic Research. He is also a past president of the
American Economic Association and a member of the American
Philosophical Society and of the Institute of Medicine at the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs, 76, visited Princeton University last week, lecturing and
meeting with graduate students. On a gray and chilly morning,
sitting at a small square table in a drafty section of his hotel's
breakfast room, he discussed how economic analysis could inform the
nation's wrenching debates about health care. Q. There has been a
lot of talk about health care reform, and at least one major
initiative, the Clinton health care plan. Do you foresee another,
more successful attempt to reform health care on the horizon?  &QL; 
A. The Clinton plan was a combination of ignorance and arrogance
and it turned out to be a disaster. But I never believed for a
minute that they could get major health care reform. Health care
reform requires a substantial political investment.
</P>
<P>
   You're talking about one-seventh of the economy and huge numbers
of interest groups of all kinds. To change the status quo in a
major way means you have to achieve a tremendous political reform
first. I've been on record for a long time saying that I only see a
major health care reform coming to the U.S. in the wake of a war, a
large-scale recession or large-scale civil unrest.  &QL; 
Q. Don't Americans want health care reform?  &QL; 
A. Two-thirds of the American people say they favor universal
coverage, but the minute you start to spell out what that means _
subsidization for the people who are poor and who are sick, and
that the plan has to be compulsory _ they are less supportive.  &QL; 
Q. We subsidize health care in a way, don't we? What about
Medicare?  &QL; 
A. You pay for Medicare but there's going to be more and more
resistance to it. Remember, Medicare started as a small program. It
was going to be $4 billion or something like that. There's a
generalized resistance to higher taxes. People don't exactly
realize that a lot of their taxes are going to transfers to the
elderly. They just know they are fed up with paying higher taxes.
The average working person today pays more in Social Security and
Medicare taxes then he pays in income taxes. But they don't express
it directly that way. They just don't want to pay more taxes.  &QL; 
Q. What about current proposals to provide Medicare coverage for
prescription benefits?  &QL; 
A. We see proposals to expand Medicare. And they're politically
popular. But then they're going to have to try and figure out how
to pay for it. One thing I'll go on record as saying is that the
Clinton proposal for paying for prescription drugs makes absolutely
no sense. It is a proposal to cover the cost of drugs from the
first dollar up to a cap.  &QL; 
Q. What's wrong the Clinton prescription proposal?  &QL; 
A. The purpose of insurance is to protect the people who have big
expenses. So you ask why do they propose a plan that does just the
opposite? Because that's politically popular. People don't think
they're paying for somebody else's drugs. Everybody thinks they're
going to get a benefit. But that's not insurance. That's not what
insurance is for.  &QL; 
Q. So will Congress succeed in expanding Medicare coverage and
reforming health care?  &QL; 
A. That's a political forecast, isn't it? All my life I've tried to
spend more time trying to figure out what the government should do
than what they will do. &QL; 
Q. What should be done about health care?  &QL; 
A. I think we should have universal coverage financed by a general,
broad-based tax which is earmarked for health care _ such as a
value-added tax _ which would give every American a voucher to be
part of some health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   I think that plan should not be a minimal sort of ``safety net
for the poor'' plan, but neither should it be one that would cover
what every American would be willing and able to pay for. I like to
think of it as a multitiered system where every American has basic
coverage and people have options to buy more, not subsidized by
taxes but with their own after-tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The individual plans could decide if they want a co-payment,
such as $10 for each prescription or a co-payment for an office
visit. I don't operate at the level of trying to specify details. I
try to see what is the broad strategy, what is the broad vision
that we want to bring to this. I'm trying to get across two points:
universal coverage for a plan, but one that is not completely
egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   I think we are hung up with the idea that everything we do in
health care must be egalitarian, and we wind up with a very
nonegalitarian system. What I'm arguing for is some kind of middle
ground.  &QL; 
Q. What happens now to the uninsured? Aren't they simply doing
without the most basic health care?  &QL; 
A. No. The truth is we do provide health care for everyone one way
or another. We have poverty clinics, we have county hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even surveys by the people who are most inclined to be concerned
about the uninsured show that the uninsured get about two-thirds of
the health care they would get if they had insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So people do get care. They don't get the same care that others
necessarily get. They don't get it under the same conditions that
other people get it. But there are not many people who simply die
in the streets, although they're the ones who make the newspapers.
 &QL; 
Q. There is widespread concern about the nation's health care bill.
What do you think of the proposed ways of cutting it?  &QL; 
A. Any time you want to reduce health care spending one of two
things comes up. Let's reduce physicians' incomes or let's cut drug
industry profits. But these are one-time cuts. These are not cuts
that reduce the rate of growth. Unless you cut the underlying
forces that allow for growth, you make a tiny little difference.
</P>
<P>
   If you cut physicians' net incomes by 20 percent, it's a
difference of one-tenth of 1 percent per annum in the growth rate
of health care costs over 20 years. Cutting drug industry profits
would get you even less, because half of drug industry profit is
less than 20 percent than physicians' net income. As a rough
estimate, drug industry profits might come to about 3 percent of
health care spending.
</P>
<P>
   If you cut that in half, it would be 1.5 percent. Spread that
over 20 years and you've got three-quarters of a percent per annum.
That's the direct effect. The indirect effect could be much larger
because if you cut drug industry profits in half you might have a
big effect on the amount of investment in new research and
development. That would show up in fewer new drugs and less
spending.  &QL; 
Q. Then what does it mean to say the prices of drugs is too high?  &QL; 
A. From an economist's point of view? We mean that the market
conditions are not producing a socially optimal allocation of
resources. The classic example is a monopoly. If a company has a
monopoly, then we usually expect that their prices will be higher
than their socially desirable rate. But that's a question that the
Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice ought to be
looking into. It's independent of whether we cover the elderly for
drugs.  &QL; 
Q. What is driving up the cost of health care?  &QL; 
A. The principle factor by far is medical innovations like new
drugs, new surgical procedures and new diagnostic techniques. This
is not just my opinion. I surveyed the 50 leading health economists
in the country on this question. Over 80 percent of them agreed
with me.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. We spend more money on health care than other industrialized
nations. Are we healthier?  &QL; 
A. Let's put it this way. We spend 40 percent per capita more for
services than people in Canada. We do get some services that they
don't get. We get easier access. We don't have the long waiting
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But basically their health outcomes are about the same as ours.
If you take as your first cut, Do we live longer? Do we have less
morbidity? Do we have less disability? The answer is no. It's about
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care is one thing, health is something else. I've been
doing research in this field since 1965 and I almost invariably
find that the health of people has little to do with the quality or
quantity of health care.
</P>
<P>
   There are some areas in the United States that have twice as
many physicians per capita as other areas. There is no evidence
that that shows up in the health of the population _ none
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas in the U.S. have medical schools and some areas don't
have medical schools. There is a widespread belief in the academic
medical community that the presence of a medical school raises the
standard of care _ people are closer to the frontiers of medicine,
the doctors there can go to the grand rounds. I don't find any
evidence whatsoever that having a medical school in an area
produces lower mortality rates. Nor is it true that we're any
sicker now from all this managed care and denial of services and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   It's also very clear that over time the introduction of some
drugs and some medical procedures does improve health. Neonatal
intensive care units, the survival of low-birth-weight babies.
That's improved enormously, and almost all of it is due to better
medical interventions: both better scientific understanding what it
takes to keep a 1,000 gram baby alive and the technology to do it.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I don't want to overstate the payoff because
medical research has done virtually nothing to lower the incidence
of low birth-weight babies.
</P>
<P>
   In the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular area, the combination
of a much more aggressive treatment of hypertension and better
drugs had a big payoff in lowering deaths from heart attacks and _
probably more important _ in deaths from strokes.  &QL; 
Q. Are you saying that even though some medicine makes a
difference, more medical care can't do much to make us more
healthy?  &QL; 
A. I'm saying that almost everyone is getting the medical care that
matters to health. Adding more care does not make much difference.
The stuff that's really effective, the antibiotics, the
appendectomies and so forth _ people get them. Health depends much
more on the things we do to and for ourselves or that we don't do.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on cigarette smoking, it depends on obesity, it
depends on certain environmental conditions.  &QL; 
Q. So if more medical care does not make us healthier, what should
we do to improve our health?  &QL; 
A. Improved health will come about through changes in the physical
and psychosocial environments and in individual behavior and in
medical advances, not in increasing the quantity of medical care at
a given point in time. &QL;

   A rock that fell in northwest Canada in January may preserve a
bit of the primordial solar system, little changed from what it was
4.5 billion years ago. During the early morning hours of Jan. 18, a
fireball exploded over the Yukon: a meteor from outer space burning
up in the Earth's atmosphere, with sonic booms heard in Alaska and
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the meteor burned up, though. A local resident
collected about two pounds of fragments, which resemble burnt
charcoal briquettes, placed them in plastic bags and stored them in
a freezer. Although the fiery journey through the atmosphere heated
up the outside of the surviving rocks, the inside would have
remained cold, giving researchers hope that delicate organic
molecules trapped within the meteorite remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorite turns out to be a type known as carbonaceous
chondrites, which contain sizable quantities of carbon and organic
molecules. Carbonaceous chondrites are rare _ only about one in 50
meteorites found on Earth is a carbonaceous chondrite _ because
they burn up easily, and pieces that survive re-entry weather away
quickly. It has' been 31 years since a carbonaceous chondrite has
been recovered soon after its arrival, and never a frozen one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meteorite is our first chance ever to look at volatile
organics,'' said Dr. Michael E. Zolensky, a cosmic mineralogist at
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. About a pound of the
fragments are on loan to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically a lot of organics, including amino acids,''
Zolensky said. In addition, ``Probably there's water inside, we're
betting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe such meteorites seeded Earth with water
and organic molecules, the building blocks of life.
</P>
<P>
   The original meteor was probably the size of a bus, Zolensky
said, and probably spent most of the last 4.5 billion years
orbiting at the outer part of the asteroid belt near Jupiter. Its
chemical composition is likely to have changed little over that
time.

found themselves without access to ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs Monday as
the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt
Disney, fought over the cable television rights to stations owned
by Disney's ABC network. The dispute has its roots in an argument
over how much money Disney should receive for carrying its channels
on Time Warner's cable systems, but it involves larger issues
dealing with the distribution of media content _ including the
longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry,
the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and
Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online
and Time Warner. It also concerns how much power the new company
will wield in a television industry that is merged with the

   SCI-PROSTATE-TEST (Undated) _ In announcing on Thursday that he
had prostate cancer, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani paused to make
a pitch that all men have the PSA test that revealed the early
signs of his disease. Two new studies have provided strong, though
not conclusive, evidence that PSA testing can reduce deaths, and
most prostate cancer patients, like Giuliani, are glad they had the
test. Yet many medical organizations and experts on prostate cancer
remain equivocal about when, or even if, the screening test should
be given. Their uncertainty reflects a continuing debate about
whether the test is worthwhile given that, especially in older men,
prostate cancer can be an indolent disease unlikely to cause
lasting harm to the health, while its treatment can often produce
serious side effects like impotence and incontinence. By Kenneth
Chang.

   SCI-EARLIEST-HUMANS (Undated) _ The book of Genesis mentions
three of Adam and Eve's children: Cain, Abel and Seth. But
geneticists, by tracing the DNA patterns found in people throughout
the world, have now identified lineages descended from 10 sons of a
genetic Adam and 18 daughters of Eve. The human genome is turning

triumphantly demonstrated that he could move beyond the solipsistic
presentations of self he had been practicing for years to create a
capacious chronicle of American innocence and disillusion. Though
the second installment of that trilogy (``I Married a Communist,''
1998) was something of a throwback to Roth's old mirror games, his
latest novel, ``The Human Stain,'' is not only a philosophic
bookend to ``Pastoral'' but another large and stirring book as
well. Reviewed by Michiko Kakutani.

TOM ROBBINS COMES CLOSE TO REVEALING REAL SELF IN NEW NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CONNER, Wash. _ This town's most famous resident sits at a
picnic table by the Rexfield Grocery on the outskirts, his perch
not far from his aging albino Jaguar and only 50 feet from the
highway where tourist cars swoosh by toward the technicolor tulip
fields. Writer Tom Robbins, just another roadside attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty woman approaches and asks, ``Could you tell us how to
get to La Conner?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep going straight,'' Robbins says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're welcome,'' replies Robbins, who, once the woman has
walked away, immediately adds, ``I probably should have sent her in
the opposite direction.''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange is classic Robbins, the politeness born of his
youth in the South, the mischievous comment afterward reflecting
his ol' trickster ways. But this also may be the first time in his
63 years of devilish life that Robbins has ever advised anyone to
``keep going straight.''
</P>
<P>
   An encounter a half-hour later gives another glimpse of Robbins.
He hails a friend who is heading into the little country store that
has been spiffed up and now purveys a ``writer sandwich'' (tuna
fish with kimchi) to honor La Conner's premiere kimchi head.
</P>
<P>
   The two men of similar vintage are soon exchanging pleasantries,
the effects of too many loud rock concerts on their hearing, the
too many friends passing away in recent months. Then, the man spies
Robbins' book on the picnic table, with its cover the color of a
tangerine dream, so striking, yet unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did that come out?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't,'' Robbins replies. ``It will be out May 2.''
</P>
<P>
   The man nods, starts to walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be the first in line to get one,'' Robbins says, with a sly
laugh. ``Be the first in your neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A laugh burbles up from Robbins' gullet, erupts through his
goatee, before he yells, ``Nice to see ya, Johnny.''
</P>
<P>
   This is another side of Robbins, who, amid the playful banter,
is plumb earnest about his new book (and most things, too).
</P>
<P>
   The laureate of La Conner is a comic writer who is doornail-dead
serious about what he does. He is also a slumgullion of
contradictions: celebrity and recluse, romantic and visionary, rake
and aesthete, fantasist and stickler for accuracy, Timbuktu
globe-trotter and hunkered-down Northwest homeboy here and in
Seattle..
</P>
<P>
   Robbins considers himself proud and unbowed, thankful for the
many loyal readers who have turned his books into sure
best-sellers, and semi-amused that a California fan has long
operated a Robbins' Web site, although the author would never visit
himself out of fears of becoming ``too self-conscious to work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins remains tired as old pajamas of being typecast and
clearcut by critics (whom he contends he almost never reads). He
traces this chronic mistreatment back eons to his first book,
``Another Roadside Attraction'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been crucified,'' Robbins stresses, ``on the cross of
whimsy ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some faint hope that the new book may help change that.
``Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates'' (Bantam, 415 pages,
$27.50), with its title taken from a poem by French bad boy Arthur
Rimbaud, is Robbins' first book in six years and his longest book
ever. It will soon to be the subject of a cross-country book tour
in which Robbins will worry once more about ``whether my tongue
will turn into a Prestolog when I stand up at the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fierce Invalids'' is indeed different in some signal ways from
his past work.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins is still the Houdini of unchained similes and metaphors.
``Fierce Invalids'' includes such doozies as ``her eyes were like
chocolate-dipped cherry bombs with their fuses lit'' and ``a
mist-bearded Saturday morning, gray as a ghoul and cool as clam
aspic.'' But such Robbinsesque verbal escapades, as addictive as
crack to his fans, are parsed out in dwindling supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably fewer metaphors and similes in this book
than my previous ones,'' Robbins concedes. ``I don't know exactly
why that is, although I do think the ones that are there are some
of the best that I've ever done. This book has a little more of a
narrative thread. It relies more on a fast-moving narrative than my
previous books.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tom Robbins' novel where, strange to behold, plot takes some
precedence. And not only plot, but a male protagonist! And not only
a male protagonist from a writer known for his spunky, randy female
leads, but a male protagonist who the author admits ``is my most
autobiographical character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fierce Invalids'' focuses on Switters, a CIA agent without a
first name, but with the same birthday as the writer who created
him. Switters is smart, savvy, sassy, semi-successful, a dervish of
dazzling contradictions himself. Loyal government servant with
free-agent tendencies. Moralist with burning lust for his teenage
stepsister. Techno-whiz with distaste for cyberia. A veggie
gastronome with ``an appetite for bold gestures and burned
bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, in a passage that seems to include some
self-descriptive elements, says of Switters: ``He projected the
air, falsely or not, of both a learned man and a rogue, innately
exhibitionist yet deeply secretive, a powerful figure who
habitually thumbed his nose at power _ and thus might lead one,
were one to fall under his spell, off in directions opposite those
that one had been conditioned to recognize as prudent, profitable,
or holy.''
</P>
<P>
   Switters sets off on a South American mission, including what is
supposed to be a brief detour to liberate his grandmother's pet
parrot in the Peruvian rain forest. But a disastrous encounter with
a indigenous medicine man, soon has Switters eating something like
crow and consigned to a wheelchair by what may be a death-dealing
curse.
</P>
<P>
   Switters repairs to Seattle, licks wounds, lays low, hangs out
at the Pike Place Market, grows enamored with the ``Art Girls''
from the design school down Elliott Avenue. He finally departs on
another mission, no longer in government employ, this time to the
Middle East where he finds himself ensconced in an embattled oasis
convent of rogue nuns (including the captivating Sister Domino) who
might just know the secret of the missing prophesy of the Virgin of
Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly an example of express train plotting taught in
Thriller Writing 101. ``Fierce Invalids'' is a tangled garden of
madcap, satire and strangeness grown slowly in Robbins' fervent
imagination from such seeds as a long night's drink with a CIA
agent in Southeast Asia, ``Terry and the Pirates'' comic books, an
entry in one of Bruce Chatwin's journals, the partially read
``Finnegans Wake'' on his bedside table, the interplay of opposites
in the universe and various other things that, as he puts it,
``flicked the spark in my Zippo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the themes of this book,'' Robbins relates, ``is
whether it is possible in today's world to live a life of
free-wheeling sensuality and romantic adventure combined with a
life of serenity and deep wisdom and full consciousness. It's
tricky. I think Switters succeeds at that _ and maybe I was working
out my own conflict and that particular dichotomy as I was writing
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing was done in the usual Robbins style of tightrope
wordsmithing without safety net. No outline, at the start or later.
``Only the vaguest sense of plot.'' No characters to begin with.
Just some themes that had been tornadoing inside his head for the
past few years. Then a piece of blank paper. A pen. Intense
concentration. Words finally. The start of his book and his trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write books the way a glacier would write books,'' Robbins
says, with a smile. ``... I hold auditions for characters and a
character or two will show up. Then I'll take a character and put
him or her into a situation, an opening gambit. I'll put him or her
in a little boat and shove them into the current and I'll just
follow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a literal trip, a literal journey. I go very, very
slowly because to work that way you have to go very slowly and you
have to stay extremely focused. The challenge, and the thrill of
it, is to take those disparate themes, which have no connection to
one another, and to take the characters, which have no connection
to one another either, and make them come together in such a
seamless way that the reader would believe that the whole thing,
part and parcel, was in my head when I began.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the organic, yet painstaking process that begat ``Even
Cowgirls Get the Blues'' (1976), ``Still Life With Woodpecker''
(1980), ``Jitterbug Perfume'' (1984), ``Skinny Legs and All''
(1990), ``Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas'' (1994). And it has gotten
no easier for Robbins with successive books _ his deteriorating
eyesight has actually made it harder _ since each still requires
starting smack dab at ground zero and trusting the fickle muse of
creative juice.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins brings similar care to the ideas underpining his work.
There are elements of Eastern religions throughout his novels,
especially the Tibetan concept of ``crazy wisdom,'' references to
assorted Greek myths, plus fevered embraces of sensuality and sex.
His practice of meditation and yoga usually comes into play. There
are also point-blank attacks on what strikes Robbins as
conventional wisdom, forced consensus, political correctness, rigid
doctrine or pomposity of any kind. His subversive weapons of choice
are satiric humor and unrepentant joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I try to do in my work is to somehow marry
the terrible truths of life on this planet with a sense of
wonder,'' Robbins says. ``I don't think I'm that different than
Kafka in my outlook, my world view. It's just that Kafka let it
make him miserable and I refuse. Life is too short for that. I'd
like to think there's an afterlife, but I certainly have no
empirical evidence. So I'm operating as if this is my only shot at
it. That's why I insist on joy in spite of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   What strains that joy for Robbins, as much as anything, are
critics who continue to describe him as ``a hippie novelist''
(``it's like referring to Tolkien as a dwarf novelist or an elf
novelist because of the characters he writes about'') or critics
who dare wave that old red cape of ``whimsy'' in front of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Being named one of ``The 100 Best Writers of the 20th Century''
by Writer's Digest was some soul salve to Robbins, as was being
deemed a Northwest artistic treasure by the Bumbershoot arts
festival in 1997, as was being called ``the most dangerous writer
in the world today'' by Fernanda Pivano, noted Italian critic. But
just the whisper of ``whimsy'' still turns Robbins into a raging
longhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That word used to be applied to my work a lot and I have grown
to despise it with a loathing that I share only for Jesse Helms and
the Los Angeles Lakers,'' Robbins stresses. ``My work is not
whimsical at all. It's playful. There is a huge difference. ... I
may have done things in an off-hand way in some of my earlier work,
but it was never, ever done on a whim. Playfulness involves an
engaged consciousness. The wisest men and women I've ever met in
this world, and I've met a few, all seem to have that in common _ a
playful attitude toward life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that playfulness may be traced to one of the key
influences of Robbins' life, the arrival of the circus or the
carnival in the small Southern towns where he grew up. So fond are
those memories that the writer has long collected vintage circus
banners, some 10 feet long and 7 feet high, and used them to
decorate his walls and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The banners are one of the reasons, too, that Robbins and his
third wife, Alexa, are in the midst of a massive remodeling project
linking his two small homes with a large addition. The resulting
hacienda is being dubbed ``Villa de Jungle Girl,'' in honor of the
leopardskin-clad damsels that grace many banners.
</P>
<P>
   None may quite hold a searchlight to the 11-year-old circus
lovely named Bobbie Beers who so beguiled the 13-year-old Tom with
the blond hair that cascaded down the middle of her back, the
knee-high patent leather boots, the riding breeches, the pet black
snake coiled around her bare arm, the little snake bites that ran
up and down that fetching appendage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the most exotic creature I had ever encountered in my
life,'' Robbins recalls. ``I've never gotten over her, really.''
</P>
<P>
   That the teen Tom was able to convince his parents to let him
travel with the circus run by Bobbie's parents for a few weeks may
have been the greatest act of Robbins' word magic in his life. As a
result, he got to help set up the menagerie tent, water nasty
llamas, scrub algae off an alligator's back, plus fantasize about
Bobbie from some proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too shy to do anything more,'' Robbins admits. ``Kissing
Bobbie would have been like exchanging a kiss with Marlene
Dietrich. She was way out of my league.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, though, that colorful circus banners and powerful
circus memories still ignite the imagination of this grandson of
two Southern Baptist preachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small towns in the rural South tend to get pretty drowsy in
the summer and then one day these trucks would pull into a dusty
vacant field,'' Robbins remembers. ``By nighttime, there would be
tents up and colored lights everywhere. Elephants would be walking
about and there would be music, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did that enliven my childhood summers, it instilled
that notion of transformation _ that something that's dull and
dreary could overnight be transformed into an area of enchantment.
It has shaped my psyche, to a certain extent, and my literary
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Robbins, astride the high wire, still strives to keep the
circus alive.

IN QUANTUM WORLD, KEYS TO NEW CODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven decades ago, Einstein and his scientific allies imagined
ways to prove that quantum mechanics, the strange rules that
describe the world of the very small, were just too spooky to be
true. With his thought experiments, he showed that one of the
weirdest aspects of this science, then only a few years old, was
its seeming prediction that measuring one particle could
instantaneously change the properties of another particle, no
matter how far apart they were.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein then wielded his thought experiments like weapons to
expose the strange implications that this process, called
entanglement, would have if it could happen. He considered this
apparent action-at-a-distance too absurd to be found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   But real experiments described in three forthcoming papers in
the journal Physical Review Letters give a measure of just how
badly Einstein has been routed. The experiments show not only that
entanglement does happen _ which has been known for some time _ but
that it might be used to create unbreakable codes for the secure
transmission of bank transactions and diplomatic communiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was first considered as pure philosophy,'' said pProfessor
Nicolas Gisin, a physicist at the University of Geneva who is a
co-author of one of the papers. ``Now we discuss that these same
strange aspects of quantum mechanics can be of some use in securing
the Internet, let's say.''
</P>
<P>
   The measured properties of entangled particles are, as the name
implies, fatefully entwined. It is as if two coins, flipped
simultaneously again and again on opposite sides of the globe,
always came out both heads or both tails _ even though the sequence
was unsurprisingly random. Coins do not act this way, but quantum
particles can.
</P>
<P>
   As with many things quantum, the true implications of
entanglement are far subtler than they at first appear. The process
does not, for example, let scientists send information instantly
from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
   But it does allow information to be passed in a perfectly secure
way, since any measurement of either particle leaves its trace on
the other _ meaning that an eavesdropper can always be detected, no
matter how clever or technically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   That guarantee of safe passage would allow people at any two
sites to share unbreakable codes using quantum entanglement. The
experiments demonstrated several versions of this trick, called
quantum cryptography. It differs from all traditional cryptography,
in which great pains are taken to transmit codes securely or to
make them mathematically hard to crack. But spies, with luck or
great pains, can and do secretly intercept or crack them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage with quantum cryptography is you don't have to
worry about any of that,'' said Paul Kwiat, a physicist at Los
Alamos National Laboratory and a co-author of another of the new
papers. ``If you do it right, you're only limited by the laws of
quantum physics.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Jennewein of the University of Vienna, lead author on
the third paper, said that turning those ideas into an
off-the-shelf technology was no longer unthinkable: ``We realized a
complete quantum cryptography system, almost ready to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they all relied on entangled particles of light, or
photons, to make codes, the experiments each did something a little
different to make quantum entanglement into a practical tool for
cryptographers.
</P>
<P>
   Jennewein and his collaborators built a system that generated
quantum codes very quickly and used them to encrypt the binary
string of zeroes and ones representing a digital color picture.
Then they sent the coded picture over an ordinary computer network
_ the usual technique _ and decoded it on the other side. Kwiat's
team actually caught a simulated eavesdropper interposed in a
quantum transmission, showing that the idea works, while Gisin and
co-workers built a system that might be especially compatible with
existing systems of fiber optics and electronics in the real world
of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all, with some justification, claim to be the first
serious quantum cryptography experiments with entangled, two-photon
sources,'' said Charles Bennett, an IBM fellow, who is one of the
field's early innovators.
</P>
<P>
   As Einstein discovered, the most problematic aspect of the
quantum world is simply inducing oneself to believe that it works
the way it does. But once they are accepted, those strange rules
are what make quantum cryptography go.
</P>
<P>
   According to quantum mechanics, for instance, particles do not
have any definite properties until they are measured by a detector
or observed in some other way. Until they are measured, particles
can have a sort of potential existence in two or more places at
once. But once the measurement is made, the particle suddenly has
an actual existence in only one of those spots _ wherever it is
detected _ and the other possibilities instantly vanish.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle holds for the polarization of a photon, the
quantum carrier of light, which can vibrate both horizontally and
vertically or at two different diagonal angles, until it is
actually measured. Once the photon encounters filters that, like
Polaroid sunglasses, allow only one polarization to pass through,
the photon's polarization becomes known and definite.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum entanglement operates in this weird world, linking the
potential states of two particles. If a laser photon passes through
a special ``nonlinear'' crystal, for example, it can split into two
photons each with two possible polarizations.
</P>
<P>
   But the photons may be entangled, so that if one is measured and
has a horizontal polarization, then the other will have that
polarization, too. If the first one measured has a vertical
polarization, the second will also be vertical.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The essence of quantum cryptography involves creating entangled
pairs of photons and sending each to one of two people,
traditionally called Alice and Bob, who want to generate and share
a secret code. Alice and Bob each measure the photons'
polarizations using filters set in randomly selected directions.
</P>
<P>
   Only if both happen to choose the same direction for a
particular photon, and the entangled photons turn out to be
polarized in that direction, are Alice and Bob guaranteed a
detection on that particular trial. If the photons are polarized in
the other direction on that trial, both Alice and Bob are
guaranteed a nondetection.
</P>
<P>
   So Alice and Bob phone each other on an unsecure line after
collecting enough photons for their code. They reveal to each
other, publicly, their detector settings, but not whether they made
a detection, in each case. They then use only the results of the
measurements when they happened to have the same settings. (In an
actual experiment, Alice and Bob have a pair of detectors each so
that the photons in question are always captured, though in
different places.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of the quantum entanglement effect, however, they do not
need to reveal the results of the measurements _ detection or no.
They know that they have both gotten the same answer. Each
detection in those instances becomes a binary one, and each
nondetection, a binary zero. The sequence, known to Bob and Alice
but to no one else, becomes the code.
</P>
<P>
   And what if an eavesdropper, usually called Eve, has tried to
intercept the photons? Bob and Alice can discover this by comparing
just a few of their measurements. If they are not virtually all the
same, the entanglement has been disturbed, and the intruder has
been found.
</P>
<P>
   Artur Ekert, a theorist at the University of Oxford whose work
paved the way for the new demonstrations, said, ``I think the three
papers open a new chapter in experimental quantum cryptography.''
While making the world of commerce and espionage more secure, they
may also bend all but the most resilient of minds.

THE DOMINO TRANSPLANT: A MAN GETS NEW ORGANS AND GIVES HIS LIVER
AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Mich.)   (The Science Times) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The call came in the early morning hours of April 11 to the
Watertown, S.D., home of Barbara Hubbard, who had just gone back to
sleep after walking the dog and having a snack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a liver. Are you interested?'' Hubbard remembers the
caller asking.
</P>
<P>
   ``How soon do I have to be there?'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   The call came about the same time for Al Cawley of Waterford,
Mich., whose wife woke him up to come to the phone. This time the
message was a little different: A liver had just become available,
as had a heart and a kidney. Was he available?
</P>
<P>
   By about that hour the next day, Cawley, whose plane took off in
a snowstorm to rush him to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., had
his three new organs, and Hubbard, who was driven there through the
night by a friend, had her liver.
</P>
<P>
   The twist was that the liver put into the South Dakota woman had
come from Cawley in a rare, multipatient procedure known as a
domino transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple-organ transplants are highly unusual: 1989 was the last
time one like Cawley's was done in the United States, according to
a national organ-donation network. But domino transplants are rarer
still. Only a handful have ever been done in this country, while
about 40 have been done around the world, mostly in Europe, Mayo
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   There are few cases in which it makes medical sense for a
patient who needs a new organ to give up one of his own.``The
situations are few, but where it is appropriate, I think it's a
great utilization of a very scarce resource,'' said Dr. Joseph A.
Dearani, the heart surgeon who was part of the team that operated
on Cawley.
</P>
<P>
   In Cawley's case, as with most domino transplants, a rare
genetic condition created the circumstances in which he was given a
new liver _ only to have his own put into another patient. A
58-year-old lawyer, Cawley had familial amyloidosis, a disease in
which the liver produces an abnormal protein that destroys many of
the body's organs.
</P>
<P>
   The liver itself, however, works fine.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Mayo, with one of the world's largest amyloidosis
treatment centers, say they cannot be sure how the diseased liver
will behave in another patient. But because amyloidosis take
decades to do real damage, they expect it will be many years, if
ever, before any symptoms are seen.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Spieldenner, a spokesman for the United Network for
Organ Sharing, which runs the country's organ-donor distribution
system, said it was important that the patient receiving the
donated organ realized the potential risks. ``You have to be sure
that the patient fully understands what's going to happen, and that
they're comfortable with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, a 58-year-old registered nurse, put it simply. When the
call from Mayo came, she had been suffering from liver disease for
about 10 years, and her condition had gotten worse.``It was hope
for a new life, and I wasn't about to turn it down.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other ethical issues, said Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis,
co-director of transplantation at the University of Miami's Jackson
Memorial Hospital, who has been involved in six cases where an
amyloid liver was given to another patient.
</P>
<P>
   What, for example, should a hospital do if an emergency liver
failure case comes in as doctors are about to perform an elective
domino procedure? Who should get the liver? Should amyloid livers
in general be treated like any other donated organ, and placed into
the general distribution system?
</P>
<P>
   ``It might sound like hair-splitting,'' Tzakis said, ``but the
truth of the matter is: In this day and age, a lot of people die
for a liver. This question is going to come up more and more as the
procedure becomes more frequent.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how these issues are resolved, even though domino
transplants will do little to reduce the backlog of people waiting
for new organs, each one creates a kind of ripple effect,
Spieldenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're able to help another patient out,'' he said. ``Instead
of just one person getting transplanted, you're helping two. That
not only helps those patients, but helps those patients who
continue to wait, because that's one less person they have to
compete against.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cawley, whose father died of amyloidosis at age 62, the
domino transplant did not raise ethical issues so much as help
resolve them. When he initially went to Mayo, the plan was for him
to receive a new heart and a new liver. But as time went on, it
became clear that he would also need a new kidney. Those organs, he
recalls thinking, could help three different people, and one
question kept going through his head: ``Is it fair?'' He seriously
considered saying no to the transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles B. Rosen, Mayo's director of liver transplantation,
said that doctors were intending to ask Cawley if they could give
his liver to someone else, but ``he brought it up first.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cawley learned that his liver would help someone else, he
agreed to the surgery. ``I couldn't be happier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was just a question of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Early on April 11, doctors at Mayo received a call telling them
that there might be organs available from a young trauma victim in
the region. (To protect confidentiality, doctors did not disclose
more information about the donor.) They immediately put Cawley and
Hubbard on notice, and sent two procurement teams to the hospital,
where the patient was on life-support.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 that morning, surgeons at Mayo's St. Marys Hospital
began work on Cawley, beginning with his heart. They then replaced
his liver, and finally a kidney. Hubbard, meanwhile, was being
prepared at Rochester Methodist Hospital, also part of Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   After removing Cawley's liver, doctors flushed it with a
preservative solution and had it driven the the short distance to
Rochester Methodist. Three hours and 19 minutes after it had been
taken out of Cawley, the liver was placed in Hubbard. In all, the
whole process took about 14 hours, involved at least two dozen
medical workers, and cost easily $500,000, Mayo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cawley and Hubbard have yet to meet each other, but say they
hope to do so. Both are reported to be doing well, but will have to
take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Cawley said he planned to return to his law practice, but
Hubbard said she had been advised that working in a hospital might
no longer be a good idea for her, because of the risk of infection.
As unsettling as it is, she said, she is enjoying trying to figure
out her next move.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years,'' she said, ``I thought I was just going to die.
So there was no future.''

   Atlanta Festival Celebrates Black Artists
</P>
<P>
   An eight-month arts festival about the black experience in
America, which began in January, has a full calendar of events in
spring and summer. ``Spirit and Splendor: A Celebration of the
Sights, Sounds and Soul of African American Arts and Culture'' is
being presented by the Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta. Music,
drama and dance performances and art exhibitions are being staged
at museums and cultural centers throughout the city. The festival
will run through Sept. 24.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A central component is the exhibition ``To Conserve a Legacy:
American Art from Historically Black Colleges and Universities,''
to be shown at the High Museum of Art and Clark Atlanta University
from June 20 to Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Other exhibitions include ``From Africa to America: Honoring our
Ancestors,'' June 1 to Nov. 11 at the Atlanta International Museum,
and ``The David C. Driskell Collection: Narratives of African
American Art of the Twentieth Century,'' from June 13 to Sept. 24
at the High Museum of Art.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Performances include a concert by the jazz pianist Billy Taylor
at the Rialto Center on May 20, dance by Ballethnic at East Point
Auditorium on May 20 and dramas by Dael Orlandersmith, Billy Hicks
Jr. and Rebecca Ranson.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Spirit and Splendor'' celebration of black culture also
includes city-sponsored events. The Atlanta Jazz Festival runs from
May 22 to 29 at Piedmont Park, followed by the Montreaux Atlanta
Music Festival from Aug. 28 to Sept. 4, with an array of jazz,
hip-hop, rhythm and blues, soul, rock and blues.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirit and Splendor'' vacation packages featuring
accommodations and tickets are available through Marriott Hotels.
Call (800) 327-5166.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A complete calendar including ticket information is available by
calling (404) 733-5279, or visiting www.woodruffcenter.org.
</P>
<P>
   New Pass to Cover All National Parks
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service is selling a new $50 pass that admits
the holder, and everyone else in the same car, to all National
Parks for one year from month of purchase. The Park Service put the
pass on sale last month in cooperation with its nonprofit partner,
the National Park Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Separate entrance fees at the most popular parks have risen in
recent years. Since 1997, the top price has been for a week's entry
for a car into Yosemite, the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone-Grand
Teton: $20 each. At Acadia National Park in Maine, a year's pass is
$20.
</P>
<P>
   When these fees were announced, the government said that the
added revenue would be used to make repairs and reinstitute
programs that had been lost in budget cuts. Eighty percent of the
yield from the new pass, which features a picture of bison in the
snow at Yellowstone, will be dedicated to support programs to
protect animals, rebuild trails and conduct research, the park
service said.
</P>
<P>
   For those arriving on foot, the pass admits the purchaser,
spouse, parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   The new pass can be bought at national park visitor centers,
through the Web at www.nationalparks.org or by calling (888)
467-2757. By mail, a check for $53.95, including mailing, should be
made payable to National Park Service and sent to National Park
Pass, 27540 Avenue Mentry, Valencia, Calif. 91355.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Age Pass, which covers all the parks for life, costs
$10, and is available to people over 62. Golden Access, for the
disabled, is still free.
</P>
<P>
   As the Walls Talk: Two Tours in Newport
</P>
<P>
   This summer visitors will be able to hear about the Gilded Age
as well as see its Newport, R.I., setting. The Preservation Society
of Newport County is offering new guided and audio tours. The
Victorian Cottages Walking Tour of Bellevue Avenue is a three-hour
guided program providing an architectural as well as social history
of the town's most illustrious street from Kingscote to
Chateau-sur-Mer. Kingscote was the first ``summer cottage'' built
along what was then a dirt road in 1839. Chateau-sur-Mer, designed
by a local architect, Seth Bradford, was built in 1852 and
renovated  &QC; by Richard Morris Hunt in 1872. Tours of both of these
Victorian landmarks will be included.
</P>
<P>
   Walking tours will run from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus
Day, stepping off daily at 10 a.m. at the Preservation Society's
offices at 424 Bellevue Avenue; $25, $9 ages 6 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year is a self-guided audio tour, Sights and
Sounds of the Gilded Age: Life at The Elms, focusing on the coal
magnate Edward Julius Berwind's Bellevue Avenue estate. Built at
the turn of the century by the Philadelphia architect Horace
Trumbauer, The Elms _ a National Historic Landmark _ is considered
to be a faithful interpretation of the Chateau d'Asnieres near
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The tour includes the voices of curators and historians, former
house guests and family members of the Berwinds and their
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Elms is open daily year round 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The audio
tour, which replaces the guided tour, costs $9, $4 ages 6 to 17. A
guided tour of the work areas (from laundry to boiler room) is
available, for $12, $4 ages 6 to 17. Information for the audio and
walking tours: (401) 847-1000.
</P>
<P>
   St. Maarten Gets Its Own Dialing Code
</P>
<P>
   St. Maarten, the Dutch territory in the Caribbean, may not have
its own island (it shares it with French St.-Martin), but it now
has its own international dialing code for its telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone calling from another country must dial the international
access code 011, plus the island's five-digit code, 599-54, and
then the local number. For calls within St. Maarten, the number 54
must precede all local five-digit numbers. The tourist board
suggests practicing by calling (599-54) 22337 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   New in Chicago: a T. Rex Called Sue
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, visitors to the Field Museum in Chicago will have a
chance to meet Sue, the largest, most complete and best preserved
Tyrannosaurus rex ever found.
</P>
<P>
   About 67 million years ago, Sue stood more than 13 feet tall and
roamed the Black Hills of South Dakota. The seven-ton reptile had
serrated teeth that were up to a foot long. She measured 42 feet
from her snout to the tip of her tail and has a skull that is 5.2
feet long and weighs 750 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Over millions of years, Sue fossilized so perfectly that most of
her more than 250 bones have been found, and it is still possible
to see where muscles, tendons and other soft tissues were once
attached. Sue remained hidden in western South Dakota until Aug.
20, 1990, when Sue Hendrickson (after whom the T. rex is named), a
fossil hunter, discovered her.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of Sue's arrival, the museum is playing host to a
series of opening-day and weekend educational programs including
Create-a-Saurus, where visitors can build dinosaurs using foam and
wire; Dino-Time for preschoolers; a musical premiere; and film
presentations (accompanying the exhibits) with dinosaur themes.
</P>
<P>
   Sue's skull will be on display on a second-floor balcony (it is
too heavy to fit onto the assembled skeleton), and visitors can get
a close look at it. Nearby will be touchable casts of Sue's teeth,
of the tip of her tail, of one of her forelimbs and of her
wishbone; interactive Web stations, and a room dedicated to
dinosaur facts and theories. For example, it is known that Sue has
two forelimbs with ``hands,'' but scientists don't know what they
were used for or what color they were.
</P>
<P>
   While her real skeleton (with lighter version of her skull) will
remain at the Field Museum permanently, two full-size cast models
will tour the country this summer, starting in Honolulu at the
Bishop Museum and in Boston at the Museum of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Museum, 1400 S. Lake Shore Drive, is open 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. daily except Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission is $8, $4
for ages 3 to 11, students with ID and seniors. Free on Wednesdays.

   Motorcycle Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are interested in motorcycle trips in the
United States, Europe, Costa Rica, New Zealand, etc. We are looking
for an upscale trip with top accommodations. We would like a guide
and chase vehicle with air-conditioning for my wife to ride in. _
Kenneth Sher, Syosset, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. For those seeking primarily superior accommodations,
Edelweiss Bike Travel offers tours in the Alps, Spain and
California _ each of which operates twice a year. Among the places
at which participants are scheduled to stay are the Carlton in St.
Moritz, Switzerland; the Parador de Cardona, in a ninth-century
castle near Barcelona; and the Fairmont in San Francisco. Note that
while the Edelweiss brochure describes the lodgings in the Alps and
California as first class or deluxe, it calls those in Spain
``comfortable to first class.''
</P>
<P>
   As for air-conditioning in a chase or support vehicle, it is the
exception for major tour operators. While you might get one
stateside, there's no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, tour operators point out, support vehicles are
intended primarily for transporting luggage and coming to the aid
of weary riders. They also say that the route and schedule for such
vehicles may differ from the motorcyclists'; so this kind of
vacation may not result in a fully shared experience. One final
point underscored by operators: These trips are designed for
experienced and alert cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Charges are based on double occupancy and do not include air
fare. The rates are based on one cyclist's riding solo. Itineraries
do not list every stop.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a rough basis for comparison, here are details on
Alpine tours run by three companies.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Austria-based Edelweiss Bike Travel, whose North
American representative is Tri-Community Travel, Post Office Box
1974, Wrightwood, Calif. 93297; (800) 582-2263 or (760) 249-5825,
fax (760) 249-3857; www.edelweissbiketravel.com. All the cycles for
Royal tours are BMWs, with the model determining the cost. If your
wife travels in a separate vehicle, the cost is the same as two
people riding a single bike and sharing a room.
</P>
<P>
   Alpine, 16 days. Itinerary: Munich, Salzburg, the Dolomites in
Italy, Switzerland, the Arlberg region of Austria, Liechtenstein
and Germany. Total mileage: 1,000 to 1,800. Rest days: 7. Cost per
person: $3,970 to $5,090. Departs June 3 and July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Castles, 16 days. Itinerary: Barcelona, Andorra, a
corner of France. Total mileage: 1,700. Rest days: 3. Cost: $3,985
to $5,140. Departs Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   California, 8 days. San Francisco, Little River, Mendocino and,
in Napa Valley, Boyes Hot Springs. Total mileage: 400. Two rest
days and one day of warm-up loops. Cost: $2,570 to $3,340.
</P>
<P>
   Beachs Motorcycle Adventures, 2763 West River Parkway, Grand
Island, N.Y. 14072; (716) 773-4960, fax (716) 773-5227;
www.beachs-mca.com. Itinerary for 15-day trips that arrive in
Munich on May 28, June 18, July 9 and 30 and Aug. 20 includes
Salzburg; Arabba, Italy; Interlaken, Switzerland; Imst, Austria.
Rest days: 2. Total mileage: 1,350. Cost: $4,150 for the solo
rider, $3,250 for the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Another operator you can try, although it does not have a chase
vehicle for its Alps trip, is the American Motorcyclist
Association, 13515 Yarmouth Drive, Pickerington, Ohio 43147; (614)
856-1900, fax (614) 856-1921; www.amadirectlink.com.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to Lourdes
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the best way to travel to the Shrine at Lourdes in
France, near the Spanish border? Is it easier to travel from Paris
or somewhere in Spain? _ R. Roberts, Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   A. As the crow flies, Lourdes is clearly closer to Barcelona and
Madrid than it is to Paris. But once you take into account the
Pyrenees, the picture is very different: It's a 10-hour train trip
from Madrid and a bit less from Barcelona vs. 5 hours and 35
minutes on the TGV from the Montparnasse Station in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you have lots of time _ three more hours, in fact _ you
will not want to leave from the Austerlitz Station in Paris. The
cost from both stations is the same: $116 first class. $91 second
class. Information: (800) 438-7245 or www.raileurope.com.
</P>
<P>
   A plane from Spain to Lourdes should be faster than a train. But
it's not, because flights to the Ossun-Lourdes Airport (LDE is the
code) from either Barcelona or Madrid go to Paris first. On top of
that, most Iberia and all Air France flights bound for Lourdes from
Barcelona and Madrid arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport but leave
from Orly.
</P>
<P>
   As for cost, flying from Paris costs about $109 for a 75-minute
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Other than someone trying to get into the Guinness Book of
Records, who would spend 4 hours and 40 minute to fly from
Barcelona via Paris or an hour less from Barcelona? Both flights
are $290 one way.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy in Prague
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am planning a trip to Prague in the fall and would like to
know when Vladimir Ashkenazy will be conducting at Dvorak Hall. _
Marilyn F. Rothstein, Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Ashkenazy will conduct the Czech Philharmonic in eight
concerts from September to the end of the year at Dvorak Hall in
the Rudolfinum. It was Antonin Dvorak who conducted the orchestra's
first concert in 1896. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 28 and 29 two works by Mozart _ his Overture to ``Don
Giovanni'' and, with the soprano Barbara Bonney as soloist,
``Exsultate Jubilate'' will be performed _ as will Suk's Serenade
and Bartok's Dance Suite. Scheduled for Nov. 9 and 10 are the
Sibelius Violin Concerto with Ida Haendel as soloist and Strauss'
``Ein Heldenleben.'' On Nov. 16 and 17, the program will be
Martinu's ``Frescoes of Piero della Francesca,'' Berg's Lyric Suite
and Strauss' ``Symphonia Domestica.'' And on the program for Dec.
14 and 15 are the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, with Evgeny Kissin
as soloist, and Alexander von Zemlinsky's Lyric Symphony, with
soloists to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Next season's prices have yet to be set, but tickets for this
season are $5.90 to $12.85, at the rate of 38.22 crowns to the
dollar. They can be bought at the box office, corner of Ulice 17
Listopadu and Namesti Jana Palacha. It is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
weekdays and one hour before the concert; closed weekends. (All
performances start at 7:30 p.m.) Or you can write to the Czech
Philharmonic Orchestra, Alsovo Nabrezi 12, 110 01 Prague 1;

ESSAY: SEARCHING FOR DARK MATTER, WITH BOTH EYES CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times) 
 By MICHAEL RIORDAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty years ago this month, I flew from Boston to San Francisco
with another MIT graduate student, eager to begin physics research
on a new, two-mile-long atom smasher at Stanford. Just west of
Chicago, we passed above a circular gouge in the earth four miles
around _ the footprint of another particle accelerator then under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Working with these cutting-edge tools, physicists in the United
States shocked the scientific world with the revolutionary
discovery of quarks, the elementary particles at the heart of the
atomic nucleus. It was my good fortune to be a foot soldier in this
grand upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Those heady times came to mind recently after I learned about
surprising results from an underground experiment in Italy.
Although much debated, the results suggest that physicists are
closing in on the mysterious dark matter, believed to be a vast
halo of subatomic particles swirling surreptitiously throughout our
Milky Way galaxy and holding it together gravitationally.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of these particles may in fact be whizzing harmlessly
through my body every second. If certain cherished theories hold
true, they are but the lightest members of a large clan of exotic
bits of matter that mirror the electrons, protons and other
garden-variety particles of everyday existence. They are the
shadows of creation, ghostly remnants of the Big Bang birth of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But particle physicists in the United States are ill prepared to
join their European colleagues in following up these stunning
results, should they turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   The best instrument to pursue this research, a huge particle
smasher known as the superconducting super collider, suffered an
early death. Had it been built as originally planned, this $10
billion machine, designed to speed protons around a 54-mile track
and collide them, would now be producing results.
</P>
<P>
   But because Congress killed it in a deficit-reduction measure in
1993, there are no data, only a long tunnel, filling up with ground
water, beneath the plains of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although sensitive subterranean and satellite-borne detectors
have taken great strides in the past decade in unraveling the
fabric of the heavens, they are no substitutes for the precise,
controlled experiments that physicists perform with powerful
particle accelerators or colliders. Such sophisticated detectors
may glimpse the Big Bang's afterglow and sift through its ashes,
but these big particle smashers can mimic its fire.
</P>
<P>
   To recreate the primordial conditions in which the universe was
born, researchers must generate and clash two beams of high-energy
particles. Physicists in the United States already do this kind of
work on colliders at Fermilab in Illinois and at Stanford. But
concentrating enough energy to create the ultraheavy ghosts
believed to exist will require a mammoth machine, a
multibillion-dollar investment. There is no cheap alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the super collider's demise, however, graduate
students entering particle physics will soon be unable to work at a
machine in this country that can probe the far frontiers of their
chosen field. For the next several years, they can do interesting
research at Fermilab and Stanford, but these now-aging laboratories
will be eclipsed around mid-decade.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Large Hadron Collider, a 16-mile proton smasher to be
built near Geneva, starts churning out results after 2005, particle
physicists from the United States will have to cross the Atlantic
if they wish to continue doing forefront research. By pooling their
resources across national borders and patiently building advanced
instruments at this site for half a century, European physicists
have established a laboratory that is about to assume unchallenged
leadership in a prestigious field their counterparts in the United
States had pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of particle collider able to create such extreme
conditions is on drawing boards in Europe, Japan and the United
States. Accelerator builders have been designing miles-long,
arrow-straight machines to collide trillion-volt beams of electrons
with their antimatter opposites, known as positrons. Violent
electron-positron collisions can provide physicists a complementary
and clearer picture of what occurred in the primordial fire. This
gargantuan ``linear collider'' is the natural next step for
particle physics.
</P>
<P>
   Although American physicists pioneered this alternative, they
are now struggling to assure financing for the conceptual design of
this machine, which would stretch some 20 miles and cost more than
$5 billion. Last year, with memories of the super collider debacle
still fresh, Congress almost slashed federal support for the linear
collider design effort. Its future remains precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Given its hefty cost and the fact that scientists of many
nations will have access to it, this huge machine must be built as
a truly international project. That is one obvious lesson of the
super collider, which was widely viewed as a U.S. national project
that later came begging for foreign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Since our government will probably have to pay a substantial
part of the new machine's cost, it should be in, or at least near,
the United States. By far the deepest pool of expertise in building
and operating linear colliders exists right here in America.
</P>
<P>
   If this nation hopes to remain an active player in particle
physics, it must support such a quark-busting machine, sharing the
burdens of this enormously expensive research. Sending all our top
practitioners overseas will never suffice if Americans are to be
equal partners.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a healthy particle physics program in the United
States needs a major new collider that can serve as the common
focus for theorists, experimenters and accelerator builders while
promoting scientific exchanges with other countries. Insights
gained on one continent can then be confirmed (or, perhaps,
rejected) and extended on the other. Science thrives when there are
multiple competing points of view.
</P>
<P>
   But after the super collider's inglorious demise, other nations
regard the United States as a capricious scientific partner.
Congress finances major construction projects on a year-to-year
basis and jealously guards its option to terminate them. Building a
truly international scientific center on American soil will be a
truly challenging enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, particle physicists in the United States face a difficult
future. There is a wealth of exciting research begging to be done
on the dark matter particles _ and their kin _ thought to
contribute most of the mass of the universe. And to observe the
intense primordial fire that forged them requires that we build a
new multibillion-dollar machine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States possesses a dismal record of international
cooperation on scientific megaprojects. Unless its record improves
drastically, this physics will soon be done elsewhere. The next
generation of American particle physicists will not enjoy the
research opportunities I was so lucky to have had.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving area of low pressure in central Oklahoma will lead
to numerous showers and thunderstorms Tuesday. Some of these storms
will produce heavy amounts of rainfall as they move very slowly.
Meanwhile, low clouds and patchy showers in West Texas will keep
readings below seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will decrease across the Northeast in the wake of a cold
front. The abundant sun will combine with warm breezes from the
west to yield mild readings along the Northeast coast. Clouds will
linger from North Carolina to the lower Ohio Valley as the same
front becomes nearly stationary.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will promote very warm conditions in the
deserts of the Southwest, where readings will reach triple digits.
Meanwhile, the Northwest will be cool with showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DEPARTING SNOW
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, weather observers in Alaska noted that much of the
winter snowpack near Fairbanks had melted away. Recent satellite
observations have also shown a much reduced snowpack in southern
and central Canada, with only the higher elevations of western
Canada and woodlands of Quebec carrying snow. As large tracts of
snow in northern sections of the hemisphere succumb to the
strengthening sun, the breeding ground for winter chill disappears.
Consequently, by May, cold fronts sweeping south from Canada are no
longer able to herald the harsh chill of midwinter.

FINDINGS FUEL DEBATE ON PROSTATE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.H.)  (The Science Times) 
 By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In announcing on Thursday that he had prostate cancer, New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani paused to make a pitch that all men have the
test that revealed the early signs of his disease.
</P>
<P>
   The blood test measures levels of a protein called
prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which often rise when prostate
cancer strikes. ``I urge everyone to get the PSA test,'' Giuliani
said at the news conference. ``If the PSA is normal or low, you
don't have a problem. If it's high, then you have. You should have
it tested and find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new studies have provided strong, though not conclusive,
evidence that PSA testing can reduce deaths, and most prostate
cancer patients, like Giuliani, are glad they had the test.
``That's one of the most important things as far as I'm
concerned,'' said Robert Magnini of Staten Island, whose prostate
cancer was diagnosed last year. ``I'm willing to take any test that
tells you what your health is, especially the PSA.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many medical organizations and experts on prostate cancer
remain equivocal about when, or even if, the screening test should
be given. Their uncertainty reflects a continuing debate about
whether the test is worthwhile given that, especially in older men,
prostate cancer can be an indolent disease unlikely to cause
lasting harm to the health, while its treatment can often produce
serious side effects like impotence and incontinence.
</P>
<P>
   And while some experts praise the tests as contributing to the
sharp recent decline in deaths from prostate cancer, others
attribute the decline, at least in part, to advances in treatment.
</P>
<P>
   So the American College of Physicians offers this guidance to
doctors: ``Rather than screening all men for prostate cancer as a
matter of routine, physicians should describe the potential
benefits and known harms of screening, diagnosis and treatment,
listen to the patient's concerns and then individualize the
decision to screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Urological Association's ``best practice policy''
recommends that the decision on testing be left to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ian Thompson, chairman of the division of urology at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the
chairman of the panel that wrote the policy, said he now regarded
PSA screening more favorably. ``I was originally very much a
skeptic,'' Thompson said. But the death rate from prostate cancer
has dropped sharply in recent years, and Thompson said the PSA
screening was the ``only reasonable explanation'' for the
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the death rate from prostate cancer has dropped 16
percent among white men. Among black men, who contract prostate
cancer at higher rates, the death rate has dropped nearly 11
percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The blood test became common in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
and a study of Medicare recipients by researchers at the National
Cancer Institute found that, by 1994, about half of American men 65
or older had had at least one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of American medical organizations have not made
up their minds about this test, although the majority of Americans
have,'' said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, director of the National Cancer
Institute's Office of Special Populations Research.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the debate about the test persists because while
the disease is widespread among older men, it is usually harmless.
In autopsies of men over 50, about one in three show signs of
prostate cancer, but up to 80 percent of the tumors are microscopic
or deemed unlikely to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer will be diagnosed in an estimated 184,500 men in
the United States this year, making it the second most common type
of cancer among men, after skin cancer. The disease kills about
30,000 men a year nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But if a screening test revealed mostly microscopic or
slow-growing prostate cancers, that would lead to needless worry
and unnecessary treatment, since many of those tumors, it is
believed, will never spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what we're finding with PSA testing,'' said
Thompson. Most of the tumors discovered by the PSA test have been
the faster growing, more dangerous type, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the urological association and other medical
organizations would probably review more recent studies and ``look
at whether those recommendations should be revised.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a study in the March issue of the journal Epidemiology,
Brawley and two other researchers at the National Cancer Institute
found that, in 1997, the prostate cancer death rate for white men
under 85 in the United States had fallen below what it had been in
1986, the first year the PSA test was used for screening. In the
men aged 60 to 79, the 1997 death rate was lower than in any year
since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation that has been offered for the rise of prostate
cancer deaths between 1986 and 1991 is that the publicity
surrounding the PSA test may have made doctors more likely to
ascribe prostate cancer as the cause of death rather than other
contributing conditions. The subsequent fall in death rates could
just be doctors' returning to earlier practices.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Brawley said, ``we're starting to have evidence that
there may be a positive to prostate cancer screening and
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In another study, Dr. Peter Boyle of the European Institute of
Oncology in Milan and Dr. Georg Bartsch of the University of
Innsbruck in Austria looked at Tirol, an Austrian state, which has
offered free screening since 1993 to all men 45 to 74.
</P>
<P>
   They found that 70 percent of the eligible men in Tirol had been
given at least one PSA test, and that in 1998, the prostate-cancer
death rate was 42 percent below what would have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle and Bartsch will present their findings this week at the
meeting of the American Urological Association in Atlanta. They
have also submitted a paper to The Lancet, a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   None of the researchers describe their findings as proof that
the PSA tests save lives. The drop in deaths ``might be due to
screening,'' Brawley said. ``It might be due to the fact we've
learned to treat this disease better, and it might be due to both.
My belief is it is a combination of both, but I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   More definitive answers await the completion of studies that
compare the survival rate of men who get the tests to those who
don't. Results from the studies are years off.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics, like Dr. Harold C. Sox, chairman of the
department of medicine at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.,
remain unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in death rates is happening too soon to be explained
by the screening, he said. Prostate cancer usually takes years to
spread, so most of the men who received diagnoses of prostate
cancer by taking the test during the late 1980s and early 1990s
would still be alive anyway. ``I don't understand what's going
on,'' he said, ``but I don't think it's because of PSA screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox was the chairman of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
when it recommended against routine prostate cancer screening
several years ago. ``There isn't any evidence that screening has
any benefits,'' Sox said. ``But there's quite a bit of evidence
that the consequences of screening for some patients, namely
radical prostatectomy, have some harms. Unproven benefits and
proven harms. That's why we recommended against it as a routine
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostatectomy, removal of the prostate, often leads to impotence
and incontinence. Radiation and hormone therapy can also have
strong side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Sox said he could not comment on the Tirol study because he had
not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation to tell men about the PSA test and let them
decide is a reasonable one, said Sox, a specialist in internal
medicine. But patients need to realize that the decision involves
more than just getting the blood test.
</P>
<P>
   In counseling patients, he said, ``What I do is to say that if
you get screened, and have an abnormal PSA, then we're going to
have to face the question whether you need a biopsy or not. And if
you have a biopsy and it's positive for cancer, then you're going
to have to decide whether you're willing to go for treatment. So
when you're thinking about screening, you're really thinking about
a couple of downstream decisions.''

   NEW YORK _ Researchers from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine
here are providing new evidence to support an emerging theory that
explains how defects in the gene BRCA1 can cause breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   BRCA1 was identified in 1994, and its discovery sparked great
hope that once scientists figured out how the defects did their
damage the secrets of the disease would be unraveled, and would
lead to new means of prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, theories about how BRCA1 works have come and gone,
and scientists are still not entirely sure what the gene does. They
do know that BRCA1 is a large gene that directs the body to produce
an unusually big protein molecule, and that several hundred
different BRCA1 mutations exist, some of which greatly increase a
woman's risk of breast and ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But most cases of breast cancer in the United States have not
been linked to known breast cancer genes: only 5 percent to 7
percent of the 180,000 cases a year are familial, or inherited, and
only about half of the inherited cases occur in women with BRCA1
mutations. Another 40 percent are linked to another gene, BRCA2,
found in 1995. The nonfamilial cases are not thought to be linked
to BRCA mutations, though researchers have debated about whether
some of them might be.
</P>
<P>
   A new report being published Monday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences relates to BRCA1's role in the body's
natural surveillance system, which helps to prevent cancer.
Experiments on human cells in culture by the Mount Sinai team lend
support to the idea that BRCA1's normal job is to activate other
genes that slow down the reproduction of unruly cells that are
multiplying excessively, as occurs in cancer. But when BRCA1 is
damaged by a mutation, the signal to slow down is never relayed,
and cell division can go on and on unchecked, leading to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation fits in with the findings of other studies done
during the past few years, which also suggest that BRCA1 helps to
switch on genes that rein in cell growth. But the new findings
differ from the previous view of BRCA1, which held that the job of
the gene was to repair mistakes in DNA that occur when the
molecule, which must be copied during cell division, is copied
incorrectly. Failure to repair those mistakes is also thought to
lead to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the new findings do not mean that the DNA-repair theory is
wrong, a member of the Mount Sinai team said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to downplay the evidence for a DNA repair
function,'' said Dr. Curt Horvath, an author of the Mount Sinai
report, along with Dr. Toru Ouchi. Instead, he said, it is possible
that BRCA1 does both jobs, controlling cell division and repairing
DNA. The gene is the blueprint for an enormous protein molecule,
which may have more than one function.
</P>
<P>
   Horvath and his colleagues found that the healthy, nonmutated
form of BRCA1 plays an essential role in a series of steps needed
to stop cells from multiplying uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision that because of some mutation, a cell becomes
neoplastic, meaning its growth is uncontrolled,'' Horvath said.
``It's the first cell of a tumor.'' Normally, he said, such cells
change in ways that allow the cells of the immune system to
recognize them as foreign. The immune cells then make a substance
called interferon-gamma, which acts as a signal to halt cell
division. The protein product of BRCA1 and another protein, called
STAT1, are supposed to work together to relay that signal to
another gene, which shuts down the cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if BRCA1 is mutant, STAT1 can't activate that gene,''
Horvath said. ``It short-circuits the interferon-gamma signal that
normally tells cells to stop dividing.''
</P>
<P>
   Horvath said his study was the first to show that BRCA1 has a
role in relaying the signal from interferon-gamma, which is one of
several types of interferon made by the body to fight tumors and
viruses. But he cautioned that his team worked with only one mutant
form of BRCA1, and that other mutations might cause cancer in other
ways. And like any other preliminary finding, this discovery has to
be confirmed by other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   If the finding does hold up, Horvath said, it might point the
way toward new treatments. ``If we can understand the way these
proteins function in a normal situation and how mutations disrupt
that normal function, then we can try to target strategies to
compensate for those deficiencies,'' he said. ``It's not in our
hands now,'' he added, but he suggested that it might be possible
eventually to find another way, perhaps a drug, to activate the
gene that normally halts cell division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or perhaps we could design ways to enhance the STAT1-BRCA1
interaction in people with mutations so that they could still mount
this antitumor response,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, ``I think for BRCA1, since the mutations are
all spread out, there's unlikely to be a magic bullet. And there
are also the DNA-repair functions to deal with.'' The two types of
defect would probably need different types of treatment, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary-Claire King, a geneticist at the University of
Washington in Seattle, and an expert on the BRCA genes, said that
Horvath's findings were unlikely to have an immediate impact on
patients. But she also said the experiments were important
scientifically and ``make perfect sense'' in the light of other
studies that also point to a role for BRCA1 as an activator of
other genes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the Mount Sinai experiments added new
details about the pathways on which BRCA1 acts.

<P>
   The book of Genesis mentions three of Adam and Eve's children:
Cain, Abel and Seth. But geneticists, by tracing the DNA patterns
found in people throughout the world, have now identified lineages
descended from 10 sons of a genetic Adam and 18 daughters of Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is turning out to be a rich new archive for
historians and prehistorians, one whose range extends from recent
times to the dawn of human existence.
</P>
<P>
   Delvers in the DNA archive have recently found evidence for a
prehistoric human migration from Western Asia to North America;
identified the people who seem closest to the ancestral human
population; and given substantial weight to the whispers, long
dismissed by historians, that Thomas Jefferson fathered a family
with his slave Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   A new history of Britain and Ireland by Norman Davies, ``The
Isles,'' (Oxford University Press) begins with an account of
Cheddar man, an 8,980-year-old skeleton from which mitochondrial
DNA was recently extracted. The DNA turned out to match that of
Adrian Targett, a teacher in a Cheddar Village school, proving a
genetic continuity that, despite numerous invasions, had endured
through nine millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the DNA test used in forensic cases, which is designed to
identify individuals, DNA analysis that seeks to reach back in time
usually focuses on lineages, not individuals. From patterns in the
DNA data, biologists can often estimate the sizes of ancient
populations and even the approximate dates when one group of people
split from another.
</P>
<P>
   Though DNA can bear on historical questions, often by acting as
a long-range paternity test, its most spectacular use has been in
prehistory, where it has added a new dimension to the bare
framework provided by archaeology.
</P>
<P>
   The most detailed human family tree so far available is one
constructed over many years by Dr. Douglas C. Wallace and his
colleagues at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.
Wallace's tree is based on mitochondrial DNA, tiny rings of genetic
material that are bequeathed only by the egg cell and thus through
the maternal line. A counterpart tree for men, based on analysis of
the Y chromosome, has been prepared by Dr. Peter A. Underhill and
Dr. Peter J. Oefner of Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists believe that the ancestral human
population was very small _ a mere 2,000 breeding individuals,
according to a calculation published last December. But the family
tree based on human mitochondrial DNA does not trace back to the
thousand women in this ancestral population. The tree is rooted in
a single individual, the mitochondrial Eve, because all the other
lineages fell extinct.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of the Y chromosome tree, a consequence of the
fact that in each generation some men will have no children, or
only daughters, so the number of different Y chromosomes may
steadily diminish, even if the population stays the same size.
</P>
<P>
   This ancestral human population lived somewhere in Africa,
geneticists believe, and started to split up some time after
144,000 years ago, give or take 10,000 years, the inferred time at
which both the mitochondrial and Y chromosome trees make their
first branches.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria, which live inside human cells but outside the
nucleus, escape the shuffling of genes that occurs between
generations and are passed unchanged from mother to children. In
principle, all people should have the same string of DNA letters in
their mitochondria. In practice, mitochondrial DNA has steadily
accumulated changes over the centuries because of copying errors
and radiation damage.
</P>
<P>
   Because women were steadily spreading across the globe when many
of these changes occurred, some changes are found only in
particular regions and continents. Wallace discovered that almost
all American Indians have mitochondria that belong to lineages he
named A, B, C and D. Europeans belong to a different set of
lineages, which he designated H through K and T through X. The
split between the two main branches in the European tree suggests
that modern humans reached Europe 39,000 to 51,000 years ago,
Wallace calculates, a time that corresponds with the archaeological
date of at least 35,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia there is an ancestral lineage known as M, with
descendant branches E, F and G as well as the A through D lineages
also found in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa there is a single main lineage, known as L, which is
divided into three branches. L3, the youngest branch, is common in
East Africa and is believed to be the source of both the Asian and
European lineages.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's mitochondrial DNA lineages are known technically as
``haplogroups'' but more colloquially as ``daughters of Eve,''
because all are branches of the trunk that stems from the
mitochondrial Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The Y chromosome tree has not yet been published by the Stanford
researchers, but in a book that came out in March, ``Genes, People
and Languages,'' a colleague at the university, Dr. Luca
Cavalli-Sforza, sketched a preview of the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The tree is rooted in a single Y chromosomal Adam, and has 10
principal branches, Cavalli-Sforza reports. Of these sons of Adam,
the first three (designated I, II and III) are found almost
exclusively in Africa. Son III's lineage migrated to Asia and begat
sons IV-X, who spread through the rest of the world _ to the Sea of
Japan (son IV), northern India (son V) and the South Caspian (sons
VI and IX).
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli-Sforza believes these Y chromosome lineages may be
associated with the major language groups of the world. The South
Caspian population, for example, may have spoken Eurasian, the
ancestral tongue of Indo-European (to which English belongs) and
most of the continent's other major language families. But Wallace,
asked if his mitochondrial DNA lineages also corresponded to the
world's major language groups, said he ``tended to be more cautious
than Luca.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has recently been exploring the root of the
mitochondrial tree. In an article published in March in The
American Journal of Human Genetics, he and colleagues identify the
Vasikela Kung of the northwestern Kalahari desert in southern
Africa as the population that lies nearest to the root of the human
mitochondrial DNA tree. Another population that seems almost
equally old is that of the Biaka pygmies of Central Africa. Both
peoples live in isolated regions, which may be why their
mitochondrial DNA seems little changed from that of the ancestral
population. ``We are looking at the beginning of what we would call
Homo sapiens,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vexed issues in human prehistory is the timing
and number of migrations into the Americas. Dr. Joseph Greenberg, a
linguist at Stanford University, has proposed three migrations,
corresponding to the three language groups of the Americas, known
as Amerind, Na-Dene and Eskimo-Aleut. Wallace's mitochondrial DNA
data broadly support this general thesis, though the arrival of the
Amerind-speakers seems more complex than a single migration.
</P>
<P>
   Of the A through D lineages found in American Indians, A, C and
D also occur in Siberian peoples, suggesting that their ancestors
were the principal source of the Amerind-speakers' migration. But
the B lineage, though it is found elsewhere in Asia, has not turned
up in Siberia, a hint that the B people may have taken a sea route
to the Americas and then merged there with their A- , C- and
D-carrying cousins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Wallace and his colleagues discovered the X pattern, a
rare European lineage, among the northern American Indians such as
the Ojibwa and Sioux. At first they assumed it came from
intermarriage with modern Europeans. But the American X lineage
turned out to be pre-Columbian, and its owners would have arrived
in America either 15,000 or 30,000 years ago, depending on certain
genetic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   The European X lineage seems to have originated in Western Asia
around 40,000 years ago. Wallace suggests a part of this group may
have made their way to America via Siberia, even though no traces
of the X-lineage have yet turned up in eastern Asia. A
trans-Atlantic route is a possible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   When modern humans first started to leave Africa, about 50,000
years ago by present reckoning, they probably consisted of small
groups of hunter-gatherers a few hundred strong. In their
determined exploration of the world before them, they must have
overcome, with the primitive means at their disposal, the extreme
rigors of climate, terrain and perhaps the archaic human
populations like the fearsome Neanderthals who had preceded them
out of Africa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biologist Edward O. Wilson, in a recent interview with The
Wall Street Journal, mused that a new basis for spiritual values
might be found _ not in the usual religious sources but in what he
sees as the inspiring story of human origins and history. ``We need
to create a new epic based on the origins of humanity,'' he said,
adding: ``Homo sapiens have had one hell of a history! And I am
speaking both of deep history _ evolutionary, genetic history _ and
then, added on to that and interacting with it, the cultural
history recorded for the past 10,000 years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biologists who are reconstructing the human past
certainly believe their work has a value that transcends genetics.
Although their lineage trees are based on genetic differences, most
of these differences lie in the regions of DNA that do not code for
genes and have no effect on the body. ``We are all Africans at the
Y chromosome level and we are really all brothers,'' Underhill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace remarked that since he started working on mitochondrial
DNA in the late 1970s: ``What I have found astounding is that it
clearly shows we are all one human family. The phylogeny in Africa
goes back to the origins of our species, but the fingers of L3 are
touching Europe and Asia, saying that we are all closely related.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not genetic prehistory is suitable material for a
modern origin myth, it is about to be made available to a wider
public. Last month a company called Oxford Ancestors set up
business with the offer to tell customers which of the seven
daughters of Eve they are descended from. (Almost all Europeans
belong to only seven of the nine mitochondrial lineages found in
Europe). The test (see www.oxfordancestors.com) requires sending in
a sample of cells brushed from the inside of the cheek. For a mere
$180, anyone of European ancestry can establish the start of a
genealogy far senior to Charlemagne's.
</P>
<P>
   The company's founder is Dr. Bryan Sykes, a human geneticist at
the University of Oxford in England. On the reasonable basis that
the founders of Wallace's mitochondrial DNA lineages were real
women, Sykes gave them names and sketched in details of their
likely dates and origin. Thus people found to belong to haplogroup
U will be told they are descended from Ursula, who lived about
45,000 years ago in Northern Greece. Ancestor of the X's is Xenia,
who lived 25,000 years ago in the Caucasus mountains.
</P>
<P>
   As if fulfilling Wilson's suggestion, Sykes said he had ``worked
out a mythological framework for these seven women,'' in respect of
the arduous times in which they must have lived and the triumph of
spreading their mitochondrial DNA to almost all the inhabitants of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He is now working on tests to identify other lineages around the
world, including 14 in Africa, and 16 in Eurasia and the Americas.
``I don't think this stuff should be confined to academics,'' he
said.

&HT;     SCIENTISTS LAUNCH NEW CELL PHONE HEALTH STUDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scientists are launching a new series of studies to
determine whether radiation from cell phones sparks maladies such
as leukemia, cancer, birth defects, reproductive ailments in women
and diseases in children.
</P>
<P>
   The studies include a surveillance program that will search for
clusters of cell phone users suffering particular illnesses. The
goal of the program is to determine whether the devices were the
cause or a contributing factor to the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The group also will study whether the federal government's
existing guidelines for cell phone radiation exposure are stringent
enough to protect users.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Carlo, a lawyer and epidemiologist who directs the
Washington-based Health Risk Management Group, will manage the new
effort. Private individuals and cell phone companies have supplied
seed money, Carlo said. He estimated it could take a year or more
to raise the $60 million he says is needed to conduct the studies.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo declined to name the backers but stressed that his
organization is not accepting money from plaintiffs lawyers, who
could profit if a conclusive link is demonstrated between cell
phones and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo previously headed a five-year, $27 million project funded
by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the
industry's trade association, that found possible health problems
associated with cellular phones use.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo said the new studies _ expected to last four years _ would
be farmed out to research and academic institutions around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The surveillance aspect of the research is unique among studies
that assess cell phone health risks, according to Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, nobody in the world is looking for specific health
problems'' possibly associated with specific brands of cell phones,
Carlo said. For the surveillance study, the idea is to get as many
cell phone users as possible to fill out detailed questionnaires
and allow themselves to be monitored by researchers on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will watch for ``clusters'' of disease _ large
numbers of people suffering from a particular ailment who may also
share the same type of cell phone. ``If we have a cluster, we'll
send out a team into the field to do in-depth interviews. That may
lead us to making some type of conclusion in terms of a risk or may
lead to a follow-up research study,'' Carlo said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the CTIA, said he was not
familiar with the planned studies. But he stressed that the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration and international health organizations
``thus far concluded that wireless phone use has no impact on
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA says there is no scientific basis for concluding that
cell phones are unsafe _ or safe. The only way to conclusively
answer the safety question is through ``a significant research
effort,'' the FDA says.
</P>
<P>
   That effort is scheduled to get underway later this year when
the FDA and CTIA are expected to announce a joint research effort
to determine if there are cell phone health risks. The National
Cancer Institute and the UN's World Health Organization also are
conducting major studies about whether cell phones spark diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety regulators are concerned about findings released
last year from two industry-sponsored studies managed by Carlo's
organization.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies _ conducted by the American Health Foundation
in New York _ found an association between cell phone use and a
rare type of brain tumor. The other study, conducted by Integrated
Laboratory Systems in Research Triangle Park, N.C., found that DNA
in human blood cells breaks down when exposed to large doses of
cell phone radiation, possibly laying the genetic groundwork for
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   With over 86 million cellular phone users in the United States
alone and 30,000 new users signing up daily, ``this translates into
a potentially significant public health problem, should the use of
these devices even slightly increase the risk of adverse health
effects,'' the FDA says.

KHMER DANCE IN A LESSON FOR KHMER ROUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ At the end, the murdered Desdemona in her
pinnacled gold headdress rises again to gaze at her fate as her
desperate husband and killer, Othello, kneels before her in a
silent plea not for forgiveness but for punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus concludes a new retelling of Shakespeare's ``Othello'' in
the refined and ancient vocabulary of classical Khmer dance, and it
confronts Cambodia's tortured society with a difficult message:
Take responsibility for your evil deeds.
</P>
<P>
   This month, in the still-ravaged and poverty-ridden capital of
this tiny Southeast Asian nation, an expatriate Cambodian dancer
and choreographer has returned from the United States with a jolt
of modernity cloaked in the rigidly beautiful forms of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The stated aim of the choreographer, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,
32, is to build a cultural bridge between her two worlds by
presenting a story from classical Western culture in the great
classical art form of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samritechhak,'' which means ``Dark Prince,'' is a homage to
her teachers and her tradition as well as an attempt to enrich the
nation she left nearly a decade ago with the vision she has gained
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With a $30,000 grant from the Irvine Foundation in California,
she is staging her creation with about 30 dancers, musicians and
singers from Cambodia's Royal University of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her venture has been received with a cautious welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``A monkey in a cage is not as smart as a monkey in the
forest,'' she quoted her uncle, a leading dance teacher and patron
of the arts, as counseling her on her journey. But at a recent
rehearsal, dressed all in white and fluttering a black bamboo fan,
her uncle, Chheng Phon, remained quietly reserved about the
production of his young protege. ``It takes courage to try this,''
he said, speaking in French. ``For now I have no opinion. I await
the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro bows to his opinion. One quality she has not lost in her
transition to the West is reverence for her elders and her culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young Cambodian artist I do not have the privilege to
change anything,'' she said. ``My ancestors created something
unique to history. I only have the privilege to try to make it
better. I think I would be a criminal if I did anything to destroy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a remark that did seem to reflect the vibrant artistic
scene of her new home, California, she said she hoped to ``expand
the vocabulary of dance, to make it relevant and significant to
Cambodian audiences of today.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreography of Shapiro's ``Othello'' is exquisitely true to
the ancient form, with its complex and difficult movements, its
glittering costumes that send bouncing sprays of reflection onto
the walls, and its rhythmic, quavering melodies.
</P>
<P>
   She has adapted the story to be sung by a traditional chorus,
but even here she has used only familiar traditional melodies. Her
boldest innovation in the form itself, Shapiro says, is to lengthen
the rhythmic step of the dancers just the tiniest bit to suggest
the rocking of ocean waves.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how fixed the art form, every new artist brings
himself to it. And like everyone of her generation, Shapiro has
lived through one of the greatest traumas in her nation's history,
the brutal reign of the Communist Khmer Rouge, which was
responsible for the deaths of more than a million people from 1975
to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Now, perhaps as a result of her experience in America, perhaps
not, she has something to say to her countrymen. Cambodian men who
have seen her production say they find Othello's suicide a sign of
weakness, particularly in a military leader, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been thinking about this, and there is probably
something Cambodians can learn from `Othello,' and that is that you
have to be responsible for your actions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khmer Rouge today never say they were responsible for
killing millions of Cambodians. `Othello,' regardless of his
accomplishments in his military career, punishes himself severely
for his mistake in killing an innocent person. And in the story the
last word Othello says is not, `Please forgive me.' It is `Punish
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is a strong statement to make in today's Cambodia, where
powerful men are rarely punished. Most of the aging leaders of the
Khmer Rouge remain free, and most of society's leaders accept their
suggestion to ``let bygones be bygones.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's introduction of a foreign story, not to mention what
many here see as a foreign notion of accountability, troubles some
Cambodians. In a recent interview, a reporter from the daily
newspaper Rasmei Kampuchea repeatedly asked her about her
introduction of alien elements into an art form that has been
handed down painstakingly from teacher to pupil over the
generations. ``This is not just my concern but the concern of many
people,'' the reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro responded that Cambodian classical dance itself had
roots in India and that the central stories it recounts _ with
their many similarities to the themes of ``Othello'' _ are taken
from the Ramayana, the great Indian epic.
</P>
<P>
   She is not an alien to Cambodian culture. She was a child during
the time of the Khmer Rouge, and she was one of the first
youngsters to be trained in dance in the early 1980s when the few
surviving court dancers struggled to bring their art form back to
life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 she married an American writer, John Shapiro, and moved
to California, where she has devoted herself to Cambodian culture
as a dancer, teacher and administrator of cultural programs in Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had carried a sense of guilt for leaving her
teachers and fellow dancers behind in the threadbare academy. Her
production of ``Othello'' is in part an effort to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Cambodian artist, I feel somehow guilty that I left,''
she said. ``After the Khmer Rouge time my teachers worked so hard
to teach my generation, and they hoped that we would take over
responsibility for preserving the dance here. And then I left. They
were wasting their energy because their student was not useful to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I thought, well, I'm not the best dancer in school.
Probably I can learn something more in the United States, and in
the future I can serve Cambodia better.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ideas emerge most strongly at the end of the dance she has
choreographed. Aware that it is not proper in Cambodian tradition
for characters to die at the end, she resurrects them in a moment
that challenges both traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end they rise and become like sculptures,'' she said.
``Their decay is only physical. I want to say that Desdemona moves
on, whether she forgives Othello or not. Her meditative expression
contains deep resentment. That is the Cambodian people of today.
They are moving on, but they are not forgiving the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Othello is at her feet, taking responsibility for his
actions, unlike other Cambodian leaders, who just point their
fingers at each other.''

DAWN UPSHAW SALUTES A KINDRED SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLAN KOZINN    
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  NEW YORK _ Dawn Upshaw seems to think less about individual
recital programs than about expansive celebrations of song that
require several concerts and lead her listeners through a maze of
styles and themes. As a soprano who is widely admired for the
beauty of her voice, her perceptive and communicative
interpretations and the inventiveness of her programming ideas,
Upshaw has the clout and the drawing power to hold the stage for a
series rather than an individual concert. She was thinking in
series terms a dozen years ago when her career was at an earlier
stage and before performer-driven series were as common as they
have been at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall these last few
seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upshaw's current series, ``Images of Dawn,'' will make its way
to exotic new music and American popular song before it ends on May
20. But its first installment, on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully
Hall, was a more conventional concert of French art song, with a
slight thematic twist. Upshaw offered it as a tribute to Jane
Bathori, a French mezzo-soprano who flourished in the early decades
of the 20th century and gave the premieres of dozens of works,
including the songs by Debussy, Ravel, Milhaud, Satie, Hahn,
Honegger, Roussel, Tailleferre and Koechlin that Upshaw sang. The
program largely replicated her recent Erato disc, ``Hommage a Jane
Bathori, the Inspiring Muse,'' which she recorded in a Paris
concert last year. Her superb accompanist on that recording, Jerome
Ducros, was also her collaborator on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Upshaw sees a kindred spirit here: like Bathori, she
sings and commissions a good deal of new music, and perhaps at the
back of her mind is the hope that a future soprano will recall her
with equal generosity. The program, after all, could have stood on
its merits without a unifying patron saint. And Upshaw is her own
singer, not a re-creator of a past style.
</P>
<P>
   Her interpretive view of the French song repertory is admirably
flexible, and although its overriding characteristic is an ear for
chromatic nuance it also had a playful side. That may not suit all
tastes: although her use of a slightly pinched ``child voice'' in
Satie's ``Dapheneo'' and some of Hahn's settings of Robert Louis
Stevenson poems was certainly supportable, given the texts, those
readings veered uncomfortably toward preciousness.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the dramatic and sometimes theatrical flair that
Upshaw brought to most of her readings had an enlivening effect,
particularly in Honegger's evocative ``Clotilde,'' ``Automne'' and
``Les Choches'' from the six Apollinaire settings and Roussel's
exquisitely emotional ``Adieux.'' Ducros matched Upshaw's fluid
readings at every turn.

&HT;     FOREIGN POLICY INEXPERIENCE DOESN'T MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore points out correctly that
Gov. George W. Bush lacks experience in foreign policy, compared to
Gore's own extensive knowledge. So what?
</P>
<P>
   Presidential history shows that prior experience dealing with
international leaders and issues has very little to do with how
well presidents manage foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Far more important are the president's ability to analyze events
and use good judgment, the quality of advice from his experts and
the accuracy of the information available at decision-making time.
</P>
<P>
   History may sometimes repeat itself, but it never does so
precisely. Every problem the new president will face will be
different than the ones his predecessor confronted. Some may be
continuations of old issues, but the personalities and
circumstances that frame them will have inevitably changed.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy, for instance, served on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee for three years before he entered the
White House, giving him access to much insider information. But we
came to the brink of nuclear war during the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis, the result of Kennedy's shallow performance at his first
summit with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who so underestimated
Kennedy he thought he could sneak Soviet missiles onto Cuban soil.
Kennedy saved the day by being tough-minded, but the crisis was his
fault in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Kennedy who expanded our military presence in Vietnam
beyond the handful of ``advisers'' sent in by President Dwight
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Senate majority leader, President Lyndon Johnson
also was an experienced foreign policy hand, yet he drastically
escalated the war in Vietnam. He bears most of the political burden
for that bloody disaster, which ruined his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon, a former vice president, prided himself on his
understanding of global affairs. He campaigned in 1968 with ``a
secret plan to end the war'' in Vietnam. Yet the war raged on until
a vague, humiliating settlement in 1972 called for U.S. withdrawal.
It was not until 1975, after Nixon's resignation over the Watergate
affair, that the United States went home.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's claim to foreign policy expertise rests mostly on the
opening of diplomatic relations with China during his
administration. Although Nixon and Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger would have us believe that their remarkable vision
accomplished this, it was really their good timing. China was in
economic trouble, its leadership was aging, and a little political
relaxation seemed in order.
</P>
<P>
   President Gerald Ford was in office so briefly he pretty much
got a pass on international problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a former governor like Presidents Reagan, Bush and
Clinton, wasn't so lucky. It may or may not have been his
inexperience that compounded the mess that was the Iranian hostage
crisis and the bungled rescue operation. The revolution in Iran
spun out of control when the U.S. embassy was seized, and it is
unlikely any training could have adequately prepared a president
for what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, who came to office with a legendary ignorance of
foreign affairs, lucked out with the formidable Secretary of State
George Shultz and the unraveling of the Soviet Union. The latter
had more to do with internal communist timing than with an American
president's dramatic rhetoric, although that and an overstuffed
military budget didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's personal role was more shadowy than substantive and
that saved him from taking the fall for the illegal contra war in
Nicaragua which was run from the White House basement by Oliver
North. That secret enterprise was the stuff of impeachment but when
investigated, Reagan was able to claim, apparently correctly, total
ignorance. Lesser officials were convicted instead.
</P>
<P>
   Then came George Bush, the most experienced foreign policy
expert of the era, having served as ambassadors to China and the
United Nations, and as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
His quick invasion of Iraq and rollback of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait was a triumph, with few American casualties. But when he
took the troops home without marching on Baghdad or getting rid of
Saddam Hussein, he left behind an angry sore in the Middle East
that plagues us still.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is no genius on foreign policy, but on the
whole he has managed things satisfactorily. The lid has been kept
on the potentially most dangerous problems.
</P>
<P>
   The crises in Bosnia and Kosovo have been handled shakily but
steadily, with allied partnerships, and kept at a publicly
acceptable level of violence. Middle East peace negotiations are
dicey as always, but no more scary than before. Terrorism from
rogue states, global environmental issues and international drug
traffic remain unsolved but nobody expected they would be.
</P>
<P>
   So it may not matter a great deal if Bush is a tad naove when he
meets with, say, a world leader whose name he could not recall in a
campaign interview. On the other hand, it may.

TURKISH PARLIAMENT FAILS TO ELECT LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The Parliament failed Monday for a second
time to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to elect the reformist
candidate for president who is favored by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The chosen candidate, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, finished far ahead of
other candidates, with 314 votes. The next ballot is scheduled for
Friday, and in that round just a simple majority of 276 will be
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sezer is supported by the leaders of all five parties
represented in Parliament, including Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
organization, he has been considered a shoo-in for election. Many
Turks who are campaigning for a more open political system hope
that he will win, and they remained optimistic after the vote
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who support him are confident,'' said Orhan Erisen, an
executive who works with grass-roots groups. ``He's going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But although Sezer, who is the chief justice of the highest
court, remains the heavy favorite, influential figures with various
motives are reportedly conspiring quietly against him. Several
newspapers have reported that military commanders, who wield
considerable power, are less than thrilled with Sezer's candidacy.
He has advocated the repeal of laws that limit freedom of speech,
and senior officers have said in the past that those laws are
necessary to prevent Turks from advocating separatism, religious
fundamentalism or other subversive causes.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer has also asserted that the decisions of every government
agency, without exception, should be subject to judicial review.
The military regularly cashiers officers whom it considers
sympathetic to fundamentalism, and it denies them the right to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Military commanders have not publicly expressed opposition to
Sezer. One newspaper reported Monday that they were making no
visible efforts to block him because they considered it ``quite
impossible'' that he could turn his ideas into law.
</P>
<P>
   Another reported center of behind-the-scenes opposition Sezer is
the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party. Its leading figure, former Prime
Minister Necmettin Erbakan, is said to have told his friends in
Parliament that he dislikes Sezer because in a court case in which
he was a witness, Sezer refused to order a recess for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Parliament members consider Sezer too liberal. Others may
resent his role in decisions that invalidated laws that would have
given them with lucrative pensions. Still others apparently hope to
promote members of their own parties rather than vote for a
lifelong independent like Sezer.
</P>
<P>
   Under Turkish law, Parliament may cast only four ballots in the
race, with a simple majority being enough to elect a candidate in
the third or fourth round. If no candidate wins a majority after
four rounds, Parliament is dissolved and new elections are called.
Members are thought to want to avoid this at all costs. So if no
candidate wins a majority on Friday, one is expected to be chosen
on the fourth and last ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In a fourth ballot, only the candidates who finished first and
second in the third ballot would be allowed to compete. Sezer could
find himself facing the speaker of Parliament, Yildirim Akbulut,
who finished a distant second in the balloting Monday with 88
votes.

EVEN FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES CAN'T DIMINISH VENEZUELA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The main luxury hotel is still being used
as a military barracks, and tractors and earth-moving trucks now
provide the only traffic along the main drag that used to bustle
with nightclubs and restaurants. Four months after floods and
mudslides devastated the Caribbean coast just north of here,
tourism in Venezuela's main beach playground zone remains crippled.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster was the worst in the modern history of this South
American nation of 23 million people, killing several thousand
people and leaving an additional 150,000 homeless. But the toll to
the economy and infrastructure has also proved immense, and
recovery efforts throughout the coastal state of Vargas have been
slowed by the inability of authorities to marshal money,
organization, personnel and equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, tourist arrivals in
Venezuela fell by more than 25 percent in 1999, with the sharpest
decline coming at the end of the year, normally the busiest period
here. Figures for the first quarter of this year haven't been
announced, but tour and hotel operators say they will be even more
discouraging. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by the rivers of mud that came cascading down Mount
Avila, which separates this capital of 6 million people from
coastal resort towns, were dozens of hotels and time-share
condominiums that had sprung up along the shore. The luxury
Sheraton Macuto, where army troops are now lodged, is expected to
reopen this year, but some smaller hotels built on gullies are not
expected to reopen, and the timetable for others is unclear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation continues to be difficult, with some hotels
still buried in mud,'' said Hugo Arrioja, president of the Hotel
Federation of Venezuela. ``We have to recognize that some of the
smaller ones are going to be closed for good, but we hope that the
majority will be able to re-establish themselves.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrioja acknowledged that the disaster zone's beaches, its main
lure, are also ``totally damaged'' and that tourism there is going
to have to find a new focus, such as mountain climbing or fishing.
While no one knows for certain how many people died in the floods
that began Dec. 15, it is assumed that hundreds or even thousands
of bodies were entombed under the avalanches of mud, boulders and
other debris that engulfed and destroyed several popular beaches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The disaster also forced the closing of both Venezuela's main
international airport at Maiquetia and the nearby port of La
Guaira, used by cruise ships, for several weeks. Both have now
reopened, and while there is nothing for visitors to see in the
immediate vicinity other than tent cities and reconstruction work,
Venezuelan officials emphasize that the rest of the country was
unaffected by the calamity and remains open for business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be five years before tourism can resume in the 25-mile
coastal strip that was damaged,'' said Maria Eugenia Loriente,
director of Corpoturismo, the government tourism agency. ``But we
still have more than 1,500 miles of coastline that were unaffected,
as well as Amazon jungles, Angel Falls and plains teeming with
wildlife, all of which are hundreds of miles away from the disaster
zone and are of greater interest to foreign tourists anyway.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, visitors from abroad still seem to be staying away
from this country, which is larger than Texas. Linda Sonderman, an
American who runs Alpi Tour, a travel agency here specializing in
adventure tourism, estimates that her bookings are down 40 percent
this year and places the blame on lack of information and
publicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela is still as spectacular as ever, but the fact is
that people are still worried and nothing has been done to dispel
the idea that this disaster was not localized,'' she said. ``It
shouldn't be affecting things any more, but it is, and we are just
beginning to recover.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry here was already confronting difficulties
before the December mudslides, so not all of the decline can be
attributed to the disaster. Perhaps the most expensive country in
South America, Venezuela has a currency that economists say is
overvalued by as much as 50 percent, making accommodations and
meals more expensive than in neighboring countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of the disaster, travel agents here said, is
that many middle-class Venezuelans who in the past spent their
holidays in the affected zone are now heading for nearby Caribbean
destinations such as Aruba, Curacao and the Dominican Republic. As
a result, fewer hotel rooms than usual may be available there, they
said. &QL;

&HT;     THE AGING WANT TO STAY HOME AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, SURVEY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The vast majority of baby boomers and the elderly
don't want the flavor of home sweet home to turn sour, and many are
taking steps to modify their homes for use far into their
retirement years, according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Retired Persons's national survey of
housing and home modification _ ``Fixing to Stay'' _ found that 83
percent of those surveyed said they want to stay in their current
homes as long as possible. In an effort to mix in the views of
soon-to-retire baby boomers, the survey questioned 2,000 persons
age 45 and above.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the survey at a press conference Monday kicked off
the organization's ``Independent Living Week.'' With over 34
million members, the AARP is sponsoring activities aimed at helping
older people live in their homes longer, as well as raising
awareness among soon-to-retire people that it's never too early to
start senior-proofing a home.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Harper, AARP's senior housing specialist, said seniors can
take steps that would help solve such classic problems as slipping
and falling in a tub or on the stairs, or turning faucets on and
off.
</P>
<P>
   Simple changes in a home can sometimes make the difference
between staying put or moving to a nursing home, Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message we've got to communicate is that `it's not you _
it's the house,''' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was the fifth report since 1986 covering the
relationship between housing and aging. This survey differed from
previous ones because it included _ for the first time _
respondents between ages 45 and 55, and a specific sampling of
African Americans and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   The older people get, the more likely they are to want to stay
put, the survey found. While 75 percent of those between 45 and 55
said they hoped to remain in their current home as long as
possible, 95 percent of those 75 and older want to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The answers by members of minority groups tracked closely with
the answers from non-minority group members, with one exception:
Minorities were six percentage points less likely than
non-minorities to want to stay in their current residences.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that many respondents have made at least
one modification that makes the home easier for older people to
live in it. The modifications range from non-skid strips in tubs,
showers and on stairs, levers in place of faucet knobs, and
nightlights in dark hallways and bathrooms.
</P>

<P>
   LISTVYANKA, Russia _ Almost any resident of this village can
tick off the seemingly endless string of superlatives about the
great lake _ inland sea, really _ that laps insistently against the
town docks. Lake Baikal is the biggest, the oldest, by far the
deepest, the clearest lake on earth. Were it empty, all the world's
rivers would have to flow for an entire year to fill it. It has
more than 1,500 plants and animals found nowhere else, including
the world's only purely freshwater seal.
</P>
<P>
   But press a resident to say what he loves most about Baikal, and
he may cast his lot with the nondescript, gray, oily, foot-long
fish that dwells therein.
</P>
<P>
   Siberians love the lowly omul. They love it fried, dried,
smoked, baked, grilled, salted, stuffed, with internals and without
internals, with and without scales. Residents of the eastern shore
even like it slightly decayed _ ``with odor,'' they call it.
</P>
<P>
   In warm weather _ which is to say above freezing _ they sell it
from dozens of roadside stands along the shore, their portable
cookers belching the smoke of burning alder, with rows of cured
fish on the tables, waiting to be wrapped in newspaper and carried
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``'The stands are a relatively new thing,'' said one 31-year-old
omul-hawker, who would identify himself only as Mikhail. ``In
Soviet times, you could hardly find any fish. The rumor was always
that the catch went under a contract to Czechoslovakia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days we sell a hundred; some days 10,'' he added. ``It
depends on the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Life has not been kind to the little fish, a distant cousin of
the lake herring that inhabits the Great Lakes. Experts at the
Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Limnology _ limnology is
the scientific study of lakes _ say the population has risen and
fallen in tandem with wars, famines and other events that forced
people to turn to this reliable food supply.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, fishermen took so many omul that netting them was
briefly banned. When a hydroelectric dam was built on the Angarsk
River, Baikal's only outlet, the lake rose, causing a change in
water temperature that led to a drastic decline in the fry that are
the omul's main meal. The result has been a smaller and,
presumably, hungrier omul than in past decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains the great lake's most abundant fish. Up to
150,000 tons of omul live there, although the numbers are said to
have declined in recent years, and the the government limits the
annual take to 10,000 tons. Served in a decent restaurant, the
omul's abundant, light gray meat tastes not unlike flounder, bland
and only slightly fishy. Smoked, it acquires an almost sweet
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   But to an outsider, the omul's main selling point seems not
taste, but price. Just about any stand will sell one, smoked until
its cellophane-thin skin turns golden, for between 7 and 15 rubles
_ about 25 to 50 cents _ depending on its size.
</P>
<P>
   The wharf at Listvyanka, the main stopping point for travelers
from the nearby big cities of Irkutsk and Angarsk, is prime
territory for the omul merchants, and it appears to be flourishing.
On the steep hill behind the shore, steam baths and vacation homes
have sprung up with spectacular views of the snowcapped Khamat
Dabar mountains to the east, across 30 miles of water.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen or so omul sellers who had set up their smokers and
tables on the wharf said they were increasingly visited by tourists
from Germany, Japan and the United States. But one day recently, a
cold wind blew in off the ice-covered lake and customers were
scarce, so they entertained a visitor with some of the more exotic
omul recipes.
</P>
<P>
   There is raw salted omul _ the fish is placed in a pile of salt,
organs intact, and left for 12 hours before being washed and eaten.
And there is pressed omul, in which layers of salt and gutted omul
are alternated, lasagna-style. There is hot smoked omul, roasted
for 40 minutes, and cold-smoked omul, bathed in cool alder smoke
for three days. Lightly salted and dried _ its innards are pried
open and exposed to the air with tiny matchstick-size crossbeams _
``you can take it anywhere,'' one merchant said. ``It will last
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the overwhelming preference is for gutted fish, some
customers prefer hot-smoked omul with the organs intact, and
generally wolf it down, scales and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like it with organs because it's juicier that way,'' said
Yana Borodina, a 23-year-old woman who tended one table.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is omul ``s dushkom'' _ with odor _ the
delicacy of Baikal's mountainous eastern shore and a traditional
dish of the Buryat, the Mongol-related people who live there.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe is fairly simple: Catch an omul, place it in warm
sunlight until it begins to smell _ generally 10 to 20 minutes _
and eat it, scales, organs and all. ``Each according to his
taste,'' a grimacing Borodina said, then told a joke: It seems that
a man from the east went into a market and asked the owner, ``Is
the fish fresh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' the owner said. ''In that case,'' the man
replied, ``I'll go somewhere else.''

ECHOES OF KENT STATE: SHOOTINGS TOUCHED OUR INSULATED LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - On May 4, 1970, National Guard units at Kent State
University opened fire on students protesting the war in Vietnam:
Four dead in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   That little holocaust 30 years ago brought to its knees months
of protests on student campuses across America and even touched our
serene pastures at the University of Iowa, a campus usually removed
from the radical fields of Berkeley, Madison and eastern Ohio. My
now-graying generation was shaped by such events, whether we were
then burners of draft cards, flags and bras, or whether we prefered
to light our fires with more mainstream incendiary devices like
lava lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Down with protests. Up with People.
</P>
<P>
   Kent State was a seminal event in our lives, like the
assassination of John F. Kennedy, like Woodstock. We share a common
generational memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1970, I was a freshman at Iowa, which had
hosted a meager but respectable offering of demonstrations -
candlelight vigils, Friday brown-bag protests on the main square of
buildings known as the Pentacrest and the repeated busting of
windows at the very Establishment campus book store - officially
named Iowa Book &AMP; Supply, dubbed Iowa Book &AMP; Crook by the
anti-capitalist counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   Our own state troopers, the Iowa Military Police Battalion, were
called in from time to time to quell disturbances. Protesters
burned a bus. A World War II-era building housing the rhetoric
department and graduate student offices was torched. Student
strikes were called.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution had come slowly to Iowa City. The flow of agitation
arrived in the Heartland as a trickle that became a stream, led by
drifters from Students from a Democratic Society and the Weathermen
and freelance activists who traveled from campus to campus like
itinerant preachers with their own fold-up pulpits and Bibles
written by Marx, Mao, Lenin and Lennon. In the peace and civil
rights faith, they were junior clergy, serious about their
religious convictions but temperate in the execution of those
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   No blood was spilled. Across the state at Iowa State University
in Ames, we heard, someone dumped a vial of pig's blood as a
symbolic gesture befitting farm country.
</P>
<P>
   Ours were puny events, though, compared to the clash between tin
soldiers and anti-war protesters wielding daisies at Kent State. In
the blink of an eye, like thunder suddenly reverberating on a sunny
day, the flower children were met with 13 seconds of gunfire aimed
at their free assembly. Who ordered the peaceful protest to turn
violent and who signaled the first shot to be fired has remained a
mystery. One minute there was singing, and the next minute bodies
were falling.
</P>
<P>
   Four children fell dead on the ground, nine were wounded, and
one teenager became the most famous runaway in America when a
photographer caught her look of horror as she knelt over the body
of one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa City, I was one of the non-activists who saw the horror
only as it was reflected in the faces of the truly committed. I was
a fledgling journalist and Republican sorority girl looking on
anti-war events with no more than idle curiosity. Hippies. I would
pass the weekly lunchtime vigils on my way to freshman English and
barely take notice of students in khaki jackets and blue jeans who
ate sprout sandwiches on Roman Meal bread and mulled the latest
body counts in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they hoped, perching weekly on the cold metal railing
that surrounded the Pentacrest would convince archenemy Richard
Nixon to pull out of Saigon. Did Nixon keep abreast of events in
Iowa City? Twenty-year-olds wearing peace signs believed that he
did.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Kent State shootings, collateral damage two continents
away had little impact on America's silent majority. It had little
impact on our student body until the president of our university,
hoping to avoid a similar tragedy along the banks of the Iowa
River, announced the spring semester would end prematurely and all
students would be asked to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   That left Iowa City in the hands of summer school students and
our own personal pack of outside agitators who milled around
college campuses in those days looking for a cause. Their cause was
most often Richard Nixon's aggression in southeast Asia, a policy
that did not sit well among college students, especially those at
risk for drawing low draft numbers and being sent to the boot camps
of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   When our college president announced the closing of campus, I
telephoned my brother, a senior at Iowa, sobbing that I didn't want
to leave school. I loved college. I had heard the drumming at Kent
State, but Iowa City marched to a different beat. I was pleading.
Let's not over-react. Let cooler heads prevail. Let the little
sorority girl stay. Free me. Up with me. Ban the bomb, but let me
stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   My big brother was only a little sympathetic to my despair, more
sympathetic to the anti-war cause. The next fall he would be one of
those young men who drew low draft numbers from the Selective
Service lottery and months later received his conscription notice.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home to my parents' house in upstate New York in May
of 1970, I languished in front of the television set watching
Marcus Welby and the Beverly Hillbillies. I took a summer job in
the bed and bath department at JC Penney. When a high school
classmate home from Kent State told of the sober mood that had
fallen over her campus after the tragedy, I commiserated. Thanks to
those trigger-happy Guardsmen, I had had to leave school early. I
had my own pain to deal with. Wasn't I a victim, too?
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that way when I was 20.
</P>
<P>
   Those were heady summers. In the summer of 1969, I worked at JC
Penney while the original Woodstock festival made history at
Yasgur's farm in downstate New York and Neil Armstrong walked on
the moon way, way, way upstate. In the summer of 1973, I worked at
JC Penney while President Nixon squirmed through the Watergate
trials and fought to save his legacy. In the summer of 1974, I was
working at my first job in newspapers when Richard Nixon resigned
the presidency and left his legacy in the hands of historians. For
Nixon and the war in Vietnam, Kent State had marked the beginning
of the end.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1988, I had developed a perspective about the
events of 18 years before. If not a radical, I was at least now a
Democrat, an older but wiser journalist, a little jaded as this
profession sometimes makes its people. My brother had served his
stint stateside, unscathed, and was raising a family of three
daughters, with one more in his future. His politics and mine had
finally converged.
</P>
<P>
   In May that year, a friend and I went to Washington, D.C., and
visited the stunning Vietnam War Memorial. As Baby Boomers who knew
men who had served in the war, we were sobered by the sight of 96
panels of black granite inscribed with the names of 58,000
Americans killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight thousand dead Americans. Two million dead
Vietnamese. Four dead in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   As we stood there awed by the panorama of names, a group of
teenagers on a field trip came by, acting silly, giggling,
irreverent. We were irritated. This younger generation. Don't they
know their history?
</P>
<P>
   We tried to shame them with a glance, but they were too giddy to
consider life can end in an instant even for college students
speaking their minds. They had years to go before they would
discover war not only kills warriors but also the hearts of
presidents and children picking flower.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the truth, and it made me feel old.

 &HT;    At 12:24 p.m. on May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guardsmen ended four

13-second burst of rifle fire that left four students dead and nine
other people wounded.

<P>
   On the evening of May 4, 1970, as other Kent State University
students were hurriedly packing their belongings and heading for
home, Lou Cusella was alone in the basement of the a morgue,
waiting to identify the body of his friend and roommate William
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the students killed on the campus that day by Ohio
National Guardsmen _ Sandra Scheuer, Allison Krause and Jeffrey
Miller _ had already been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the fourth victim lay on a gurney in the room next
door to where Cusella was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked a few questions by the people at the morgue, then
they told me to stand up,'' he said. ``They slowly opened the door
to the next room and I saw a white light gleaming down from the
ceiling onto the body. There was no question in my mind. It was
Bill Schroeder.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusella, now a communications professor at the University of
Dayton, was a third-year communications major at KSU in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer student from Lorain Community College, he had grown
up within a block of Schroeder in Lorain, which is about 20 miles
west of Cleveland. He and Schroeder, 19, lived with four other
students in a house at 603 Franklin Ave., a two-block walk from the
KSU campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cusella believes the tone of the violent four days that ended
with the shooting of the four students was set Friday night in
downtown Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first really warm weekend of the spring quarter,
and the bars along Water Street were packed with people,'' he said.
``Most appeared to be students, but I also saw some motorcycle-gang
types in the crowd. Early on, the mood was cheerful, but as the
evening wore on, it changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The partiers eventually poured into Water Street, making it
difficult for motorists to pass. Then a large metal trash can was
placed in the middle of the street and set afire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew the Kent police would be coming, and when they
did they were wearing riot gear and carrying nightsticks,'' Cusella
said. ``As the police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, some store
windows were broken. That's when it became an us-vs.-them
situation, and that set the stage for what was to come.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, after Kent officials requested that the National
Guard be sent to the city, the university's ROTC building was
torched by students. When firefighters arrived, their hose lines
were cut and they were pelted with rocks. On Sunday, hundreds of
students were driven off with tear gas after they gathered on the
university Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Cusella observed many of the violent acts of the weekend. ``If
you were involved in any way with campus life, you couldn't help
but run into something that had to do with the anti-war
demonstrations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When National Guardsmen opened fire on students at 12:24 p.m.
Monday, Cusella was standing at the back of Taylor Hall, which
housed the school's journalism and architecture school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was among those running from the bullets'' he said. ``It was
chaos. Students were screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting stopped, Cusella retraced his steps to the
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I walked, I heard sirens,'' he said. ``Crossing the parking
lot near Prentice Hall, I saw Jeffrey Miller's brain matter and
blood splattered on the pavement. ``
</P>
<P>
   Cusella returned to the house where he lived. He spent the next
several hours trying to locate his roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One by one they turned up _ everybody but Bill Schroeder,'' he
says. ``Nobody knew where Bill was. ``
</P>
<P>
   Cusella turned on the television and watched as a Cleveland
station reported the shootings. ``The station had the names of
Scheuer, Krause and Miller, but the fourth victim was identified as
'James Schneider.' The report said he was a non-student from New
York. That chilled me because Schneider sounds a lot Schroeder.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Cusella got a telephone call from a friend who was in his
dorm room.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's Bill?'' the friend wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, how's Bill?'' Cusella asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been shot,'' the caller replied. ``I helped lift him into
the ambulance. He was shot in the upper body, but he spoke to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusella phoned Robinson Memorial Hospital in Ravenna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them if they had a shooting victim there that hadn't
been identified, and the man I was talking to said, `Yeah. Do you
think you know who he is?' I told him, `I think I might.' The man
took my name and telephone number and told me he'd call me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he received a call from an Ohio senator who said he'd heard
Cusella might be able to identify one of the slain students. He
asked him if he'd be willing to go to the morgue. Cusella said he
would. About the same time KSU officials shut down the campus and
sent the students home, a Portage County Sheriff's cruiser carrying
two deputies pulled up at his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took me to a large building in Ravenna,'' he said. ``We
went to the basement, they led me into a room and told me to sit
down. A few minutes later, two men came in. One was a soft-spoken,
Italian-looking man who reminded me of my uncles, who lived in
Buffalo. He asked me, `What does your roommate usually wear for
pants?' When I told him Bill almost always wore denim jeans, he
looked relieved and said, `This man was wearing orange corduroy
bell bottoms.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when my heart sank. Bill's favorite pants were a pair
of orange corduroy bell bottoms. He called them his `Brian Jones
pants.' Jones was one of the original Rolling Stones. Later, after
I'd identified Bill, I lost it. I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1975 Justice Department report, Schroeder was at
least 335 feet from the troops when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   On the 25th anniversary of the shootings, Cusella was invited to
the university to talk about Schroeder. ``I described Bill as a
blossoming Renaissance man,'' he says. ``He was an Eagle Scout. And
a high school honor student. He played baseball and ran track. He
had a great sense of humor, and he loved serious talk about serious
issues. For a long time, he'd planned to be a geologist, but then
he changed his major to psychology. Oddly, Bill was at Kent State
on an ROTC scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   After that 1995 visit to Kent State, Cusella vowed he would
never go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I'd seen all of Kent that I wanted to see ... and
that the only way I'd go back is if someone told me May 4, 1970,
never really happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cusella has changed his mind. On Thursday afternoon he'll
return to the campus to talk again about Schroeder at the 30th May
4 Commemoration sponsored by the student-run May 4 Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to go because nobody else offered to talk about
Bill,'' he said. ``My speech will be short, then I'll come home.
I'm not going back to Kent to reconnect with my past, or anything
like that. I'm doing it for Bill's mother.'' And probably, too, for
Bill.

 &HT;    Vet got news of Kent State from Hanoi Hannah's show
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was May 4, 1970 and Jim ``Doc'' Perry was celebrating his
18th birthday with 11 other members of the 5th Infantry in a damp,
dimly lighted underground bunker in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the DMZ _ the area between North and South Vietnam
_ and the day before we were hit pretty hard by Charlie, so we were
spending the evening drinking Budweiser and listening to rock music
on a North Vietnamese propaganda radio station,'' Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   ``A song ended, then the host of the show _ we called her 'Hanoi
Hannah' _ broke in and said something like, 'Now the Americans are
murdering college students who don't want to go to war.' That's how
I found out about the shootings at Kent State University.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment Perry and the other men in the bunker just stared
at the radio. Then the jokes began.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the guys said, 'Can you believe it? All those National
Guardsmen and they could kill only four college students?,''' Perry
recalls. ``We all laughed. I know it sounds cruel, but you have to
remember what was happening then. There we were, ready to lay down
our lives for our country, and college kids all over America were
pretending to preach peace by burning buildings and cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 47 and vice president of the 137-member Chapter 97 of the
Miami Valley Vietnam Veterans of America, was 17 when he enlisted
in May 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us were young. Real young.'' the former combat medic
says. ``At first, we were awed by the whole war thing. Then we
settled in.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry enlisted at 17 because serving in the military is a family
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six generations of Perrys served their country, starting with
my great-great-grandfather,'' he explains. 'We were in the Civil
War, the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War
and Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately following the killings at Kent State,
Perry and other members of the 5th Infantry got most of their
information about the shootings from the enemy radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened to Hanoi Hannah instead of Armed Forces Radio
because she played better music,'' Perry says. ``Besides, our own
people weren't telling us anything about the war. We were under
strict orders to destroy all of our mail after we read it. And we
weren't allowed to carry anything that would identify us because
the enemy had people in the states and they could make trouble for
our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those precautions, letters written by American fighting
men and women fell into enemy hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Hanoi Hannah used them against us every chance she got,''
Perry says. ``She'd deliver 'Dear John Letters' to the troops.
She'd get ahold of a letter with some guy's name on it and she'd
come on the air and say 'Dear so-and-so, your mother has been
killed in a car accident in Cleveland.' Propaganda radio was hard
to deal with because it got into your head. And you can't fight a
war with stuff like that in your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry wrote many letters to his mother in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I didn't realize it at the time, my mail was being
censored,'' he says. ``If I wrote that two guys were killed
yesterday, somebody would blot it out with with a felt pen. ``
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``One time I ran out of writing paper, so I wrote a
letter to my mother on a cardboard carton that had held spaghetti
and meat balls. When Mom sent me her next letter, she included five
packs of stationery.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who had two tours of duty in Vietnam, was wounded twice.
On Christmas Eve 1970 he was injured by a rocket-propelled grenade
while treating two wounded soldiers. In September 1971 he was hit
twice by enemy bullets during a helicopter rescue mission to the Ho
Chi Minh Trail in Laos. The chopper then crashed, killing the pilot
and crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat medics spent a lot of time retrieving bodies,'' he
says. ``We didn't handle the small stuff. We saw major trauma.
There was lots of bleeding. Lots of dying. The Viet Cong had all
sorts of ways to kill you. If the mortar fire didn't get you, there
were booby traps and pointed punji sticks smeared with human
excrement. If you took one of those in the leg, it had to be
treated in a matter of hours, or you'd lose the leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry believes time has mellowed the feelings of some of the
Miami Valley's more than 31,000 Vietnam War veterans toward the
1970s war protestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, we thought anything anti-war was anti-us,'' he
says. ``But we're older now, and more educated. I'm a former altar
boy. My parents raised me to be forgiving. I can't bring those four
dead students back any more than I can recapture the innocence I
had when I celebrated my 18th birthday in that bunker on May 4,
1970. But life goes on. I really don't think those National
Guardsmen wanted to kill those kids at Kent State.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry pauses, then adds: ``One thing hasn't changed for me
though. I still hate Jane Fonda. I won't even watch her movies on
TV.''

 &HT;    Wright State University medical residents give aid
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lake below their helicopter was littered with treetops
pointing straight up.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a lake. The emergency medicine residents from
Wright State University knew that. The repeated flooding in
Mozambique was the reason they went to this country in southeastern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   They interrupted their lives for nearly three weeks last month
to address the desperate need for doctors, food and medical
supplies in a country that is one of the world's poorest and least
healthy in the best of times. The floods that left water marks nine
feet high on one town's schoolhouse brought infection, starvation
and homelessness cascading into an already bleak landscape where
about 30 percent of the people are infected with HIV, only seven of
every eight babies survive their first birthdays and the per-capita
telephone rate would scatter about 3,000 of them through
Montgomery, Greene, Miami and Clark counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware of any other residency program in the country
that has ever done anything like this,'' said Dr. Roger Pacholka,
who connected the medical residents with funding from Humedica, a
Christian disaster-relief agency in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters were receding by the time residents arrived in
late March, but Drs. John Henner, Frank Lee and Brian Loveridge
still saw furniture on the rooftops of city houses and roofs on the
ground alongside rural huts, their waterlogged reeds now limp as
spaghetti. They treated patients who had walked for two days and
visited others almost too weak to blink while their government
officials sold donated food and supplies for cash.
</P>
<P>
   They saw the bloated bellies of malnutrition that have become
icons for relief agencies. They saw some of the world's deadliest
strains of malaria, carried by mosquitos that were bred by the
acres of impromptu ponds. They saw people with oozing skin
infections who were too weak to brush the flies away from their
pus. They saw parasitic worms big enough to turn patients' hips and
stomachs into bas-relief maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw about 60 to 150 people each day,'' Henner said last
week, back at the Wright State School of Medicine's emergency
medicine headquarters on the grounds of Kettering Medical Center.
On some days when they didn't split up, Loveridge said they would
see 300 people in line when they arrived, treat all of them and
more, and see another 300 people waiting when they left. But they
also knew the floods had chased more than 360,000 from their homes
and drowned thousands more, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treated very few people in the big picture,'' Henner said,
``but at least for those few people, I think we made a huge impact
on their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveridge had spent two years in Brazil on a Mormon mission. ``I
thought I knew what poverty was,'' he said. ``Mozambique just
doesn't compare to that. The floods made things worse, but a lot of
their problems were just part of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacholka, a Wright State emergency medicine alum now working at
Miami Valley Hospital, has been going to Mozambique and nearby
Swaziland for several years. He's there now with his wife, Katy, a
nurse at Greene Memorial Hospital. They established the In His Name
mission a year ago and were planning to expand their work to
Central America when Pacholka heard from one of his Mozambique
friends last month.
</P>
<P>
   The man had barely escaped the flood that overran his home in
Xai Xai (pronounced ``shy shy''). Pacholka called Dr. Glenn
Hamilton, the emergency residency department's chairman, and Dr.
Scott Doak, its director, asking for help. Thirty hours later about
half of the program's 36 residents had volunteered. Eight residents
and three faculty members were chosen for three separate trips.
</P>
<P>
   Other residency programs aren't flexible enough to undertake
such a journey in place of the training that had been planned,
Pacholka said, ``but Glenn and Scott know these experiences will be
very beneficial.'' What is emergency medicine, after all, but
quickly treating an unpredictable variety of severe medical
problems? Mozambique was just the extreme version.
</P>
<P>
   ``They saw a lot of the same stuff we see here, but at such an
advanced state that we never see it here,'' Doak said, looking at a
picture of a boy whose scabies seemed to blister his entire back.
They saw a few examples of the oozing, deaf ears that result from
letting repeated ear infections go untreated. They saw countless
people who had been blinded by trachoma, a common eye infection
easily treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of our trip, we started looking into every
kid's eyes that we saw, just to make sure they didn't have
trachoma,'' Lee said. The residents won't see that in the United
States because a preventive ointment is applied to the eyes of
every newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably costs a penny,'' Doak said.
</P>
<P>
   Exploding crocodiles, makeshift clinics
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, malaria was most prevalent near the original river
banks, while fungal and other skin infections were more common out
in the country. A common fungus was transmitted from cows to humans
by flies. ``It would get into their hands and fingers and swell up
with pus,'' Henner said. ``Some people looked like they had Mickey
Mouse hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The natives, from Bantu tribes, had their own traditional
medicine for these infections. ``Then the infections got really
bad,'' Henner said, because their treatment consisted of packing
the wounds in a compound of dried leaves and cow feces.
</P>
<P>
   Microbes weren't the only danger spread by the flooding.
Mozambique endured 18 years of civil war until 1992. International
agencies had marked hundreds of thousands of land mines since then.
The floods not only washed away the markers, they also dislodged
many of the mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a crocodile farm with about 7,000 to 10,000
crocodiles, and they got loose when the farm was flooded,'' Henner
said. ``We were told one of them swallowed a land mine and blew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the crocodiles went downstream until they reached
Xai Xai on the Indian Ocean. Tasting salt, they fled the water and
wound up roaming the town, along with the snakes who also disliked
saltwater. ``I treated one woman with vision problems,'' Loveridge
said. ``A cobra had spit into her eyes from the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Xai Xai sits on the mouth of the Limpopo River, which originates
in nearby South Africa. At midnight on the morning of March 17,
nearly six weeks after the region's flooding began, Henner said
South Africa's government decided to open its flood gates in order
to keep its levees from breaking. The wave it unleashed was nearly
10 feet high, crashing through Mozambique as its residents slept.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright State doctors stayed upstream from Xai Xai in
Chibuto, a city of 150,000 before the flooding submerged half of
it. With the phone lines, electricity and running water knocked
out, they filled their generator with black market gasoline for
$5.50 a gallon and took cold showers from rainwater they had
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, they boarded a helicopter from Helimission, one
of many relief agencies in Mozambique, and flew to remote settings
with medical supplies and the locals they had quickly trained as
assistants. They set up in churches or below tree branches, used
piles of flour sacks for operating tables and examined lines of
people that never ended.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hospital in Chibuto, but the helicopter had only so
much room and the doctors saw 50 or 60 people a day who would have
been admitted without question back home. ``You'd see somebody at
10 in the morning and you'd have to say, `If you're still the
sickest person I've seen at the end of the day, I'll take you
back,''' Henner said.
</P>
<P>
   `You have to rely on your own judgment'
</P>
<P>
   No one was coordinating the food and medical help, no one
telling the doctors where they were needed next. ``It was word of
mouth, random acts of kindness,'' Henner said. ``When people first
got there, they tried coordinating with the government, but that
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Only by accident did the residents learn that four tons of food
and medical supplies meant for Chibuto had disappeared. ``There's a
huge problem with government corruption,'' said Loveridge, who
spoke the country's official Portuguese but used interpreters for
the tribal language. ``Nobody knew the hospital was in such dire
straits.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents found out because a woman's propane stove had
exploded, burning her breasts so badly she couldn't feed her
five-month-old baby. They took the mother and child to Chibuto's
hospital, which had 200 patients with 30 kids in its malnourishment
unit. The hospital also had food for only 15 people a day, and no
baby formula at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A doctor there had never seen formula,'' Loveridge said, ``but
so many mothers had quit producing milk from malnourishment. And
World Relief had a storage of formula 30 minutes away.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents might become better doctors for having understood
the rarely appreciated value of food and antibiotics. They probably
will be better doctors for having treated so many new diseases,
especially because all three are military doctors who could wind up
stationed in Third World countries. And they certainly will be
better for having worked mostly with their hands and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't order blood tests or X-rays on anybody there,''
Pacholka said. ``You have to rely strictly on your own judgment,
and that makes for a very good doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical dollars would have been spent more efficiently by
simply treating everyone for malaria, trachoma and the most common
parasites, Henner said, ``and then teaching good hygiene and giving
them clean water supplies.'' There's a limit to what modern
medicine can do when the same river serves as a latrine, a laundry
and a drinking fountain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the residents noticed the one oasis from infectious
cholera and dysentery was a refugee camp where an Austrian group
set up temporary water filtration. They've gone, though, and other
groups will follow them as Mozambique fades from the headlines.
Things will get worse, the Wright State group said, because the
floods also destroyed a year's worth of crops.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be watching for that news. Now they have a stake in the
people of Mozambique, as represented by the friendly, appreciative
and resolute folks they met. ``They had next to nothing, but they
kept on going,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   More than their medical skills, the doctors said the feeling of
uplifting each other was their reward for the vacations they gave
up, the health risks they took, the sacrifices their families made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last day, there was a guy in the hospital who just started
laughing,'' Loveridge said. ``He couldn't stop. He pointed down. He
said, `That's my house.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't see anything but water.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush: bigger say in retirement funds . . .
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush plans to push for a fundamental overhaul of
Social Security soon, reopening an issue that could be among the
most combustible and bitterly debated of the presidential campaign.
In the next month, his aides say, Bush intends to begin pressing
his case for the establishment of individual investment accounts
within Social Security, a change that would be the most
far-reaching in the program since it was established during the
Depression. Under the plan, workers would be allowed to invest a
portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in stocks and bonds,
taking advantage of the economy's prosperity and ensuring the
national retirement systems's long-term viability.
</P>
<P>
   . . . GORE: BUT IT COULD BE LIKE ROLLING DICE
</P>
<P>
   To Al Gore, creating individual investment accounts is
tantamount to abandoning Social Security's role as the provider of
a guaranteed benefit for the elderly. Gore's aides said they would
portray Bush's approach as too risky because it would leave their
retirement security exposed to the ups and downs of the stock
market. They expect that argument to play strongly if Wall Street
remains as volatile as it has been in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   MORE LIKE SOCIAL INSECURITY?
</P>
<P>
   The White House also dismissed George W. Bush's plan for
overhauling Social Security as too sketchy and set ``in a world
where budgets don't exist.'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said Bush needed to provide more details on his proposal
and ``stop talking about campaign promises in a vacuum, in a world
where budgets don't exist.'' Lockhart said the outline indicates
that Bush's program could push Social Security toward insolvency
rather than preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE CARD
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of hands-on diplomacy at the White House, Al
Gore believes he outshines George W. Bush in foreign policy
expertise and is taking aim at what he sees as a Bush
vulnerability: Gore charges that Bush's thinking on national
security is ``noticeably blank'' on issues such as terrorism,
narcotics trafficking, the global environment and international
family planning. Addressing the International Press Institute's
congress of foreign journalists in Boston, Gore cast Bush as a
puppet of ``right-wing'' ideologues such as Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) and dangerously fixated on the Cold War past.
</P>
<P>
   OK, SO HE'LL STUDY UP
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, seeking to shore up that area of perceived
weakness, is spending a lot of time learning about foreign policy
in depth, said Condoleezza Rice, Bush's main foreign policy adviser
says. Rice, who served on the National Security Council under
Bush's father, the former president, said in a Reuters interview
that the Texas governor was delving into the history behind the top
issues in U.S. foreign policy, including the Balkans, Russia and
the Middle East. ``We've been spending a lot of time since the
primaries talking in depth about some of the big issues,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   SO MUCH FOR THE SYMPATHY VOTE
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll out today showed Hillary Clinton and Rudy
Giuliani in a statistical dead heat, with no change for Giuliani
since last week's announcement that he has prostate cancer. The
latest telephone poll, conducted from Monday of last week through
Sunday by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute, had Clinton
leading 46 percent over Giuliani's 44 percent. That is
statistically unchanged from an early April Quinnipiac poll that
had Clinton up 46-43 percent. The poll has a 3 percentage point
margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI EXPECTED TO STAY IN RACE . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani's campaign manager expects his candidate to stay
in the New York Senate race because his prostate cancer has not
spread. ``It's not only my hope, but my expectation, that he will
run,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum. ``Hopefully he'll pick a course of
treatment that will give him a cure, a complete cure and then we'll
be able to move forth aggressively, with a winning campaign.'' John
McCain also thinks Giuliani will stay in the race against Hillary
Clinton. McCain's offered to campaign for Giuliani while the mayor
meets with doctors, but said he's sure Giuliani will be campaigning
himself soon. Giuliani played golf with his son Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND SEE ANOTHER COMPETITOR
</P>
<P>
   If Rudy Giuliani does stay in the New York Senate race while
undergoing cancer treatment, he could find the race a little more
crowded. A former congressman, Joseph DioGuardi, told the New York
Times he's going to try for the nominations of three parties:
Conservative, Right-to-Life and Independence. DioGuardi, 59, an
accountant, repeatedly assailed Giuliani as out of step with
conservative-minded Republicans. ``We have two social liberals in
the race,'' DioGuardi said. ``There's a clear need for a
conservative alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLIKE HIMSELF? THAT COULD BE MOST ANYONE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says he's looking for a vice president who's someone
unlike himself _ and hasn't ruled out tapping a Republican. ``It's
most unlikely, I don't want to mislead you,'' Gore said. ``But I
don't completely rule it out.'' Earlier, Gore had talked about
bipartisanship: ``My natural instincts are to reach out and create
bipartisan coalitions.'' But Gore also insisted on keeping silent
about who will be No. 2 out of deference to the candidates who will
be vetted by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is
heading up Gore's search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN
</P>
<P>
   John McCain said he'll endorse George W. Bush even if they don't
agree on campaign finance reform, as he expects, when they meet
next week. Overhauling federal campaign finance laws was the
signature issue of McCain's unsuccessful presidential campaign.
McCain said he and Bush agree on other areas in need of change,
including Social Security, the military, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   HEIGHTENED FOCUS ON AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   Africa, a continent long ignored by the developed world and long
troubled by famine, civil war and disease, would enjoy a new and
heightened focus by a Gore administration. Al Gore said so himself
in an interview with the Boston Globe. Africa ``has tremendous
potential. And there's too much suffering. And in partnership with
the European Union and others, I think we can help awaken this
renaissance in Africa with democracy and free markets.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS BE HANGED! L.A. COMES FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Leading his city in playing host for the Democratic National
Convention, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan may end up the one
Republican whose praises Democrats sing this year. ``The Democratic
convention is a huge plus for the city of Los Angeles, and that's
my first love,'' Riordan said. ``My first love is not the
Republican Party.'' Riordan already has called the Aug. 14-17
convention his top priority and even participated in a high-profile
Beverly Hills fund-raiser with President Clinton that drew director
Steven Spielberg and other Democratic Party stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT TILL THE NRA GETS HOLD OF THIS
</P>
<P>
   The Libertarian Party says it is ``baffled'' by a proposal to
have the city of Annapolis, Md., buy back toy guns. They don't know
whether to ``support the program or snicker at it,'' the group said
in a prepared statement. Last week, Annapolis Alderman Cynthia A.
Carter proposed that the city start a program to buy back water
pistols, cap guns and other toy weapons to curb ``violent
behavior''among children. The Washington Times reported that
Carter, a Democrat, argued that children ``can't distinguish
between a real gun or a play gun''and said she would eventually
like to make all toy guns illegal.

seized Elian from her home in Miami last weekend hang like a weight

is not America.'' Daniel begs to differ. ``I can vouch for the fact
that it happens in Texas,'' she said. ``When they took (Elian) out
of that house, I could see my grandson hollering for his mother.''

METHODISTS PREPARE FOR POTENTIALLY DIVISIVE CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARY McMULLEN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a family reunion that brings together kissing cousins and
in-laws that snap at the sight of each other, the United Methodist
General Conference promises to be potentially bitter. The recurrent
issue of homosexuality is threatening to leave delegates with
bruised feelings, even if it is unlikely they will make major
changes to church policies on gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-day conference gets under way Tuesday at the Convention
Center in Cleveland. It will draw 992 delegates from 66 regional
conferences across the United States and 52 in Europe, Africa and
the Philippines. About 2,500 visitors are also expected.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church is the third-largest religious body
in the United States with 8.4 million members, behind only the
Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention. The General
Conference, its policy-making assembly, meets every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Methodists have been a moderate and tolerant
bunch, emphasizing the generosity of God toward sinners and
welcoming all sorts into their churches. A historical insistence on
personal holiness has tended to fall by the wayside. And like
society generally, the church is struggling to find common ground
in the midst of increasing geographical, racial and philosophical
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates will take up legislation affecting moral questions
and pastoral duties, how local churches will be assessed to support
the denomination's administrative and mission work, and whether its
structure should be changed to reflect its global membership.
</P>
<P>
   They will participate in yet another act of public repentance by
a religious body, for mistreatment of blacks over the centuries.
And, for the first time they will be addressed by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the primate of the church from which they split 215
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's first five days will be devoted to committee
meetings, in which delegates will consider a staggering 2,000
petitions to modify the Book of Discipline, the church's policy
manual. The following week, the committees will submit proposed
legislation to delegates meeting in plenary sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Although they point to a number of issues they consider more
important, delegates regretfully concede that homosexuality
probably will dominate discussions and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure have spent a lot of time and money on it, and that
sickens me,'' said the Rev. Riley Short, pastor of First United
Methodist Church in Lakeland, Fla., a delegate in 1996 and a
reserve delegate this year.
</P>
<P>
   Controversies surrounding the issue have occurred at every
General Conference since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The church's official position is that the practice of
homosexuality is ``incompatible with Christian teaching'' and
sexually active gays and lesbians are prohibited from being
ordained as deacons or ministers. Church policy also states that
God's grace is available to gays and lesbians, that they are
equally deserving of the church's ministries and that their civil
rights should be protected. United Methodists have condemned
violence against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   This year, most of the attention is focused on a rule adopted in
1996 that prohibits ministers from performing ``holy union''
ceremonies for gays and lesbians. That rule was tested on four
occasions, and two ministers were charged with violating it. The
Rev. Jimmy Creech and the Rev. Gregory Dell were convicted in
church courts in separate cases. Creech was removed from the
ministry, and Dell was given a one-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But the case that caused the most strain occurred in Sacramento,
Calif., in January 1999, when 68 ministers participated in a
same-sex union service, as a deliberate act of disobedience. In
February, an investigative committee decided not to press charges
against the ministers, a decision supported by Bishop Melvin
Talbert of the California-Nevada Conference, who has been an
outspoken opponent of the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative congregations and advocacy groups within the church
were outraged, and while some threatened to split from the
denomination, others vowed to strengthen the prohibition and find
ways to ensure that disobedient clergy and bishops are held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Those who advocate the church's current position say it is a
matter of maintaining the authority of scriptural teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scripture is the norm in matters of faith and practice. In our
day and age, you see talk shows where people spill their
experiences, and that becomes so powerful it almost presents a
tyranny. So society has tended to lose its sense of principle. I'm
not willing to give up the teaching of scripture,'' said the Rev.
Dan Johnson, pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in
Gainesville, Fla., who will be a delegate for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of change say the policy contradicts the openness
that has been the hallmark of Methodist theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the Discipline creates outcasts, a
second-class citizenry. It says that gays and lesbians are less
than heterosexuals. So the basic theology that God loves all and
welcomes all doesn't fit,'' said Marilyn Alexander, program
coordinator for Reconciling Congregations, an advocacy group for
Methodist gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The General Conference will pause Thursday for a worship service
designated ``An Act of Repentance for Reconciliation.'' The service
will include representatives of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and the
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, three black denominations
that split from the Methodist church in the 18th and 19th centuries
over claims of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Charlene Kammerer of the Western North Carolina
Conference said the service, intended to confess past sins of
racism, will be the most important event of the General Conference.
``It's going to be very profound,'' she said. ``Until we have a
public step of confessing and naming our sins, we can't move
forward. And it has to come from the privileged, white part of the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Other items on the conference agenda include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A revision of the already-complex formula by which money is
assessed from local churches. Regional per-capita income, operating
costs and worship attendance would be factored in. Some pastors
favor the revision, but delegates from regions with high costs of
living, like California, opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   _ A proposal to spend $20 million on a national media campaign,
``Igniting Ministry,'' including television ads as well-produced as
those from the Mormon Church, which are much admired.
</P>
<P>
   _ A May 10 ecumenical worship service at which George Carey, the
Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, will preach. The Methodist
Church began as a movement within the Anglican Church, led by a
priest, John Wesley. A conference in 1784 in Baltimore marked the
separation of Methodists from the Church of England.

   CHINA-HUMANRIGHTS _ BEIJING _ Almost a year after China
suspended official dialogue with the United States on human rights,
it has invited a private American businessman to Beijing to discuss
the status of political prisoners. Although John Kamm has visited
China dozens of times in the last few years for talks with the
Ministry of Justice, this is the first time China has formally
invited him to do so. Some say Beijing timed the visit next month
to influence Congress' vote on normalizing trade relations. (Chao,

   PUERTORICO-VIEQUES _ VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ With the dust still
flying from the Elian Gonzalez case, federal officials are
preparing for another controversial confrontation with protestors,
this time at the U.S. Navy bombing range on the island of Vieques,
near Puerto Rico. The long-simmering dispute over the range flared
a year ago when a wayward bomb killed a Puerto Rican security
guard, prompting protestors to occupy part of the range. That
prompted massive protests in San Juan and near unanimity among the
island's fractured political parties that the Navy must leave
Vieques for good. A deal brokered between the Clinton
Administration and P.R. Gov. Pedro Rossello calls for a phased
withdrawal and a referendum, but protestors have rejected the deal
and vow to stay until they are forcibly removed. (Williams, Cox

WHAT THE DAY-TRIPPERS WILL NEVER KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7) 
 By JAN BENZEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fox hunters were out, jodhpurs freshly cleaned, boots
polished, riding their plump mounts across the winter-brown fields
silvery with frost. I was on foot, rounding the last leg of the
loop I run whenever I visit this southeastern Pennsylvania
countryside I grew up in.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this horse-dotted landscape, equestrian events like
steeplechases and the hunt have a devoted, eccentric following.
People drive around staking out spots where they might catch a
glimpse of riders and hounds coursing over the hills. They'll spend
the morning sitting in a car and be gratified by a sight that might
last all of a minute and a half.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I approached the turnoff to my parents' house, I slowed,
leery of a parked pickup truck and a couple of grizzled guys
smoking cigarettes and stamping their feet in the cold. ``Can I
help you?'' I asked, drawing myself up and summoning up as much
property owner's authority as I could, on my parents' behalf.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fox huntin', missy,'' said the one in the heavy, faded
plaid shirt, making his claim to the land. ``You know anything
about fox huntin'?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't stop to explain my own claim, that I'd lived up the
road from the kennel where the hounds sometimes howled all night,
that I'd seen foals born and horses die, that I'd known some of the
riders since they were kids, that I'd ridden a yellow school bus to
this very spot countless times 35 or so years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I realized that he took me for one of the multiplying arrivistes
who now whiz around the country roads on fancy bicycles or in
high-tech running shoes and neon microfiber outfits. He resented
me.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I understood. Although I had moved away, choosing an urban life
over a rural one, I expected that that rural life would be there
when I needed it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But nearby cities have thrived and spread. Farmers whose
children, like me, have made lives elsewhere are selling their one
asset _ their land _ when they can no longer keep it up
themselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First the area became a playground. One orchard opened a general
store, offered pick-your-own pumpkins and strawberries and
sheep-petting photo ops. Put a quarter in a machine, get a handful
of nuggets and the sheep will lick your fingers. A freight-bearing
train reinvented itself as scenic railroad, taking its passengers
through leafy green glens in summer and blazing maple and oak in
fall. It ran along part of the narrow, winding Brandywine River,
upon which parties of canoeists float when the water is high
enough. A local triathlon _ of partners who walk, bike and canoe _
that started years ago as a quirky low-key fall event snowballed
into a competition for which people train, seriously scouting the
terrain ahead of the date, puffing up hills and quaking when farm
watchdogs bark. An old, rickety cow barn, freshly painted, is the
site of a summer folk festival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My father used to drive our family to Lancaster, Pa., for the
day, when he needed to shop for a piece of tack or get a saddle
repaired. We'd marvel at the ways of the Amish, and at the same
time be glad we were there with a purpose, not just to gawk. The
fishbowl aspect of their lives even then was in part calculated,
but despite the boon of tourism, I thought of the intrusion they
must feel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The place where I've got the deepest roots is now similarly
becoming a destination. Richly historic, it's drawing ever more
people these days. Tasteful but prominent brown signs have been put
up to point the way to the major attractions like Winterthur,
Longwood Gardens, the Brandywine Battlefield.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what draws the Sunday drivers and other visitors to the
landscape that Andrew Wyeth made so familiar is in danger of
vanishing. Those who used to come for a day in the country now want
a piece of it for themselves. Outsized houses are sprouting like
weeds on any available hilltop, loudly architectural. The
centuries-old houses and gorgeously worn stone and red-painted
wooden barns seem embarrassed by their new, unsightly neighbors.
The open fields are shrinking.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I comfort myself sometimes by thinking of the secrets the
newcomers and tourists won't ever know about this land: Where the
May apples and jack-in-the-pulpits grow in the many microclimates
of the woods. How to spot the fox that doesn't get caught,
streaking up the hillside after the horses and hounds have
thundered past. Summer afternoons spent poking along with friends
by those railroad tracks or hunting for bullfrogs in the creeks.
Life here can also be rugged; more than once tornadoes have ripped
the tin roofs from sheds, sent huge trees crashing through houses.
Deer menace the roads, ravage the gardens. Lyme disease is a
plague. A rainstorm can ruin a field of cut hay.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once my husband and I played tourist for a weekend. We went out
to dinner and to a museum and tried out one of the proliferating
bed-and-breakfasts. A refugee from New York had bought and
painstakingly restored an old stone farmhouse, furnishing it with
locally scavenged antiques. He also ran a furniture store across
the road, and the pieces in the rooms were for sale, too: discreet
price tags dangled on the sides of the beds and dressers. When we
went down into the big, open living area for breakfast, I realized
why I'd been feeling so strange: the house smelled just like one
I'd spent dozens of nights in, on sleepovers at my childhood friend
Jennifer's farm: damp, a bit like dogs, comfortingly warm and old.
People _ we _ were paying for the experience of sleeping for a
night in my own past.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer I went to a little town on Lake Michigan, where 15
of us settled in for a week's celebration of my parents-in-law's 50
years of marriage. I set out one day on a bicycle, and soon found
myself in rolling farmland, where the hills were gentle and fields
of crops ripening in the July sun stretched on both sides of the
road.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the distance I saw an orchard. It looked incongruously
space-age, with each young tree festooned in strips of silver Mylar
glittering in the breeze. Three men were working just off the main
road, and, ready to give my legs a rest, I stopped to ask them
about the silvery stuff. A man about my age told me it was to ward
off the deer. ``We've tried everything,'' he said. ``This seems to
scare them off a little, especially if there's a moon out.'' He
proudly reeled off the kinds of apples they were planting, more
varieties than I had ever heard of.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the other two men, looking gentlemanly with snow-white
hair and brand-new denim overalls, was his father. The land had
been in the family for generations. Deer were a minor threat in the
grand scheme of the farm. ``We deal with all kinds of varmints,''
they told me. ``Groundhogs, bugs _ if it's not one it's another. Or
the weather can damage a whole year's crop.'' The younger man, in a
mood to talk, was hoping he'd be able to pass it on to his own
three sons, but was struggling to be able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of migrant pickers, he said, were dwindling, as the
workers now more often chose jobs in fast-food restaurants than in
the fields. Selling produce wholesale yielded little income. So he
was planting pick-your-own crops, and his wife was selling pies at
a stand down the road in an effort to hold out against what he
called ``going into the real estate business,'' cashing in on the
land and abandoning his family's tradition. ``My sons might sell
it, but I want to give them that choice,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want to keep them from their work, so I wheeled the
bike back onto the hardtop and got ready to pedal away. ``You take
care on that bike,'' said the older man, with a wave and a smile.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would have stopped for a pie _ I love pie _ but I didn't think
I could manage it on my bike. Months later, I still worry about
that farm, and how, besides the vagaries of weather and varmints,
its owners will now have to factor in the whims of day-trippers
like me.

&HT;     STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS TERRORIST ATTACKS RISE BUT CLAIM FEWER
VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of terrorist attacks increased by more
than 40 percent from 1998 to 1999 but deaths from acts of terror
fell significantly, the State Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in releasing the
report that there were ``terrorists caught, plots thwarted and
lives saved'' in 1999. Still, she said, ``we cannot relax our
global full-court press on against terror.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, 233 people were killed in terrorist
attacks last year, down from 741 in 1998, while the number of
attacks worldwide rose from 274 in 1998 to 392 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Five U.S. citizens were killed and six wounded in international
attacks last year. Three were kidnapped Feb. 25 and killed by a
terrorist group in Colombia while working with an Indian tribe in
the northeast of the country. A Rwandan group kidnapped and
murdered two Americans on March 1 in the central African nation of
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say a potentially large loss of American lives was
averted in December with the arrest of an Algerian man, Ahmed
Ressam, while he was crossing the border from Canada into Port
Angeles, Wash. The State Department report said Ressam's vehicle
contained explosives and detonating devices that were intended for
use in bombing millennium celebrations in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Albright reported that terrorists are receiving more funding
from private sources, and less from foreign governments, than they
did a few years ago. However, the State Department has maintained
since 1993 that the governments of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North
Korea, Sudan and Syria provide a ``safe haven'' for terrorists or
``plan and sponsor'' terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling Taliban militia of Afghanistan is believed
to harbor terrorists as well, the nation was not placed on the list
of state sponsors because the United States does not recognize the
Taliban as a ruling government.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheehan, the State Department's coordinator for
counterterrorism, said ``we had a good year in 1999.'' For
instance, he said that ``in Egypt for the first time in many years
there were no terrorism-related deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   But the threat of terrorism ``remains very real,'' he said.
``There are no guarantees in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the State Department identified Pakistan as
part of the growing South Asian terrorism center. The report cites
Pakistan as ``one of only three countries that maintains formal
diplomatic relations with ... Afghanistan's Taliban.'' It also
alleges the Pakistani government aided rebels in Kashmir, a
disputed region that both India and Pakistan claim.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheehan said Pakistan is considered a friendly state and was
therefore not placed on the list of governments that sponsor
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The report says South Asia became the ``locus of terrorism
directed against the United States'' in 1999 in a shift from past
conglomerations of foes in the Middle East. Afghanistan and
Pakistan were the only two South Asian nations identified by the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted that protection of U.S. and international
interests does not come without money.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is ``gravely concerned'' by congressional proposals
to cut more than $2 billion from President Clinton's international
affairs funding request. She urged Congress to approve the
president's full request of $22.8 billion.

&HT;     CAN POLICE STOP PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THEIR HOMES? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide
whether police can stop people from going into their own homes
alone while the officers attempt to get a warrant to search the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it would hear an Illinois case in which police in
the town of Sullivan prevented a man suspected of possessing drugs
from entering his trailer alone. The police said they were
concerned that he would destroy any evidence inside.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state trial court and the 7th District Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago ruled that the police had violated the
constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and seizures by
temporarily keeping him outside at the request of an officer while
the police sought a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1997, when John Love, assistant police chief
in Sullivan, accompanied Tera McArthur to a trailer owned by her
husband, Charles. Tera wanted to move out but was afraid her
husband might become violent. She asked the police to be present to
keep her husband from trying to stop her from moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Love waited by the door until Tera had removed all of her
belongings. When she was finished and the two were outside, she
told Love that her husband had a bag of marijuana under the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Love knocked on the door and McArthur came outside. When asked
about the marijuana, McArthur denied having any drugs inside.
Suspicious, Love sent another officer to seek a search warrant for
the trailer and refused to allow the defendant back into his home
alone.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour wait, Love allowed McArthur to go inside
twice to get cigarettes and to make a telephone call _ but always
in the company of an officer.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the warrant, the police searched the trailer and
found marijuana and drug paraphernalia. McArthur was charged with
possessing less than 2.5 grams of marijuana and possessing drug
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   But at his trial, McArthur asked the judge to suppress the
evidence. Although admitting that he would have destroyed the
marijuana if allowed inside alone, McArthur said keeping him
outside his home was a violation of the Fourth Amendment's
protection against unreasonable search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   The judge agreed and dismissed the case. Two years later, the
appeals court affirmed that decision, saying what the police did
amounted to an ``eviction of the defendant from his residence.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court noted that other courts have let police keep
someone outside when the person was under arrest, subject to arrest
on arrival, or when the person consented to stay outside.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief to the high court, Deanne F. Jones, a Chicago
attorney representing McArthur, said that the police had no ``hard
evidence'' that the client had done anything wrong. ``Police should
not be able to stop you from re-entering your own home without any
evidence that you've committed a crime,'' Jones wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors argued in their filing to the court that the
police needed to prevent McArthur from destroying evidence, and
that the appeals court ruling would make it nearly impossible for
police to ``secure evidence'' when the defendant was still at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was probable cause to believe he had this contraband in
his house,'' said Colleen Griffin, assistant Illinois attorney
general. Love had ``no choice'' but to seize the house while he
waited to secure the warrant, she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A seizure is not necessarily unconstitutional for the period
of time necessary to secure the warrant,'' Griffin wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will hear arguments in the case this fall, and a
decision is expected next year.

MAY DAY RALLY IN ROME HEARS A PAPAL MASS AND A ROCK CONCERT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  ROME _ Preempting the trade unions' traditional hold on May 1,
Pope John Paul II presided over a workers' rally Monday that
combined a solemn Mass with a raucous rock concert dedicated to
third world debt relief.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All must work so that the economic system in which we live
does not upset the fundamental order of the priority of work over
capital,'' the pope said in his homily. ``Globalization is a
reality present today in every area of human life, but it is a
reality that must be managed wisely. Solidarity too must be
globalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jubilee of the Workers, a Holy Year event that throughout
the day drew hundreds of thousands of people to Tor Vergata, a
field in suburban Rome, was unusual in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, union leaders and workers' delegations
from more than 40 countries attended the event, which also drew
pilgrims eager to attend a Mass celebrated by the pope. By late
afternoon close to half a million young people, with some tattoos
and body piercing providing a sharp contrast to nuns carrying
rosaries, packed the area to hear Lou Reed, Alanis Morissette and
the Eurythmics.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who began his papacy by backing the Polish labor
union, Solidarity, in its struggle against the Communist
authorities, has long made workers' rights a major theme of his
social message. And the Vatican's campaign to coax industrialized
nations to forgive or reduce the foreign debts of the world's
poorest nations drew pop stars eager to be associated with a cause
that targets the injustices of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   But the day, dedicated to international labor, also was one of
precedents that said less about the Vatican or pop music than about
Italy, which still has one of the most inflexible sets of rules
protecting labor in Europe. For the first time since May Day
celebrations began, city buses ran in Rome on Monday and shops in
the city center were given the option of opening _ and some did.
State museums all over Italy were open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, Italians will vote in a referendum, sponsored by the
center-left government, that among other things would make it
easier for companies with more than 15 employees to lay off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   To allow the Vatican to hold its event _ broadcast live on
Italian television and on Eurovision, a Europe-wide television
hookup _ Italy's three major labor federations agreed to suspend
their annual labor day rally and youth concert. Union leaders said,
though, that they considered it a onetime-only break with their
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always shared the social concerns of the church, and I
don't see why today we shouldn't participate in this event,'' said
Pietro Larizza, secretary-general of the Union of Italian Laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But some other unions ignored the decision, leading a wildcat
May Day parade of many thousands of people through central Rome,
with red flags, hammer-and-sickle insignias and Marxist and gay
pride slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go to Tor Vergana and kneel with bankers and
industrialists,'' said Luciano Muhlbauer, 34, a representative of
Cobas, a leftist union, as he marched a few yards ahead of a
demonstrator who was dressed as the pope in a glittering gold
miter. ``Especially when we are threatened by a referendum that
will bring us to the same situation as the United States, where
everyone works but they are poor.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul shared a concert stage with Bob Dylan in Bologna in
1997, recently gave a papal audience to Bon Jovi, and has produced
his own CD, a medley of his rendition of hymns. He has rarely shied
away from popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   He did avert his eyes, however, while the Israeli pop singer Noa
sang the theme song from the Holocaust movie ``Life is Beautiful''
in a low-cut white top with a bare midriff. (She covered herself
with a wispy chiffon scarf to shake the pope's hand.) He also shook
hands with a few selected rock performers, including Morissette but
not Reed, a one-time gender-bending performer whose repertoire
includes the song ``Heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope left the stage before the rock concert began at 5 p.m.
It ended six hours later with songs from ``Jesus Christ Superstar''
as the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials had been asked all week about the incongruity
of having Reed take part in a solemn papal event. ``Rock music,
when it is performed by great artists, is stupendous,'' said Bishop
Fernando Charrier, who organized the event. ``There is no
diabolical rock; if anything there are diabolical people.''
</P>
<P>
   Concert organizers said that the Vatican did not seek to censure
the artists or their material and that they had used their own
judgment in recruiting stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We avoided inviting performers who might try exploit the media
attention, brandishing crucifixes, or something,'' said Ricardo
Corato, president of Network, a rock promotion company that
organized the concert. ``I didn't invite Madonna, not because I
don't respect her but because it would have been inappropriate.
Madonna needs to exploit media attention to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, whose 80th birthday will be on May 18, looked to be in
good form. He was alert and smiled often throughout the event.
``Happy May First holiday to all the workers in the world,'' he
said shortly before he left the stage.

 &HT;    Study into causes of ADD promising, expert says
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John Ratey, a national expert in attention deficit
disorders, will be the keynote speaker at the National Conference
on Attention Deficit Disorders being held this weekend in Atlanta.
The conference, which is open to the public, will feature
discussions that can help patients, parents and physicians
recognize, treat and overcome the disorders. Ratey, a Harvard
Medical School associate professor of psychiatry, talked to medical
writer Diane Lore about new research into the disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What exactly are scientists seeing in the brain chemistry of
ADD patients vs. that of the general population?
</P>
<P>
   A:We're seeing that they actually have genes that are different
from the norm, and many of those (genes) are associated with a
person's dopamine system. (Dopamine, a chemical messenger, is
similar to adrenaline. It affects brain processes that control
movement, emotional response, and ability to experience pleasure
and pain.) We are finding that dopamine transporters _ these
enzymes that put dopamine into the nerve cells _ are too active.
It's like you're trying to bail out water that's flooding a boat
and the transporter keeps pumping it back in. That process messes
up a lot of the brain's operations, especially the parts that help
people remember, learn or concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How will this information about a biological basis for ADD
change treatments?
</P>
<P>
   A:Well, as we get more sophisticated, I believe we'll be able to
develop better drugs that not only correct the dopamine levels, but
correct the genes themselves. I believe that's where we're headed.
I also believe we will be able to create better environments for
people suffering with ADD _ know, for example, exactly what
exercises and what kind of structures these patients work best in.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So, even if scientists prove that ADD is a biologically based
disorder, there will be a need to develop strategies beyond handing
out a pill?
</P>
<P>
   A:Definitely. Just like you need to change the environment of a
blind person to make it more accessible, you need to create an
environment to help those with ADD. With children, that probably
means stricter, more structured home lives. And because dopamine is
affected by aerobic exercise, it means getting more physical
activity in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It almost sounds as if the two philosophical camps of ADD
could find common ground as science learns more about the
disorders. That those who complain that the disorder is linked to
parenting could find their strategies being used in conjunction
with new medications.
</P>
<P>
   A:Absolutely. We're not that far apart. We cannot separate
nature from nurture. Even though we're crazy about the genes and
the dopamine and how the brain works, we've always got to be
cognizant of how that relates to the patient's environment.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So, where will attitudes and research be in a decade?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think we will be much better at making correct diagnoses.
And we will have a much better sense of how to create exercises,
computer games and structures that these kids need. As far as
attitudes, I think we're in a period right now where we have a lot
of people making blanket statements about there being too much
Ritalin. We have a lot of people who say, `You're going to change
your kid's brain.' But people still don't realize that untreated
ADD in a youngster can be much worse than anything a drug could do.
A drug might be a brain changer, but trust me, so is feeling like
you're stupid. Feeling like you're no good. That ruins the brain
too, along with the life and the soul. And people just don't see
that equation.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is being held Friday through Sunday at the
Atlanta Airport Hilton and Towers; walk-up registration is $200.
For more information, call the National Attention Deficit Disorder
Association at 1-847-432-2332; to learn more about ADD, visit the
association's Web site at www.add.org.

 &HT;    Revitalized George eyes Elian et al.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John F. Kennedy Jr. died in a plane crash last year, the
outlook for the future of his magazine, George ($3.95), was gloomy.
Magazine and ad sales had stagnated, and its financial backers were
losing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's death may have saved the publication. Newsstand sales
increased by nearly 150 percent and copies of the October 1999
tribute issue became a collector's item that sells on online
auction sites for $50 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to new editor Frank Lalli to continue the momentum
and, from the looks of his first issue, he just might succeed. The
May issue has two covers. The newsstand cover shows Elian Gonzalez
and his mother and refers to a fascinating article by Ann Louise
Bardach about the other survivors on Elian's ocean journey.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers, meanwhile, will get a cover on ``Will the Biggest
Liar Win?,'' which examines the extent to which Al Gore and George
W. Bush have distorted the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Other articles include a good mix of celebrity political topics,
from an excerpt from Betty Friedan's autobiography revealing that
her husband beat her, to Heather Locklear's advice to Rudolph
Giuliani on how he can defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Politics and prose: Speaking of Giuliani, The New Yorker ($3)
looks at the effects of the New York mayor's recently diagnosed
prostate cancer on his Senate campaign. As David Letterman learned,
there's nothing like a life-threatening illness to win sympathy
from even your harshest critics. Also in this issue, editor David
Remnick talks with Philip Roth about his new novel, ``The Human
Stain,'' and his turbulent life.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another coat of paint: The third installment of John Grisham's
serialized novel, ``The Painted House,'' is worth the price of the
May/June issue of The Oxford American ($5.95), but several of the
other articles won't disappoint, either. Diane Roberts offers a
brief history of Florida's electric chair, ``Old Sparky,'' John T.
Edge writes about the beauty of biscuits, and John Jeremiah
Sullivan examines the life and teachings of Trappist monk Thomas
Merton.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Kinder and gentler: Forget everything you saw in Kirk Douglas
epic film, ``The Vikings.'' According to Time ($3.50), these Norse
warriors did more than rape, loot and pillage. They were also
craftsmen, explorers and proponents of democracy. A new exhibit at
the National Museum of Natural History in Washington offers
examples of the Vikings' skills as artists. By the way, Time notes,
only those who went on raiding parties were called Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The millennial generation: Vikings are not the only group to
get a bad rap; so have teenagers. In a new poll of the group
between 12 and 20, Newsweek ($3.50) finds that 28 percent of teens
feel angry, 78 percent say their parents don't spend enough time
with them, and 59 percent are worried about violence. The second of
a four-part ``New America'' series also includes an essay by
Hillary Rodham Clinton on the upcoming White House summit on teens.
Despite all their protest and swagger about being independent,
writes the first lady, ``teenagers need _ and want _ the everyday
love, involvement and discipline of their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: The second issue of Real Simple ($2.95) offers
more suggestions for reducing the stress in your life, such as tips
on how to create pantry dinners and advice on how to clean your

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The protestors huddle in their rough-hewn
cabins and under makeshift tarps, hiding from the scorching
Caribbean sun, watching and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   A few look up as a U.S. military helicopter beats through the
sky overhead. Others scan the vast azure blue horizon, peering out
to sea, where early Monday a sleek gray U.S. Navy ship steamed
past.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of rhetoric and protests, a showdown appears to be
finally drawing near over a bomb-scarred, bullet-strewn strip of
land on this tiny island.
</P>
<P>
   For 60 years, the U.S. Navy has used the eastern tip of Vieques
as a bombing range, but now many of the island's 9,000 residents _
and thousands more of their fellow Puerto Ricans _ want the war
games to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bastante,'' said Noel Garcia, 57, a distribution manager for a
San Juan newspaper who took his month-long vacation to join the
protestors at their remote camp. ``Enough. The people here on
Vieques have not been able to live normal lives. The bombing has
destroyed the environment and held back the island's development.
All of Puerto Rico believes this must end.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Washington, D.C. swirled with reports that three U.S.
Navy ships and 1,200 Marines were headed for Vieques Island in
order to set up a perimeter following a law-enforcement action in
which U.S. Marshals and FBI agents would move in to arrest and
remove the protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Unnamed administration sources have said the action might take
place this week. But coming on the heels of the widely-publicized
raid to take Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami
relatives, some here question whether the U.S. government can
afford to mount another heavy-handed action so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted by the rumors, Vieques is now swarming with media, with
television crews from Puerto Rico and the mainland filling the
island's few hotels and hiring fishermen for the 8-mile boat-ride
to the remote bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   If the raid takes place, some of the 50-70 protestors on the
range vow to scatter into the hills away from their camps on the
beach, hiding in the brush. Others say they will not resist arrest
_ but promise that more protestors will quickly come to take their
places.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, a source close to the Coast
Guard said they were preparing to blockade waters around the
two-thirds of Vieques that is federal land _ the eastern bombing
range and a munitions store in the west _ to prevent threatened
demonstrator reinforcements from reaching the protest area by sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here in peace,'' said Bishop Juan Vera, head of the
Puerto Rican Evangelical Council of Churches, which has sent
ministers on a rotating basis to the protest camps. ``Our moral
witness is the most important thing. If we are taken away, others
will come here to take our place. We are following the tradition of
Ghandi and Martin Luther King Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   An army barge also arrived carrying three vans of Puerto Rico's
anti-riot police, who are to provide crowd control during the
operation. On board a dozen men in green uniforms were visible. In
a channel farther out from Vieques a destroyer anchored Monday,
carrying two U.S. Coast guard helicopters, with blue-overalled
crews checking their aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, the three warships steamed off to Roosevelt Roads
Naval Station on the main island of Puerto Rico, about 1 1/2 hours
away given the glass-calm sea, and the barge deposited the police
vans on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques bombing range dates back to the years of World War
II, when the sleepy U.S. possession of Puerto Rico suddenly took on
a new strategic military importance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the residents of Puerto Rico and Vieques were U.S.
citizens, there was little protest when the Navy condemned 22,000
of Vieques' 33,000 acres, moving small farmers and sugar cane
workers off their land at either east or west end, and to the
island's center. Many residents left, seeking work on Puerto Rico
or going to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But resentment simmered.
</P>
<P>
   In April of last year, the controversy boiled over after a
wayward bomb dropped by a Navy jet killed David Sanes, a Vieques
resident who worked on the range as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, small groups of protestors set up camps on the
range, halting all military exercises. Soon they were issuing press
releases and giving media interviews, claiming that the decades of
bombing and strafing _ at times with uranium-tipped bullets _ had
rendered the range an environmental nightmare. They also cited
health studies showing an unusually high rate of cancer on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   As the protest camps grew to a few dozen in strength, the issue
swept like a wildfire across the neighboring island of Puerto Rico,
with thousands joining protests in the streets of San Juan. Outrage
over Vieques managed to unite the island's normally fractious
political parties, with dozens of elected officials joining in the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, however, stood firm, saying that the Vieques range is
essential to the combat-readiness of U.S. forces. For decades, most
Navy battle groups have conducted live-fire war games on the range
immediately prior to overseas duty, with pilots, Marines and ship
crews all participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vieques is unique because it's the only place in the United
States that we can bring all of the elements of an integrated
battle group together for training,'' Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob
Garcia said last year.
</P>
<P>
   After months of negotiation, President Clinton and Gov. Pedro
Rossello of Puerto Rico signed an agreement Jan. 31 aimed at ending
the festering conflict. The deal calls for the Navy to leave
Vieques by May 2003 if island residents vote to expel the military.
The vote would come sometime next year, and the Navy was supposed
to resume bombing practice _ although only with dummy munitions _
in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   But the protestors were outraged by the deal, and have vowed to
stay in place until the U.S. military agrees to an immediate and
permanent pullout.
</P>
<P>
   They are counting on the backing of more than 2 million Puerto
Ricans now living in the United States. Thousands will vote in the
upcoming November elections in New York, where first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton is a candidate for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they are removed, the protestors believe the issue will
be kept alive by more protestors sneaking out to the range by boat
or slipping through the fence that surrounds the Navy land and
making their way in by foot.
</P>
<P>
   And they believe they will ultimately win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already obtained a great victory,'' said Ruben
Berrios, head of the Puerto Rico Independence Party, who hasn't
left his camp at the bombing range in the past year. ``There have
been no bombs for one year, and we have demonstrated the moral
force of the Puerto Rican people. Whatever happens, we think it is
only a matter of how and when the Navy leaves for good.''

 &HT;    Laws collide with medicine in partial-delivery abortion
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An awful lot of energy has been devoted to a procedure that
accounts for less than 0.06 percent of all abortions. Imagine if
that energy had been directed toward an effective adoption system
that would reduce both abortions and heartbroken infertile couples,
two goals that stir hardly any controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But the abortion issue has grown far beyond the question of
whether an embryo's right to be born trumps a pregnant woman's
right to control her body. Just last week, as the Supreme Court
heard arguments about this rare procedure, abortion cast its broad
shadow over several aspects of what role the government should have
in practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate committee debated whether to pay for promising research
that could cure such horrifying disorders as Alzheimer's disease
and paralysis by using stem cells from discarded human embryos.
Another Senate committee discussed whether doctors' ability to
treat severe pain should be limited for the purpose of outlawing
assisted suicide. A federal agency raised the question of whether a
patient's right to privacy should be sacrificed for society's right
to identify possible alcoholics by using imprecise blood tests.
</P>
<P>
   And the Supreme Court's case boils down to whether a safer
abortion procedure should be outlawed in favor of procedures that
kill the fetus less gruesomely.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the partial-delivery procedure call it
``partial-birth abortion,'' a term that's meant to inspire outrage
about this technique for killing fetuses and not to undercut their
thesis that life begins at conception and therefore is never
partial.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one states have passed laws against this procedure,
medically called ``intact dilation and extraction,'' or D&AMP;X. Most
of those laws have been struck down by courts as being so vague as
to also cover the most common abortion procedure, called ``dilation
and evacuation'' or D&AMP;E. Ohio's Legislature recently passed a
second try at this law. The Supreme Court will settle the issue
next month by ruling on Nebraska's typical law.
</P>
<P>
   The laws have been poorly written because neither side of the
abortion issue really cares much about the one of every 1,800
abortions done by D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
   There are two morally unambiguous positions that can be taken on
abortion. Abortion-rights advocates maintain all abortions are
legal until the fetus is able to survive outside of the womb. The
anti-abortion side maintains all abortions constitute the illegal
murder of a life that began at either conception or implantation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the laws have been written by the groups that don't see
much distinction between D&AMP;X and the other 99.4 percent of
abortions. Murder is murder, after all, the argument goes, so it's
no wonder they're writing laws that prohibit more than just D&AMP;X.
From their perspective, we might as well be asking them to write
laws declaring murder to be legal when the weapon is a knife or a
rope.
</P>
<P>
   It's the middle majority, opposed to outlawing all abortions,
that wants D&AMP;X to be illegal. This opposition can only be based on
a belief that it is more repulsive to cut and empty a fetal skull
while most of its body is in the birth canal than to cut and empty
the skull while the body is elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The middle majority needs to get past this distinction. All
abortions are gory, but as long as they're legal up to the fetus'
viability _ and no court has shown an inclination to change that _
then only the doctors should be choosing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Undisputed Supreme Court testimony called D&AMP;X one of the safest
abortion procedures for the woman, primarily used when she has
heart disease, diabetes or other conditions that make other
techniques needlessly dangerous. The reason President Clinton
intends to veto a bill against ``partial birth abortions'' for a
third time is that Congress keeps making exceptions only if other
techniques would endanger the woman's life, not if they would
endanger her health.
</P>
<P>
   So it's possible to write a law forbidding D&AMP;X except in
narrowly defined cases.
</P>
<P>
   It's more desirable to create the infrastructure _ bureaucratic,
social, medical and psychological _ that would make it as practical
as possible to carry unwanted children to full-term for adoption.
That would eliminate a lot more than 0.06 percent of abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that abortions in general and the
partial-delivery procedure in particular have become no less than a
cultural battleground between the liberal value of permissiveness
and the conservative value of shame. Twenty-five years ago, this
country abandoned a similar surrogate battle between free
enterprise and communism. It was the Vietnam War.

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Douglas Sills was hired to rescue people from the
guillotine, he didn't realize that the neck he was saving might one
day be his own.
</P>
<P>
   His mission? To star on Broadway in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' a
splashy, big-budget musical based on Baroness Orczy's 1905 novel
about a mysterious do-gooder who spares innocent victims from
France's Reign of Terror.
</P>
<P>
   The risks? The musical's composer was Frank Wildhorn, a Broadway
outsider who'd already scored a monster hit with the pop-flavored
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' making him something of a marked man in the
byzantine New York theater world.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel's'' $10 million budget put
it in a league of messianic expectation usually reserved for
blockbusters like ``Ragtime'' ($12 million) and ``The Lion King''
($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sills, a strapping, multitalented Michigander with more
top-flight California theater credits to his name (South Coast
Repertory, Mark Taper Forum) than Marie Antoinette had corsets.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Pimpernel's'' producers initially had hoped to land a
big-name Hollywood or Broadway star for the challenging lead role,
Sills' versatility, charisma and technical finesse won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always call him Danny Kaye, because he reminds me of that
kind of a talent who can also sing,'' says Wildhorn, comparing
Sills to the late great comic actor.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the New York critics skewered ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' when it opened at the Minskoff Theater in the fall of
1997. Yet Sills emerged unscathed. He was praised for his
dual-edged portrayal of the title character, who masquerades by day
as the English fop Percy Blakeney but changes at night into the
dashing, elusive Scarlet Pimpernel, whose true identity is hidden
even from his wife, Marguerite. (A pimpernel, as if you didn't
know, is a type of primrose whose star-shaped flowers close up in
bad weather, suggesting its secretive nature.)
</P>
<P>
   When the ailing show was stripped down and remounted the
following November _ this time to generally rousing reviews _ Sills
was the only principal actor to return. Revised once more by
Wildhorn and bookwriter-lyricist Nan Knighton, and transferred to
the smaller Neil Simon Theatre, it ran for a total of 363
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the downsized, revivified musical, The New York
Times' Vincent Canby described Sills as ``a true singer'' who ``has
great fun with the role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sills continues to dominate the show,'' Canby wrote,
``though now the show is working with him, instead of ignoring
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills' efforts in helping ``Pimpernel'' gain a second life were
rewarded with Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle award
nominations for best actor in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Sills will reprise his star-making performance when
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' opens an eight-week run at the Ahmanson
Theatre in his hometown of Los Angeles. In November, he'll be back
in L.A. playing the silent film comedy king Mack Sennett in the
Reprise! Broadway's Best in Concert production of the legendary
1974 musical ``Mack &AMP; Mabel'' at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   If Sills' turn in ``Pimpernel'' has suddenly put him on the
musical theater fast track, you wouldn't guess it from his
self-effacing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never call myself deserving, because I've known so
many far more talented actors,'' he says, speaking by phone from
San Francisco, where the show was recently parked during its
current national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be surprising to me if I were back waiting tables
some day. The younger people in the cast hear that and they say,
`Are you kidding?' They think it's false modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Show biz's legendary fickleness aside, it seems unlikely Sills
will be sponging countertops anytime soon. Having just passed the
big 4-0 mark, he's enjoying the type of ``overnight success'' that
sometimes happens to people who've been toiling for years in the
regional theater trenches.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly the past decade, Sills has been seen regularly at
many of Southern California's top professional stages. He performed
in the Los Angeles premiere of ``Chess,'' is a two-time Drama-Logue
winner and was a charter member of the Antaeus Theatre Company, the
acclaimed North Hollywood-based ensemble that specializes in
classic plays.
</P>
<P>
   He also has appeared in recurring TV roles in shows like
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Coach'' and ``Party of Five,'' and was the
original Los Angeles producer of the hit bio-musical ``Dinah Was,''
starring Yvette Freeman as blues legend Dinah Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of such dues-paying persistence, it wasn't until
age 35 that Sills made his Broadway debut in ``Pimpernel.'' Kevin
Kline was among those originally considered for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled that Kevin Kline had other engagements,'' Sills
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had to audition six times, Sills has outlasted his
original ``Pimpernel'' co-stars Christine Andreas (Marguerite) and
Terrence Mann (as the Pimpernel's arch-rival Chauvelin), as well as
their replacements, Rachel York and Rex Smith. The touring
production, once again directed and choreographed by Robert
Longbottom (``Side Show''), co-stars Amy Bodnar and William Paul
Michals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success alighted on my tree, and I'm just glad that my bough
was sturdy enough to support it,'' Sills says with an agreeable
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' theatrical roots reach all the way back to his Ann Arbor,
Mich., childhood, where he grew up in a tightly woven Jewish clan.
</P>
<P>
   His adolescent idols weren't brawny American Method actors in
torn T-shirts, but silver-tongued classicists like Laurence
Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Richard Burton and John Gielgud. He
remembers that after telling his mother he wanted to be an actor,
she made him watch the 1935 film version of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel,'' starring that most urbane of Anglo leading men, Leslie
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Detroit's artsy Cranbrook Academy prep school,
Sills gained further high-culture exposure. Even though ``everyone
in my family got law degrees,'' Sills' father took him aside one
day and encouraged him to try the stage. He made his debut as Matt
in a suburban dinner theater production of ``The Fantasticks,'' and
moved to San Francisco to pursue acting after graduating from the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Pimpernel eight times a week is highly demanding,
requiring Sills not only to sing and dance but also parry, thrust
and otherwise make like Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, he follows a strict regimen of workouts, weight
training, protein shakes, voice lessons and plenty of sleep. After
nearly two years of playing the show in New York, he had to take
several weeks off to recharge before starting the current national
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery,'' he says, ``but it is an exact
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills credits his classical training at San Francisco's vaunted
American Conservatory Theater (ACT) with helping him balance the
two halves of his Pimpernel persona: the prissy Percy and the
suave, butt-kicking Pimpernel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more fun playing Percy,'' he acknowledges. ``To hear the
sound of laughter roll through an audience and know you had a part
in building that is the greatest feeling you can have. It just
fills your chest to bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills also has proven adept at handling Wildhorn's voluble,
r&AMP;b-influenced show numbers. In his other life as a pop-rock
composer, Wildhorn has written songs recorded and performed by
Whitney Houston, Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, Liza Minnelli and Trisha
Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're songs that drift in your mind, not songs you take
apart with tweezers,'' Sills says in praising Wildhorn's
commercially oriented, accessible tunes, which have propelled shows
like ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' (now in its fifth year on Broadway) and
``The Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sills has proven he can buckle his swashes with the
best of 'em, he has plenty of offers coming his way. He'll be
starring opposite Vanessa Williams in an upcoming period musical
set in New Orleans' red-light district. And he's mulling over a
possible Shakespearean double bill: the title role in ``Hamlet''
and perhaps ``Much Ado About Nothing'' with Southern California
director Mark Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' professional fortunes appear to be peaking at an
opportune time. For many years, the actor says, a family tragedy
had cast a long shadow over his life and those of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed while
taking off from Detroit Metro Airport en route to John Wayne
Airport in Orange County. Of the 153 people on board, only a
4-year-old girl survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers that evening was Sills' older brother. He
was heading to Arizona and was planning to visit Sills and watch
him perform in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is one of those things where everything in your life
divides into before and after,'' Sills says. ``When I look back at
that period of my life, there are some really dark colors in my
palette.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many months in New York, Sills says, having the chance
to perform ``Pimpernel'' in Los Angeles was a big factor in his
signing up for the national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn applauds that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you want to lead with your best, and Doug is our
best,'' Wildhorn says. ``But also, Sammy Davis Jr. once had a
conversation about roles, and those roles that come once in a
lifetime, and you have to be careful because you may never get
another one. Yul Brynner never got another `King and I,' and Rex
Harrison never got another `My Fair Lady.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if I may say so, I think it was very smart of Doug to
continue the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he now keeps a second home in New York _ ``The house that
`Pimpernel' bought,'' he calls it _ Sills considers L.A.'s Fairfax
District his true nesting place..
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a longtime partner and various beasts of the animal
kind,'' he says in a gently amused tone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's his next derring-do mission?

GENERAL SEES LENGTHY ROLE FOR NATO TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP MONTIETH, Kosovo _ After a thank-the-troops tour by Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen to two American bases that have already
become self-sufficient towns, the top US commander in Kosovo
predicted Monday that NATO peacekeepers will have to remain in the
Balkans for ``at least a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   That assessment by Brigadier General Ricardo Sanchez, commander
of Task Force Falcon, in an interview with the Globe, was made as
many members of Congress have expressed increasing displeasure with
the open-ended US deployments to Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, senators questioned Cohen about the US troop
commitment. Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat,
told Cohen and General H. Hugh Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to stop ``whistling Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to stop kidding each other,'' Hollings added, as he
urged the leaders of the nation's military to give ``a realistic
appraisal of where we are headed'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The defense secretary acknowledged then that US troops in the
Balkans will not be pulled out during his final months in office,
and possibly not during the time of his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez's comments went much further, noting that the two US
camps in southwestern Kosovo, Montieth and the sprawling Bonsteel,
were being built to support and house US troops for at least three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easily it could be that long,'' he said as soldiers nearby
swarmed around Cohen and the secretary's wife, former Boston
television personality Janet Langhart Cohen. ``It order to
guarantee the safety of all the people here, we're talking at least
a generation for NATO's commitment to secure the Balkans region.
I'm not saying troop size would be the same. But it's a long-term
commitment for NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   About 39,000 NATO troops, including about 5,600 Americans, are
currently trying to keep the peace in Kosovo, which continues to be
wracked by ethnic violence. Following NATO's air campaign last
spring that eventually pushed Yugoslav troops out of the Serb
province of Kosovo, ethnic Albanians have committed the majority of
crimes, many directed at the remaining Serb villagers.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Bosnia, about 6,000 US troops remain as peacekeepers,
down from the initial 1995 deployment of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who has traveled to Kosovo three times in the last 10
months and has made it a priority to visit US troops around the
world, said the Kosovo situation remains tense and volatile. But he
said it represented a ``rather remarkable'' improvement from a year
ago, when the province had 50 murders a week. Now the number
averages about five weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still too many . . . but in not a great amount of time,
we're making a good deal of progress,'' he told reporters during
his flight to Europe. ``But we need to have more police. . . . We
need to have more judges, more courtrooms, more civilian-run
institutions organized by international institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Americans have dug in for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   They seem determined not to repeat the mistakes of Bosnia, where
troops slept in tents for month after month. In Kovoso, the
military chief ordered wood-framed dormitories with floors.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is America's footprint here more visible than at Camp
Bonsteel. What was once a field of mud in springtime, and a sea of
growing wheat in summer, today looks like a city in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsteel is home to about 4,000 troops. They eat in two huge
dining halls or in a Burger King, sleep on mattresses rather than
cots, watch recently released movies such as ``The Green Mile'' and
``Dogma'' from plush maroon theater seats, pray in two chapels,
work up sweat in two gyms, mail letters at a post exchange and
flush toilets linked to one of the two most advanced sewage
treatment systems in all of Kosovo. The other military camp is at
Montieth, about 15 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to Kosovo,'' said Major George Linka, after reading a
list of what has been built in the last year at the 755-acre
Bonsteel camp.
</P>
<P>
   But from this safe and relatively comfortable haven, US troops
are dispatched, some of them daily, to areas of Kosovo where
violence is a constant presence.
</P>
<P>
   One is Military Police Specialist Jeremy Bailey, 19, of
Braintree, who has been here since November, enough time that death
has lost its shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things get pretty wild,'' Bailey said outside the theater
where troops were lining up to have their pictures taken with Cohen
and his wife. ``You just expect to see certain things, like dead
bodies, or people stepping on land mines. That kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the quality of life has been outstanding. I get
to take a shower. I eat chow every day. Hot chow. This morning, I
had French toast with maple syrup and an omelette.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't expect the job to become much easier for those
soldiers who will take his place here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation upon generation upon generation of taught hatred is
going to take a long time to go away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment seemed uniform among the soldiers, underscoring
Sanchez's forecast of a long NATO commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Bosnia. In Bosnia, people could go to whichever
side they live on. Here, you have no side to go live on,'' said
Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Rousseau, executive officer for the
3rd Brigade and a Burlington, Vt., native.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder in Kosovo,'' where ethnic Albanians and Serbs
live among each other, he said. ``Half of the town, the Albanians,
waves to me when I go by. The other side flips me off. We see it,
we live it, every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain John Gossart, 29, of Washington, a Boston College
graduate, was more optimistic. He said he believes the situation is
``getting better every day. I got here about five months ago, and
it's more safe and secure, and it has more freedom of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We're not there yet. The problem is 800 years
old, and it's going to take time to solve.''

EDITORS: CORRECTS NAME OF WRITER TO REED JOHNSON 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Douglas Sills was hired to rescue people from the
guillotine, he didn't realize that the neck he was saving might one
day be his own.
</P>
<P>
   His mission? To star on Broadway in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' a
splashy, big-budget musical based on Baroness Orczy's 1905 novel
about a mysterious do-gooder who spares innocent victims from
France's Reign of Terror.
</P>
<P>
   The risks? The musical's composer was Frank Wildhorn, a Broadway
outsider who'd already scored a monster hit with the pop-flavored
``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' making him something of a marked man in the
byzantine New York theater world.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel's'' $10 million budget put
it in a league of messianic expectation usually reserved for
blockbusters like ``Ragtime'' ($12 million) and ``The Lion King''
($15 million).
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sills, a strapping, multitalented Michigander with more
top-flight California theater credits to his name (South Coast
Repertory, Mark Taper Forum) than Marie Antoinette had corsets.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Pimpernel's'' producers initially had hoped to land a
big-name Hollywood or Broadway star for the challenging lead role,
Sills' versatility, charisma and technical finesse won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always call him Danny Kaye, because he reminds me of that
kind of a talent who can also sing,'' says Wildhorn, comparing
Sills to the late great comic actor.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the New York critics skewered ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel'' when it opened at the Minskoff Theater in the fall of
1997. Yet Sills emerged unscathed. He was praised for his
dual-edged portrayal of the title character, who masquerades by day
as the English fop Percy Blakeney but changes at night into the
dashing, elusive Scarlet Pimpernel, whose true identity is hidden
even from his wife, Marguerite. (A pimpernel, as if you didn't
know, is a type of primrose whose star-shaped flowers close up in
bad weather, suggesting its secretive nature.)
</P>
<P>
   When the ailing show was stripped down and remounted the
following November _ this time to generally rousing reviews _ Sills
was the only principal actor to return. Revised once more by
Wildhorn and bookwriter-lyricist Nan Knighton, and transferred to
the smaller Neil Simon Theatre, it ran for a total of 363
performances.
</P>
<P>
   In praising the downsized, revivified musical, The New York
Times' Vincent Canby described Sills as ``a true singer'' who ``has
great fun with the role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sills continues to dominate the show,'' Canby wrote,
``though now the show is working with him, instead of ignoring
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills' efforts in helping ``Pimpernel'' gain a second life were
rewarded with Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle award
nominations for best actor in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Sills will reprise his star-making performance when
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' opens an eight-week run at the Ahmanson
Theatre in his hometown of Los Angeles. In November, he'll be back
in L.A. playing the silent film comedy king Mack Sennett in the
Reprise! Broadway's Best in Concert production of the legendary
1974 musical ``Mack &AMP; Mabel'' at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   If Sills' turn in ``Pimpernel'' has suddenly put him on the
musical theater fast track, you wouldn't guess it from his
self-effacing attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never call myself deserving, because I've known so
many far more talented actors,'' he says, speaking by phone from
San Francisco, where the show was recently parked during its
current national tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be surprising to me if I were back waiting tables
some day. The younger people in the cast hear that and they say,
`Are you kidding?' They think it's false modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Show biz's legendary fickleness aside, it seems unlikely Sills
will be sponging countertops anytime soon. Having just passed the
big 4-0 mark, he's enjoying the type of ``overnight success'' that
sometimes happens to people who've been toiling for years in the
regional theater trenches.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly the past decade, Sills has been seen regularly at
many of Southern California's top professional stages. He performed
in the Los Angeles premiere of ``Chess,'' is a two-time Drama-Logue
winner and was a charter member of the Antaeus Theatre Company, the
acclaimed North Hollywood-based ensemble that specializes in
classic plays.
</P>
<P>
   He also has appeared in recurring TV roles in shows like
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Coach'' and ``Party of Five,'' and was the
original Los Angeles producer of the hit bio-musical ``Dinah Was,''
starring Yvette Freeman as blues legend Dinah Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of such dues-paying persistence, it wasn't until
age 35 that Sills made his Broadway debut in ``Pimpernel.'' Kevin
Kline was among those originally considered for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled that Kevin Kline had other engagements,'' Sills
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had to audition six times, Sills has outlasted his
original ``Pimpernel'' co-stars Christine Andreas (Marguerite) and
Terrence Mann (as the Pimpernel's arch-rival Chauvelin), as well as
their replacements, Rachel York and Rex Smith. The touring
production, once again directed and choreographed by Robert
Longbottom (``Side Show''), co-stars Amy Bodnar and William Paul
Michals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success alighted on my tree, and I'm just glad that my bough
was sturdy enough to support it,'' Sills says with an agreeable
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' theatrical roots reach all the way back to his Ann Arbor,
Mich., childhood, where he grew up in a tightly woven Jewish clan.
</P>
<P>
   His adolescent idols weren't brawny American Method actors in
torn T-shirts, but silver-tongued classicists like Laurence
Olivier, Ralph Richardson, Richard Burton and John Gielgud. He
remembers that after telling his mother he wanted to be an actor,
she made him watch the 1935 film version of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel,'' starring that most urbane of Anglo leading men, Leslie
Howard.
</P>
<P>
   As a student at Detroit's artsy Cranbrook Academy prep school,
Sills gained further high-culture exposure. Even though ``everyone
in my family got law degrees,'' Sills' father took him aside one
day and encouraged him to try the stage. He made his debut as Matt
in a suburban dinner theater production of ``The Fantasticks,'' and
moved to San Francisco to pursue acting after graduating from the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Pimpernel eight times a week is highly demanding,
requiring Sills not only to sing and dance but also parry, thrust
and otherwise make like Errol Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, he follows a strict regimen of workouts, weight
training, protein shakes, voice lessons and plenty of sleep. After
nearly two years of playing the show in New York, he had to take
several weeks off to recharge before starting the current national
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery,'' he says, ``but it is an exact
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills credits his classical training at San Francisco's vaunted
American Conservatory Theater (ACT) with helping him balance the
two halves of his Pimpernel persona: the prissy Percy and the
suave, butt-kicking Pimpernel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more fun playing Percy,'' he acknowledges. ``To hear the
sound of laughter roll through an audience and know you had a part
in building that is the greatest feeling you can have. It just
fills your chest to bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sills also has proven adept at handling Wildhorn's voluble,
r&AMP;b-influenced show numbers. In his other life as a pop-rock
composer, Wildhorn has written songs recorded and performed by
Whitney Houston, Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish, Liza Minnelli and Trisha
Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're songs that drift in your mind, not songs you take
apart with tweezers,'' Sills says in praising Wildhorn's
commercially oriented, accessible tunes, which have propelled shows
like ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' (now in its fifth year on Broadway) and
``The Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Sills has proven he can buckle his swashes with the
best of 'em, he has plenty of offers coming his way. He'll be
starring opposite Vanessa Williams in an upcoming period musical
set in New Orleans' red-light district. And he's mulling over a
possible Shakespearean double bill: the title role in ``Hamlet''
and perhaps ``Much Ado About Nothing'' with Southern California
director Mark Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   Sills' professional fortunes appear to be peaking at an
opportune time. For many years, the actor says, a family tragedy
had cast a long shadow over his life and those of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, 1987, Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed while
taking off from Detroit Metro Airport en route to John Wayne
Airport in Orange County. Of the 153 people on board, only a
4-year-old girl survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers that evening was Sills' older brother. He
was heading to Arizona and was planning to visit Sills and watch
him perform in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is one of those things where everything in your life
divides into before and after,'' Sills says. ``When I look back at
that period of my life, there are some really dark colors in my
palette.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many months in New York, Sills says, having the chance
to perform ``Pimpernel'' in Los Angeles was a big factor in his
signing up for the national tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn applauds that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you want to lead with your best, and Doug is our
best,'' Wildhorn says. ``But also, Sammy Davis Jr. once had a
conversation about roles, and those roles that come once in a
lifetime, and you have to be careful because you may never get
another one. Yul Brynner never got another `King and I,' and Rex
Harrison never got another `My Fair Lady.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if I may say so, I think it was very smart of Doug to
continue the journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he now keeps a second home in New York _ ``The house that
`Pimpernel' bought,'' he calls it _ Sills considers L.A.'s Fairfax
District his true nesting place..
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a longtime partner and various beasts of the animal
kind,'' he says in a gently amused tone.
</P>
<P>
   So what's his next derring-do mission?

LIMITED U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN RAISES CONCERN AMONG NATO
ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The foreign policy chief for the European Union,
Javier Solana, said Monday that European officials are concerned
about the potentially damaging effect the Clinton administration's
plan for national missile defense could have on Europe's security
ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe were not protected by the missile shield, such a
system could lead to ``decoupling'' _ a splintering in military
ties _ between the United States and its NATO allies, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were not to be defended by the United States, that may
risk the beginning of `decoupling,''' Solana told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, the former secretary-general of NATO, is now leading the
European Union's efforts to build a defense force that would
complement NATO. He said that if the American missile system moves
ahead it must not ``strain trans-Atlantic links'' or provoke a ``a
major crisis with Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana is here meeting with senior Clinton administration
officials to discuss the European Union's defense plan and to learn
about the Clinton administration's talks with Russia over the
planned missile defense. President Clinton is scheduled to attend a
summit meeting of the European Union in Lisbon before meeting with
the Russian president-elect, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow in early
June. In both arenas, missile defense will be a major topic.
</P>
<P>
   Western European leaders _ some more than others _ have publicly
questioned the necessity of the administration's plan to construct
a limited national defense designed to protect against the missiles
of ``rogue'' states like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans question the depth of the threat from these
countries, some of which _ like Iraq, Iran and Libya _ are much
closer to Europe than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Karsten Vogt, a senior foreign ministry official,
said recently that the limited missile defense planned by the
Clinton administration _ which would protect the United States but
not Europe _ would lead to a weakening of the military ties between
the United States and its European allies. Vogt also said that
Germany did not agree with the American assessment of the
seriousness of a threat from the ``rogue'' states.
</P>
<P>
   In London last month, Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was visited
by Putin, publicly said that his government would try to help
resolve the differences between Russia and the United States on
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin has opposed the Clinton administration's efforts
to amend the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, considered the
basis of Cold War arms control, to allow for a missile defense
system. The ABM treaty prohibits defense systems like the one now
being tested, and in order to forge ahead with its plan, the
administration must persuade Putin to amend the treaty or the
United States must pull out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Blair played a constructive role
with Putin by both asking him to think seriously about the threat
from ``rogue'' nations and also emphasizing that the administration
wants only a modest change to the ABM treaty that would keep the
spirit of the treaty intact.
</P>
<P>
   The British position on missile defense is a critical one for
the administration. Behind the scenes, British officials have been
deeply skeptical of the plan and questioned why Washington would
want to push ahead with a scheme that would protect the United
States but not Britain.
</P>
<P>
   And although it would not protect Britain, an American early
warning radar located in Britain designed to monitor Russian
missiles would have to be modified under the American plans so that
it could detect missiles from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk with reporters, Solana, a physicist, said he
understood the compulsion politicians feel about moving toward
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a country and you have risks and you have the
technology, it's very hard for a leader not to use it,'' he said.
But, he added, ``You have to weigh the consequences for the rest of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the worries for Europe if the United States proceeds with
the missile defense system is not only a deterioration of relations
with Russia but also with China. Europeans also worry that the
defense system could lead to a spiraling arms race that the ABM
treaty was designed to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said Monday that missile defense had not yet reached the
front burner of public debate in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared to be reflecting an undercurrent of concern that
if the United States put such a system into effect, Europe would be
left more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article, Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution who specializes in arms control, described
the European quandary this way, ``Either they differentiate their
security from that of the United States, thus bringing about the
very decoupling they fear, or they acquire a similar degree of
protection by deploying missile defenses of their own.''

 &HT;    A REAL WHITE HOUSE STAFF, AND THEY PLAY ONE ON TV
 &HT;    280&AMP;add.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does art imitate government, or is it the other way
around?
</P>
<P>
   It has been hard to tell at the White House lately.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton stepped into an unaccustomed role to film a
humorous video skit that was screened Saturday night at the annual
White House Correspondents Association dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The same soiree featured a tape of White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart starring in a self-effacing satire with the cast of the
NBC television hit ``West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Martin Sheen, Allison Janney and other members of the
show's cast dropped into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. to nose around the
real West Wing with Lockhart and a few other real White House
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who plays fictional President Josiah Bartlet in the TV
series, took a seat alongside astonished reporters in the briefing
room as Janney stepped up to the podium to open the midday press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment today, but I will take questions,'' the
actress announced as her real-life counterpart stood by and the
press corps played along with the gag.
</P>
<P>
   UPI correspondent Helen Thomas, the 79-year-old grade dame of
the White House press corps, served up a softball about the
president's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he doing any work?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment,'' replied Janney.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Lockhart reasserted his briefing room authority,
and was quickly asked whether he was troubled by an apparent
blurring of the lines between Hollywood and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, let me tell you,'' Lockhart replied, ``I spent some time
looking at a group of actors in the fake briefing room in
Hollywood. And, looking out at you _ no, not at all. Not at all.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brought down the house at Saturday's black tie gala
before about 2,600 attendees (about 1 percent of whom actually have
much to do with covering the White House) with a tongue-in-cheek
video showing him stumbling around an empty White House with little
to do as his term expires.
</P>
<P>
   In the parody, titled ``The Final Days,'' Clinton played a
likeable but lonely prisoner in the twilight of his administration,
alternately passing the time by watching Disney reruns with First
Dog Buddy, coaxing ice cream sandwiches from a reluctant vending
machine or washing the presidential limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strange time in the life of any administration,''
Clinton told the crowd when he introduced the video. But, he said,
``I have come to terms with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a real-life White House spokesman _ said no tax
dollars were used to produce the video. Clinton spent, by various
accounts, two to six hours to play his part.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She muscled her way into the neighborhood in the
1920s, when nobody thought she belonged there. Now here she is
again, trying to squeeze in uptown with those ample hips of hers,
looking for a spot among the witty Brits and singing animals and
dancing gymnasts. And isn't she a sight for glazed eyes? Stand up,
boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   West has returned in a compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle called
``Dirty Blonde,'' the play written by and starring Claudia Shear
that opened Monday night at the Helen Hayes Theater. Eight decades
after a work of theater with the forthright title of ``Sex'' landed
her in jail and 20-some years after her death, West is proving that
she still has the power to shake things up. She has also, not
incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the
best new American play of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Though West is the dominant presence in ``Dirty Blonde,'' which
was first seen off Broadway at the New York Theater Workshop, this
is no evening of mere impersonation. It's not ``Mae West Tonight!''
with a celebrity facsimile spouting choice epigrams. Nor is it a
high-toned tabloid of a play in which a real-life sacred monster
reveals her all-too-human heart, a la Maria Callas in Terrence
McNally's ``Master Class.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Shear's ``Dirty Blonde'' is a multilayered study of the
nature of stardom, as experienced by one of its avatars and two
adoring fans. Shaped with remarkable fluidity and inventiveness,
``Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record
of that floating dialogue between icons and idolizers that remains
so much a part of American culture. What's more, it does so without
the usual tut-tutting, instead making a persuasive case for star
worship as a healthy religion.
</P>
<P>
   Conceived by Shear and the show's director, James Lapine, who
does his best work in years here, ``Dirty Blonde'' frames West's
self-willed rise to glory through the perspective of two
contemporary admirers who meet at the actress' grave in Queens.
They are Jo (Shear), a sometime actress and full-time loudmouth,
and Charlie (Kevin Chamberlin), a big, self-effacing fellow who
works in the movie archives of the public library.
</P>
<P>
   A less imaginative play would begin with this graveside
encounter. ``Dirty Blonde'' starts by bringing Jo and Charlie to
the edges of opposite sides of the stage, where they take turns
delivering a sort of litany that describes the traits of the
archetypal ``tough girl.'' She is someone who, as Charlie says,
``goes where she shouldn't, and when she gets there, she does
exactly what she wants ... and she likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the official version of Mae West, of course, and like
most outsize public icons, it is made of natural grit and
artificial varnish. ``Dirty Blonde'' will proceed to deconstruct
that persona, as it shifts between two essential story lines: the
professional evolution of Mae (who is embodied, brilliantly, in all
phases of her adult life by Shear) and the developing relationship
between Jo and Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   The Jo and Charlie plot, one of the more unlikely love stories
of the season, is pretty much chronological. The story of Mae
leapfrogs in time, showing her at one instant as a pushy young
hopeful in vaudeville and the next as the stylized gargoyle of her
old age, with Chamberlin and the invaluable Bob Stillman (also the
show's musical director) portraying human stepping stones and
resting places along Mae's path to legendhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde'' is especially ingenious in tracing the elements
that West appropriated in creating herself. The pelvic dancing she
observed in Harlem nightclubs, the baroquely exaggerated femininity
of female impersonators, the opulent hourglass glamor of the
gaslight era _ the discovery of these elements is rendered with an
immediate freshness.
</P>
<P>
   So, however, is the gnarled caricature of a woman whom Charlie
remembers meeting as a young man (the occasion for the evening's
most memorable sequences) and who is seen performing an arthritic
nightclub routine in Las Vegas, held up by two musclemen. Both as
playwright and performer, Shear finds the continuity in all the
seasons of Mae, the unrelenting drive that shapes and finally
warps.
</P>
<P>
   The play gives credence to the observation made by Arthur
Laurents in his recently published memoir that ``anyone who becomes
a movie star must be superhuman to remain human.'' Yet while the
geriatric Mae is indeed monstrous, ``Dirty Blonde'' refrains from
lip-smacking schadenfreude.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it views the transformation with a compassion commonly
reserved for more obviously noble sacrifices. The play has its own
perverse but credible theology: Mae becomes a monster that others
might draw what they need from the courageous, defiant and
exaggerated symbol she became. (Not, of course, that this was her
intention.) The idea of Mae West helps Charlie and Jo, who both
define themselves as losers, get through the day. It is also what
brings and keeps them together.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was seen downtown last winter, ``Dirty Blonde'' has
changed only for the better. The script remains basically the same,
with a little tightening here and there. But Lapine's adroit
staging feels even more streamlined now and more sure-footed. In
their Jo and Charlie incarnations, Shear and the wonderful
Chamberlin, who knows that low-key doesn't have to mean invisible,
have found a newly magnetic sense of mutual attraction that
justifies the play's ending.
</P>
<P>
   What's more surprising is how effortlessly the play seems to
fill the Helen Hayes, a 1912 jewel box for the rough diamond that
was Mae West. Douglas Stein's inspired warm pink trapezoid of a
set; Susan Hilferty's time-traveling costumes and David Lander's
cinematic lighting work beautifully together to create a world in
which past and present bleed into each other.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's a sensibility that reaches epiphanal heights in a scene in
which both Mae and Jo turn into the creature who would forever
after be identified as Mae West. The moment is one that could be
achieved only in the theater, and while ``Dirty Blonde'' may
celebrate a movie star, it also celebrates theater.
</P>
<P>
   The show does indeed incorporate many of fabled West witticisms.
Yet Shear's words are on their own terms equally resonant, blending
a novelist's sense of detail with a dramatist's feel for music.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, for example, to Charlie, describing the elderly Mae
settling into a car: ``I could see her sink against the seat,
staring straight ahead, like a doll on a pillow.'' Or here is Jo on
the virtues of Mae as a role model: ``No desperation, no pain
behind the eyes, `the man who got away,' `I love him so, he beats
me too' or any of that ... She's my teen-age fantasy, my mother's
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   That's still what comes across when you see Mae West in her
movies: a pure sexual confidence untainted by guilt or doubt.
American sex objects before and after her were nearly always
conflicted and usually self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course she shocked and delighted the audiences of her heyday.
Who else was like that? Who, for that matter, is like that now?
Shear finds the enduring substance in the smoke and mirrors of one
actress' stardom, allowing Mae West to shock and delight once
again.

MAY DAY RALLY IN ROME HEARS A PAPAL MASS AND A ROCK CONCERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs lede to fix style on `Pre-empting'.)  
By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  ROME _ Pre-empting the trade unions' traditional hold on May 1,
Pope John Paul II presided over a workers' rally Monday that
combined a solemn Mass with a raucous rock concert dedicated to
third world debt relief.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All must work so that the economic system in which we live
does not upset the fundamental order of the priority of work over
capital,'' the pope said in his homily. ``Globalization is a
reality present today in every area of human life, but it is a
reality that must be managed wisely. Solidarity too must be
globalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jubilee of the Workers, a Holy Year event that throughout
the day drew hundreds of thousands of people to Tor Vergata, a
field in suburban Rome, was unusual in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, union leaders and workers' delegations
from more than 40 countries attended the event, which also drew
pilgrims eager to attend a Mass celebrated by the pope. By late
afternoon close to half a million young people, with some tattoos
and body piercing providing a sharp contrast to nuns carrying
rosaries, packed the area to hear Lou Reed, Alanis Morissette and
the Eurythmics.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who began his papacy by backing the Polish labor
union, Solidarity, in its struggle against the Communist
authorities, has long made workers' rights a major theme of his
social message. And the Vatican's campaign to coax industrialized
nations to forgive or reduce the foreign debts of the world's
poorest nations drew pop stars eager to be associated with a cause
that targets the injustices of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   But the day, dedicated to international labor, also was one of
precedents that said less about the Vatican or pop music than about
Italy, which still has one of the most inflexible sets of rules
protecting labor in Europe. For the first time since May Day
celebrations began, city buses ran in Rome on Monday and shops in
the city center were given the option of opening _ and some did.
State museums all over Italy were open to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 21, Italians will vote in a referendum, sponsored by the
center-left government, that among other things would make it
easier for companies with more than 15 employees to lay off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   To allow the Vatican to hold its event _ broadcast live on
Italian television and on Eurovision, a Europe-wide television
hookup _ Italy's three major labor federations agreed to suspend
their annual labor day rally and youth concert. Union leaders said,
though, that they considered it a onetime-only break with their
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always shared the social concerns of the church, and I
don't see why today we shouldn't participate in this event,'' said
Pietro Larizza, secretary-general of the Union of Italian Laborers.
</P>
<P>
   But some other unions ignored the decision, leading a wildcat
May Day parade of many thousands of people through central Rome,
with red flags, hammer-and-sickle insignias and Marxist and gay
pride slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go to Tor Vergana and kneel with bankers and
industrialists,'' said Luciano Muhlbauer, 34, a representative of
Cobas, a leftist union, as he marched a few yards ahead of a
demonstrator who was dressed as the pope in a glittering gold
miter. ``Especially when we are threatened by a referendum that
will bring us to the same situation as the United States, where
everyone works but they are poor.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul shared a concert stage with Bob Dylan in Bologna in
1997, recently gave a papal audience to Bon Jovi, and has produced
his own CD, a medley of his rendition of hymns. He has rarely shied
away from popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   He did avert his eyes, however, while the Israeli pop singer Noa
sang the theme song from the Holocaust movie ``Life is Beautiful''
in a low-cut white top with a bare midriff. (She covered herself
with a wispy chiffon scarf to shake the pope's hand.) He also shook
hands with a few selected rock performers, including Morissette but
not Reed, a one-time gender-bending performer whose repertoire
includes the song ``Heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope left the stage before the rock concert began at 5 p.m.
It ended six hours later with songs from ``Jesus Christ Superstar''
as the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican officials had been asked all week about the incongruity
of having Reed take part in a solemn papal event. ``Rock music,
when it is performed by great artists, is stupendous,'' said Bishop
Fernando Charrier, who organized the event. ``There is no
diabolical rock; if anything there are diabolical people.''
</P>

   Concert organizers said that the Vatican did not seek to censure
the artists or their material and that they had used their own
judgment in recruiting stars.

<P>
   ``We avoided inviting performers who might try exploit the media
attention, brandishing crucifixes, or something,'' said Ricardo
Corato, president of Network, a rock promotion company that
organized the concert. ``I didn't invite Madonna, not because I
don't respect her but because it would have been inappropriate.
Madonna needs to exploit media attention to exist.''

MEXICAN CONGRESS HELPS BANKS EASE THEIR CREDIT CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FINEREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The Mexican Congress has passed new legislation to
replace bankruptcy and loan guarantee laws dating to the 1940s,
boosting hopes that Mexican banks could begin issuing new loans to
needy businesses after a five-year credit crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was approved last week, should help banks
recover their loans when debtors run into financial difficulties,
banking analysts said. One law streamlines bankruptcy procedures
and creates a federal institute to referee legal battles between
debtors and creditors. The other allows borrowers to use the goods
they produce or the assets they buy with the loan as the collateral
on the loan itself.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts said the new laws are a step in the right
direction, but warned that other weaknesses in the banking system
will slow the renewal of business lending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks are coming out of intensive care, but they remain in
a very delicate condition,'' said Mauricio Gonzalez Gomez, director
of the Grupo Economistas y Asociados, a Mexico City consulting
firm. ``These laws provide a more secure legal framework for
lending.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could take several years for bank lending to catch up
with the needs of an economy that has been starved for credit for
half a decade, Gonzalez Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   After the December 1994 peso crisis, interest rates topped 100
percent, causing millions of debtors to default on loans. Previous
laws made loan recovery cumbersome, and banks responded by cutting
off credit to most Mexican businesses. Over the years since,
bankers lobbied for new laws to make it easier to seize assets held
as collateral on past due loans.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the new laws were originally written by aides to
President Ernesto Zedillo, and they were biased in favor of the
banks when first proposed to Congress, people familiar with their
legislative history said.
</P>
<P>
   During months of legislative work on the bankruptcy bill,
lawmakers from several parties, including Zedillo's own
Institutional Revolutionary Party, made at least 150 changes.
Representatives of the banks and several business associations said
that after this vigorous rewrite, the language of the final
bankruptcy law was fair to both creditors and lenders. The
500-member Chamber of Deputies approved it last week in a 355-13
vote. Other lawmakers were absent or abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The loan guarantee law did not undergo such extensive
legislative evolution, although the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution proposed a series of major revisions. It passed the
chamber last week in a 289-128 vote. Senators from Democratic
Revolution criticized the law as too generous to bankers before it
was put to a vote on Sunday, but the Senate passed it by a broad
margin anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the new legislation may be muted at first because
the problems facing Mexican banks are far broader than simple
difficulties with loan collection, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks have been so weakened by the years of crisis that
they have little money to lend, and virtually all carry a
significant number of non-performing loans in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Mexico has few creditworthy businesses, so banks
with capital to lend face the challenge of identifying projects
that are financially sound, said Ursula Wilhelm, a bank analyst at
Standard &AMP; Poor's in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Not only the banks remain wary. Millions of Mexicans are still
paying off debts incurred during the peso crisis, and many are
reluctant to borrow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the laws eliminate legal loopholes that debtors have
abused, said Hector Rangel Domene, the president of the Mexican
Bankers' Association. Under Mexico's previous laws, companies in
debt could seek protection under Mexico's version of Chapter 11
before creditors could even recover the collateral the companies
had put up to secure the loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers could often prolong bankruptcy proceedings for 10 years
or more, while companies in debt proceeded with business as usual,
he said. The new legislation should allow credit flows to increase
moderately during the second half of 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we aren't going to know just how effective the new laws
are until they're put to the test in the real world,'' he said.

   DISNEY-TIMEWARNER (Undated) _ Millions of television viewers
found themselves without access to ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs Monday as
the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt
Disney, fought over the cable television rights to stations owned
by Disney's ABC network. The dispute has its roots in an argument
over how much money Disney should receive for carrying its channels
on Time Warner's cable systems, but it involves larger issues
dealing with the distribution of media content _ including the
longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry,
the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and
Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online
and Time Warner. It also concerns how much power the new company
will wield in a television industry that is merged with the
Internet. By Bill Carter.

   NY-POLLUTION-CREDITS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The New York state
legislature has passed a bill that would radically reduce the
amount of air pollution that has for years drifted from Midwestern
and Southern states into New York. The bill would forbid New York
companies from selling pollution credits they earned by cleaning up
their own smokestacks to polluters in other states. The legislation
directly challenges the 1990 Clean Air Act, which set up a
marketplace in which companies could trade the right to pollute in
the form of credits, as a commodity. Gov. George Pataki is expected
to sign the measure, which would make New York the first state to
ban these exchanges. By Raymond Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   CORPORATE-DONATIONS (Washington) _ More big companies are
deciding not to give large ``soft money'' donations to political
parties. But many are not telling anyone why they're not giving _
or even acknowledging that they've stopped. By Don Van Natta Jr.

   IRAN-JEWS (Shiraz, Iran) _ One of 13 Jewish men charged with
espionage went on trial Monday and Iranian authorities immediately
displayed him on television and had him admit that he had spied for
Israel. The defendant, Hamid Tefileen, made the public confession
came after the government had adamantly refused to allow family
members, human rights groups or the public to witness the opening
of the politically charged trials of the 13, who are to be tried,
one by one, in coming weeks. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Undated) _ Two members of Congress were back
in Washington Monday after one of the most expensive lobbying
efforts ever undertaken by the Clinton administration, if measured
on a per-vote basis. Hoping to sway legislators who remain
undecided on whether to grant China permanent normal trade
relations, President Clinton set aside funds earlier this year to
fly wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and
human rights conditions for themselves. But when the group, led by
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, left last week, there were only
two undecided congressmen. So began the education of Rep. Gregory
Meeks, D-N.Y., and Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas. They were treated
royally in Beijing where they met with a vice premier and watched
the sun rise over the Great Wall. In Shanghai, they had a private
audience with China's chief negotiator with Taiwan. And in Hong
Kong, they met with the chief executive of China's newly reclaimed
territory. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT-CENSUS (Detroit) _ For more than a month, a giant pair
of eyes has peered down from a billboard along several of this
city's expressways with the warning: ``DETROIT All eyes are on
You!'' The billboard was intended to remind residents to mail their
2000 census forms. But the sign is also a stark symbol of a
decade-old fear that Detroit could become the first American city
of more than 1 million people to have its population fall below
that number. The city, long dogged by its image as a rusting auto
giant, barely made it over the million marker in 1990, and then
only after a recount. Staying at a million is a point of pride.
Census anxiety runs so deep here that Mayor Dennis Archer began
drafting his battle plan four years ago. He determined that a
couple of public appearances would not be enough. So he has taken
the unusual approach of treating the census as a political
candidate would, stumping all over town on its behalf and imploring
residents to view their participation as a vote for Detroit's
future. By Nichole M. Christian.

MEDICAL HELP ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., May 7)  
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Society of Travel Medicine has spent hours of
its biennial conventions since it was formed in 1989 debating how
to tell people that travel in the developing world is not like
being in Kansas: that malaria is a reality in particular areas,
that motor-vehicle crashes are a more severe hazard than Japanese
encephalitis, that diarrhea is a frequent problem in the tropics.
Slips inserted into airline ticket jackets were discussed, as well
as in-flight filmstrips, data sheets to be distributed by travel
agents or even folders for brochure racks.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seemed to overcome the reluctance of the natural
intermediaries _ airlines, travel agents and tour operators _ to
cloud their ``fly with me'' message by saying that paradise has a
few bugs in it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Internet. And the same popular tools that
prospective travelers use to shop at 1 a.m. for interesting
itineraries and cheap fares and hotel rooms provide access to
medical information, good and bad, without intermediaries.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As always on the Web, sorting out the authoritative sites from
the sea of information is not always easy. But when medical Web
sites are reliable and backed by solid research, they are a no-cost
source of vital information and searchable lists of travel clinics
where one can get inoculations, prescriptions and post-travel help.
They also permit shopping online for gadgets or books, and link
into government Web sites that offer help, both medical and
practical _ where to get a visa, for example.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web has changed the way experts deliver travel medicine,
according to Dr. Bradley Connor of New York, head of the public
education committee of the International Society for Travel
Medicine. ``I can get an e-mail from a client in Indonesia,'' he
said, ``and give him help easily. It is so much better than the 3
a.m. phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide to a choice few sites on travel health.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Book
</P>
<P>
   The mother lode in this field is ``Health Information for
International Travel,'' researched and issued by the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In print, it
is known as the Yellow Book. Online, at www.cdc.gov/travel, its
home page is slicker, with tropical fish and blue panels.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because this material is in the public domain, it is the
resource travel writers draw on first. It hews to U.S. rules in not
recommending, for example, medicines or treatments not approved by
the Food and Drug Administration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current edition is 1999-2000, and Dr. Martin S. Cetron,
acting deputy director of the division of quarantine at the CDC,
said that a hard issue was whether to update the online version
with, for example, later immunization decisions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cetron is in negotiation with several dot-com companies that
want access to the Yellow Book beyond a simple hyperlink, which is
provided now on some Web sites _ www.travelmed.com, for example.
``We have progressed from giving advice on the voice phone to
providing faxes upon automated phone order to going online,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cetron said that the government could not enter into an
exclusive agreement with any company, and so he was talking to all
the major players. This includes www .medicineplanet.com, a
brand-new Web site, and www.ijet.com, a site that will not emerge
until fall.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, the online Yellow Book has many bonuses for
travelers: the Green Sheets, giving scores on government
cruise-ship inspections, and the Blue Sheets, which update cholera,
yellow fever and plague reports. The site is searchable by
destination and by disease.
</P>
<P>
   For those still in fiber mode, the book, stock number
017-023-00202-3, costs $22 from the Superintendent of Documents,
Washington, D.C. 20402; with a credit card, (202) 512-1800.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Medicineplanet
</P>
<P>
   Www.medicineplanet.com opened officially in mid-March. It is
large, with articles on a wide number of issues, including, as an
example, emergency contraception. This article, under Women's
Travel Center, by Dr. Susan Anderson, a clinical assistant
professor at the Stanford Medical School in California, is detailed
and includes charts with dosages and timing. This is not a topic
the Yellow Book touches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicineplanet is focused in the San Francisco area; its chief
executive officer is identified as Dr. Jordan Shlain, Lufthansa's
medical director in California. Editorial material is approved by
Dr. David Shlim, who directed a clinic in Nepal for years and is a
recognized authority on high-mountain illness. The editorial board
includes Dr. Martin Wolfe, a State Department consultant who is
considered the father of travel medicine as a discipline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was created and set up with venture capital. It has
three partners: American Express, which is selling travel medical
insurance, but not trip-cancellation coverage, on the site;
SelfCare.com, some of whose online catalog items are being offered,
and Ericsson Australia, a branch of the cell phone company, that
expects by the Olympics this fall to offer information from the
site to users of its telephones in Australia. Ann Trunko,
Medicineplanet marketing director, said that this service would
enable Ericsson clients in a pharmacy to dial a number to learn
what name to use for a drug known only by its United States name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is easy to use. The authors are well identified,
and the country-specific information on infectious diseases is
extensive. Dr. Stephen W. Hargarten, chairman of the emergency
medicine department of the Medical College of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee, was less enthusiastic about the information on vehicular
safety, which he found too generic. Hargarten, whose specialty is
travelers' injuries, said that www .asirt.org, (Association for
Safe International Road Travel) had road information for many
countries. This site was established by Rochelle Sobel, whose son
died in a bus crash in Turkey five years ago and is maintained as a
volunteer effort. Updating seems to be sporadic; sample material on
Turkey had not been revised for some time. Reports from other
countries are available, and users are asked to sign up and make a
donation.
</P>
<P>
   Other Specialists
</P>
<P>
   The Web simplifies the search for a travel clinic, although all
the sites with searchable lists add warnings that they do not
guarantee the care provided. Trunko said medicineplanet's list was
compiled from other lists and then checked by telephone. The
International Society of Travel Medicine now maintains its list,
sorted by country and by state within the United States, on the Web
only, at www.istm.org.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also on the association site are articles from the Journal of
Travel Medicine, a peer-reviewed publication. The most recent issue
includes an article about young volunteers who contracted dengue
fever in one of the British Virgin Islands and others, elsewhere on
the island, who did not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene also has a
clinic list at www.astmh.org. Most of the major problems in travel
occur in the tropics, although high-mountain sickness, diphtheria
in Russia, hypothermia in cold climes and injuries anywhere are
part of the picture. Tropical medicine specialists often have an
additional specialty, or, like Wolfe, end up counseling people
going almost everywhere.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Travel Medicine Inc. in Northampton, Mass., was created 10 years
ago by Dr. Stuart Rose to publish his book, ``International Travel
Health Guide,'' now in its 11th edition. The organization's Web
site, www .travelmed.com, noted above as one with links to the CDC
book, sells the Rose book and a number of travel items like
insecticides. This organization is taking over publication of the
Traveling Healthy newsletter, edited by Dr. Karl Neumann, a
pediatrician. The newsletter will appear on the Web in the near
future, Neumann said. Neumann frequently leads travel medicine
panels on children and insect repellents.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of the International Association for Medical
Assistance to Travelers, an organization that exists on voluntary
contributions, does not put everything on line at
www.sentex.net/iamat. It includes good samples of its literature,
including maps and color diagrams. But the material most people
want is the directory of English-speaking physicians around the
world who agree to modest fees, from $55 for an office visit up to
$95 for house calls at night and on Sundays and holidays. This
directory is not online; it is mailed to new members with an appeal
for help to build a center for the study of travel and geographical
health.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M. Assunta Uffer-Marcolongo, thewidow of the founder, Dr.
Vincenzo Marcolongo, continues the group's work as a memorial to
him and others who helped set it up. The old-style mail address is
417 Center St., Lewiston, N.Y. 14092 or 40 Regal Rd., Guelph,
Ontario, Canada N1K 1B5.

Russian troops tried to take the capital, Grozny, Chechen rebels
had begun on Jan. 31 to fight their way out. Now hundreds of
bloodied militants were waiting for treatment in Baiyev's village
southwest of Grozny. They included Shamil Basayev, the most
notorious of the Chechen warlords, who was wounded as he led his
fighters through a Russian minefield. After administering a local
anesthetic, Baiyev, a surgeon, amputated Basayev's right leg. And
soon after that, the rebels whisked their leader to safety in the
Caucasian mountains. Baiyev's life has not been the same since. By

far the deepest, the clearest lake on earth. But press a resident
to say what he loves most about Baikal, and he may cast his lot
with the nondescript, gray, oily, foot-long fish that dwells
therein. Siberians love the lowly omul. They love it fried, dried,
smoked, baked, grilled, salted, stuffed, with internals and without
internals, with and without scales. Residents of the eastern shore
even like it slightly decayed _ ``with odor,'' they call it. By

`FRONTLINE' EXPLORES JEFFERSON'S LASTING LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It begins with Thomas Jefferson _ Founding Father, author of the
Declaration of Independence, president, prince of the Enlightenment
and father of several children by his slave mistress, Sally
Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson-Hemings story may be familiar to most Americans,
largely because so many viewers watched a CBS miniseries about
them, heavily garnished with dramatic license, three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the best ``Frontline'' of the season revisits the
DNA evidence that proves, beyond all but the tiniest doubt, that
Jefferson fathered Hemings' children.
</P>
<P>
   Hemings herself was the half-sister of Jefferson's wife, and
three-quarters white. The children she bore by Jefferson were
seven-eighths white, yet they were enslaved until Jefferson's death
in 1826.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the fractions seem silly. But they aren't, because race
and racial identity are still at the core of American life.
</P>
<P>
   That's where producer Thomas Lennon and guest correspondent
Shelby Steele, a well-known author and fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, make this ``Frontline'' so
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' visits Virginia, where the Monticello Association
will meet this weekend for another discussion about conceding that
Hemings' descendants are part of the official Jefferson family.
</P>
<P>
   But the provocative part of the 90-minute program is in Ohio,
where generations of Hemings descendants have resided since the
early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   They live, in effect, in separate clans. There are ``white''
Hemings and ``black'' Hemings. It's a matter of self-identification
more than physical traits. Some of the ``black'' Hemings have blond
hair. Some of the ``white'' Hemings choose to conceal their African
American lineage.
</P>
<P>
   They're the living legacy of a long-lasting but historically
murky affair between a white slaveholder and his mixed-race lover.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's own conflicts over race and his refusal to admit the
obvious _ he never openly acknowledged that he fathered Hemings'
children _ are echoed among his descendants two centuries later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline'' finds one family, named Cooper, painfully divided
over two sisters' recent discovery of their black heritage. At
least one of the sisters is eager to seek out her relatives among
the ``black'' Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't. The sisters' father, descended from Jefferson and
Hemings, has lived as a white man his entire life. He wouldn't talk
to ``Frontline''; the program even blurs his face in photos. Like
his famous ancestor, he is safeguarding a racial secret.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Frontline'' becomes, increasingly, Steele's personal
essay. He ponders skin shadings _ black, white, light-skinned
black. He notes that Jefferson himself tried to devise a
mathematical formula for how many generations it takes to cross
racial lines. What makes someone white or black? Why must we choose
a racial identity?
</P>
<P>
   Steele wonders why it all matters, but never if. In this country
it does matter, positively or negatively, in Jefferson's time and
today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Frontline'' closes on an upbeat note from Steele, who
co-wrote and narrates the program.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of Jefferson's hypocrisy and tacit denial was
procreation and possibly love. The flip side of the Cooper family's
anguish is that most of the Hemings descendants embrace and
celebrate their ties to Jefferson, Hemings and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this story shows the pains caused by racial identity,''
Steele says, ``it also shows that they are finally not enough to
keep us from being human.''

STONE &AMP; WEBSTER STOCK OFF 53 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Shares in Stone &AMP; Webster Inc. fell 53 percent Monday,
a day after the company disclosed a cash crunch that has forced it
to put most of its assets up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the engineering and construction firm said a cost
overrun at one project has created liquidity problems, forcing it
to restate 1999 results and to try and renegotiate payments. If its
efforts aren't successful, the company said, its accountants think
its ``ability to continue as a going concern will be brought into
question.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems could also lead to default with lenders including
Bank of America, though Stone &AMP; Webster said it exepcts to enter
into a ``forbearance agreement'' with banks in case of such an
event.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster stock closed Monday at $6.25 on the New York
Stock Exchange, down $6.9375. The stock was trading as high as
$28.625 a share in September _ still far below its record high of
$54.875 reached in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster is best known as a builder of power plants but
has struggled in the competitive industry in recent quarters. To
raise cash, it had already agreed to sell its office building in
downtown Boston and put its refrigerated-storage business up for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Tobias Levkovich said
bankruptcy ``is a possibility'' for Stone &AMP; Webster if it can't
arrange a sale or some other extensive partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a real confidence crisis in the business,'' said
Levkovich, who said the company could have troubles drumming up new
contracts. ``I wouldn't be brave and buy the stock here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster wouldn't say with whom it is holding talks to
sell assets including its engineering and construction business,
the majority of the company. Boise, Idaho-based Morrison Knudsen
Corp. had previously explored a purchase of Stone &AMP; Webster but
opted to buy Raytheon Co.'s engineering and construction business
instead last month. A spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Levkovich mentioned Fluor Corp. of Aliso Viejo, Calif. and
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. of Pasadena, Calif. as possible
bidders; spokesmen for both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's $6.25 closing price, the company has a total market
value of about $89 million. In its results for the three months
ended March 31, the company listed total assets of $888 million and
shareholders' equity of $320 million.
</P>
<P>
   But even before the most recent cost overrun, related to work on
an undisclosed domestic power project, Stone &AMP; Webster's cash
position had fallen dramatically. It listed $36.9 million in cash
and equivalents at the end of March, down from $106.5 million at
the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Stone &AMP; Webster spokesman said the company plans to file
restated 1999 earnings within several weeks. The company had about
7,000 employees worldwide late last year, but now has about 4,100
employees, apparently related to the completion of several major
projects, the spokesman said.

BROKAW WARNS OF RAPID CHANGES IN NEWS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw suggested Monday that rapid
changes in the technological and economic models for journalism are
hurtling the news business at ``warp speed'' to a largely unknown
destination.
</P>
<P>
   One perhaps surprising consequence, Brokaw and a panel of
broadcast executives agreed, is that in the new media world _
marked by mega-conglomerates, print and broadcast partnerships,
digital anchors, all-news cable networks, and the rampaging
Internet _ the consumer is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental shift . . . in the relationship between
those of us conveying the news and people who are receiving it, a
shift toward giving individual consumers a choice,'' said ABC News
president David Westin, who recently endured a journalistic flap
over ABC's use of actor Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President
Clinton. ``I think audiences have said we want to make those
choices, and I don't think that's reversible.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the future of media took place as part of the
International Press Institute's World Congress in Boston. The other
panelists included CNN International president Eason Jordan, Voice
of America director Sanford Unger, Henrikas Yushkiavitshus,
assistant director-general for Communication, Information and
Informatics at UNESCO, and Anne-Margrete Wachtmeister,head of the
Media Unit, Competition Directorate General, at the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a similar theme in a lunchtime speech at the
conference, New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the
``challenges for us are as complex and demanding as anything we
have seen in the past five decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want ``instant information gratification,'' Sulzberger
added.
</P>
<P>
   During the panel, Voice of America's Unger highlighted that
concern by saying the challenge of new media ``is how to revise,
innovate, and modernize news programming without losing the
authority of the news programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw prodded the participants on that point, asking Westin
whether the DiCaprio episode suggests that programming that is
``popular'' and ``profitable'' is edging out serious news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Leonardo DiCaprio issue is an interesting and
challenging issue but at a different level than was discussed in
the press,'' Westin responded. ``If we stand still, we will be
passed by. That means, I think, that we have to take chances.
Ironically in this new world, some failure . . . is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brokaw asked about the impact of CNN's falling ratings,
Jordan responded that doing the ``right thing'' journalistically is
more important than the numbers. ``Your ratings slip a bit, that's
life.'' But he acknowledged the suddenly crowded universe of
instant news, saying ``we're not just competing with Fox News and
the MSNBC's, we are competing with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate news synergy _ most evident in NBC's partnerships with
cable news networks CNBC and the MSNBC _ is proving to be another
mixed blessing, said the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content becomes a kind of tyrant . . . and reduces the
opportunity then to make an investment in other long-term
projects,'' because of the endless appetite for instant news,
Brokaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Westin lauded ``NBC's business model in the news area,'' but
said ``the real danger . . . is turning news into a commodity.'' In
an brief interview, Westin said ABC is ``exploring actively''
partnerships with regional cable news networks. NECN station
manager Charles Kravetz confirmed Monday that his station has
engaged in preliminary talks with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   During his address, Sulzberger stressed the difference between
news delivery and news integrity. While affirming that ``we are
committed to transmitting the news any way our customers prefer,''
he added that ``the more information that is available, the more
likely it is that people will turn to information they consider
reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also acknowledged the strains of the instant information
age, saying that although journalists ``continue to profess belief
in our basic principles, some of our practices have gotten a little
shaky.''

RIGHTS CONCERNS FOLLOW EXPULSION OF ELECTION MONITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The expulsion of a US-based human rights official
from Mexico is raising concerns that the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party may hinder foreign monitoring of the hotly
contested July 2d presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Lewis, Mexico director of Global Exchange, a human rights
and elections observation group based in San Francisco, was ordered
out of the country by immigration officials on April 9 after he
arrived in the western city of Guadalajara. Lewis was on his way to
Mexico City to inquire about the 35 visas that the group was
promised, but has not yet received, for a pre-election visit later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's expulsion has raised concerns at Mexico's Federal
Electoral Institute, the independent agency responsible for
coordinating this year's election and credentials for international
observers. The institute, formerly a government agency, was given
autonomy in 1996 to ensure its impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the government is taking a hard line against
international observers because they're worried we might get good
information that would mess up their game plans,'' Lewis said
Monday by telephone from California.
</P>
<P>
   This year's presidential campaign is the tightest in recent
history. Opposition candidate Vicente Fox of the conservative
National Action Party, perceived as the hands down winner of last
week's presidential debate, poses the strongest challenge to
unseating the PRI, which has controlled Mexico's presidency for 71
years. In polls conducted before the debate, Fox trailed PRI
candidate Francisco Labastida by 2 to 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many residents and experts fear the PRI _
despite its pledges to support fair and open elections _ may resort
to its historical use of vote-buying and other fraudulent tactics
to boost Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference last week with civic organizations, Jaime
Cardenas, one of the Federal Electoral Institute's board members,
said the Global Exchange problem was sending a disturbing signal
about democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried that the Interior Secretariat, through
immigration officials, is putting up obstacles for foreign
oberservers,'' Cardenas said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogelio Gomez, director of Civic Alliance, a political watchdog
group, said the government's actions were ``highly troublesome in
the midst of an electoral campaign,'' and warned that the chances
of government pressure on voters will increase as the election
draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the third presidential election in Mexico to
have international observers. Official delegations began monitoring
in 1994. So far this year, the Mexican electoral institute has
issued accreditations to about 70 observers and expects the number
to increase to 1,000 by election day.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, immigration officials emphatically deny that
Lewis' expulsion from the country was politically motivated or that
the government was trying to control foreign observers. But
authorities have offered different explanations for rejecting his
entry in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One immigration spokeswoman told the Associated Press last week
that Lewis had abused previous visas by making unauthorized visits
to Chiapas state, an area where government troops have been
fighting armed insurgents for six years. Authorities in the past
have expelled some human rights officials believed to be
sympathetic to the Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But another immigration official, Jose Angel Pescador Osuna,
said Lewis had lied to authorities in Guadalajara by arriving on a
tourist visa and then telling officers he was going to perform work
as a human rights and election observer _ activities which require
a special visa, which could not be granted for another 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's false that there exists some hostility against Lewis and
Global Exchange . . . or that the Interior Ministry is putting
obstacles before international observers,'' Pescador wrote in a
letter published Saturday in the Mexico City daily La Jornada.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he traveled to Mexico after being told by the Mexican
consulate in San Francisco that there was still no word about visas
for a Global Exchange delegation visit this month. The delegation
is expected to check for evidence of pre-election vote-buying,
media fairness and the use of government resources to manipulate
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who has been accredited by the electoral agency, was
taken aside by immigration officers at the Guadalajara
International Airport upon arriving from San Francisco. After
several hours of interrogation, he said, he was refused entry and
was told to take a flight back to San Jose.

HARVARD MED TO PARTICIPATE IN AETNA WEB HEALTH SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School has agreed to provide consumer
health-care information to Aetna US Healthcare's InteliHealth Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna hopes to draw on the school's expertise to broaden its Web
site, www.intelihealth.com, including more information targeting
minority consumers and the health needs of children.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to be completed
within the next several weeks, were not disclosed. A spokesman said
Monday the medical school does not intend to take an ownership
stake in InteliHealth.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Medical School will replace Johns Hopkins University,
which since 1996 has offered consumer advice, reviews, and articles
written by InteliHealth staff. The relationship ended shortly after
Aetna announced plans to expand its Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future business interests were not going in the same
direction,'' said Steve Libowitz, director of Hopkins' office of
consumer health information.
</P>
<P>
   Libowitz declined to elaborate, but health-care analyst Ken
Abramowitz speculated that Johns Hopkins, which had owned a
minority stake in InteliHealth, did not want to invest more money
in the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually disputes involve two issues: money or capability,''
said Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York.
``I suspect that Johns Hopkins did not want to put more money in.''
</P>
<P>
   The InteliHealth Web site has more than 1 million visitors each
month and licensing agreements with more than 400 broadcast, print,
and other media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Internet business, attracting more visitors and
revenue does not necessarily lead to profits. And so far,
health-care sites like Drkoop.com have struggled with ballooning
losses and wary investors. Aetna does not release InteliHealth's
financial results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear whether there's a sustainable business model in
putting up large numbers of advertisements and providing free
information,'' said Dr. William Hersh, head of the medical
informatics division at Oregon Health Sciences University.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and other insurers, however, may have a better shot at
becoming large providers of online health-care information, Hersh
said. Unlike sites like Drkoop.com, they can provide consumers with
more services and products.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say both insurers and their content
providers, like Harvard Medical School, will need to be careful to
avoid potential conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me this represents potential good, in a
sense that more information is made available to the lay public,''
said Benjamin Moulton, executive director of the American Society
of Law, Medicine &AMP; Ethics. ``But it also represents some conflict
issues that should be well thought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Gibbons, a spokesman for Harvard Medical School, said the
school will have ``strict editorial content'' and control over the
placement of advertisements next to its name.
</P>
<P>
   At Johns Hopkins University, professors, nurses and doctors
reserved the right to review and correct any inaccuracies in
Intelihealth's articles.

FROM ECCENTRIC TO MICROMANAGER TO DOMINATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 7)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Hague, leader of the Tory opposition in the House of
Commons, rose to denounce the prime minister: ``Tony Blair is the
 &UR; control freak &LR;  who has lost control.'' In an editorial about the
devolution of power to Wales, Britain's Daily Telegraph noted,
``Tony Blair has acknowledged that he has occasionally acted like
the  &UR; control freak &LR;  his opponents accuse him of being.''
</P>
<P>
   The charge has equal puissance on this side of the Atlantic. The
Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, used the phrase to describe
his Republican counterpart, Trent Lott. And during the recent
presidential primary elections, The Austin American-Statesman
quoted an unidentified aide to Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona as
derogating Sen. John McCain in these words: ``The senator gets very
heated about things. He's a  &UR; control freak &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The favored political attack phrase means ``one obsessed by the
need to dominate; a person driven by the urge to be in total
command.'' It is not as serious a blast as ``totalitarian'' and
does not carry the sexual overtone of ``dominatrix,'' but _ by
suggesting the control is for control's sake rather than for any
rational purpose _ imputes more neuroticism than ``micromanager.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because  &UR; control &LR;  as a noun has become a double-edged
sword. To be  &UR; out of control &LR;  is to approach what used to be called
``raving mad,'' but at the other extreme is the grim-faced,
white-knuckled  &UR; control freak &LR; , with his obsession to extend
untrammeled authority into every detail of others' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the meaning of the slang noun  &UR; freak &LR;  _ first
recorded in Finley Peter Dunne's 1895 ``Mr. Dooley'' in The Chicago
Evening Post as ``the deluded ol'  &UR; freak &LR; '' _ has also been getting
quirkier with the passage of time. A century ago, it meant
``eccentric'' or ``abnormal,'' as in the carnival  &UR; freak show &LR; 
exploiting specimens of obesity or dwarfism, and later as an
adjectival synonym for ``aberrational,'' ``deviant'' or ``hard to
imagine,'' as in `` &UR; freak &LR;  accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, it was adopted in drug lingo as a verb,  &UR; to freak
out &LR; , meaning ``to rave under the influence of hallucinatory
drugs.'' It was then applied as a noun in  &UR; speed freak &LR;  and  &UR; acid
freak &LR; . In his 1977 book, ``Dispatches,'' Michael Herr, who had
covered the Vietnam War for Esquire magazine, applied the term
 &UR; control freak &LR;  to ``one of those people who always ... had to know
what was coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   The term became favored by Hollywood screenwriters and producers
dealing with that war; it was repeated in the 1978 film ``The Deer
Hunter'' and in the 1979 ``Apocalypse Now.'' By 1986, the meaning
softened to ``enthusiast, aficionado, maven,'' and Steven Spielberg
freely confessed to TV Guide, ``I'm a  &UR; control freak &LR; .'' (In the
same way, language mavens call themselves  &UR; word freaks &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In current use, the meaning of the combination of  &UR; control &LR;  and
 &UR; freak &LR;  has veered toward ``neurotic.'' In The Boston Globe in
1992, Matthew Gilbert noted how crowds prized the singer Madonna's
`` &UR; control-freakishness &LR; .'' Writing four years later about Barbra
Streisand, The London Sunday Times could not decide whether she was
``America's greatest female singer or a power-mad woman whose
 &UR; control-freakishness &LR;  makes working with her all but impossible
save from a kneeling position.''
</P>
<P>
   That latest interpretation of  &UR; freakishness &LR;  as ``off the deep
end'' is why Daschle, when asked about his use of  &UR; control freak &LR; 
about Lott, hastily backed off: ``I say it in a light-hearted way.
I don't mean he is a  &UR; freak &LR; . I'm just saying he's a  &UR; control
nut &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   In Senate rhetoric, evidently  &UR; nut &LR;  is far less pejorative than
 &UR; freak &LR; . That reflects general usage; to be  &UR; nutty &LR;  is to be mildly
crackbrained and is often used in self-description of too-earnest
advocacy: I readily call myself a ``privacy  &UR; nut &LR; ,'' but would not
flagellate myself as a ``privacy  &UR; freak &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; nut &LR;  is a  &UR; freak &LR;  you kind of like. Loosey-goosey descriptive
lexicographers, with their anything-goes passivity, deride
prescriptive pop grammarians like me as  &UR; control freaks &LR; , but I
look bemusedly at those roundheeled dictionary writers as
common-usage  &UR; nuts &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RIGHT'S WORDS
</P>
<P>
   William F. Buckley announced last month that he has decided to
give up public speaking; in its stead, this pioneering practitioner
of self-mocking rodomontade has endowed his conservative followers
with ``Let Us Talk of Many Things'' (Forum/Prima, $30), a
high-stylish compilation of 50 years of piquant and literate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches show his easy way of teaching as if in passing. ``I
shall not introduce _ the rhetoricians call this  &UR; paralepsis &LR;  _ the
wonderful woman sitting, appropriately, on my left, Mrs. Robert
Kennedy.'' This is a device of emphasis by pretending to omit (the
old ``to say nothing of'' and ``not to mention'' trick). When you
 &UR; paralep &LR;  like that, but then call attention to your own
emphasis-by-omission, you're subtly instructing.
</P>
<P>
   He also provokes you to teach yourself. Buckley is known for his
delight in using unfamiliar words. He referred to Henry Kissinger
and ``one truth no one can challenge: the petrology of our
association.'' I had to look it up:  &UR; Petrology &LR;  is the study of the
structure of rocks.
</P>
<P>
   So why not say ``the rock-solid quality of our association''?
Because the speaker sometimes wants to push his audience a little.
He is saying: Go look up the word _ work on it a little _ and then
you won't forget it or my point.
</P>
<P>
   He's made those of us in the word trade stretch. ``There is
pleasure in even a little progress,'' he said in tribute to the
conservative thinker James Burnham, ``even among those of us
taught, at our mother's knee, not to seek to immanentize the
eschaton.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eschatology &LR;  is the study of ultimate destiny, the purpose of
life reckoned at the last accounting. The  &UR; eschaton &LR;  is its Greek
root: the last thing, the divinely ordained climax of history, with
its present sense of a final judgment that should inform our lives.
That's the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; immanentize &LR; ? The Latin  &UR; immanere &LR; , ``to remain in,'' leads
us to  &UR; immanent &LR; , ``inherent, intrinsic,'' with a special
philosophical sense of ``confined to the mind.'' It's not a word I
would use, because  &UR; inherent &LR;  does the job and  &UR; immanent &LR;  is too
easily confused with  &UR; imminent &LR; , ``about to take place,'' with a
connotation of danger.
</P>
<P>
   So I admitted defeat and called Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The source of  &UR; immanentize the eschaton &LR;  is the 1952 `New
Science of Politics,' by Eric Voegelin,'' he explained. ``It's a
warning against taking ultimate reality and treating it
pantheistically, rather than as an objective philosophical
phenomenon.'' The conservative pioneer added: ``It was turned into
a bumper sticker by the Young Americans for Freedom. Delicious,
don't you think?''

BROKAW WARNS OF RAPID CHANGES IN NEWS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw suggested Monday that rapid
changes in the technological and economic models for journalism are
hurtling the news business at ``warp speed'' to a largely unknown
destination.
</P>
<P>
   One perhaps surprising consequence, Brokaw and a panel of
broadcast executives agreed, is that in the new media world _
marked by mega-conglomerates, print and broadcast partnerships,
digital anchors, all-news cable networks, and the rampaging
Internet _ the consumer is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fundamental shift . . . in the relationship between
those of us conveying the news and people who are receiving it, a
shift toward giving individual consumers a choice,'' said ABC News
president David Westin, who recently endured a journalistic flap
over ABC's use of actor Leonardo DiCaprio to interview President
Clinton. ``I think audiences have said we want to make those
choices, and I don't think that's reversible.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the future of media took place as part of the
International Press Institute's World Congress in Boston. The other
panelists included CNN International president Eason Jordan, Voice
of America director Sanford Unger, Henrikas Yushkiavitshus,
assistant director-general for Communication, Information and
Informatics at UNESCO, and Anne-Margrete Wachtmeister,head of the
Media Unit, Competition Directorate General, at the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a similar theme in a lunchtime speech at the
conference, New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the
``challenges for us are as complex and demanding as anything we
have seen in the past five decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want ``instant information gratification,'' Sulzberger
added.
</P>
<P>
   During the panel, Voice of America's Unger highlighted that
concern by saying the challenge of new media ``is how to revise,
innovate, and modernize news programming without losing the
authority of the news programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw prodded the participants on that point, asking Westin
whether the DiCaprio episode suggests that programming that is
``popular'' and ``profitable'' is edging out serious news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Leonardo DiCaprio issue is an interesting and
challenging issue but at a different level than was discussed in
the press,'' Westin responded. ``If we stand still, we will be
passed by. That means, I think, that we have to take chances.
Ironically in this new world, some failure . . . is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brokaw asked about the impact of CNN's falling ratings,
Jordan responded that doing the ``right thing'' journalistically is
more important than the numbers. ``Your ratings slip a bit, that's
life.'' But he acknowledged the suddenly crowded universe of
instant news, saying ``we're not just competing with Fox News and
the MSNBC's, we are competing with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate news synergy _ most evident in NBC's partnerships with
cable news networks CNBC and the MSNBC _ is proving to be another
mixed blessing, said the participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content becomes a kind of tyrant . . . and reduces the
opportunity then to make an investment in other long-term
projects,'' because of the endless appetite for instant news,
Brokaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Westin lauded ``NBC's business model in the news area,'' but
said ``the real danger . . . is turning news into a commodity.'' In
an brief interview, Westin said ABC is ``exploring actively''
partnerships with regional cable news networks. NECN station
manager Charles Kravetz confirmed Monday that his station has
engaged in preliminary talks with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   During his address, Sulzberger stressed the difference between
news delivery and news integrity. While affirming that ``we are
committed to transmitting the news any way our customers prefer,''
he added that ``the more information that is available, the more
likely it is that people will turn to information they consider
reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also acknowledged the strains of the instant information
age, saying that although journalists ``continue to profess belief
in our basic principles, some of our practices have gotten a little
shaky.''

N.H. SEX OFFENDERS SEEK HAVEN IN MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The traffic across New England's state borders may be driven by
more than 6 percent sales tax or liquor stores' blue laws:
Personnel at New Hampshire's sex offender registry say convicted
offenders are moving to Maine to avoid registering their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Robert McMurray, who oversees the 250 offenders listed
in Manchester, N.H., said since the fall, several offenders had
called to deactivate their files and told him outright that moved
because they would not have to register in Maine because their
crime took place before September 1999. To State Trooper Jill
Rocky, who oversees the New Hampshire registry, the gap between the
two states' laws is large enough to seriously undermine the premise
of sex offender registries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep track of these people, but we're doing it
in a way that allows them to play the system,'' Rocky said.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts from across the border came as news to Maine law
enforcement officers, who say they have seen no evidence that the
number of sex offenders in Maine has been increasing. And some
dismissed the suggestion that Maine has earned an underground
reputation as a comfortable place for convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Julie Ann O'Brien, Republican of Augusta, was so
disturbed to hear of the offenders' comments that she spent a day
trying to figure out how to bring the states' laws into closer
agreement _ most likely, she said, by broadening Maine's registry
to include crimes committed before 1999. New Hampshire registers
all convictions since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it's happening, or if it's happening en
masse,'' said O'Brien, who sponsored a tougher registry law last
September. ``But I firmly believe that if it's enough for police
detectives to bring it up, it's enough of a problem that we need to
close any loopholes we might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine and New Hampshire's uneven state laws, like 48 others,
issued from one source: the 1994 murder of 7-year-old Megan Kanka,
who was raped and strangled by a repeat offender who lived on her
street. Congress passed a version of Megan's Law in 1997, requiring
that past convictions be made public, but left the states to pass
detailed laws of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky, of the New Hampshire sex offender registry, said the
patchwork of laws is playing right into the hands of pedophiles _ a
highly mobile population skilled at manipulating the system, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And others say local police departments should be doing the work
of monitoring convicted offenders anyway. Portland police chief
Michael Chitwood said his department had done 16 ``neighborhood
notifications'' in the past two years in cases where the offender
was not required to register.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offended by (the suggestion that) Maine is a place where
sex offenders can enjoy life `the way life should be.' I can just
speak for the city of Portland, but that's not the case here,''
Chitwood said. ``I don't buy that. No, not at all.''

ADVERTISING: CHURCH'S FRIED CHICKEN SERVES UP OFFBEAT TELEVISION
COMMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cliff Freeman and partners _ known for offbeat commercials like
``Where's the Beef?'' for Wendy's International and ``Pizza!
Pizza!'' for Little Caesar's Pizza _ is now serving up a television
campaign for Church's Fried Chicken that comically depicts the
gritty dinner hour of working-class families, with a sarcastic
twist.
</P>
<P>
   The new commercials center on working families who are about to
eat supper when a family member does something outrageous to avoid
having to eat the family meal. In one spot, the grandfather of the
house shows up naked, while in another a little boy lights up a
cigarette so he will be sent away from the table. The commercials
typically show close-ups of the family's dinner _ a slab of meat,
some kind of overcooked canned vegetable and lumpy potatoes or
noodles __ followed by the slogan ``Maybe it's your cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is a departure in advertising because it attempts
to depict working families as real and not as they usually appear
in advertising: great-looking and in settings that the average
working family doesn't live in and can't afford. Instead, these are
obviously tired-looking people often living in cramped Archie
Bunker-quality housing. The spots are also made to look real by
appearing at first to be a film clip, rather than a commercial. The
spots are devoid of music or other commercial techniques, save for
a delicious looking product shot at the end and a voice-over that
says ``Church's, it's what made from scratch should taste like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought was that it would be refreshing to make it almost
like a clip from a movie without a lot of the usual commercial
cues,'' said Cliff Freeman, the ad agency's chairman and chief
creative officer. ``In our researching, we found that it works,
people are sucked in to this almost slice-of-life drama, and then
surprised and have a laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said using an element of surprise is in vogue right now,
as witnessed by the success of movies like ``American Beauty'' and
``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a real yearning for the unexpected right now
because there's so much done in a genre and the unexpected is
tremendously rewarding for people. That's what's at work here,''
Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot called ``Bad Son'' a tired-looking mother who is
badly in need of a hairstyle is dropping some kind of lumpy noodle
concoction onto each family member's plates, as she instructs the
children to eat their peas. When the son lights up a cigarette, she
is stunned and asks her pockmarked and unshaven husband, who chases
him away from the table, ``What's wrong with him?'' right before
the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Another spot shows an obviously beleaguered middle-aged man who
comes home in the pouring rain to a cramped house where the
couches, table and even the lamp shade is encased in plastic. His
prim, aging overwrought wife sobs that she slaved over his meal _
which a close-up reveals to be overcooked meat loaf and canned
vegetables _ and then asks if he's having an affair with his new
secretary. She learns maybe it's her cooking when her husband
bluntly replies: ``I don't have a secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising, Freeman said, is designed to help relieve any
guilt about buying prepared food to bring home to eat. Research
showed Church's that its customers are the kind of people who still
view a home-cooked meal as a big daily responsibility. Church's
customers tend to be working and lower middle income white,
African-American and Latino consumers who live mostly in urban
areas. Church's, a unit of Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises Inc., has
1,178 locations in 30 states, with a heavy concentration in the
South. Its menu offerings include what it calls comfort foods, like
fried chicken, okra and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the spots may be so true to life as to be
uncomfortable, said Barbara Lippert, advertising critic for Adweek
Magazine, an industry trade publication. She noted that sitcoms and
cartoons often depict the working class in less than ideal ways,
but the lower middle-class population is not used to being depicted
in commercials in such a graphic way. She said the approach might
be risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to make fun of those obviously aspirational spots for
being overly glossy and phony,'' she said. ``But maybe sometimes
that is necessary. Reality can be pretty bleak, but maybe that's my
own elitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Haley, Church's chief marketing officer, said the spots
tested well during focus groups with consumers. Church's
franchises, which represent about 60 percent of all restaurant
units, applauded the spots at a recent meeting, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The ads also have a strategic imperative: to get the chain
noticed in an industry that is overshadowed by Kentucky Fried
Chicken, which has more than half the fast-food chicken market.
Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of Tricon Global Restaurants Inc.,
had 1999 sales of $4.4 billion, compared with fifth-ranked
Church's, with $655 million in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said with just a $15 million budget, Church's does not
have the luxury to do the kind of feel-good image advertising that
is so popular in the fast-food business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads are very different, and we believe very engrossing,
very real and even gritty in feel, and that's very absorbing,''
Haley said. ``In our focus groups, people laughed even more when
the bubble is burst and they realize all this family drama is about
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley is also known for taking calculated risks. He was in
charge of marketing at Jack in the Box when the company brought
back its Jack character with the happy face head on a real man's
body. The campaign was a hit and is still running.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said his company deliberately chose Cliff Freeman because
of the agency's reputation for creating advertising that gets
noticed despite huge competitors. He pointed to the attention the
agency got for its famous Wendy's ``Where's the beef?'' commercials
with Clara Peller, in the face of giants like McDonald's and Burger
King. More recently, Freeman has won attention for its campaigns
for Staples and for the Budget Rent a Car Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also fits Church's trailblazing and successful
strategy of reclaiming locations in urban working class
neighborhoods, said Richard L. Papiernik, financial editor of
Nation's Restaurant News, an industry trade publication. He said a
generation ago, many fast-food outlets, including Church's, left
urban neighborhoods, and they were replaced by Chinese restaurants.
Church's has been returning to those markets over the last five
years, sometimes replacing Chinese takeout stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church's is building an urban market and has been one of the
real leaders in that whole field,'' Papiernik said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the campaign is part of a broader re-imaging of Church's
brand, which also includes some new products, a new logo and a
contemporary redesign of the restaurants, said Haley.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is airing in markets around the country on networks
such as UPN and Fox, and in Spanish-language television. And what
of the people who might shudder at the characters in Church's
campaign as not exactly people with whom you want to go out to
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really upscale target doesn't consume mass food in general
very much and fried chicken to an even lesser degree, so we're not
overly concerned,'' Haley said. ``We showed the advertising to our
target audience and they responded very favorably and that's our
primary concern.''

DEFINING TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The State Department's annual report on international terrorism,
released Monday, merits criticism for its inconsistencies. But it
does sketch a useful picture of a threat that is in constant flux.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inherent difficulties of doing such a report stems
from the unending debate about how to define who is a terrorist.
The State Department does not hesitate to call the
Iranian-sponsored Lebanese Shi'ite militia Hezbollah a terrorist
organization because it plants bombs in southern Lebanon, targeting
Israeli soldiers or Israel's local proxies. When the Socialist
prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, called the Hezbollah
fighters terrorists, however, he was castigated in many quarters of
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Like the guerrilla fighters who train in Pakistan for operations
in Indian-occupied Kashmir or the People's Mujahedeen of Iran who
are headquartered in Iraq and conduct bombings and armed assaults
inside Iran, the Hezbollah are terrorists to some and freedom
fighters to others. For the State Department's report to earn
credibility, it should hew to a definition of terrorism that is
influenced as little as possible by shifting geopolitical
preferences or political opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   This report, like its predecessors, combines dispassionate rigor
with politicized shadings. It says that Syria is now a sponsor of
terrorism but will cease to be so if it makes peace with Israel.
The reality, however, is that the regime of Hafez Assad has
harbored not only anti-Israel groups but others that have targeted
Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, and the PLO.
</P>
<P>
   One lucid observation of the report is that the bloody and
protracted antiterrorist campaigns of Egypt and Algeria, in
combination with political tactics aimed at separating moderate
Islamic fundamentalists from more extreme groups, have greatly
reduced the level of internecine violence.
</P>
<P>
   The most questionable assertion of the report is that ``loose
networks'' rather than traditional state sponsors of terrorism now
represent the greatest threat worldwide. Iraq and Iran still have
the money and the state powers to do far more damage than any small
cluster of zealots.

DETROIT RALLYING THE CROWDS TO FILL OUT THE FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., W.Va., Ohio, Ill., D.C., Calif. Colo.)   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For more than a month, a giant pair of eyes has peered
down from a billboard along several of this city's expressways with
the warning: ``DETROIT All eyes are on You!''
</P>
<P>
   The billboard was intended to remind residents to mail their
2000 census forms. But the sign is also a stark symbol of a
decade-old fear that Detroit may become the first American city of
more than 1 million people to have its population fall below that
number. A study by the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments
has estimated the city's population at 970,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city, long dogged by its image as a rusting auto giant,
barely made it over the million marker in 1990, and then only after
a recount. Staying at a million is a point of pride.
</P>
<P>
   Census anxiety runs so deep here that Mayor Dennis Archer began
drafting his battle plan four years ago. He determined that a
couple of public appearances would not be enough. So he has taken
the unusual approach of treating the census like a political
candidate, stumping all over town on its behalf and imploring
residents to view their participation as a vote for Detroit's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we've got great American cities that have less than
a million people,'' Archer said, ``And certainly we're not going to
fall off into the Detroit River if we drop below a million. But I
don't want that to happen. It's a matter of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the city has draped itself in Census 2000
paraphernalia: 13,000 lawn signs, 10,000 bumper stickers and scores
of banners and billboards, all of which were paid for from its own
budget and are independent of the census bureau's promotion blitz.
There is so much census advertising here, it is easy to overlook
the few bumper stickers and banners promoting the presidential
candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   What is more striking here, at a time when census officials
nationally have been worried about low response and lack of
community involvement, is the grass-roots support the mayor's
effort has won. Thousands of people have turned out to his Call to
Action rallies and Census Sunday church meetings. Many _ including
schoolchildren _ have donned Census T-shirts and taken to the
streets promoting the census to anyone who will listen. At the
city's public schools, prizes were awarded to students who brought
their families' completed forms to on-site census coordinators. At
least 7,000 people have signed up to become ``Knowledgeable
Neighbors,'' an initiative that aims to draft one person on each of
Detroit's 11,000 city blocks who can help census counters get
information about neighbors who decline to open their doors. And
long before the government mailed out census forms, the mayor's
staff was out checking the list of addresses. They turned up 17,000
unregistered addresses, and 22,000 where the home had either been
demolished or abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many cities are working with us to make sure they're on top of
the count,'' said Dwight Dean, head of the Census Bureau's Detroit
region, which oversees operations in Michigan, Ohio and West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't seen a city put in the kind of emotional energy
and human resources that Detroit is investing since the 1970s,''
said Dean, who has also assisted in census mobilization efforts in
Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles and Denver. ``The mayor has the
whole city energized and ready to take personal ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are stepping up, too. At the mayor's request, several
of the city's top rival advertising agencies volunteered to create
a slogan (``Everybody Wins When You Mail It In) and a slick package
of accompanying television and radio ads. The price tag for such a
package is usually about a half million dollars, say advertising
executives. Owners of beauty salons and coffee shops have partially
converted their businesses into census information centers. Local
McDonald's owners offered unlimited meals throughout April to any
of the nearly 10,000 homeless people here who filled out a census
form and received a yellow ``I'm Important I've Been Counted'' pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Detroit's gone census crazy,'' said Lydia Bolgard,
an assistant at the Coalition of Temporary Shelter, one of
Detroit's largest homeless shelters. ``They've come in here with
census back packs, water bottles, you name it. They're really
taking this seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what has made the census such a priority here is the
memory of the 1990 census, which even the federal government now
concedes undercounted several million people across the country. At
the time, Mayor Coleman Young was so angered by the government's
count, which pegged Detroit's population below 1 million, that he
discarded it and conducted his own census. After his staff found
more than 100,000 more people, the official U.S. census count was
adjusted to 1,027,974.
</P>
<P>
   Equally pressing for Detroit was the fact that its population
has steadily dropped since 1960, though never below a million. And
because some federal aid is based on population, every uncounted
person is a $3,000 loss for the city. Besides that, under a state
law, the city stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in aid
if it dipped below 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of Archer's planning, the law was rewritten, as
part of a 1998 package of revenue sharing concessions, which
lowered the population requirement to 750,000 and left Detroit with
the authority to increase taxes should its population dip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit's great digit scare is over,'' said Patricia Becker,
executive director of the Southeast Michigan Census Council, an
independent demography consultant. ``If the population is six
digits or seven, it doesn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, in the eyes of those who live here. ``This is
the Motor City, Motown,'' boasts Maggie Jene Resor, a longtime
resident and census partnership specialist. She is the census
liaison to the city's religious and elderly outreach committee.
``We've given too much to the world to be known as the city that
couldn't keep a million people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is both tangible and anecdotal evidence that Archer's
approach may be working. Sixty percent of the census forms mailed
to the city's 400,000 housing units were returned by the federal
government's April 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   That's up 3 percentage points over 1990. U.S. Census Director
Ken Prewitt said he believed the increase was the result of the
Archer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit is easily in the top half dozen in terms of the
quality of effort and commitment that they've put into this,'' said
Dr. Ken Prewitt. ``They've proven they don't intend to repeat the
1990 census.'' Census counters have until July 7 to find the people
who have not responded by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it was taboo to even speak of the census in
Southwest Detroit, a largely Mexican enclave and home to many
illegal immigrants. Those who were familiar with it feared it, says
Maria Elena Rodriguez, president of the Mexicantown Community
Development Corp. But this time around, she said, the city and the
local census office have dispatched so many resources _ including
commissioning a mural _ and so many people to the neighborhood that
even some recent illegal arrival have become curious about the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we would have been so grossly undercounted in
1990 if they had done this kind of outreach,'' said Rodriguez. Her
organization estimates Detroit's Hispanic population at 70,000, a
marked difference from the 33,000 people counted in the 1990
census. ``By putting up a mural, going door to door, and sending
out radio and TV announcements in Spanish, the city has really made
the people feel like `Yes, you count, even if you are
undocumented.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Archer, a co-chair of the Democratic National Committee,
worries. For every breakthrough, a new hurdle awaits, like the
complaints that flooded into his office from residents upset that
their forms arrived with the address of a nearby suburb instead of
Detroit. When census officials explained that the forms were bar
coded and would be counted in Detroit's favor, it raised even more
suspicions, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to great lengths to assure people the information
is absolutely confidential; the I.N.S. can't get it, the FBI can't
get it. No one,'' he said. But he added, ``This city is 80 percent
people of color and because of that rich diversity a significant
part our population does not trust the federal government. It makes
it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is certain of this much: ``We've done everything we
know how to do to ensure that Detroit stands up and is counted.''

IT'S A LONG, FLAT DRIVE FROM HERE TO THE END OF CREATION  
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week brought us the usual ho-hum array of major scientific
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   More progress on mapping the human genome. New indications that
cloned cells could slow or reverse the aging process. Exciting
advances in the search for a replacement for Kathie Lee.
</P>
<P>
   One particular discovery captured my attention. It sounded like
it might be a riff from an old blues song: The Earth ain't flat,
baby, but the universe is.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you read the story. An international team of scientists,
using an ultra-sensitive telescope hovering above Antarctica, were
able for the first time to observe itsy bitsy ripples of something
called cosmic microwave background radiation.
</P>
<P>
   These ripples, as best I can tell from news accounts, are kind
of like cosmic dust bunnies. They're leftover particles of light
that have been skittering around on heaven's floor since the start
of the universe about 15 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I don't profess to understand all of this _ I was, uh, a couple
of gym credits short of a degree in astrophysics _ but scientists
say the pattern of ripples provides conclusive evidence that the
universe is shaped more like a pancake than, say, a hard-boiled
egg.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm more than a little disappointed.
What they're telling us is that all of creation is one long,
mind-numbingly flat drive. No hills, no stomach-plummeting dips, no
hairpin turns. Not even a tacky souvenir stand, apparently. It's
straightaway dull, from here to the edge of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   What a letdown. Where's the romance? Where's the adventure? Aye
carumba, where's the next exit? I wanna pull over and take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   As bluesy as this news was, however, it could well be the least
of our worries. I have in front of me a much more alarming
newspaper story about a whizbang new gizmo called the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like something you might see offered by Ronco on
late-night TV, but it's more than that. Much, much more. Some time
in May _ an exact date hasn't been set yet _ scientists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory intend to fire up the aforementioned
device on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to recreate what the universe looked like a few
milliseconds after it was formed. (Flat, but a lot less cluttered,
I'm guessing.)
</P>
<P>
   The collider will hurl subatomic particles at each other at
pretty close to the speed of light. The resulting boom-booms will
create temperatures of a trillion degrees, which is quite a bit
steamier than _ oh, let's see _ the center of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, this is happening. Sort of puts the New York
Senate race in perspective, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Sunday Times of London ran a piece speculating
that this super-duper supercollider could accidentally create a
black hole and suck up the entire universe at roughly the speed of
light. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger, according to the Times article, is that the
collider will generate ``strangelets,'' a new form of matter that
would transform everything it touches, also at the speed of light.
(Transform into what, exactly, the story doesn't say. I'd like to
be skinnier, with either a 100 mph fastball or a good head for
math, but I gather that's not the sort of thing they're talking
about.)
</P>
<P>
   Brookhaven's response to this public display of fretting was to
commission a group of physicists to contemplate doom and, more to
the point, the collider's relative ability to bring it about. They
studied it and reported there's no need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conclusion is that the candidate mechanisms for
catastrophic scenarios at RHIC are firmly excluded by existing
empirical evidence, compelling theoretical arguments, or both,''
the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Um, OK. Thanks for checking!
</P>
<P>
   The force of the collisions, according to Brookhaven's Web site
(www.rhic.bnl.gov), will cause no more impact than ``a mosquito
hitting a screen door on a summer evening.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a lovely image, but I prefer to think of it as a skeeter
brushing our necks as we drive our hopelessly overwhelmed selves
toward the edge of our flapjack-flat universe.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, I eagerly await news of what Brookhaven will
scrape off creation's screen door this month. We certainly live in
exciting times, don't we? Strangelet days, even.

 &HT;    Lewis lawyers win big point on allegations
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Defense attorneys for Ray Lewis scored a big victory
Monday when a Fulton County judge denied prosecution efforts to use
prior allegations of assault against Lewis in his upcoming murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of whether Lewis will be tried separately was put
off until later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner disallowed a bid by
prosecutors to enter into evidence three separate incidents in
which the football star allegedly struck women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same argument (that) if he did it before, he'll do
it again,'' Bonner said. ``I don't find the incidents sufficiently
similar'' to the attacks that occurred Jan. 31 where two men were
stabbed to death in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were attempting to show the incidents _ in which he
allegedly choked a girlfriend, scratched a woman and punched
another in a bar _ show a pattern of conduct and ``rebut his claim
that he was a peacemaker.'' Defense attorney Don Samuel called all
three allegations baseless.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in an unexpectedly quick session where the judge
upheld a police search of Lewis' Baltimore home but left unanswered
until later key issues as to whether Lewis gets tried separately
from his two co-defendants and if his statement to Atlanta police
should be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial against Lewis and his friends, Reginald Oakley and
Joseph Sweeting, is scheduled to start May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's lawyer, Bruce Harvey, renewed his request for Bonner to
grant immunity to Kwame King and Carlos Stafford, two men who were
with Lewis the night of the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey called the two men ``witnesses/participants'' and said
they can provide testimony to help clear his client. The men have
hired attorneys and have not talked to prosecutors or the defense.
Bonner postponed ruling, asking Harvey to show her if she has
authority to grant immunity to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearing, Bonner asserted control over the case.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered prosecutors to turn over evidence favorable to the
defense, reminded lawyers about a court-imposed gag order and even
scolded prosecutor Elizabeth Baker for not listening to her while
she spoke. Bonner also told prosecutors that they should now be
preparing their case for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys complained they are still getting evidence
from the prosecution, four weeks after the court-imposed deadline
for both sides to exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   Baker reminded Bonner that the speedy trial demand by defense
gave prosecutors less time than normal to prepare. She was not
swayed by that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time to stop investigating,'' said Bonner, 59,
who has been a Fulton judge for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The judge appeared to take a practical approach to motions,
mentioning that a prosecution effort to have the jury visit the
scene inside the Lincoln Navigator limousine at 4 a.m. may be
pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a convinced that going to the scene will be of
assistance to the jury, especially at four in the morning,'' Bonner
said.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutor Clint Rucker told the judge he could amend the
request so that jurors could visit the Buckhead scene ``when it's
dark,'' Bonner asked, ``Why didn't you do that in the first
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner wondered if the jury could simply be taken to see the
limo in the darkened courthouse parking lot. ``But my thought about
it is we can't make it 20 degrees and Super Bowl night,'' she said,
deferring her ruling until the trial is underway.
</P>
<P>
   The judge upheld a search of Lewis's Baltimore home, which the
defense characterized as ``overbroad,'' noting that police even
confiscated Lewis' little sister's photo album. Prosecutors
countered that Lewis had not been cooperative to police and they
were trying to find photos of potential suspects to include in
police lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, the flamboyant pony-tailed attorney, also filed a motion
to ``level the playing field'' _ allowing him to bypass the gag
order and hold a press conference. Harvey said that he was not
appointed until after lawyers were ordered to stop talking about
the case. And he pointed out that both Lewis's attorneys and
prosecutors had a field day beforehand courting the press.
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied his motion without comment.

 &HT;    Time could run out for S.C. flag compromise
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the raging row over the Confederate battle flag flying atop
South Carolina's State House dome, there's plenty of debating and
maneuvering left. There's just not much time.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly adjourns June 1, a quickly approaching
finish line for a chamber more comfortable at a tortoise's pace.
</P>
<P>
   While this week is crucial in determining whether the
controversial Civil War emblem remains over the South Carolina
Capitol, it also may be pivotal in shaping similar debates in
Georgia and Mississippi. The Palmetto State's Deep South cousins
incorporate the same battle design in their state flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't crank out something this session, the flag will be
flying for God knows how long,'' said Gilda Cobb-Hunter
(D-Orangeburg), House minority leader in South Carolina and a key
member of the legislative black caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the first day the House theoretically could open floor
debate on a bill that would remove the flag from the Capitol dome,
black legislators will try settling on a proposed amendment to a
Senate plan, which calls for the battle emblem to be flown at a
Confederate military memorial on the State House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, though, the floor debate will commence next week to
give both sides time to develop their plans, according to leaders
in the GOP-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders say the Confederate banner _ a red flag marked by
a sea-blue ``X'' with 13 white stars _ is a reminder of slavery and
white oppression. Flag supporters see it as a mark of battlefield
heroism and Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
started a boycott of South Carolina's $14.6 billion tourist
industry Jan. 1. The group said the sanctions would remain in
effect until legislators move the battle flag from the State House
dome.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP is stinging from an ironic political defeat Monday:
Gov. Jim Hodges signed a bill that creates a Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday in South Carolina _ the last state to officially recognize
King Day. The NAACP opposed the bill because it also establishes a
permanent holiday honoring Confederate Memorial Day on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   As for the flag, there's urgency to act now, Cobb-Hunter said,
because she doubts the fragile coalition of business leaders,
churches, Republicans and Democrats who want to move the flag will
last into next session. The state Senate already has passed a bill
that would remove the battle flag from the dome and both chambers
of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in South Carolina, the debate is creating
momentum for Georgia lawmakers who oppose the Confederate insignia
on the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   If South Carolina removes the battle flag, it would be a
``victory for America,'' said Georgia Rep. Tyrone Brooks
(D-Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do not,'' said Brooks, president of the Georgia
Association of Black Elected Officials, ``then I think we're going
to be hard-pressed over here to show the nation that we're smarter
than they are, that we can find some common ground, that we can do
the right thing and we can alleviate the necessity of Georgia being
faced with economic sanctions as South Carolina is suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brooks repeated his warning that civil rights groups,
including the NAACP and the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, would call for an economic boycott of the Peach State
if the General Assembly doesn't change the state flag next year. In
South Carolina, the primary debate is over where to relocate one of
the most recognizable symbols of Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of 26 black House members oppose the Senate's
proposal because it moves the flag to one of the most prominent
places in downtown Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb-Hunter, the House minority leader, is working for a
``healing waters'' display that flies the Confederate flag as one
of many in a new memorial behind the 37-foot marble tribute to
Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate plan is not the vehicle we need to use,''
Cobb-Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly the House begins debate may rest with the Rules
Committee, which can set a specific time to consider the bill. It
would take a two-thirds vote by the 15-member committee then a
majority vote by the House to start debate.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker David Wilkins (R-Greenville) and Rules Committee
Chairman Doug Smith (R-Spartanburg) today begin the formal process
of testing the will of committee members. Smith estimates he has a
``solid eight, possibly nine votes'' right now. Since some
Republicans refuse to support any compromise, Smith needs
Democratic support to pass a resolution to start debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what happens through the week,'' Smith said Monday.
``If a new compromise comes in and begins to erode the base of my
party, the Republican Party, then obviously whether we present a
Rules resolution is somewhat in question. I just don't see that a
compromise will be coming.''

   DISNEY-TIMEWARNER (Undated) _ Millions of television viewers
found themselves without access to ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs Monday as
the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt
Disney, fought over the cable television rights to stations owned
by Disney's ABC network. The dispute has its roots in an argument
over how much money Disney should receive for carrying its channels
on Time Warner's cable systems, but it involves larger issues
dealing with the distribution of media content _ including the
longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry,
the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and
Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online
and Time Warner. It also concerns how much power the new company
will wield in a television industry that is merged with the
Internet. By Bill Carter.

   NY-POLLUTION-CREDITS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The New York state
legislature has passed a bill that would radically reduce the
amount of air pollution that has for years drifted from Midwestern
and Southern states into New York. The bill would bar New York
companies from selling pollution credits they earned by cleaning up
their own smokestacks to polluters in other states. The legislation
directly challenges the 1990 Clean Air Act, which set up a
marketplace in which companies could trade the right to pollute in
the form of credits, as a commodity. Gov. George Pataki is expected
to sign the measure, which would make New York the first state to
ban these exchanges. By Raymond Hernandez.

KISSINGER WARNS OF WORLDWIDE UPHEAVAL AMID `ADJUSTMENTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger warned
media executives from around the world Monday that while advancing
human rights is a ``totally appropriate'' goal for democracies,
such crusades have the potential to cause massive upheaval without
achieving the desired results.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the world is headed ``into a period of great
turmoil. . .. As a result of globalization and technology, there
will be huge adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to 300 members of the International Press Institute
meeting at Boston's World Trade Center, Kissinger rejected the idea
that human-rights standards and practical foreign policy
considerations would necessarily conflict, but he said that the
problems confronting Western countries in the Balkans illustrate
the dangers of fuzzy thinking about rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maneuvered ourselves into a situation where we have
not really identified what objective we are serving'' in Kosovo, he
said, and are ``forcing three reluctant nationalities to live
together. . . in Bosnia, when that multiculturalism had failed in
Yugoslavia'' before the West became involved.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger later told faculty and students at Tufts University's
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy that ``statesmen have to
approach their objectives in stages; prophets try to achieve them
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only problem is,'' he said, his voice more gravelly than ever
as he approaches his 77th birthday, ``prophets have caused a lot
more suffering than statesmen because they produced crusades, and
declared all their opponents as evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade relations between the United States and China, currently
one of the hottest issues in US foreign policy, surfaced repeatedly
in the press institute discussion following Kissinger's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, who
clashed frequently with China over human rights issues in the
closing years of Britain's 150-year rule over the enclave, agreed
with Kissinger that human rights and trade issues ought to be
separated _ a position initially disdained and now embraced by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization
should be decided on trade and commercial grounds,'' Patten said.
Kissinger stressed that it took 400 years to develop democracy in
the West and said China should get some credit for evolving in a
positive direction, rather than being continually confronted with
absolutist demands.
</P>
<P>
   Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's representative to the United
Nations, challenged what he called the easy assumption that Western
societies engaged in human rights campaigns to benefit others, and
urged that ``you at least consider the possibility that there is
another point of view _ (that the human-rights issue) is a cynical,
self-serving instrument of foreign policy.'' The comment was
directed at foes of normalizing US trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China enters the WTO, it will be transformed in the same
way as other East Asian nations'' that were helped into the world
economic order by Western countries building alliances against Cold
War communism, Mahbubani said.
</P>
<P>
   For all his emphasis on gradualism and practicality, Kissinger
said leaders and foreign policy makers should recognize and react
to the the recent demonstrations against globalization in
Washington, Seattle, and foreign cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like these demonstrations, because I lived through
them in the Vietnam period and their ultimate objective is usually
to undermine the credibility of government,'' he said. ``Many of
the demonstrators don't know . . . what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``they have called attention to an important
problem which should be taken very seriously. . . . The globalized
world is only a small percentage of the global economy. In many
countries, we have a globalized upper level, a national middle
level, and an underclass level. All of these are going to express
themselves politically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-globalizers are calling attention to a real
problem,'' he said, ``and if that problem is not met, we will find
more and more resentments around the world.''

COMMENTARY: THE REAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The re-reopening of the final final-status talks between
Israelis and Palestinians in Eilat Monday provides an illuminating
snapshot of where Israeli-Arab negotiations are now. To put it
bluntly: The Palestinians want to say yes to a deal but are waiting
for the goods from Israel; and the Syrians, who have all the goods
they could want from Israel, don't know how to say yes.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian leaders know exactly what the outlines
of their deal will be: The Palestinians will get back 90 percent of
the West Bank and Gaza for their own state, and Israel will keep 10
percent _ the 10 percent of the West Bank where 80 percent of
Israeli settlers live. The big question is whether the Israeli and
Palestinian ruling coalitions can hold together for such a tough
compromise. Don't kid yourself _ we're approaching the moment of
truth here, and for both Israelis and Palestinians it could be a
moment of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   True, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, got off to a slow
start. For a general who said he was not much of a politician,
Barak spent a lot of time looking at polls. His clear preference
was also to get the Israeli-Syrian deal done first _ a deal for
which he had much more of an innate feel, because it is a deal
about how two armies live apart. The Israeli-Palestinian talks, by
contrast, are about how two communities live together. The
negotiations with the Palestinians required the development of
trust; the negotiations with the Syrians were built on the absence
of trust.
</P>
<P>
   But since Syria's president, Hafez Assad, stiffed President
Clinton in Geneva a few weeks ago, Barak has thrown himself into
the Palestinian talks. What happened with the Syrians was that
their foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, had indicated to the
Israelis and Americans that ``the lake'' _ that is, the Sea of
Galilee in northern Israel _ would remain entirely in Israel's
hands. When Assad met with Clinton, though, he insisted that the
northeastern shore and northeastern portion of the lake had been
Syria's before the 1967 war, and would have to be returned to
Syrian control along with the Golan Heights. Shara said the lake
was Israel's; Assad said the lake was Syria's; Barak said: ``You
can have the Golan back, but no lake. See you later. I'm going to
talk to the Palestinians.``
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Barak has made two key moves. First, he's buying off
the Shas ultra-Orthodox party, a key coalition partner. Shas'
religious schools are bankrupt and it desperately needs state
funds. Barak is offering Shas the money it wants _ if Shas agrees
to deliver its key votes to support any settlement Barak strikes
with the Palestinians. Barak is also moving toward giving Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, full control of the Palestinian
village of Abu Dis, which is just outside the boundary of Jerusalem
and could serve as the foundation for the Palestinians' own capital
in the Jerusalem area _ without Israel's having to redivide the
city in any way.
</P>
<P>
   These moves, which are already being resisted by all the
rightist parties in Israel, are aimed at pressuring Arafat to start
preparing Palestinians for their tough compromise. That means
preparing Palestinians for getting only 90 percent of the
territories back, not 100 percent; preparing them for getting only
a symbolic return of Palestinian refugees _ in the form of family
reunifications _ to pre-1967 Israel; and preparing them for having
their own Jerusalem _ which they can call by Jerusalem's Arabic
name, Al-Quds _ in Abu Dis, rather than in the old, eastern half of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat needs to find a way to take these Palestinian mantras _
Jerusalem, refugees, territory _ and redefine them in a way that
defuses them as political issues for the Israeli public,'' argues
Stephen Cohen of the Center for Middle East Peace. ``If he does
that, he can get 90 percent of the West Bank back, which, after all
these years of struggle, would be amazing. But Barak and the
Israeli people are going to have to be mature enough to understand
that these classic Palestinian mantras can't simply be thrown out
by Arafat, but must be reshaped in a way that Israelis and
Palestinians can both live with.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a test. This is the real deal. Completing it and
implementing it are going to be wrenching experiences for both
societies. Not doing so will be a disaster.

RELIEF GROUPS FEAR AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL FROM RED CROSS FEDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Concern is spreading among international relief
organizations that the American Red Cross may be on the verge of
withdrawing from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies because the umbrella organization has not agreed
to immediately admit an Israeli contingent under a star of David
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, under its new president, Dr. Bernadine
Healy, who took office in July, has already withheld $5 million in
dues from the international federation, based in Geneva, which
relief experts say was a significant blow to the organization from
its largest member. The federation serves as a secretariat for 176
national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of American participation in the international
federation is expected to be raised at a national conference of the
American Red Cross from May 19 to 21. Several requests for comment
from the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington were not
answered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   American contributions of about $350,000 are also being withheld
from the International Committee of the Red Cross, an independent,
Swiss-based organization that works among civilians in battle areas
and visits prisoners of war, among other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross and Red Crescent societies deal with disaster relief.
The two organizations, while sharing the general goals of one
humanitarian movement, are not related in any organizational way.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health,
who replaced Elizabeth Dole as Red Cross president last year, gave
almost immediate priority to a campaign for membership for the
Magen David Adom, or Red Shield of David, an organization whose
emblem is a six-pointed star. Red Cross officials say that it was
the United States, not Israel, that pressed the case strenuously in
meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Geneva, the International Committee, the
federation and representatives of governments reopened discussion
on the possibility of a neutral emblem that could serve as an
alternative for those countries _ not only Israel _ that did not
want to use the red cross or red crescent symbols. In the minds of
many, those symbols are linked with religious affiliation, although
the Red Cross argues that its symbol has no sectarian connotations
and is only the Swiss flag with colors reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lingering problem for decades,'' an aid official
said. Other nations have also asked to use their own symbols and
have been refused, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neutral symbols suggested in recent years is a red
diamond, within the outline of which other symbols could be
incorporated. But the step would not be easy to take because the
1949 Geneva conventions would have to be rewritten and a special
international conference called. Only three symbols have ever been
recognized, the red cross, the crescent and a red lion and sun,
which was used briefly by Iran before the overthrow of Shah
Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
</P>
<P>
   Healy criticized the inconclusive April meeting in Geneva and
has since renewed a demand for an immediate recognition of Israel's
Magen David Adom. A press release from the American Red Cross said
that the necessary diplomatic steps proposed to expand the use of
symbols would, in all likelihood, ``extend endlessly, with no
guaranteed solution for the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy's critics within the Red Cross movement, none of whom
would agree to be quoted, say that her hard line is related to
domestic American politics. Healy ran an abortive campaign for a
Senate seat from Ohio as a Republican in 1994, after her contract
at the National Institutes of Health was not renewed by President
Clinton, and her critics say she may be seeking to position herself
for another political race by making this a high-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, relief organizations say that they have been
told that Healy will soon announce the withdrawal of the American
Red Cross from the international federation and the end of support
for the International Committee, and will ask her organization's
national convention in Columbus, Ohio, to endorse these moves.

 &HT;    'Rational market' found to be not so rational
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investor psychology is getting scrutiny these days from the
business press as well as shrinks. They agree on one thing: The
``rational market'' isn't so rational after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A growing body of academic research _ in fields ranging from
psychiatry to anthropology _ explains market behavior in terms of
irrational urges,'' says Forbes (May 15). It cites findings by the
Journal of Psychology and Financial Markets, the first academic
journal devoted to investor psychology, that investors act ``more
like herds of agitated animals'' than rational individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes blames market madness in part on the increase in
individual investors and the relative ease of online trading, which
have made ``wild swings wilder and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For sensible investors,'' says Forbes, ``the upside of
widespread investor irrationality is the opportunities it presents
to capitalize on other people's missteps. The bad news: The chances
of your acting rationally are very slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Personal Finance (May) cites research that warns
against following your instincts because that undermines your
ability to invest wisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors trade too actively, cling to their losers, are
underdiversified and buy stocks that grab their attention,''
according to University of California researchers Terrance Odean
and Brad Barber.
</P>
<P>
   They found that most investors are overconfident and
overestimate what they know and how good they are at investing _
and that it afflicts everybody, even psychologists. One problem
with online investing, they say, is that the computer gives
investors an illusion of control that builds overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring academia
</P>
<P>
   U.S. colleges and universities once relied on a prestigious name
or winning football team to attract the nation's best and
brightest. Now, says Yahoo Internet Life (May), ``undergraduates
are as interested in a college's Net sources as in its curriculum
or social life.''
</P>
<P>
   Academia has responded: 98 percent allow prospective students to
apply electronically, 68 percent offer Web-based registration, 56
percent offer high-speed access in all classrooms, 41 percent offer
some wireless access on campus, 35 percent provide public computer
equipment or labs in dormitories, and 11 percent even require that
students own computers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech ranks 15th among the magazine list of 100 ``most
wired'' colleges. The No. 1 institution is Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   America's inner cities are not necessarily economic dead zones.
Inc. Magazine (May) identified 100 inner-city regions that
collectively provided close to 4,500 new jobs and generated revenue
of $12.2 million. (No, Atlanta wasn't among them.)
</P>
<P>
   Business Week (May 8) profiles Lawrence J. Ellison, chairman of
No. 2 software maker Oracle Corp. After playing second fiddle to
market leader Microsoft, the company has rebounded because the
Internet favors Oracle's software over Microsoft's, the magazine
says.

 &HT;    Lodgian suffers loss, but outlook remains positive
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Lodgian Inc. Monday reported a fourth-quarter loss
of $66.5 million, or $2.39 a share, before extraordinary items.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $140.7 million for the quarter and $592.4 million
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The results were delayed twice because of the integration of
multiple accounting systems following the 1998 merger of Servico
and Impac, which created Lodgian.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Robert Cole said cash flow was in line with
management's expectations and that he expected the year to be
positive.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most telling number in the fourth quarter is that RevPar
(revenue per available room) was flat for the stabilized
properties,'' said Paul Puryear, an analyst with Raymond James in
St. Petersburg, Fla. ``Obviously the conclusion is not rocket
science. This was not a very good quarter with the level of
write-offs they had and the flat number in same-store stabilized
properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Puryear said the lodging industry is ``looking a little better,
probably for the first time in a year and a half. Based on the
current trend, I think Lodgian's asset value should be on the
uptick for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired an investment banker to review strategic
alternatives, including a possible sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is being ruled out at this point,'' said Cole
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky businessman William Yung Sr. made a bid for the company
last year. Yung said he is still interested in acquiring the
company and has filed a lawsuit in Delaware seeking to overturn a
decision by Lodgian to reduce the number of board members.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also selling properties to reduce $880 million in
debt. Sixteen hotels have been sold since the beginning of 1999.

BOEING'S CHANGE OF FOCUS MAKES SPACE STATION PROJECT QUESTIONABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. _ It was the kind of careless mistake that is
not supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Believing two crates were empty, a Boeing worker earlier this
year put them into a dumpster outside the space station
manufacturing building here at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   The crates each contained a lightweight, beach-ball sized tank
designed to hold a high-pressure air mixture the airlock of the
International Space Station (ISS). A search failed to recover them,
and _ although a design change meant the tanks would never be used
_ Boeing has agreed to reimburse NASA, if asked, the estimated
$750,000 replacement cost.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is a metaphor for the problem-plagued program that
is more than two years behind schedule and for Boeing's
difficulties as prime station contractor to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's cost overruns have reached nearly $1 billion. It has
forfeited much of the potential profit it could have made from
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing President Harry Stonecipher has even questioned
whether it makes good business sense for the company to be the
station's prime contractor, according to people who have heard
Stonecipher talk about the station.
</P>
<P>
   Stonecipher declined to be interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   But one company official said Stonecipher's point is that
Boeing's business focus has changed since it was picked by NASA in
1994 to be the prime contractor for the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not making much profit on the station,'' said the
Boeing official who asked not to be quoted by name. ``We have a lot
of people tied up on a contract that even if we perform it's not a
big money maker for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our other contracts that these smart people could be
working on that have much more potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 Boeing workers are involved directly in the space
station work at sites around the country. Most are in Huntsville,
Florida and in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the cost overruns on Boeing's nearly $10 billion
space station contract from NASA, the company will likely receive
only $75.4 million of the $203 million in performance bonuses set
aside for managing costs, NASA said in February. Boeing has also
received only about 60 percent of $203 million available for
overall good contract management, though it could still receive an
additional $28 million if it meets certain technical requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing does not break out the financial performance of the many
programs in its main business units. So industry analysts who
closely follow Boeing can only make an educated guess about the
kinds of returns the company is making on its space station work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is one program that is probably not carrying its
own weight,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs of the Regan MacKenzie
Group in Seattle. ``Boeing is probably not losing money, but given
the resources and capital they have put into this, it probably
doesn't make sense from a value-added perspective ....
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what Boeing knows now, it's probably safe to say this is
not a program Boeing would have undertaken,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The station, an orbiting laboratory that will eventually be the
size of one and a half football fields, is more than two years
behind schedule and will not be completed until September 2005,
assuming NASA's latest assembly schedule doesn't slip even more.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian-built element now in orbit is running out of power
because of bad batteries. Bad weather at the Kennedy Space Center
prevented NASA from launching a shuttle mission last week that
would have brought fresh batteries to the fledgling station. The
shuttle also was to nudge the station into a higher orbit until a
critical Russian service module is finally launched in July.
</P>
<P>
   That shuttle mission has been rescheduled for May 18. Meanwhile,
the station continues to lose nearly 2 miles of altitude a week and
will have to dip into a limited on-board fuel reserve to boost its
orbit until the shuttle arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the cash-strapped Russians, one of the 16 international
partners, for much of the two-year delay. The Russians have been
late launching the service module that will be the early living
quarters for construction astronauts during assembly. The service
module will also provide a permanent propulsion system to keep the
station from falling out of orbit and burning up in the earth's
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Russian delays have cost NASA an estimated $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, director of space policy for the Federation of
American Scientists in Washington, D.C., said problems should be
expected on such a massive and complex effort, one much more
difficult than the Apollo moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   He described the space station as ``the biggest construction
project since the Pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two elements have circled the Earth nearly 10,000
times since they were launched. One is a connecting node called
Unity made by Boeing at its space station manufacturing building
here in Huntsville. It was carried into orbit by a shuttle in
December 1998 and astronauts attached it to a Russian-built module
called Zarya that had been sent into space several weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the much-delayed service module, Zarya was built with
U.S. money under contract for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian service module was supposed to go up early last
year. It wasn't ready, even though NASA's original station assembly
schedule called for it to be in orbit by early 1998, a couple
months after the first two elements.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Proton rocket, which will carry the service module into
orbit, also failed twice in 1999, furthering the delays. The rocket
was grounded until design changes could be made. In February, a
Proton successfully placed a satellite into orbit, but two more
tests are planned before it carries the all-important service
module to the station in July.
</P>
<P>
   If that mission is a success, the first astronauts will begin
living in the service module in October. Three-man work crews will
be rotated until assembly is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Russian service module, astronauts might not be able
to live continuously on the station until the Boeing-built habitat
module is launched to complete station assembly in September 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-foot by 14-foot habitat module is one of four U.S.
pressurized segments that Boeing built under its NASA contract. The
node is already in orbit. A laboratory module is at Kennedy
undergoing tests and is scheduled to be launched next January. And
a Boeing-built airlock is still here in Boeing/Huntville's space
station manufacturing building. It is nearly completed and is
supposed to be transported to Kennedy in July for launch next May.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat module is also still here. But it is only a hollow
aluminum shell. NASA issued a stop-work order on the module a
couple years ago while it explored the idea of roomer
accommodations called Transhab, an inflatable module NASA had hoped
to finance with private contractors who would then rent out its
space to NASA. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stephenson, head of Boeing's space station work in
Huntsville, said NASA could give the order next month for Boeing to
pick up work again on the habitat module.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost impossible to imagine Boeing not being involved in a
project such as the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The company's space roots go deep. In the same building here at
Marshall Space Flight Center where Boeing has manufactured all the
pressurized U.S. modules for station, an earlier generation of
Boeing workers built the first stage of the mighty Saturn 5 rocket
that carried U.S. astronauts to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important program to us. The Boeing name plate is
going to be on the space station,'' said Joe Mills, Boeing's deputy
space station manager in Houston in an echo of the company's stated
goal of being a leader in the space business.
</P>
<P>
   But Mills also knows that times have changed for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``ISS does fit the category of providing value to the company,''
Mills said. ``Are the returns what we would like them to be? No. We
would like to have better returns. But we do recognize the
realities of doing business with the government. Even Harry
(Stonecipher) has stated, and I've been in meetings with him where
this has come up, that if we could get returns in the 8 to 10
percent range, that would be a reasonable return for a government
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills pointed out that the NASA contract has generated sales for
Boeing of about a billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money that flows to the corporation,'' Mills
said. ``Even though the rate of return may not be exactly what we
want, whether it is 5 or 6 percent of that, it is still profit.
Those are bottom line dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, but Stonecipher has told people within the company
that if NASA were looking for a prime contractor today for the
space station, Boeing might pass.
</P>
<P>
   Said the Boeing official who asked not to be quoted by name:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the company has a different focus _ creating value _
we have to be careful in government business not to sign up on
long-term contracts that are not going to be very profitable for us
and can't create value.''

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ When Dr. Hasan Baiyev was summoned to his
hospital in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Kala on Feb. 1, he quickly
learned that it was not for an ordinary case.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian troops tried to take the capital, Grozny, Chechen
rebels had begun on Jan. 31 to fight their way out. Now hundreds of
bloodied militants were waiting for treatment in Baiyev's village
southwest of Grozny. They included Shamil Basayev, the most
notorious of the Chechen warlords, who was maimed as he led his
fighters through a Russian minefield.
</P>
<P>
   After administering a local anesthetic, Baiyev, a surgeon,
amputated Basayev's right leg. And soon after that, the rebels
whisked their leader to safety in the Caucasian mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Baiyev's life has not been the same since. He said he was simply
carrying out the Hippocratic oath and that he has treated Russian
soldiers as well as Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation made him a contentious figure in Russia. And
he soon decided that this would not be a bad time to learn about
medical care in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes to recall that I was saving elderly civilians by
the thousands,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington,
D.C. ``The only thing they remember is that I was the surgeon who
operated on Basayev.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Alkhan-Kala's residents had believed that they could
ride out the war in the separatist southern Russian region,
especially since the rebels had not made the small town a center of
their resistance. But Chechnya is also a place where people can get
into trouble by trying to avoid taking sides.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Baiyev grew up in Alkhan-Kala and was trained in dentistry and
facial surgery in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. He worked in a
hospital in Grozny but returned to his hometown in October to
restore an abandoned hospital. He had a small medical team,
including about 20 nurses, but he was the only surgeon in the town
of 20,000, including several thousand refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Baiyev had been harassed by both sides during the earlier war in
Chechnya. And this time, as Russian troops advanced toward the
Chechen lowlands, he initially decided to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents and relatives kept urging me to leave,'' he said.
``But the night before I was supposed to go, I walked through the
village and saw that many people were staying. They thought they
could live through it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Baiyev took his wife, three children, 86-year-old father and
75-year-old mother to safety in the neighboring Ingushetia region
and then returned to his hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the hospital staff nobody would pay us and that
everything they were doing was strictly voluntary,'' he said. ``My
plan was to stay despite the bombs and the shelling, to stay until
the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the war to come to Alkhan-Kala. In
mid-October, the Russians moved to encircle Grozny and to trap
Basayev and his fighters. Alkhan-Kala was caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 civilians were wounded by a Russian mortar attack, much
of the hospital staff left. But Baiyev stayed on.
</P>
<P>
   There were also tense moments when a band of Wahabbis arrived in
the village. This group of militants, under the command of Arbi
Barayev, profess a strict version of Islam but have been widely
accused of kidnapping people for ransom. They accused Baiyev of
treating Russian soldiers, fired their weapons at the ceiling of
the hospital and threatened to shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   Baiyev's greatest test came, however, when the thousands of
militants tried to escape from the besieged Chechen capital. He
learned about it at 6 a.m. on Feb. 1, when he was summoned to his
hospital to treat more than 300 wounded fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They arrived in the morning,'' he recalled. ``It was news to
us. Nobody expected it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two days, Baiyev ran a one-man emergency room,
operating without an anesthesiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone and conducted more than 100 operations during the
first 24 hours, including 67 amputations and seven skull
surgeries,'' he said. ``It was very difficult. We were basically
out of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev was the second patent. It was something of a reunion.
Baiyev had grown up in Alkhan-Kala with Basayev, whom he recalls as
a quiet child who liked to play chess and later moved to the
Chechen mountain town of Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very modest and never stood out among the school
children,'' Baiyev said. ``He followed our national traditions and
was very respectful toward elders.''
</P>
<P>
   The young Basayev seems to bear scant resemblance to the bearded
commander who led a daring raid on Budyonnovsk, a town in southern
Russia, in 1995 during the first war in Chechnya, and then
spearheaded a rebel invasion of Dagestan, another neighbor of
Chechnya, last August, proclaiming that he would establish an
Islamic state in the region. That attack sparked the current war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Basayev's roots in the town added a new twist to the story of
his escape from Grozny. The Russians say they lured the rebels into
a trap. A Russian intelligence agent, they say, promised the
militants safe passage out of Grozny in return for a bribe and then
directed them toward a minefield that was bracketed by Russian
machine-guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Baiyev said he believed that Basayev decided to try to
escape toward Alkhan-Kala because he knew the terrain there like
the back of his hand. Either way, the rebel leader paid a heavy
price.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a phalanx of fighters blocked access to the operating room,
Basayev was brought in on a stretcher. His right foot had been torn
apart by a mine. His fingers were frostbitten because he had been
lying in the snow. He was also blind from the concussion effects of
the explosion, a condition the doctor thinks was probably
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   But Basayev was still conscious. The doctor decided to amputate
part of his right leg to minimize the risk of gangrene and used a
local anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if it hurt,'' Baiyev recalled, ``He said, `Do your
business.'''
</P>
<P>
   Basayev was taken away by his men. Russian officials here say
their intelligence reports indicate that Basayev is now suffering
from gangrene and is being carried around on a stretcher by Russian
prisoners and kidnap victims. The Russians also say his role as a
rebel commander has diminished as a result of his condition. But
there is no way to confirm those reports.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For Baiyev, the situation in Alkhan-Kala soon went from bad to
worse. The Russians were hot on the rebels' trail, and the town was
in the way. His hospital was bombed, forcing him to move his
operating theater into his home.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, Russian soldiers entered the town. The rebel wounded
who remained there, Baiyev recalled, were taken away by a
pro-Moscow Chechen militia unit under the command of Bislan
Gantamirov, the former Grozny mayor.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Russians came looking for the doctor, complaining to
him that he had helped the rebels. Later, with the help of the
villagers, Baiyev made his way to Ingushetia and later to Moscow,
where he lived in fear of detention. He finally decided to go to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his experiences, Baiyev says he was threatened
by both sides for doing his duty as a doctor. He plans to return to
Chechnya, but for now is enjoying his study and relaxation in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a citizen of Chechnya, my tragedy has been to watch my
people suffer,'' he said. ``A hospital should be isolated from
combat operations. We were at the center of it.''

 &HT;    Atlanta start-up, WorldCom enter $316 million deal with few
details
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Group Information Services Inc., a tiny Atlanta start-up, Monday
announced a contract to buy at least $316 million in services from
WorldCom, part of an ambitious plan to sell communications packages
nationwide this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the five-year deal _ involving a large-sounding dollar
figure for a company with only a handful of full-time employees and
no revenues at all _ was announced with a puzzling fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when such agreements are commonly trumpeted by
publicity-seeking chief executives, the chief executive of Group
Information Services declined to comment on the announcement. In
fact, Vice President Kalpana Finucan declined to name the company's
top officers, saying some, including the CEO, are still working for
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   And the company offered only the barest of details about its
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Group Information Services will provide ``integrated voice mail
and e-mail,'' said Finucan. ``But the concept is proprietary and we
don't want to reveal too much just now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement is real, said WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The $37 billion-a-year Mississippi-based telecom giant confirmed
it has agreed to provide high-speed transmission and other services
to Group Information Services. It also confirmed the value of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   But it hadn't agreed to talk about it, said WorldCom spokesman
Paul Adams. ``We do have a contract, we do have a relationship. But
that press release was not authorized by us.''
</P>
<P>
   The news release was placed on the Business Wire, which is used
to transmit corporate announcements to newspapers and analysts at
10 a.m. It was removed by day's end, after discussions between
WorldCom and Group Information Services, which said it had not
understood the behemoth's procedures for approval of news releases.
</P>
<P>
   But Group Information Services stands by its ambitions, despite
its status as a mostly ``virtual company,'' Finucan said. About 10
people are involved, she said. ``Some are full-time. Some, like
myself, will become full-time once the financing comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is trying to raise nearly $10 million, but has no
venture funding to announce at this time, she said. Plans are to
put its marketing and research in Atlanta but corporate
headquarters could end up somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In about 30 days, we hope to put out a release that tells more
of the story.''

 &HT;    Manager sees soft landing for economy
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Canakaris finds himself in unfamiliar territory: trailing
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Canakaris, chief investment officer at Montag &AMP; Caldwell in
Atlanta, manages the Enterprise Growth fund for the Enterprise
Group fund family, also based in Atlanta. The ``A'' class of the
fund is down 4 percent so far this year, while the S&AMP;P 500 index is
off 0.07 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer haul, the fund has consistently topped the S&AMP;P
500 in total return. The ``A'' fund _ there are three classes _
topped the index in the one-, three-, five-, 10-, 15-, 20- and
25-year periods that ended Dec. 31, excluding the impact of the
fund's sales charge. After accounting for the sales charge, the
fund beat the S&AMP;P 500 in the five-, 10-, 20- and 25-year periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, year-to-date, we've gotten off to a slow start,''
said Canakaris. ``I think what is going to happen in the second
half of the year is that quality stocks are going to start to do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   He bases that expectation on the belief the Federal Reserve will
produce another soft landing for the U.S. economy and that earnings
growth will accelerate. He thinks the beneficiaries will be
companies with international exposure, because they will be helped
by economic growth outside the United States, as well as those with
mostly domestic sales that are able to take advantage of continued
expansion at home.
</P>
<P>
   In selecting stocks for the Enterprise Growth fund, Canakaris
looks for companies whose earnings are growing at least 10 percent
a year, and whose stocks are trading at about 20 percent below what
he and his colleagues at Montag &AMP; Caldwell think is a fair price.
Their calculation of a fair price is based on the present value of
future dividends _ if the company pays dividends _ plus the present
value of what the stock might sell for 10 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   These are stocks Canakaris recently has bought for the fund:
</P>
<P>
   Beverage company Coca-Cola (ticker symbol KO).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added to our Coke position because we see a significant
improvement in earnings growth in the second half of the year. The
company is very well-positioned to benefit from improvement in the
global economic expansion,'' he said. ``Next year we think they
could earn as much as $1.80 (a share).''
</P>
<P>
   Health care products maker Johnson &AMP; Johnson (JNJ).
</P>
<P>
   ``We added to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. They have this tremendous
breadth of product (and) strong marketing. We see very strong
earnings growth this year and next. It's very reasonably priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceuticals company Pfizer (PFE).
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfizer is just a very strong company,'' he said, suggesting
the proposed acquisition of Warner-Lambert (WLA) ``is going to make
it just more formidable.'' Canakaris expects annual earnings growth
of 25 percent after the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services provider Citigroup (C).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's selling at a very reasonable multiple, 17 times this
year's earnings,'' said Canakaris. Montag &AMP; Caldwell recently upped
its earnings estimate for Citigroup to $3.60 a share this year, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies (LU).
</P>
<P>
   ``We added to Lucent,'' Canakaris said. ``They had a
disappointment in the fourth quarter, but this quarter they have
gotten back on track and are benefiting from all the interest in
telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronics retailer Circuit City (CC).
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't positioned globally, but Circuit City is benefiting
from the transition from analog to digital in consumer products,''
said Canakaris. He estimated the transition represents a 10- to
15-year product cycle that is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Canakaris also has trimmed some of the fund's holdings. The
stake in chip maker Intel (INTC) was reduced as a result of its
price and valuation, freeing cash to buy Lucent Technologies,
Canakaris said.
</P>
<P>
   The MCI WorldCom (WCOM) holding was cut as well, in order in
invest in other stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty fully invested,'' explained Canakaris. ``We don't
have that much in cash. If we're going to be adding something, we
have to trim something else.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Just south of a park called Dreamland on an
abandoned airfield surrounded by slums, Edward Soeryadjaya is
testing the Internet's powers of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   In a country dominated by corporate dynasties, Soeryadjaya is
famous as the scion who broke his family's bank and cost his family
the car company his father founded in 1957, Astra International.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Soeryadjaya (pronounced sir-ya-JAI-ah) has returned to the
corporate stage as a high-technology entrepreneur planning to build
a stable of dot-coms and turn Jakarta's old airport into
Indonesia's Silicon Valley. In the process, he wants not only to
resurrect a fallow property investment but also to prove at last
that he was an unwitting pawn of politics and to help restore his
family's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting my future at stake,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I believe that information technology, as an enabler
for the Indonesian nation, is in line with the development of
technology in the world and has a very good future.''
</P>
<P>
   His vehicle is PT CyberCity Indonesia, a holding company with
what he calls a ``bag of goodies,'' which he hopes will attract
$76.5 million in new investments before listing by year-end. Inside
the bag are stakes in an Internet service, two Web portals, an
incubator for Net-related businesses, a multimedia academy and a
7.5-acre sliver of a 109-acre piece of overgrown airport that he
hopes to turn into a high-technology commercial and residential
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clicks and bricks,'' Soeryadjaya intoned in his sonorous
Indonesian drawl. He says he already has a heavy list of backers,
including the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan, as well
as Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of naysayers, however, many of whom point
to Soeryadjaya's reputation for financial misfortune. ``I'm always
skeptical about whatever Edward does,'' said Manggi T. Habir,
president of the credit-rating agency Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   While the Soeryadjayas' influence with Indonesia's new
government has spurred criticism, some skeptics wonder about
Soeryadjaya's high-technology connections. They question the
seriousness of a project that, despite claiming to have set up at
least five different ventures, has yet to establish a corporate Web
site. CyberCity, they say, is more about bailing out a $50 million
project Soeryadjaya was in charge of developing on the site of the
old Kemayoran domestic airport before the colossal failure of the
bank he ran, Bank Summa, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya is not the only Asian tycoon to become a pioneer of
the new economy. Though brash unknowns have won many of America's
new fortunes, the high-technology start-up scene in Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand is dominated by the rich and
powerful. Skeptics say it is a sign of how much buzz surrounds the
Internet; in Asia, as elsewhere, there is nothing like an Internet
play to give an old-economy stock a new shine. Others say it is a
symptom of economies in which wealth is still tightly concentrated
and local capital markets are developing too slowly to fuel the
speedy growth of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of entrepreneurs who want to start up but
don't have resources,'' said Vasant Chatikavanij, executive vice
president of Loxinfo, a Thai Internet service owned by his family's
conglomerate. ``They end up selling themselves cheap. They sell to
companies like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia may seem an unlikely venue for dot-com mania. Most
bankers and economists will not even discuss its Internet
potential. This, after all, is a country whose government still
depends on the International Monetary Fund to make ends meet, where
a personal computer costs nearly twice the average annual income.
Only 4 of every 1,000 Indonesians use the Internet, according to
International Data Corp., compared with 14 of every 1,000 Asians
overall. Most people do not even have a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and Internet entrepreneurs like Soeryadjaya say such
statistics show the market's promise. Indonesia, the world's
fourth-most-populous nation, already has more Internet users than
Singapore, and millions of wealthy urban residents with money to
spend online. New and cheaper ways of connecting to the Internet,
like television set-top boxes and mobile phones, they say, will
quickly extend the Net to more of Indonesia's 200 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large market coming out of the crisis that has
spending potential,'' said Jonathan Morris, 26, a Bostonian who
dropped out of the Harvard Business School a year and a half ago to
start Indonesia's most popular Web site, astaga.com.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya, 51, comes to the Internet world with more business
experience _ and, some say, more baggage. The eldest son of William
Soeryadjaya, a respected businessman who built Astra from a small
importer of diesel generators into a $2.4 billion automotive giant,
Edward Soeryadjaya started out as a salesman at an Astra unit. He
then ventured into finance, first with a bank in Germany and later
a finance company in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he bought a small Indonesian bank, renamed it Bank
Summa and expanded rapidly though the Summa Group. By 1991, Bank
Summa was one of the country's largest private banks, with about $1
billion in assets, most in the form of loans to Summa companies and
much of that for property investments.
</P>
<P>
   One such investment was the $50 million Jakarta International
Trade Fair Corp., a joint venture of Soeryadjaya's Griya Nusantara
Pratama, the Indonesian State Secretariat, Jakarta's city
government and a group of Japanese investors. The corporation was
to develop 109 acres of the sprawling old Kemayoran airport, which
had closed in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1990, Indonesia adopted a tight fiscal policy, and
Summa's world began to unravel. The property market tanked, and
Bank Summa was faced with $303 million in losses in 1991.
Soeryadjaya's father moved in to bail Summa out, removing his son
as chairman and pledging Astra shares against the bank's
obligations. The more he struggled to prop the bank up, the lower
Astra's share price sank and the deeper Bank Summa's hole grew. By
late 1992, the central bank closed Summa amid a depositor run. To
help meet the bank's $690 million in liabilities, the Soeryadjayas
relinquished virtually their entire 76 percent stake in Astra to
several businessmen close to President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   That is only half the story, according to a version of events
that Soeryadjaya said could be told only now that Suharto has
fallen. The government set him up, he said, by encouraging him to
lend, only to later impose restrictions and then remove government
pension funds from Bank Summa to precipitate its collapse. He said
his father would eventually spell out who was behind the intrigue
in a tell-all biography. ``I blame ourselves for being naive,''
Soeryadjaya said. ``We refused to be a crony.''
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya suggested he was victimized because his first wife,
who died of cancer the year the family lost Astra, was the daughter
of President Sukarno, whom Suharto ousted in 1965. Astra had long
been uncharacteristically independent of the Suharto clan. Suharto
was reportedly less than appreciative when, in mid-1990 Bank Summa
built a network of banks for rural Muslim communities with a
powerful cleric named Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wahid is Indonesia's president, the Suhartos are fending
off prosecutors, and the Soeryadjayas are rebuilding. In 1998,
Edward Soeryadjaya was reinstated as a board member of Jakarta
International Trade Fair. Last December, his father was named
chairman.

JAKARTA, Indonesia: named chairman.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The family's comeback has forced Wahid to counter accusations
that the Soeryadjayas have become neocronies. Last month, the
president sold his stake in the Muslim finance company he set up
with Soeryadjaya in mid-1990 after it bought a stake in Mandiri
Inti Finance, a company Edward Soeryadjaya took control of last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Mandiri was trying to raise funds for a last-minute bid to buy
back the Soeryadjayas' stake in Astra _ it was on the block after
being seized from the indebted cronies who had bought it seven
years earlier _ before the government sold it to a Singapore-led
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya denies trying to capitalize on his presidential
connections. ``If I were doing it, why didn't I do it before, when
we were fighting for our existence?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mandiri Inti Finance changed its name to Siwani
Trimitra and said it would start raising funds for CyberCity. But
most of Soeryadjaya's Internet deals have so far been conducted by
L&AMP;M Group Investments, a financially troubled engineering company
in Singapore, which Soeryadjaya's younger brother, Edwin, ended up
controlling after taking over a different Singapore company.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Soeryadjaya remains listed as L&AMP;M's deputy chairman and
his father is chairman; Edward Soeryadjaya became a member of the
board last year and, after slowly building up his stake in the
company, was named chief executive last month.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the tangled shareholdings and cross-shareholdings
that make Indonesian business so nebulous, L&AMP;M owns part of
CyberCity together with Jakarta International Trade Fair and
Soeryadjaya's own Griya Nusantara Pratama, which still owns part of
Jakarta International. Just how much of CyberCity each owns,
Soeryadjaya said, is ``now being arbitrarily decided.'' CyberCity,
in turn, owns only a portion of the five Internet-related ventures
it is involved in.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, L&AMP;M's stock has become a proxy on the project. It
rose 20 percent in November when L&AMP;M announced that MyWeb Inc.com,
an American set-top box maker, would take a 10 percent stake in
CyberCity and help build an Internet service in Indonesia, then
fell 8 percent when the deal fell apart a month later. Soon
afterward, when L&AMP;M said it was in talks to replace MyWeb with
Microsoft, the stock shot up more than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   L&AMP;M's share price has drifted down about 28 percent this year,
tracking the decline of Asia's stock markets. But L&AMP;M has also been
dogged by concerns about whether partnerships will materialize. The
company has announced that Singapore Telecommunications' Internet
unit, SingNet, is considering a 30 percent stake in CyberCity, and
that Detecon Marketing Consulting, unit of Deutsche Telekom, will
buy 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, L&AMP;M said it had signed a memorandum of understanding
with SingTel to help develop CyberCity but gave no details. Detecon
said it was in talks but that no deal had yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
   In February, L&AMP;M finally signed a deal with Microsoft _ not to
take a stake in CyberCity but rather to help build a news and
information Web site in return for a share of revenues the site
generates. The site is scheduled to start this month. The only
CyberCity venture that appears to be up and running is the Jakarta
Multimedia Academy, which L&AMP;M established with Malaysian Technology
Development, a government-owned venture capital concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support CyberCity fully, but we're still waiting for
something to be realized,'' said Pandji Choesin, executive director
of the Indonesian Association of Internet Service Providers.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya wants to sell a 50 percent stake in CyberCity for
$26.5 million by June 28, when he plans to officially introduce it
at an Internet trade show at Kemayoran. He hopes to raise another
$50 million by the end of the year, despite the fact that there are
still no revenue projections for the group. ``From June 28 onward,
I trust that the price tag of our company will be in excess of $100
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a big capital buildup might not be unusual for an Internet
start-up, but it would represent an especially neat turnaround for
Jakarta International Trade Fair's original airport investment.
</P>
<P>
   Property analysts say prices in Jakarta have fallen at least 50
percent the last 10 years, though with no sales anywhere in two
years it is hard to tell. Soeryadjaya said CyberCity was valuing
its 7.5-acre property at $5 million, a price that would make
Jakarta International's entire 109-acre spread at Kemayoran worth
around $73 million _ a 46 percent paper profit.
</P>
<P>
   Soeryadjaya rejects criticism that his high-technology vision is
a property deal in disguise, though he does not deny that CyberCity
could be good for the local real estate market. ``We know we have
to push it as a cyber initiative because that's where most of the
funds are basing their decisions,'' he said. ``We're not cheating
anybody.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: AND IN THIS CORNER, BIG PORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. _ Today we're going to take a break from the
unending excitement of the presidential race to talk about hog
lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial livestock farming is probably not a big problem in
your neighborhood, but really, people, how can you resist a
controversy in which the villain is called Big Pork, and the
possible repercussions include flesh-eating algae? If hog farming
weren't a political issue, it would be a TV movie in sweeps month.
</P>
<P>
   It's already played a role in today's North Carolina
gubernatorial primary. ``If I'm elected governor we're going to end
hog lagoons,'' vowed Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker in a famous TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hog lagoons'' sound like pigs in bathing suits with mermaid
tails, swimming around a la Esther Williams. Actually lagoon is a
fancy term for a humongous pit of manure. It's a critical element
in the brave new world of pork production, in which hogs are often
owned by the packers but raised by contractors in a system that
bears a striking resemblance to a fast-food franchise. One of the
great features of the system is that while the big guys own the
hogs, the little contractors own the waste. It drains into lagoons,
and if one of them ruptures or overflows or leaks, do not go
looking to the packer for restitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different smells to it. One day it might smell like
ammonia. Another day it might have an almost burning-type smell
that hurts your nose,'' said Karen Priest, a North Carolina
homeowner who woke up one morning and discovered that 7,300 hogs
and two lagoons had moved in next door.
</P>
<P>
   In many places you can't put up a tree house without somebody
seeking an injunction. But in North Carolina, thanks to the
tireless efforts of a former state senator named Wendell Murphy,
monster hog farms had free right-of-way into the countryside. By a
remarkable coincidence, Murphy happened to be a major hog producer
himself, as well as a great pal and major contributor to Jim Hunt,
the outgoing governor.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its hospitable attitude, over the last decade North
Carolina has been inundated with oversized hog farms and their
lagoons, along with the largest meat-packing plant in the world.
They're crammed into the eastern section of the state, an area that
is made up in large part of wetlands and flood plains.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put the hog lagoons in the flood plains. People, is that
great planning or what?
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen from animal wastes seems responsible for the sudden
appearance of a flesh-eating algae known as Pfiesteria in state
waters. During one particularly grisly period in the mid-'90s,
North Carolinians were discovering piles of fish, laden with sores
and gasping for breath, on the riverbanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the scientific evidence that says it's swine
waste that creates this problem,'' said Al Tank of the National
Pork Producers Council. There are, of course, other potential
culprits. But except for private golf courses, you'd be hard
pressed to name any that have as little redeeming social value.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the smell and the environmental impact, the big farms
are driving small hog producers out of business. Pork prices for
the consumer aren't dropping. The hogs can't be enjoying their
lives _ ``Where is Kim Basinger when we need her?'' asked Priest.
To top it all off, the jobs created at the contract farms and
meat-packing plants are so lousy that even residents of a poor,
rural area won't take them.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that the candidates for governor would be leaping
over each other to take on this issue. They're all middle-aged
lawyers, so interchangeable that their own mothers might be hard
pressed to cull one from the herd, and this pig thing is definitely
the most interesting aspect to the race. But the two Democrats have
moved on to the more traditional topics of education and character
assassination. The Republicans have kept their distance altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the only thing to do is go national. Next time Al Gore or
George Bush comes to your town, ask him what he'd do to crack down
on hog lagoons. One of them might have an answer, and at least it
might liven things up.

PALIN DOES PAPA, OR THE OLD PYTHON AND THE SEA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below; `tonight' refers to Wed., May 3) 
Our rating: 2{ stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Palin's 1995 novel, ``Hemingway's Chair,'' was a
whimsical story of a timid Brit postman who struggled, mightily, to
attain the level of machismo of his favorite author, Ernest
Hemingway. In ``Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure,'' the former
Monty Python trouper says he relates to the author's wanderlust;
Papa's works appeal to him because they suggest, ``If you were bold
and fearless, (you) could (live in that) world, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Palin, like his novel's protagonist, ultimately
seems more at home in a comfy recliner than a schooner's deck chair
battling a marlin at the business end of a fishing pole. Palin,
perhaps the most versatile and certainly the most normal-seeming of
the Pythons, makes for a most genial host throughout all his
perambulations, so you certainly enjoy his company.
</P>
<P>
   Over four one-hour episodes, ``Hemingway Adventure'' treks to
places either made famous by Hemingway through his writings, or
places where he spent significant amounts of time, or simply
visited. Sometimes, as when Palin explores the sites of two plane
crashes the writer survived in Uganda, the visit's intent is to
contribute to the understanding of Hemingway's biography; other
times, it's simply to drink in the local flavor or see how the man
left his mark or how he might possibly have spent his time.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the series has a more specious premise than Palin's
previous travel excursions, ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' ``Full
Circle'' and ``Pole to Pole,'' which at least had a built-in
structure and internal logic to propel them. This is a random,
peripatetic trek that brings Palin to different points in America
in three different episodes, including a Montana dude ranch that
can't help but seem pointless, and to Africa twice. Cuba and Spain
also figure prominently in Palin's perambulations.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who ostensibly wants to understand Hemingway better,
Palin can be awfully bull-headed when it comes to divining
bullfighting's appeal, for one thing. An unabashed animal-rights
activist, he persistently asks hunters and matadors why they do
what they do and whether they feel bad doing it. The gamesmen might
just as reasonably ask him, ``Don't you feel a little guilty
getting paid so well just to take a vacation?'' It's simply what
both parties do; it's part of their enculturation; it's in their
blood. (In the TV series, Palin never succeeds when he joins the
sportsmen, as all of his hunting and fishing expeditions end in
abject failure; the companion book suggests that that may not have
been completely true.)
</P>
<P>
   One certainly wishes that Palin's pauses for comic frippery were
more inspired. In Africa, he offers a weak fashion show of
Serengeti finery and riffs mildly on bathroom accouterments; in
Venice, he trots out, to little effect, the Gumby character from
his Python days; in Cuba, he pretends, half-heartedly, to drink too
much and, more embarrassingly, fashions a series of mock scenes in
which he tries to contact Fidel Castro, with a particularly lame
pay-off.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, he does hit upon an inspired comic
observation: Many of the places Hemingway either wrote about or
called home have become gaudy tourist traps that no doubt would
have sent him screaming from the place in search of a refuge with
more quietude and, certainly, less amateurish drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a Hemingway lookalike contest in Key West; no one is
allowed to touch Papa's possessions in communist Cuba, and, of
course, running with the bulls in Pamplona has become a rite of
manhood for all manner of privileged college drunks who enjoy
taking leave of their senses.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a thought that, despite the potential for comedy, goes
relatively undeveloped. Which seems to be the overriding impression
``Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure'' leaves the viewer: After
butting heads with bulls in Spain and closing down bars in Key West
and Cuba, the show is a little too fuzzy-headed to posit a coherent
point. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Michael Palin's Hemingway Adventure.'' &QL;

the life of the author. &QL;

   CELL-PHONE-SAFETY (Washington) _ Scientists are launching a new
series of studies to determine whether radiation from cell phones
sparks maladies such as leukemia, cancer, birth defects,

GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SPIN IN JAPAN CREATES DEBATE ON
ACCOUNTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When his superiors discovered that an army colonel had
invited civilian friends to an official firing range recently to
have fun shooting guns, they hushed the matter up quickly, saying a
scandal might cause the public to lose trust in the military.
</P>
<P>
   When the director of an orphanage in Kyoto recently found
evidence of child abuse by a longtime employee, he concealed the
crime for nearly a year, explaining later that he had kept silent
``out of consideration'' for the worker's future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the double-barreled police scandal in the city of
Niigata that was front-page news throughout Japan for weeks
recently. A senior national police official, who was sent to the
town in mid-January to carry out a scheduled national inspection of
the local police department, instead repaired with the Niigata
police chief to a nearby spa for drinks and games of mah-jongg.
</P>
<P>
   Their partying came to light because on that same day, the
Niigata police were dealing with their biggest case in years _ the
discovery of a kidnapped girl who had been missing for nine years _
and questions were raised about why the chief was not on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently to enhance their crime-fighting image, the police
also claimed to have found the girl, but it turned out that she had
been discovered by social workers.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the affair before Parliament, Keizo Obuchi, who was
then the prime minister, shocked many people by saying he felt that
the inspector had merely been unlucky to have been revealed
shirking his duties because of all of the attention suddenly cast
upon Niigata, a normally sleepy city of a half-million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's comments, and the widespread criticism that followed
them, have fueled a mushrooming debate over what many see as a
crisis of public accountability in Japan. A spate of ill-concealed
scandals has cast a pall over the government and other public
institutions like the police.
</P>
<P>
   The debate had its biggest public airing over Obuchi's own
collapse from a stroke early in April. His condition was hidden
from the public for 22 hours by a government that went on to
dissemble about events surrounding the prime minister's health for
at least two more days.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning after his late-night hospitalization, reporters
were told that he was working normally in his residence. The next
evening, the public was told that the prime minister had been
hospitalized for exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Only the day after that, when succession politics had already
been worked out in secret, was it disclosed that Obuchi had
suffered an incapacitating stroke. Bit by bit it emerged that Mikio
Aoki, the caretaker leader who filled the vacuum until a new prime
minister took office, had stated falsely that Obuchi had been
conscious throughout the day of his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   That statement was ostensibly made to lend credibility to Aoki's
claim to have been asked by Obuchi to hold the reins of power on
his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial writers, members of civic groups and experts in
government say that the ham-fisted instances of official dishonesty
in cases like these are eroding the once high level of faith of
ordinary people in public institutions. And they say that this kind
of behavior comes from a bankrupt ethical culture that typically
values appearances far more than the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent national poll in the leading daily newspaper Asahi
Shimbun, for example, 60 percent of respondents said they
distrusted the police. According to the newspaper, in previous
polls, as recently as 1998, no fewer than 69 percent of those who
responded said they had faith in the police.
</P>
<P>
   On the floor of the Parliament in mid-April, the leader of the
opposition, Yukio Hatoyama, drew a direct link between the handling
of the Obuchi's stroke and other recent scandals. The prime
minister's health crisis, he said, had been handled ``without
transparency, with secretive discussions and a mass of
falsifications, and the same could be said of the police
scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many Japanese, the Obuchi affair seemed like yet another
example of the murky way in which power has long been wielded in
this country, contributing to widespread feelings of powerlessness
and apathy about politics.
</P>
<P>
   A venerable expression here about the attitude that governors
should hold toward the governed is not far off the mark, even in
the Internet age. ``We should not inform the people,'' the saying
goes. ``They must depend upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   The most extreme example of this approach involves the death
penalty. A family of a prisoner on death row, for example, is
notified of the execution only after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Another telling sign of how prevalent such attitudes toward
information and public service remains is that the Japanese
language lacks a word to express neatly the idea of accountability.
When the subject comes up here, the English word is most often used
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Even if apathy is prevalent here, a number of commentators have
begun to denounce the culture of concealment and opacity, which
they say is dangerously corrosive to this country's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an attitude that we don't have to divulge
information,'' Manabu Hasegawa, a journalist and author of a 1993
book, ``The Illness and Death of Politicians,'' said in an
interview. ``A society that preserves the ideal of concealing
information is a society that has distorted democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Common explanations of the way even seemingly innocuous
information is closely held by politicians, corporations and groups
of ordinary people often focus on Japan's insular, so-called mura,
or village culture, which developed over centuries of rural
near-isolation.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to these theories, is a society built from
tightly-knit groups, in which decisions are made by consensus,
where authority is rarely questioned, and where a premium is placed
not on openness, but on avoiding shame or embarrassment for the
group.  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When problems do surface, the preferred solution is typically
ritualized apology, resignation and, in extreme cases, suicide.
Forthrightly dealing with the facts of the wrongdoing is typically
avoided. The Niigata police, for example, finally apologizing for
lying about their discovery of the missing girl, contended that
they were seeking to avoid creating a nuisance for the social
service workers who found her.
</P>
<P>
   Hisatake Kato, a professor of ethics at Kyoto University, cited
the recent nuclear accident in Japan as another example of this
type of approach, contending that everyone knew the proper
procedures were not being followed but remained silent. In the
United States, he said, ``In the case of the Three Mile Island
accident, whistle-blowing helped prevent a far worse disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous procedures only came to light after an
uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction broke out at the plant in
question, in Tokaimura, last October, killing one worker, and
contaminating hundreds of others in the town with dangerous levels
of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, even if there is some kind of misconduct in an
organization that you belong to, what you are supposed to do in
this culture is avoid leaking the information to the outside,''
said Kato. ``That is what is considered public morality in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   To back up his contention, Kato cited his own research in which
he interviewed scores of workers in downtown Tokyo, asking them if
they would disclose serious wrongdoing in their company if they
came across evidence of it. Ninety-nine percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply held attitudes like these perhaps explain why, despite
the protests by journalists, there was relatively little popular
outcry following the Government's clearly deceptive handling of the
news of Obuchi's stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of a freedom of information act last spring modeled
on similar laws in the United States has the potential of
revolutionizing people's access to official information in Japan.
But because of the relative lack of public pressure, activists who
helped bring about the law's passage say it's impact has so far
been small.
</P>
<P>
   ``This society has a very low interest in what the Government is
doing,'' said Shigeki Okutsu, director of the Information
Clearinghouse, a group that pushed for the law. ``But also, the
government has very little regard for what people think.''

</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Radio A Go-Go!'': Host Hal Lifson offers an aural scrapbook of
the '60s, incorporating B-sides, album tracks, rarities, original
commercials and guests such as session drummer Hal Blaine and the
Ventures. A tie-dyed-in-the-wool '60s enthusiast, Lifson's delight
and knowledge of the era shines through. &QL; 
Where: KRLA-AM (1110). &QL; 
When: 7 p.m. Saturdays and 10 p.m. Sundays. &QL; 
Typical segment: ``Alone Again Or,''Love; ``A Mexican Shuffle,''
Herb Alpert &AMP; the Tijuana Brass; ``Jennifer Eccles,'' Hollies;
``Okolona River Bottom Band,'' Bobbie Gentry; ``Stone Free,'' Jimi
Hendrix. &QL; 
Quote: ``A lot of this stuff never made it onto radio in the first
place but it's still great music. Sixties music and culture will
always be ultra-hip.'' &QL; 
Off the air: Lifson doubles as an entertainment manager and
publicist whose clients include Nancy Sinatra. In fact, the singer
of the 1966 chart-topper ``These Boots Are Made for Walkin'''
recently did a concert at the El Rey Theatre to promote ``Radio A
Go-Go!'' which incidentally was just named the city's best oldies
show by New Times. &QL; 
Background: Raised in Encino in the '60s with transistor radio to
ear, Lifson hosted a '60s show at Berkeley's KALX in the early
'80s. He later worked in advertising which is where he realized
'60s culture would always be influential. He launched ``Radio A
Go-Go!'' last year on Glendale's KIEV-AM (870), moving to KRLA in
January. &QL; 
Taking a stand: As more and more oldies outlets add tracks from the
'70s, Lifson won't budge from his '60s playlist. &QL; 
You'll like this if... You like Mega 100, KRTH-FM (101.1). &QL;

A 4-YEAR ASSIGNMENT: LEAD TURKEY INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ On the wall behind Ambassador Volkan Vural's
desk at the Turkish mission here is a reproduction of a 1923 Time
magazine cover featuring Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who forged modern
Turkey out of the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Vural is scheduled to return to Ankara to take up a
new post that presents a challenge almost as daunting. His job will
be to convince the European Union that Turkey merits membership and
to convince his countrymen that joining the club is worth the
painful admission price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a tough job,'' said Vural, who will need his
closeness to Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and a combination of
persistence and patience. ``We have to convince Parliament, the
ministers and the political parties to support the process of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years at the United Nations and three years as
ambassador to Germany, Vural has developed personal relationships
with many of the European diplomats who will be involved in the
membership negotiations. But in an interview, he was cautious in
his optimism and would not make promises about timing, saying only
that the goal is be ready for formal talks by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Even the timing on his new job is uncertain. While Vural has
been traveling back and forth to Ankara in recent weeks to discuss
European Union issues, the position of secretary-general for EU
affairs has not yet been created formally by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Turkey's enthusiasm for membership is at an all-time
high. After European leaders agreed in December to let Turkey
become a candidate for full membership, a poll for NTV, a Turkish
television network, found that two out of three Turks favored
joining and only one in six opposed it, the same number that had no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But Vural, 58, a former journalist and director of Turkey's
state-owned radio and television network, is well aware that public
opinion can change and support may ebb as Turkey confronts the
political and economic changes required to conform to EU standards.
</P>
<P>
   Membership offers tantalizing prospects for prosperity and
economic stability, but the costs will be high. For instance, 45
percent of Turkey's workforce is engaged in farming, a number that
must be slashed by half or more to be competitive. Overall economic
growth, which surged last year, is expected to decline this year as
the country battles double-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the often-fractious Parliament will have to completely
overhaul half of the country's laws and regulations to mesh with
the EU in areas ranging from strengthening environmental rules to
abolishing restrictions on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The primary obstacles are not economic, according to European
diplomats, but instead Turkey's wobbly democracy and the treatment
of its Kurdish population. European leaders are troubled by the
influence of Turkey's military in government and the army-backed
crackdowns on Kurdish and Islamic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging room for improvements, some Turkish leaders
complain that EU demands threaten to interfere with internal
matters that are vital to national security.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that the membership bar is higher for Turkey
than for Eastern European countries that may be less prepared.
Though Turkey's membership application has been pending since 1987,
Poland, Slovakia and other countries that applied more recently
have been moved ahead of it in line.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference on American-Turkish relations in Washington last
month, Turkish officials and business leaders were generally upbeat
about prospects for membership. But they expressed concern that,
even if Turkey meets the EU's goals, membership might remain
outside its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Turkey does appears to be not enough,'' Ilter Turan,
the president of Istanbul's Bilgi University, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vural said signs are promising that Turkey will be ready
to open formal membership negotiations within four years and that
ultimately it will join the EU.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound very optimistic, but we have the desire and the
political will to do it,'' he said.

FIRST JEWISH DEFENDANT IN IRANIAN SPY CASE SHOWN IN TV CONFESSION
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRAZ, Iran _ The first of 13 Jewish men who are accused of
espionage went on trial Monday, and Iranian authorities displayed
him on television admitting that he had spied for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The government had adamantly refused to allow family members,
human rights groups or the public to witness the opening of the
politically charged trials of the 13, who are to be tried, one by
one, in coming weeks, on vague charges of spying.
</P>
<P>
   In the public confession, broadcast on Iran's state-run
television as part of the main evening news, the defendant, Hamid
Tefileen, 31, told an interviewer that he was part of a network of
spies who were trained in Israel ``to get information from
Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Tefileen, described by his family as a simple clerk in his
father's shoe store, was dressed in prison garb decorated with tiny
drawings of the scales of justice during the brief
question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am charged with being a spy for Israel,'' said the
relaxed-looking defendant, who was sandwiched between two
interviewers in a room that appeared to be in the provincial
courthouse here. ``I admit to that charge.''
</P>
<P>
   His public confession was apparently made without his attorney
present. Broadcast just hours after court officials had once again
insisted that the trial of the Jews must be closed for national
security reasons, it did little to convince the foreign envoys who
were in Shiraz to see if the Jews receive a fair trial from a court
system dominated by hard-liners hostile to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is, it's a setup,'' said Vicken Koundakjian,
first secretary in the Canadian embassy in Tehran and one of five
diplomatic observers who had appealed to the judge in the case for
permission to meet with the defendants. ``He's a fall guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision two weeks ago to conduct the espionage
trial behind closed doors had drawn intense criticism from human
rights groups and diplomats, who argued that only an open
proceeding could assure that the defendants were not bullied or
persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe a TV confession,'' said Elahe Hicks, a
representative of Human Rights Watch in New York, who is in Shiraz
to monitor the trial. ``It's a violation of detainees' rights. If
they wanted to show him, they should have allowed a representative
of the Jewish community, or diplomats or even me, to attend the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of a broad reformist
movement that hopes to depoliticize the conservative judiciary, had
pledged that the trial would be conducted according to the rule of
law and human rights. But Khatami does not control either the
judiciary or the state broadcasting system.
</P>
<P>
   Both institutions are under the control of Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is chosen by the senior Muslim
clergy and is the paramount political and religious authority in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Both are also dominated by conservatives, who have recently
mounted a full-scale assault on Khatami's reformist supporters,
closing 16 of their publications, jailing their leaders as
un-Islamic and accusing them of being foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   Several hard-line clerics and judges have already labeled the
accused Shiraz Jews as Zionist spies. Local court officials,
pressed by reporters and diplomats to justify the charges against
the 13 men, have also maintained that some of the defendants had
confessed during interrogations to being spies for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said that any such admissions were not valid
because none of the defendants were represented by counsel until a
few weeks ago. They said the only evidence against them are the
transcripts of their interrogations, which were conducted by the
trial judge who acts as both prosecutor and judge under Iran's
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants _ part-time Hebrew teachers, shop assistants, an
18-year-old high school student and a professor of English _ are
accused of operating a spy network for Israel. If convicted, they
could be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyers said that several of the defendants have secretly
visited relatives in Israel, but none had access to classified
information or passed any state secrets, as required for a
conviction on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   Tefileen spent about four hours with the Revolutionary Court
judge on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's hearing, Hussein Ali Amiri, the head of the court
system in Shiraz, the provincial capital, told reporters that
Tefileen had admitted in court that he had ``connections with the
Mossad,'' the Israeli secret service, and had passed ``confidential
information'' to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri said that for reasons of national security, he could not
describe the nature of the information that Tefileen is supposed to
have turned over. Some Iranian Muslims, he added, provided the
secrets to the Jews and some of them have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he could not explain why those Muslims, who have
never been named by the authorities or seen in court, were released
on bail months ago.
</P>
<P>
   None of the defendants work in positions that would give them
access to state secrets, their families have said. Tefileen's
younger brother, Omid, described him as ``a regular guy.'' Both
work in their father's shoe store, he said. Omid Tefileen is also
charged in the case, but he is one of three defendants who is free
on bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of cases where spies are ordinary people,''
responded Amiri, when asked how a shoe salesman could run an
espionage scheme. ``In all the spy stories you read, the spies are
just ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which was set to begin three weeks ago but was
postponed until Monday to give the defense more time to prepare, is
taking place during a wider political conflict between reformers
backing Khatami and conservatives who are using the courts to
undermine and persecute his liberal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hostility toward Israel is one of the litmus tests
of loyalty toward the Islamic system in Iran. With many in their
own ranks facing charges of insulting Islam, neither the president
nor his supporters have been willing to interfere in a high-profile
case that involves alleged spying for Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has denied any connection with the men, and their
families have said the charges are false and could only be the
result of a misunderstanding.

 &HT;    Lewis lawyers win big point on allegations
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Defense attorneys for Ray Lewis scored a big victory
Monday when a Fulton County judge denied prosecution efforts to use
prior allegations of assault against Lewis in his upcoming murder
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of whether Lewis will be tried separately was put
off until later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner disallowed a bid by
prosecutors to enter into evidence three separate incidents in
which the football star allegedly struck women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the same argument (that) if he did it before, he'll do
it again,'' Bonner said. ``I don't find the incidents sufficiently
similar'' to the attacks that occurred Jan. 31 where two men were
stabbed to death in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were attempting to show the incidents _ in which he
allegedly choked a girlfriend, scratched a woman and punched
another in a bar _ show a pattern of conduct and ``rebut his claim
that he was a peacemaker.'' Defense attorney Don Samuel called all
three allegations baseless.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in an unexpectedly quick session where the judge
upheld a police search of Lewis' Baltimore home but left unanswered
until later key issues as to whether Lewis gets tried separately
from his two co-defendants and if his statement to Atlanta police
should be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial against Lewis and his friends, Reginald Oakley and
Joseph Sweeting, is scheduled to start May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's lawyer, Bruce Harvey, renewed his request for Bonner to
grant immunity to Kwame King and Carlos Stafford, two men who were
with Lewis the night of the stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey called the two men ``witnesses/participants'' and said
they can provide testimony to help clear his client. The men have
hired attorneys and have not talked to prosecutors or the defense.
Bonner postponed ruling, asking Harvey to show her if she has
authority to grant immunity to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearing, Bonner asserted control over the case.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered prosecutors to turn over evidence favorable to the
defense, reminded lawyers about a court-imposed gag order and even
scolded prosecutor Elizabeth Baker for not listening to her while
she spoke. Bonner also told prosecutors that they should now be
preparing their case for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys complained they are still getting evidence
from the prosecution, four weeks after the court-imposed deadline
for both sides to exchange information.
</P>
<P>
   Baker reminded Bonner that the speedy trial demand by defense
gave prosecutors less time than normal to prepare. She was not
swayed by that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a time to stop investigating,'' said Bonner, 59,
who has been a Fulton judge for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The judge appeared to take a practical approach to motions,
mentioning that a prosecution effort to have the jury visit the
scene inside the Lincoln Navigator limousine at 4 a.m. may be
pushing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a convinced that going to the scene will be of
assistance to the jury, especially at four in the morning,'' Bonner
said.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutor Clint Rucker told the judge he could amend the
request so that jurors could visit the Buckhead scene ``when it's
dark,'' Bonner asked, ``Why didn't you do that in the first
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner wondered if the jury could simply be taken to see the
limo in the darkened courthouse parking lot. ``But my thought about
it is we can't make it 20 degrees and Super Bowl night,'' she said,
deferring her ruling until the trial is underway.
</P>
<P>
   The judge upheld a search of Lewis's Baltimore home, which the
defense characterized as ``overbroad,'' noting that police even
confiscated Lewis' little sister's photo album. Prosecutors
countered that Lewis had not been cooperative to police and they
were trying to find photos of potential suspects to include in
police lineups.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, the flamboyant pony-tailed attorney, also filed a motion
to ``level the playing field'' _ allowing him to bypass the gag
order and hold a press conference. Harvey said that he was not
appointed until after lawyers were ordered to stop talking about
the case. And he pointed out that both Lewis's attorneys and
prosecutors had a field day beforehand courting the press.
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied his motion without comment.

 &HT;    Boycotts have spotty history of success
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Holmes had to go to Columbia for business, but other than a
night's stay in a hotel and breakfast, he kept his money in his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many times when the director of the Southern
Center for Studies in Public Policy at Clark Atlanta University has
driven by Texaco gas stations and Shoney's restaurants, targets of
past boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollar is by far the most effective weapon folks have,''
said Holmes, who is also a state representative.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, high-profile boycotts _ or threats of boycotts
_ have focused attention on a weapon long used by labor unions and
civil rights activists to press for change.
</P>
<P>
   In April, former and current African-American employees called
for a national boycott of Atlanta-based Cola-Cola, which is the
defendant in a racial discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, the NAACP is leading a boycott of the state's
tourism industry in an attempt to pressure legislators to remove a
Confederate flag from atop the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina flag flap reignited debate about Georgia's
state flag and its representation of the Confederate battle emblem.
A call for a boycott here is on hold to give the state Legislature
time to act. A tourism official estimates a boycott could cost the
state $100 million in convention and tourist business.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Putnam, founder of the Institute for Consumer
Responsibility in Seattle and a boycott expert, estimates that as
many as 200 boycotts are in progress in the country at any given
time, up from about 50 at a time 15 years ago. Many will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many boycotts are more symbolic than real,'' said Leon Fink, a
labor professor at the University of North Carolina. ``Sometimes
they're public relations weapons for larger campaigns for a
particular cause. Only in rare cases does it substantially hurt the
company or merchant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, boycotts are increasingly popular because they can
work. But they are hard to organize and sustain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can stand out on a corner and call for a boycott,''
said Monroe Friedman, author of a book on boycotts and an Eastern
Michigan University professor. ``It's another thing to organize and
implement one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some have clearly been successful, others have clearly
been unsuccessful, and there is a wide range that falls in
between,'' said Friedman, citing the failure of the National
Organization for Women's boycott threats against states that didn't
ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. A successful boycot must appeal
to consumers emotionally and have a clear message and goal, said
Friedman. It also helps to have the support of a well-known
organization. Widely recognized boycotts helped end apartheid in
South Africa, unionize California grape workers in the 1960s and
launch the civil rights movement in Montgomery in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO claims its boycott of Adolph Coors Co. over labor
issues caused Coors' Colorado market share to fall from 47 percent
in 1977 to about 22 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Coors sees it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know sales were affected, but we can't quantify it,'' said
Joe Fuentes, a company spokesman. Coors' competitors stepped up
advertising at the time. ``We don't know if it was the boycott or
the beer wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauging the economic effectiveness of a boycott often is
guesswork, and target companies may look for any other explanation
rather than admit boycotts can work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations will tell you that changing their policy had
nothing to do with the boycott,'' said Putnam. ``That's pretty
common, because once you acknowledge the boycott has been
effective, then you make yourself a target for future boycotts.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman refers to boycotts such as the South Carolina campaign
_ targeting the tourist industry to force government to act _ as
``surrogate'' boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory, of course, is that you put pressure on the
surrogate _ businesses _ who will in turn put pressure on the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, ``the business community forced the government
to change because they were losing market and losing money,''
Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Arizona was the target of a tourism boycott
after the state refused to recognize the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. holiday. ``The impact was enormous,'' said Brent DeRaad,
spokesman for the Greater Phoenix Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically it was across the board _ not just African-American
groups but groups of all different backgrounds that had been
looking at Arizona decided not to come,'' said DeRaad.
</P>
<P>
   DeRaad estimates the boycott had an economic impact of $189.6
million and resulted in the loss of 170 meetings and conventions
between 1987 and 1992. The biggest blow was the loss of the 1993
Super Bowl. Arizona voters approved a King holiday in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, losses to the state's $14.6 billion tourism
industry already are being estimated at $6 million to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly feel like the boycott has had an impact on the
entire island,'' said Gary Sims, manager of the Holiday Inn
Oceanfront in Hilton Head.
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, at least 20 conventions and events _ with an
economic impact of $3.3 million _ have been canceled since the
boycott started last June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only have we lost booked business, but you can't even
measure how many meetings and business we've lost because people
won't even consider coming to South Carolina,'' said Amy Ballenger,
a spokeswoman for the Charleston Area Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, flag opponents and business leaders hope the flag
will be changed by the next Legislature, forestalling a threatened
boycott of the state's $18 billion tourism industry. South
Carolina's Legislature is considering a measure to remove its
Confederate flag. Such quick response is more typical of boycotts
now.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam estimated that in 1984 the average boycott needed seven
to 10 years to succeed. ``Most proactive companies are not going to
wait around until they actually start losing money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Georgia Black Chamber of Commerce urged a boycott
against Thomasville-based Flowers Industries because Chief
Executive Amos McMullian was on the board of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation. The conservative foundation had sued to overturn the
city of Atlanta's minority contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   McMullian immediately resigned from the board and said the
company would no longer make donations to the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for quick response is that a boycott, especially a
long one, can tarnish a target's image.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, ``there are lingering perceptions out there that
only time will correct,'' said DeRaad. This summer, the National
Association of Black Journalists will host its annual convention in
Phoenix, which DeRaad considers a ``big coup.''
</P>
<P>
   In Charleston, Ballenger worries that no matter the outcome,
many consumers will view South Carolina ``as a state full of
racists, when that isn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia tourism officials don't want that to happen here.
Already, there have been calls from concerned convention planners.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Allen Rubin, president of the 800-member
Society for Social Work and Research, spent several days on the
phone trying to get a status report on a boycott of Georgia because
the group planned to hold its annual meeting here in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had a boycott been called, we were going to pull out of the
meeting because we support the cause,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau is among
organizations working to change the flag.
</P>
<P>
   A boycott would ``have a very direct impact over the next couple
of years of potentially $100 million,'' said Bill Howard, vice
president of tourism and public relations. ``But future bookings
and the impact in terms of Atlanta's image and Georgia's image
globally will probably have far more serious consequences than that
of $100 million.''

COKE EXECUTIVE TO BECOME CHIEF OF MOTLEY FOOL  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Motley Fool is expected to announce Tuesday that C. Patrick
Garner, a Coca-Cola Co. executive, will become its new chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, 52, was most recently president of Coca-Cola's Southeast
and West Asia division and has spent three decades at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat comes with a lot of operating experience, brand experience
and tremendous intellectual curiosity,'' said Tom Gardner, a
founder of the Motley Fool. He noted that it had recently added
several experienced executives to its management team.
</P>
<P>
   Created as a newsletter in 1993, the Motley Fool has developed
into a popular personal finance site on the Internet. It features
irreverent stock commentary by Gardner and his brother, David, and
lively participation from the site's thousands of daily users. The
company, which is based in Alexandria, Va., has about 320 employees
and has sites in Britain and Germany. It does not disclose its
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has no immediate plans to go public, it
expects to do so at some point, Tom Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardner brothers will continue to serve as co-chairmen of
the company, focusing on strategy and extending the Fool brand in
other countries and venues. ``Tom and David are really the
ambassadors of this business,'' Garner said. Erik Rydholm, who also
helped found the business, will continue to oversee its operations
and production.

 &HT;    GORE TO UNVEIL ANTI-CRIME PACKAGE IN ATLANTA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore will unveil a comprehensive
anti-crime package in an Atlanta address Tuesday, including $1.3
billion in spending for new police officers and crime-fighting
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will propose that the federal government provide funds to
help local communities hire 50,000 new police officers, building on
the initiative of the Clinton administration to add 100,000
officers to America's streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore package will also include a proposed constitutional
amendment guaranteeing victims' rights in the criminal justice
system, new anti-gang laws, and a requirement that prisoners be
free of drugs before being released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will also propose resurrecting a special
trust fund created by Congress six years ago to target violent
crime. The trust fund was part of the 1994 crime bill, but has
since expired.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has criticized Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for
supporting laws allowing private citizens to carry concealed
handguns, the vice president will call for allowing off-duty police
officers to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is expected Tuesday to argue that a tax cut promoted by
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, would limit the federal
government's attempt to help local governments fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech is his first major address on crime since securing
the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the second time Gore has chosen Atlanta for a major
policy speech. The first was last year, when he proposed allowing a
greater role for faith-based organizations in providing social
services.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said Monday night there was
no particular reason why Atlanta was chosen as the site for the
vice president's anti-crime speech.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``Georgia is a critical state in the general
election, and Georgians will see a lot of Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speech marks a major departure in Gore's comments
about crime in the United States. Until now, most of his comments
on the issue have focused on the proliferation of handguns and his
push for more gun control and safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   There is little new in the Gore package, however. The Clinton
administration secured funding in Congress in 1994 to place 100,000
new police officers in communities across America. But by early
this year, only about half that number of officers had been hired
and deployed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is currently debating a proposed constitutional
amendment that would grant crime victims and their families the
right to reasonable notice of court proceedings and an offender's
release or escape.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively new idea, though, is Gore's proposal to halt the
``revolving door'' involving criminals and illegal drugs. Gore is
calling for about $400 million in drug treatment and testing for
those who enter the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   While providing treatment, the proposal would require an
offender to be drug-free in order to be released from the system.
Once released, parolees would have to undergo drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore will propose funding to help communities
obtain ``crime mapping'' computer software to help them establish
patterns of criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-crime package also calls for new laws giving
communities the authority to seek injunctions and other legal
remedies against gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials could not be reached Monday night for
elaboration of some of the key elements of the package. Bush
campaign representatives could not be reached for reaction.

2 CONGRESSMEN ARE FETED IN CHINA TO WIN THEIR VOTES FOR TRADE
ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)  By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Measured on a per-vote basis, it was probably
one of the more expensive lobbying efforts ever undertaken by the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to sway legislators who remain undecided on whether to
grant China permanent normal trade relations in a vote set for this
month, President Clinton set aside money earlier this year to fly
wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and human
rights conditions for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, only two undecided congressmen showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Two trips had originally been proposed, one led by Commerce
Secretary William Daley and another by Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman. But these quickly became political no-flight zones for
politicians worried about coming under attack by organized labor,
which argues that permanent trade status would erode human rights
in China and cost American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So Daley's trip, which was to have included a dozen legislators,
was ``consolidated'' with that of Glickman's. And when Glickman
lifted off from Andrews Air Force Base last week, he had only the
two undecided congressmen in tow _ and administration officials
were refusing to identify them until the flight had left, lest they
be pressured at the last minute to drop out of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   And so began the education of Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., and
Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, neither of whom had been to China
before. They were treated royally in Beijing, where they met with a
deputy prime minister and watched the sun rise over the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   In Shanghai, they had a private audience with China's chief
negotiator with Taiwan. And in Hong Kong, they met with the chief
executive of China's newly reclaimed territory and dined with its
business elite at the exclusive, 1930s-style China Club.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen administration officials accompanied them from
Washington, as well as two congressmen who support making China's
trade status permanent. And dozens more people chaperoned the men
from place to place on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks and Hinojosa seemed bemused by so much attention,
sometimes falling behind the throng that moved through a program
meant to show them how much the United States would lose if it did
not grant China the permanent trade status. China's favorable
status has been subject to annual review by Congress since the
military suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen
Square in 1989, though it has always been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks appeared particularly suspicious of the over-orchestrated
show, and skipped a supermarket visit in Shanghai in order to meet
with common folk. With a consular official translating at his side,
Meeks trudged up the stairs of a middle-class apartment block and
along the dirt paths of a migrant worker neighborhood in his gray
summer suit and alligator shoes, addressing startled Chinese along
the way with his big American hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like China?'' he asked a young migrant from Anhui
province who invited him into her barren, whitewashed room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I do,'' she replied, ``I'm Chinese!''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks questioned everyone he met about human rights (``I've
never had any trouble,'' one elderly man replied in a typical
exchange) and what they thought about China joining the World Trade
Organization (``Well, of course you should support it, we want to
compete with the rest of the world,'' said Cui Qian, a middle-aged
businesswoman).
</P>
<P>
   Between stops, he fought to reconcile what he had heard from the
labor unions in Washington with what he saw in China. He detected
none of the repression or exploitation so often talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese seem to think that economics are more important to
them than whatever form of government they have right now,'' he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks was uncertain what advantage labor unions could expect if
Congress does not grant China permanent trade status when it votes
on the measure later this month. ``That's something I'll have to
ask them,'' Meeks said, noting that the issue is muddled even in
his own district, the borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service, which has a large operation at Kennedy
International Airport, supports permanent trade status and China's
membership in the WTO because the company is lobbying for a cargo
route to China. The Teamsters support the UPS in that bid for the
new route, which would create union jobs, but are nonetheless
lobbying against permanent normal trade relations, or PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meeks and Hinojosa watched workers in camouflage fatigues and
orange hardhats unload yellow sacks of American soybeans from
barges at a feed mill and cooking oil plant along Shanghai's muddy
Huangpu River. China is the biggest buyer of American soybeans and
is importing $700 million worth of them in the current
September-to-August season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of demand for imported soybeans in China and if
we don't give them PNTR that demand will go to the Argentinians or
the Brazilians,'' bellowed Philip Laney, a bearlike man who
represents the American Soybean Association in China and was on
hand to lobby the congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it will apply to enter the World Trade
Organization regardless of the congressional vote, and the United
States is unlikely to stand in its way _ in part because such a
move would infuriate Taiwan whose membership is being held up until
China joins.
</P>
<P>
   China's entry does not require Congress' support. And although
Clinton promised China during the negotiations that the annual
congressional review of its trade status would end, ``China can
come in regardless of what Congress votes, provided that the U.S.
representatives in the General Council and the Working Party
approve the conditions, along with the other member governments,''
said a Geneva-based trade official.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is sure exactly what would happen if Congress votes
against permanent normal trade relations, China could join and then
invoke Article XIII of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the
WTO, allowing Beijing to withhold from the United States
commitments it makes to other WTO members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States misses this opportunity it will actually
lose the tremendous market of China and will be giving away the
opportunity for participating in this market to its competitors,''
China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, said last month. ``In that
case, the United States, especially U.S. companies, will suffer the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   That has many American business people in China worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's government as no qualms about rewarding political
cooperation with economic opportunity,'' says Jeffery Bernstein,
founder of Emerge Logistics, which handles distribution of foreign
products on the mainland an industry likely to open most
dramatically to foreign participation if China joins the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeopardizing American companies' natural advantage in
distributing products provides a wonderful opportunity for our
European, Asia and Australian friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the American people are going to be able to take advantage
of what WTO has to offer, permanent normal trade relations must be
passed,'' says Larry Wortzel, director of the Heritage Foundation's
Asian Studies Center. He says that 20 percent of the shipping
containers passing through the port of Seattle are going to or
coming from China, and American union workers handle all of those
containers. More than 200,000 American jobs are directly related to
China trade, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives will vote on China's trade status
during the week of May 22. Legislators familiar with the vote say
it is still 10 to 15 votes short of passage.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been working with Rep. Sander Levin,
D-Mich., on ``parallel legislation'' that would set up a watchdog
congressional commission to review Chinese trade and human rights
policies and perhaps recommend sanctions against Beijing within the
limits of WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks and Hinojosa, for their part, remained undecided as they
headed home this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get a different feel once you have been here,'' Meeks
said. ``Theory and practice are two different things.''

JUSTICES REJECT RULING BASED ON RETROACTIVE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ill., La.)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday took an expansive view
of the Constitution's bar against retroactive legislation,
overturning a Texas man's sex abuse conviction on the ground that a
change in state law had made it easier for the prosecution to prove
its case than it would have been at the time the crime was
committed.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision was unusually interesting in several respects,
not the least of which was the extensive debate between the two
sides over the current meaning of one of the Supreme Court's
earliest important rulings, a case from 1798 called Calder vs.
Bull.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, and for many years after, that decision provided
the definitive interpretation of what the Constitution's framers
meant when they barred Congress and the states from passing any
``ex post facto law.'' The question for the court on Monday was
whether the broad definition adopted by Justice Samuel Chase's
opinion had been eroded by more modern cases, and the 40-page
majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that it had
not.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' lineup, cutting across all ideological boundaries
on the court, was another notable feature of the decision Monday.
Joining Stevens were Justices Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
wrote a dissenting opinion, which Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy
also signed.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning a ruling by the Texas Court of Appeals, the court
also rejected the Clinton administration's argument that the state
court had correctly taken a narrow view of the current meaning of
the ex post facto clause.
</P>
<P>
   There was no dispute on the court over the most commonly held
definitions of the ex post facto prohibition: that it prevents
prosecution for an act that was not a crime at the time it was
performed, as well as the imposition of a different or greater
punishment than conviction for a crime had previously entailed.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the debate was over whether an alteration of the rules
of evidence, in a manner that did not redefine the crime or the
punishment, could amount to an ex post facto violation. Texas, the
Texas courts, the Clinton administration and the dissenters
maintained that it could not. The majority held that it could,
finding that the state's relaxation of an evidentiary rule for
prosecuting sex crimes had an effect, as applied to the defendant
in this case, that was ``as grossly unfair'' as any of the other,
more common examples of ex post facto legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Scott L. Carmell, who made a living counseling
victims of incest, was convicted on 15 counts of sexually abusing
his teen-age stepdaughter from 1991 to 1995, when the girl was 12
to 15 years old. At issue in the case, Carmell vs. Texas, No.
98-7540, were the four of the 15 convictions that were affected by
a 1993 change in the Texas criminal sex offense law.
</P>
<P>
   Before that time, in the absence of corroboration, a person
could be convicted on the victim's testimony alone only if the
victim had told someone else about the offense within six months, a
requirement known as an ``outcry'' provision. But there was an
exception for victims under the age of 14, as to whom there was no
separate requirement for either corroboration or for having told
another person; on the young victim's testimony alone, the
prosecution could try to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
that the crime occurred as the victim alleged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Texas Legislature raised to 18 from 14 the age at
which there did not have to be an outcry. At Carmell's 1997 trial,
the state applied the amended law. Because the victim had not made
the required ``outcry,'' this made possible Carmell's prosecution
for the four incidents that occurred after his stepdaughter's 14th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision overturning the four convictions is not
likely to have an effect on Carmell; he is serving two life
sentences for his conviction on the two most serious charges of
aggravated sexual assault that occurred before the girl was 14 and
that were not at issue in his appeal. The 11 remaining convictions
together drew a 20-year concurrent sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Appeals upheld Carmell's conviction on the
four disputed counts, ruling that the application of the amended
law was not an ex post facto violation because the amendment
involved a procedural rule and ``does not increase the punishment
nor change the elements of the offense that the state must prove.''
</P>
<P>
   In overturning that decision on Monday, Stevens said the
amendment did something equally important: It ``changed the quantum
of evidence necessary to sustain a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the law in effect at the time the acts were committed,
the prosecution's case was legally insufficient,'' Stevens said,
noting that Carmell would have been legally entitled to a judgment
of acquittal. Only by applying the amendment, he said, was the
state able to take its case to a jury based solely on the victim's
uncorroborated testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elements of unfairness and injustice in subverting the
presumption of innocence are directly implicated by rules lowering
the quantum of evidence required to convict,'' Stevens said. ``Such
rules will always run in the prosecution's favor, because they
always make it easier to convict the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in ordinary procedural rules that do not involve the
sufficiency of the evidence needed for a conviction would not
necessarily be in violation of the ex post facto prohibition, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In her dissenting opinion, Ginsburg said that in its ``expansive
new reading'' of the ex post facto clause, the majority
misconstrued the Texas amendment as changing the amount of evidence
the prosecution needed. She said the amendment did not lower the
``sufficiency of the evidence hurdle; it simply expanded the range
of methods the state could use to surmount it.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendment was more accurately described as a ``rule of
admissibility,'' Ginsburg said, and its retroactive application was
not inconsistent with the ``fundamental purposes'' of the ex post
facto clause. She described those purposes as ``ensuring fair
notice so that individuals can rely on the laws in force at the
time they engage in conduct and sustaining the separation of powers
while preventing the passage of vindictive legislation.''

</P>
<P>
   These developments also occurred Monday at the court:
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Compensatory Time
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 6-3, that state and local governments could
require their employees to use their accumulated compensatory time
by taking paid time off, even if the employees would prefer to keep
accumulating ``comp days.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Christensen vs. Harris County, No. 98-1167, upheld
a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
It does not apply to private sector employment, where employers are
generally required by the Fair Labor Standards Act to compensate
their employees in cash for overtime work.
</P>
<P>
   A 1985 amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, intended to
cushion the impact of a Supreme Court decision that upheld the
application of federal wages and hours standards to the states,
permitted public employers to use comp time instead of cash
overtime if their employees agreed. Over certain maximums, cash
still has to be paid, and the employer also retains the option of
paying cash for unused time.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Harris County, Texas, wanted to limit its eventual
liability by requiring its deputy sheriffs to use up their
accumulated comp time. The lower federal courts disagreed on
whether employers could impose such a requirement without the
employees' agreement. In this case, the deputy sheriffs filed suit
with the support of the Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Thomas said there was nothing in the Fair
Labor Standards Act amendment to prohibit employers from adopting
such a policy. He said the Labor Department's informal
interpretation to the contrary was not a formal regulation and was
not entitled to the court's deference. Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Search Warrant
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating that the convoluted law of search and seizure
never runs out of new permutations, the court accepted an appeal by
the state of Illinois and agreed to decide whether the police could
stop people from entering their own homes during the time it takes
to get a search warrant for the property.
</P>
<P>
   In a splintered 1984 decision, the court suggested that the
police could secure the premises from the inside, but did not
resolve whether they could effectively evict the occupant to
prevent destruction of evidence during the hours it took for a
search warrant to be issued.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Illinois vs. McArthur, No. 99-1132, the state is
appealing a ruling by the Illinois Appellate Court. Suppressing
evidence of the marijuana that police in Sullivan, Ill., found in a
trailer when they eventually executed a search warrant, the state
court said the refusal to allow the trailer's owner to enter during
the two-hour wait for the warrant amounted to an unconstitutional
seizure.

IN PITTSBURGH, A REDEVELOPMENT TOO FAR?

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ There have been so many blockbuster redevelopment
projects in this gritty, resilient city in the past six years that
a corner of Mayor Thomas Murphy's office is cluttered with
ceremonial shovels that gleam with his dig-we-must determination.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing from that proud display, however, is the
groundbreaker spade for one of the mayor's most controversial ideas
_ a plan to raze or gut 61 buildings and displace up to 125
businesses in one fell swoop through the tattered old retail core
of downtown Pittsburgh. In their place, Murphy envisions an
ambitious cluster of trendy restaurants, upscale national stores
and underground parking for 1,000 cars to serve surrounding office
towers and perchance lure affluent suburban shoppers back to their
urban roots.
</P>
<P>
   It is such a sweeping plan that, even beyond the cries of
outrage from longtime merchants still able to make a profit in
Market Place, the area in question, Murphy has drawn no less an
adversary than the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which
calls the plan ``one of the most wrongheaded revitalization
proposals to appear anywhere in this country in the last 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the warning of Richard Moe, president of the trust,
which is based in Washington and is the nation's largest private
preservation organization. Moe calls the Pittsburgh plan a
``reversion to the worst of urban renewal in the '60s and '70s,''
when whole neighborhoods were swept away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anomaly,'' Moe said, describing how the national trend
in most other cities is to selectively revitalize and showcase
time-worn neighborhoods, rather than to replace them wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   From LoDo in Denver to South Beach in Miami, from the Lowerton
district of St. Paul, Minn., to the 7th Street renewal in
Washington, preservationists are citing dozens of less sweeping,
more selective renovation programs across the country as profitable
success stories that Pittsburgh would be wiser to emulate. But the
mayor insists he needs something fast and singular, on the scale of
the Copley Plaza renewal in Boston, to save downtown Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   For all the opposition here and beyond, Murphy offers a smile of
resolve and an encyclopedic accounting of the city's hard-earned
recovery since the catastrophic collapse of its steel mill economy
a generation ago. In $4 billion worth of current projects, he cites
two new ballparks, a new convention center and hotels, office
complexes offering 6,000 new jobs and a dozen other downtown
projects. The weary looking Market Place stretch, he insists, is
``the hole in the doughnut'' that absolutely must be redone to make
the urban whole palatable to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In virtually everything we've done, from building ballparks to
dealing with old industrial properties, we have faced enormous
resistance,'' the mayor said, looking beyond his office shovels at
a master-plan map vivid with splotches of large-scale change.
``Every one of these has been a struggle; it's the nature of
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics demanding a more tempered approach, Murphy, a
56-year-old son of a steelworker who rose from the nitty-gritty of
civic politics to wield mayoral power, replies that the city has
well employed the selective ``Main Street'' style of renewing
building by building in other old neighborhoods. But the Market
Place area, he insists, requires something more extensive and
faster _ a single project of urban renewal that he wants completed
in two to three years rather than 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The urgency we feel,'' the mayor emphasized, is rooted in the
fact that the region has been losing residents for 30 years, with
the city fighting to secure a more eclectic future as its
population fades to 350,000, half of its old blue collar high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Across the executive corridor, City Councilman Jim Ferlo exults
no less in the city's resurgent pattern of fresh development. But
he draws the line at the mayor's Market Place proposal, viewing it
as ultimately more arrogant than ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers there have been paying their tax bills for a hundred
years, and suddenly they're blights on the city?'' said Ferlo, a
Democrat like the mayor in this one-party city.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman complains that some of those very taxes would
subsidize the arrival of national chains that would then enjoy a
monopoly position in the $480-million redevelopment, which would
cover about five acres radiating from Fifth and Forbes Avenues.
Murphy says the plan would involve $53 million in city subsidies,
but opponents estimate it would be twice that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction would mean five years of social chaos,''
Ferlo said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most other opponents, Ferlo agrees that a stylish but far
more measured upgrading is badly needed in the area. It now
presents a tired mix of seedy novelty shops and respected longtime
merchants like the 130-year-old Original Oyster House, one of
several establishments that would be exempted from removal under
the mayor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabriel's shoe repair around the corner would have to go, as
would other humbler shops revered by neighborhood regulars like
Bernie Lynch, a volunteer leader of the fight against Murphy's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd destroy a real historic district to build a pretend
historic district,'' said Lynch, strolling the neighborhood and
savoring her first-name familiarity with merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is offering a leasing agent's dream and a city's
nightmare,'' she said, adding that the Institute for Justice in
Washington was already preparing a lawsuit for the local owners who
would be displaced by national competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor denies Lynch's contention that the project would be a
thinly disguised mall.
</P>
<P>
   He said the three-story scale of the neighborhood would be
retained, along with up to 20 existing building facades. Critics
like Moe concede that there are few pure landmark buildings at
stake. Rather, opponents say it is the overall character of one of
the city's oldest neighborhoods that would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, coalescing as the Golden Triangle Community
Development Corp., has offered a $256 million counterproposal to
rehabilitate facades and modernize the area's dilapidated upper
floors for business and housing. Murphy, trying to finesse the five
votes he needs on the nine-member City Council, recently added some
housing to his plan.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome remains uncertain, with the proposal not yet
formally submitted and some Council members underlining the failure
of an earlier mayoral initiative, the construction of a Lazarus
department store two years ago. It was built downtown with $48
million in public subsidies and a guarantee to pay no city rent
until it reaches $41 million in annual sales, a level it has thus
far failed to approach.
</P>
<P>
   Down at ground zero, Patty Maloney, a local card store merchant
on Wood Street, offered hearty laughter at the mayor's promise to
help relocate the scores of displaced retailers to within a
10-minute walk of their Market Place roots. As president of the
Golden Triangle association, Maloney said she had found only 30
open retail locations for all the displaced, none of them
comparable to what they have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is we own this building, picked the location, took
the risk and built this business up _ we did everything we were
supposed to do,'' she said, asking how a conglomerate of upscale
newcomers given a monopoly franchise could match that investment in
the city and its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chains can't do the things local businesses can do in the
neighborhood,'' Maloney asserted, denying the mayor's complaint
that merchants have let the area drift downward for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people aren't leaving this city because there's no
Banana Republic, no Pottery Barn downtown,'' Maloney argued,
emphasizing the need for high-technology jobs that she said could
be invited by creating office space above existing shops.
</P>
<P>
   But it is this very need for jobs that Murphy insists can only
be solved by the image of a fresh Pittsburgh renewed at its very
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to create a scale of development that changes the
dynamic of downtown,'' he said, warning against the alternative of
incremental change. ``We need to move more quickly,'' he added, at
once treasuring and regretting what he described as the city's
small-town resistance to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old joke we have about ourselves in Pittsburgh,''
the mayor said. ``It goes: If the world ends, you want to be living
in Pittsburgh because you'll have 10 more years to live.''

ACTORS STOP MAKING COMMERCIALS IN DISPUTE OVER RESIDUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in 12 years, the Screen Actors
Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists
called on their combined membership of about 135,000 actors to stop
working on all television and radio commercials at 12:01 a.m.
Monday until an agreement could be reached with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Residual payments for commercial work are at the heart of the
disagreement between the actors _ who rallied Monday here and in
New York, Chicago and San Francisco _ and television and radio
advertisers. For years, actors in commercials used on network
television have received payments every time an ad runs in a
practice known as ``pay per play.'' For commercials on cable
television actors receive a flat rate.
</P>
<P>
   A placard stating ``Please Don't Squeeze the Actor'' summed up
the attitude of an estimated 2,000 actors as they marched Monday
down Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the marchers, Frank Simmons, an actor, said the disparity
between the two sides could be vast. For example, he cited the
residual payments he received for working in a recent General
Motors commercial. Over a three-month period on cable, he said he
received a flat-fee payment of $1,100, although the commercial was
shown several times a day. During the same period on the networks,
he said the commercial brought him nearly $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as good as economic times are going to get and
by suggesting to get rid of residuals they're basically asking for
a pay cut,'' said Greg Krizman, a spokesman for the guilds.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial advertisers want the flat-rate used by cable to be
adopted across the board while the unions want to see pay-per-play
extended to cable advertising. Under the advertisers' most recent
proposal, the lead actor's fees for unlimited use of a commercial
on cable in a 13-week cycle would increase 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Actors' representatives say that times have changed since they
negotiated flat-rate portion of their contract. In those days,
cable was a struggling enterprise and unions across the country
were making concessions during hard economic times.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's booming economy, with cable television well
entrenched union representatives say it is time to share the
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They boast of record profits,'' said Todd Amorde, a Screen
Actors Guild board member and joint chairman of the unions' strike
committee. ``We want our fair share. It's very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers counter that with the decline in network viewership
and an audience dispersed over a greater number of networks, they
must show a commercial more often to reach viewers. They have
contended that the unions' demands would increase the cost of cable
television commercials by 350 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for advertisers did not respond to telephone
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the two groups broke down in mid-April and
attempts in recent days by federal mediators to bring the two
groups back together were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Screen Actors and American Federation representatives, who have
said they would attempt to shut down production on television and
radio commercials made after the strike began, said they knew of no
production going on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Posell, an entertainment lawyer who represents
production companies, said he knew of no companies that were
shooting Monday and predicted they would not work, at least in the
United States, during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of commercial business is an enormous blow to the
entertainment community and the economy at large particularly Los
Angeles and New York,'' Posell said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that commercial production is estimated to represent
about 60 percent of Screen Actors Guild income, or about $720
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money,'' he said. ``It's going to effect not
only the production business but I think the economy of Southern
California.''
</P>
<P>
   For the actors, the issue is one of fairness. Along with the
residual payments, they are calling for an independent monitoring
system to track when commercials are shown and they are asking
advertisers to negotiate how actors will be paid for work broadcast
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were bracing for a long haul. The last strike lasted
three weeks and this is expected to go longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly seem to be at a crossroads situation,'' Krizman
said, ``where we're trying to go in one direction and they're going
in another.''

MAN ACCUSED OF SOCCER ASSAULT MAY BE DEPORTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oscar Peralta's two-month ordeal with the Harris
County District Attorney's Office may have ended with a deal
negotiated by his attorneys Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the alleged soccer-field assailant's problems with U.S.
immigration authorities have just begun.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mexican national was released from the county jail
early Sunday, immigration officials were waiting at the door.
Peralta, whose assault trial ended in a hung jury Friday, was
whisked away to a federal detention facility in Houston, where he
now awaits possible deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Immigration and Naturalization Service
haven't decided yet, but they say it is unlikely the undocumented
immigrant will be allowed to stay in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's here illegally, he doesn't have a right to stay in
this country,'' said Luisa Aquino-Fine, of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The INS move to take custody of Peralta served to further cloud
his future. His attorneys expressed concern that their negotiations
with the county might even put them in conflict with the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The county offered a diversion of prosecution, which means
Peralta would be on a sort of parole by performing community
service for less than a year, with no more jail time than what he
has already served, about nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta's attorneys accepted the deal Monday, though it still
must be approved by Harris County Court at-Law Judge James Anderson
in a Wednesday hearing. But if the INS deports him, Peralta would
obviously violate the deal, since he wouldn't be here to perform
the community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the INS going to do now that he's in their custody?''
asked Herman Martinez, one of Peralta's attorneys. ``That's the
battle now.''
</P>
<P>
   Peralta, 20, was involved in a collision with Keith Martin, 17,
during a state youth soccer tournament game in the Houston area
last December. Martin elbowed Peralta in the head, and Peralta then
smacked Martin in the mouth, bending back four of his teeth and
drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and his father reported the incident to police, and the
District Attorney's Office filed charges. Police arrested Peralta
at his high school classroom in the Texas border town of Mission on
Feb. 22. He had been in jail ever since, unable to post his $25,000
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta's attorneys complain that he has received unfair
treatment, but prosecutors reject that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea there's some kind of big conspiracy in this case is
a bunch of bunk,'' said Assistant District Attorney Lyn McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said he has no control over the INS, but it will
sometimes wait to deport someone until a case is completed. So,
McClellan speculated, the federal authorities might let Peralta
stay in the country while his deferred prosecution plays out.

VIEWERS SCRAMBLE FOR A SIGNAL OF THEIR BLACKED-OUT PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Ramer, an assistant district attorney in the
Bronx, watches ``Eyewitness News'' on WABC-TV here to keep up with
breaking crime stories and spends late evenings with Ted and Sunday
mornings with Cokie and Sam. He's also a big fan of other ABC
programs like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't count Ramer among the millions of Time Warner Cable
subscribers across the country who woke up Monday to find that one
of their favorite networks had gone dark. He took action 10 days
ago just to forestall such disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Ramer and his neighbors got together and bought a satellite dish
for their brownstone in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Each of
the five families was able to get a service package from Direct TV
for about $40 a month _ $20 less than Ramer was paying for cable
service from Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   For Ramer, the dispute between American Broadcasting Cos. and
Time Warner ``turned out to be a blessing in disguise,'' he said.
``You really think you have only one option,'' he added, ``and it's
not until you are forced into action that you realize that as a
consumer, you have a right to better service.''
</P>
<P>
   But for other television viewers _ whether they are addicted to
one of ABC's long-running daytime soap operas or the surprise hit
``Who Wants to be a Millionaire?'' _ the timing of the blackout was
especially irritating. It arrived just at the start of the May
sweeps period, when the competition for ratings heats up and
viewers can expect special developments _ the return of a
much-missed character of ``All My Children,'' for example, or more
celebrity contestants on ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite providers like Direct TV and EchoStar Communications
hope to capitalize on that unhappiness. They say the disruption is
likely to prove a bonanza, pushing many people who have been
contemplating switching into finally acting. Both companies said
sales had already increased in Houston, where the Time
Warner-Disney squabble first surfaced in March.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing the window of opportunity, Echostar is running an
advertising campaign advising that ABC programs can be seen through
the company's Dish TV service and offering a free dish, receiver
and remote control plus installation to cable customers, said
Judianne Atencio, an Echostar spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the ABC affiliate in Houston gave Time Warner
customers more than 4,000 vouchers that could be redeemed for
Direct TV satellite dishes. The two companies are close to signing
another agreement that would include rebates on both the dish and
the installation, said Robert A. Marsocci, a Direct TV spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back, Time Warner pointed out that subscribers could
still watch ABC programs by installing an A/B switch and an antenna
and offered to reimburse them up to $15 for the cost. Tony
Magoulas, a spokesman for Radio Shack, said it was too early to
tell if the tactic was working. But he said one store in Houston
had reported a tenfold increase in antenna sales.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani scoffed at the antenna idea as ``stupid''
in New York, which has so many tall buildings. Similarly, satellite
dishes are not always a practical option for Manhattan residents _
unless their apartment includes a balcony. Another company, RCN
Corp., hopes to lure some high-rise-dwelling Time Warner customers
into signing up for a package that includes telephone service, a
high-speed Internet connection and cable. RCN now serves 70,000
customers in the 800 Manhattan buildings equipped with the
company's fiber optic cable and is weighing whether to step up its
marketing efforts, said Valerie C. Haertel, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Time Warner Cable offices were flooded with complaints.
By 10 a.m., the company's Los Angeles division had received 300
calls _ half from people who were angry about the service
disruption and half from people who were concerned that their rates
might be affected, said Robert Moel, a Time Warner vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Other people voiced their complaints directly to Soap Opera
Digest, a weekly publication with a circulation of 1 million.
``Think about the investment these people make in their shows _ the
amount of ime they spend and the passion they feel,'' said Lynn
Leahey, the editor in chief. She recalled that when some of the
soaps were pre-empted for the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, some
viewers never came back. &QL;

<P>
   ``Cupid &AMP; Cate,'' based on a novel with the significantly less
alliterative title ``Cupid and Diana,'' could've been structured a
little more efficiently. The romantic telefilm spends its first
hour spinning its narrative wheels, protractedly spelling out its
fairly simplistic plot complications; then, in a 15-minute spate, a
whole bunch of things happen. The final 45 minutes are given over
to the rote resolution of that brief, calamitous spurt of
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin (Mary-Louise Parker) runs a vintage clothing store she
bought from a family pal (Oscar winner Brenda Fricker, in what
passes for a colorful character here). She's involved with a guy
who, it's made intractably clear in his first minute of screen
time, is all wrong for her _ his engagement pitch is, ``We make a
good team _ I want you to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   She meets Mr. Perfect (Peter Gallagher), who tells her, ``I
think you're somethin', and very beautiful, too.'' Her heart so
melts that when he asks her on a date, she responds, ``Whatever'';
she waffles undramatically over whom she should wind up with.
</P>
<P>
   By then, a whole new crop of crises has arisen. Trouble is,
they're just nominally interesting, and at this point, the viewer's
good will toward the proceedings has probably dissipated. In
between, there's a whole lot of establishing shots, not to mention
images of cars pulling up to and folks sauntering up to their
destinations that helps sap any tension that might be developing.
Most network series could've dispensed with the plot here in a mere
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's too prosaic here to carry the proceedings, particularly
playing a character weary of the staid status quo _ she seems a
card-carrying member of it. Joanna Going, as her ditzy/wise sister
Cynthia, boasts a lot more spark and verve; she would've made a
much livelier headliner. Gallagher exudes a low-key charm; the rest
of the cast members hit their marks competently. Fricker's big
moment comes in a brief monologue extolling the virtues of
fertilizer; she must be plenty at home here. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Cupid &AMP; Cate.'' &QL; 
What: Romantic tale of a restless woman bristling against family
dynamics. &QL;

   So Drew Carey wanted to stretch _ can't blame the guy for that.
He's a deadpan-funny presence who enjoys pushing cynical/naughty
buttons on his sitcom, but go figure, he wanted to prove he has not
only a heart but vocal chords, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, ``The Wonderful World of Disney's Geppetto,'' a musical
(using the term advisedly) from the point of view of Pinocchio's
toy- maker creator. This being a Disney production, it opens with a
number in which children extol the virtues of acquiring as many
toys as possible (the filmmakers exercise restraint in not shooting
this sequence in a Disney Store).
</P>
<P>
   Geppetto pines for a son, then, from pine (or an inexpensive
wood substitute), crafts one (Seth Adkins, under some icky makeup).
Pinocchio rebels, dully; the Blue Fairy (an amiably twittering
Julia Louis-Dreyfuss), the wicked Stromboli (amusingly essayed by
Brent Spiner), the insidious Buonragazzo (Rene Auberjonois as his
most blustery) and an inept Magician (a game but underused Wayne
Brady) variously abet and obfuscate Geppetto's efforts to bond with
his chip off the old block.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe Carey has a heart _ hard to tell; any real emotions
get lost in the clutter of a busy, almost desperate-seeming
production (also, Carey's a little self-conscious about his acting
_ check out his amateurish double-take when he learns Pinocchio has
gotten into trouble at school). Clearly, though, the comic lacks
the pipes to carry the sort of simperingly tuneless ballads foisted
upon him here.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just about anyone would be at sea with this material;
composer Stephen Schwartz seems to have knocked off the whole
musical in an afternoon or two. The lyrics have some clever rhymes,
but more often they're forced and strangulated, and there's not a
memorable melody in the whole melange. As a result, the dancing is
either tentative (Carey and Louis-Dreyfuss mainly concentrate on
not stepping on anyone's feet) or a jumble of motion for motion's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Tom Moore from a witless script by David Stern,
The thinking seems to be if there are enough vivid colors and
random activity and gobs of plain-old busy-ness littering the
screen, viewers might be distracted from noticing what a mess
everything is. It's sort of the ``Howard the Duck'' of TV musicals.
</P>
<P>
   _____ &QL; 
The show: ``Geppetto''' &QL;

creator. &QL;

RELIEF GROUPS FEAR AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL FROM RED CROSS FEDERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Concern is spreading among international relief
organizations that the American Red Cross may be on the verge of
withdrawing from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies because the umbrella organization has not agreed
to immediately admit an Israeli contingent under a Star of David
flag.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross, under its new president, Dr. Bernadine
Healy, who took office in July, , has already withheld $5 million
in dues from the international federation, based in Geneva, which
relief experts say was a significant blow to the organization from
its largest member. The federation serves as a secretariat for 176
national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of American participation in the international
federation is expected to be raised at a national conference of the
American Red Cross from May 19 to 21. Several requests for comment
from the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington were not
answered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   American contributions of about $350,000 are also being withheld
from the International Committee of the Red Cross, an independent,
Swiss-based organization that works among civilians in battle areas
and visits prisoners of war, among other functions.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross and Red Crescent societies deal with disaster relief.
The two organizations, while sharing the general goals of one
humanitarian movement, are not related in any organizational way.
</P>
<P>
   Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health,
who replaced Elizabeth Dole as Red Cross president last year, gave
almost immediate priority to a campaign for membership for the
Magen David Adom, or Red Shield of David, an organization whose
emblem is a six-pointed star. Red Cross officials say that it was
the United States, not Israel, that pressed the case strenuously in
meetings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Geneva, the ICRC, the federation and
representatives of governments reopened discussion on the
possibility of a neutral emblem that could serve as an alternative
for those countries _ not only Israel _ that did not want to use
the red cross or red crescent symbols. In the minds of many, those
symbols are linked with religious affiliation, although the Red
Cross argues that its symbol has no sectarian connotations and is
only the Swiss flag with colors reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lingering problem for decades,'' an aid official
said. Other nations have also asked to use their own symbols and
have been refused, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the neutral symbols suggested in recent years is a red
diamond, within the outline of which other symbols could be
incorporated. But the step would not be easy to take because the
1949 Geneva conventions would have to be rewritten and a special
international conference called. Only three symbols have ever been
recognized, the red cross, the crescent and a red lion and sun,
which was used briefly by Iran before the overthrow of Shah
Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.

BELL ATLANTIC IS SET TO OFFER PREPAID SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ark., Iowa, Kan., Mich., Nev., Ore., S.D., Wis., Calif.,
Idaho, Minn.)  (Exclusive)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maintaining its strong drive into the long-distance
telephone market, Bell Atlantic intends to introduce an innovative
calling plan Tuesday that appears less expensive than popular plans
offered by AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint, executives close to Bell
Atlantic said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bell Atlantic plan, to be called SmartTouch, offers
interstate long-distance calls for 8 cents a minute at any time and
without monthly fees or minimum charges. The most attractive
flat-rate calling plans from the established long-distance giants
generally include fixed fees or minimum charges of $5 a month or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The twist is that Bell Atlantic will require SmartTouch
customers to buy long-distance minutes in advance under a system
somewhat akin to prepaid calling cards. Generally using a credit
card, consumers will pay into a SmartTouch account that will then
be drawn down as the user makes long-distance calls. SmartTouch
customers will not receive a monthly bill and Bell Atlantic intends
to describe the prepaid nature of the plan as a way for
budget-conscious consumers to increase control over their
household's long-distance spending, executives close to the company
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Atlantic spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Bell Atlantic became the first regional Bell
company to win permission from federal regulators to offer
long-distance service in part of its traditional service region.
Last week, the company announced that it signed up 428,000
long-distance customers in New York in the first three months of
the year. While that represents only about 6 percent of Bell
Atlantic's New York customers, it was nonetheless a remarkably
robust figure.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has not won permission to sell long-distance
service in any of the other states where it is the dominant local
phone company, but Bell Atlantic is free to sell long-distance
products outside of the Eastern Seaboard. Bell Atlantic will
initially offer SmartTouch in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan,
Nevada, New York, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. The
company intends to extend the plan to California, Idaho and
Minnesota by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   SmartTouch users will not have to dial extra digits, like a
``10-10'' code, before placing a call. But after dialing a
long-distance number, SmartTouch users will hear a
computer-generated message informing them how much time is
remaining on their account. While some users will welcome the
reminder, others may consider it an annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Bell Atlantic intends to allow users to
automatically transfer money from a credit card to their SmartTouch
account when their calling balance runs low.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance titans offer plans with per-minute rates lower
than 8 cents, but those plans require monthly fees or minimum
charges. AT&AMP;T, for instance, sells interstate long-distance calls
for a flat rate of 5 cents a minute, but only to consumers who pay
a monthly fee of $8.95.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom offers a plan with no monthly fee, 9-cent calling
during the week and 5-cent calling on weekends. That plan requires
a $5 monthly minimum and asks that customers conduct all billing
and customer service via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's best flat-rate plan with no monthly fee and no monthly
minimum charges 30 cents a minute during the week and 10 cents a
minute on weekends.

LACK OF EFFORT A MYSTERY TO HITCHCOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If it was 1993 and these were the Dallas
Cowboys instead of the Dallas Stars of the new millennium, we'd
know without question or pretense that the head coach was blowing
smoke up our you-know-whats again.
</P>
<P>
   Just another ploy by that master psychologist, Jimmy Johnson,
we'd chuckle. Good ol' Dr. J.J., up to his old tricks. Team plays
well, he rants and raves as if they'd been beaten by three
touchdowns. Team plays sorry, he acts mild and unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early '90s, that was just Jimmy being Jimmy.
Everyone knew what he was doing, but it worked anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But these aren't the Cowboys, this isn't 1993 and this isn't
J.J. manipulating the media by tossing a red herring into our
midst.
</P>
<P>
   It's seven years later, these are the defending Stanley Cup
champion Dallas Stars and when Ken Hitchcock is frowning after a
1-0 playoff victory, usually his favorite kind, then maybe we all
should be pulling a pouty face.
</P>
<P>
   Not to suggest that the normally affable Hitch isn't smart
enough or cagey enough to use the media to get his message across.
He is, and he has. But his concern following Sunday night's
victory, the one that put the Stars up two games to none in the
best-of-seven series, which reconvenes tonight in San Jose, Calif.,
seems genuine enough.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: Hitchcock has less control of his team this
year than he did at this time last year, and that does not make the
head coach happy.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, in Hitch's mind at least, too many of his players,
particularly the forwards, once again weren't committed to the
program.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly a stop-the-press news bulletin, but it is an
aggravation at this stage of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the players sometimes buck Hitchcock's
system. There's a reason for that: It's no fun. It's hard work.
It's boring hockey, except maybe for the final minute, when you're
fighting off a full-scale, desperation 6-on-4 frontal assault.
</P>
<P>
   As Hitch likes to say: ``There's a price that has to be paid,
especially against a team like San Jose.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, not enough of his forwards _ Mike Modano being an
exception _ were willing to pay the price. It doesn't take a
telescope to see Hitch's finger pointed then, at people such as Joe
Nieuwendyk, Jamie Langenbrunner, Brett Hull, et al.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to Hitchcock that the Stars got away with it,
only that at this critical time of year that some still aren't
willing to put everything they have on the ice in every game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, this series is following almost the same blueprint
that the one against Edmonton did in its basic structure. Stars win
the first two at home and hit the road. Now, if this plays out like
the Edmonton series did, they'll split the two games in San Jose to
maintain the home ice advantage, return home with a 3-1 lead and
wrap it up Sunday at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plan anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock knows how difficult a venue San Jose can be. Next
to Edmonton, it might well be the loudest arena in the league.
Eddie Belfour, by far the single biggest reason the Stars hold this
2-0 advantage after brilliant back-to-back shutouts, doesn't
usually play well there.
</P>
<P>
   It's the trend, not the results, that causes Hitchcock to break
out in a cold sweat. Instead of heading home down 2-0 and
demoralized, the Sharks seemed to gain confidence from Sunday's
narrow defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our effort,'' Sharks center Vincent
Damphousse said. ``I feel bad about the result.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be difficult for the Sharks to change that result if
they don't get high-scoring center and team leader Owen Nolan back
tonight. He played poorly in Game 1, apparently because of an
injured right foot _ don't even ask him what the real problem is
because, under NHL rules, if he told you, he'd have to kill you _
and spent Game 2 sprawled on the trainer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan scored six goals and had two assists in the Sharks'
seven-game upset of the Blues, and if he can't return in this
series then the Fins are probably dead in the water anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the heart and soul of their team,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's condition doesn't really interest Hitchcock. He's always
said that the Stars need to be more concerned about their own play
than about what the other team might do.
</P>
<P>
   This Stars team is convinced it can turn it on and off at will.
At the end of the regular season, when the Stars were going winless
in their last five games, team leaders asked Hitchcock to back off
and not worry. They said publicly that they could turn the switch
back on when the playoffs began, and they did.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that at least some of them believe they can even
turn the switch on and off during a playoff series _ it was on
``off'' in Game 3 in Edmonton and in Game 2 against San Jose at
Reunion _ and still survive.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously the head coach isn't convinced that approach is the
right one at this perilous time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The only smoke he seems to be blowing is coming off the back of
his neck.

EMMITT SMITH HAS BIG EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ It was perhaps fitting that during an off-season of so
many changes for the Cowboys, Emmitt Smith showed up at Valley
Ranch yesterday, for the first time, a married man.
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to say that his April 22 wedding and Baja honeymoon
that followed were extremely important to him, but he also admitted
that it just didn't feel right being away from Valley Ranch during
a three-day voluntary minicamp over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was cheating myself,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   There probably is no one inside the Cowboys locker room who
takes winning and losing more seriously than No. 22. And while he
sees the additions of Joey Galloway, Jackie Harris, Michael Wiley,
et al, as being extremely positive for the Cowboys offense, Smith
also sees the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to be in Washington D.C., this past weekend and saw
part of the Redskins' minicamp on the news,'' said Smith. ``On
paper, these guys look to be unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Redskins lost out on the Galloway sweepstakes, they
quickly signed the NFL's No. 2 all-time sack leader Bruce Smith and
three-time Pro Bowl safety Mark Carrier to a defense that already
includes the likes of Dana Stubblefield, Dan ``Big Daddy''
Wilkinson, Darrell Green, Champ Bailey, and soon possibly Deion
Sanders, who is expected to be waived by the Cowboys on June 2 for
salary-cap purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, the Redskins look 10 times better than they were
last year,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Redskins added former Jets/Cardinals running
back Adrian Murrell while still trying to come to contract terms
with 1999 NFC rushing champion Stephen Davis, and they've backed up
quarterback Brad Johnson with 10-year veteran Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are the consensus favorite this season to win the
NFC East, if not the whole NFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never seen a `paper' winner win a game,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones' admission that the Chan Gailey offense was a
bad fit for Troy Aikman has brought the Cowboys back to the offense
that won three Super Bowls for them in the '90s. Jack Reilly
(offensive coordinator) and Ernie Zampese (passing-game consultant)
have been brought back after brief absences to mastermind how to
best utilize the double-edge, breakneck speed of Galloway and
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   James McKnight, Chris Brazzell, Jason Tucker and Wane McGarity
are vying for the third-receiver spot. When the Cowboys go with two
tight ends, which they will much of the time, Harris and David
LaFleur are expected to fill those roles.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the emphasis on upgrading the passing game, the
Cowboys are converting Wiley, a fifth-round pick from Ohio State,
into an all-purpose receiver who can work the middle of the field
either from the slot position or coming out of the backfield,
similar to the role that Chris Warren has filled the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Smith sees the bigger picture. He sees all this opening
up the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buy into the concept all the way around,'' Smith said of the
return to a more vertical passing attack that is expected to spawn
more big plays in 2000. ``But it's only a mindset until you
actually make the plays. You can throw it as much as you want, but
you have to make the plays to gain the respect \Rof opposing
defenses\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith yesterday recalled Alexander Wright, a world-class
sprinter from Auburn, who came to the Cowboys one pick after he did
in the 1990 draft. Wright was fast, but he was never considered a
big-play threat by opposing defenses because he didn't make enough
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is coming off both his busiest and his best season since
1995. Despite missing 10 quarters because of injuries
(hand/hamstring), he recorded his most carries (329) and his most
rushing yards (1,397) since the Cowboys' last successful Super Bowl
run in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our running game was looked upon last year as being very
solid, very consistent, while our passing game was looked upon as
being inconsistent ... no big plays at times,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``So while we went out and improved one area of the offense,''
Smith said, ``let's not forget about the other area that we need to
continue working on, the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're loading up to do one thing ... to stop the Cowboys,''
Smith said. ``And so I guess that means, hey, we ain't too
shabby.''

MICROSOFT SEEKS TO SUMMON WITNESSES TO CHALLENGE BREAKUP PLAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fighting to defeat the government's proposal to break the
company in two, Microsoft plans to ask the trial judge next week
for broad authority to obtain hundreds of pages of government
records on the case, and for permission to summon witnesses to
argue that the proposal is unwarranted and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their extreme request for relief invites questions on how they
came to the the observations and conclusions in their
declaration,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The effort could take many months, ``well into the fall,''
Neukom said. Government officials call this simply a stalling
tactic, possibly intended to delay the ruling on a remedy until the
next administration takes office. Microsoft denies that intent, and
outside experts note that the company might not gain any particular
advantage from a delay.
</P>
<P>
   If a new administration is more sympathetic to Microsoft, it
could in theory settle or drop the federal case at any time _ even
if an appeal was before the Supreme Court. But the case brought by
the 19 state attorneys general who are the Justice Department's
partners in the case would remain active. The attorneys general
have repeatedly said they will persevere no matter what the Justice
Department does.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it has lobbied both Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush to counter lobbying from its competitors. Bush
has made a few unspecific comments about the case sympathetic to
Microsoft, while Gore has declined to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general filed
their remedy request with the court in Washington on Friday. It
asks Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to split the company in two. One
company would hold the Windows operating system and the other,
Microsoft's application programs. The proposal also would impose a
range of restrictions on conduct while the breakup is being carried
out. Two states declined to join in the breakup proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is to file its response by May 10 and will make its
request for discovery and witness testimony. The government says
proper discovery can be accomplished in two or three weeks. But
while Neukom said Microsoft earnestly wanted to move the case to
the Court of Appeals as soon as possible, he said Microsoft would
need the extra time.
</P>
<P>
   Of the discovery request, one person who is close to the
government's case said, ``If a person is convicted of bank robbery,
does he have the right to find out how the prosecutor came up with
his sentence?''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock took a beating last week after the
government's intention to seek a breakup was reported. But Monday,
in the first trading session since the government plan was formally
submitted, Microsoft gained $3.6875, closing at $73.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Once the judge receives Microsoft's request, he is not bound to
accept it. Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase
quickly. Microsoft made a similar request for months of delay to
prepare for the opening of trial two years ago and Jackson rejected
it.
</P>
<P>
   The request for discovery and witnesses is just one of the
company's tactics for defeating the remedy request. Microsoft notes
that the government proposal makes expansive claims for the
increased competition likely to come from a breakup. Company
lawyers call that sheer speculation. But the government, Microsoft
says, ignores the efficiency benefits that come from having an
integrated company making both the Windows operating system and
Office applications.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University who advised
the Justice Department on an earlier Microsoft case, predicts that
the company's lawyers will investigate that issue in court.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, he notes, is a breakup, but the economics are
similar to those of two companies in adjacent markets that have
merged. And the Justice Department's own guidelines, Hall notes,
call for the government to give relatively more weight to
efficiencies in such mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a thoughtless neglect of efficiencies in the
government's analysis, and I think that will be an attractive
target for Microsoft,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that the government's breakup proposal will
make it far more difficult, if not impossible, for the company to
develop innovative products that result from putting together a
wide range of software technologies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft's Pocket PC software for hand-held
computers combines Windows software and Office technology in one
product. Similarly, its planned computer game product, the X-box,
to go on sale next year in competition with Sony, Nintendo and
Sega, uses technology from both Microsoft's operating-systems and
applications divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But a government official said nothing would prevent the two new
companies from collaborating on a product in most circumstances,
though the proposal does include specific anti-collusion
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The government's plan says the company's software tools
programs, which are used to create other programs, would go to the
applications company _ even the developers making tools for
Windows. That might seem to be an inefficient step, but it may not
be the wayward move it seems, according to some computer experts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and co-author of ``Microsoft Secrets,'' noted there was
already a lively market for makers of development tools for
Windows. Though skeptical that the government proposal will bring
much new competition, Cusumano is also skeptical about some of
Microsoft's arguments about the lost efficiency the software
industry may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be enormous incentives for the two companies to
work together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with those arguments, Brad Smith, deputy general counsel
for Microsoft, has extensively researched previous antitrust cases
and said none of them offered a clear parallel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's remedy proposal, and in public statements since
then, Justice Department officials pointed to the breakup of AT&AMP;T
as a precedent. But Smith argued Monday that the precedent was two
sided.
</P>
<P>
   While AT&AMP;T was broken up as part of a settlement in 1984, the
government also lifted decades-old government regulations that had
governed AT&AMP;T's business practices. ``And it was that
anti-regulatory aspect of the decree that allowed AT&AMP;T to enter new
markets and grow,'' Smith argued, ``while this proposal puts into
place many regulatory restrictions on our behavior'' in the
short-term conduct remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom added: ``Comparisons to AT&AMP;T are just wrongheaded.'' He
said the May 10 filing would make this point. A government official
noted, however, that new government regulations were also imposed
on AT&AMP;T and its former subsidiaries in 1984, many of which remain
in place today.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom also pointed to another piece of research from Smith's
work. ``Never,'' he said, ``has there been a litigated antitrust
case at the end of which a federal court has been asked to order
the divestiture'' of part of a unified company.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the previous cases, he and Smith said, the government
has split up a company along clear divisional lines _ AT&AMP;T and its
local phone companies, Paramount Pictures and its chain of movie
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in contrast, is a single company with different
products but less clear internal divisions. The government notes,
however, that the proposed split falls across a clear divisional
line at Microsoft. In the past, Microsoft executives said there was
a ``church-and-state separation'' between the operating system and
applications companies.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Neukom said, ``The court should proceed
cautiously.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few weeks ago, the seven members of the New York
City Board of Education found something odd in their mailboxes:
three Wallace Stevens poems, courtesy of Harold O. Levy, the
interim schools chancellor. ``Poetry,'' he wrote in an attached
memo, ``can give voice to the inner souls of people who lead
seemingly mundane lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the news that Levy was planning a series of lectures,
designed specifically for the enlightenment of the board members.
The first, scheduled for Tuesday night, will be on cosmology, the
study of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Levy will gather the school system's 43
superintendents for a group violin lesson at Carnegie Hall, taught
by none other than Isaac Stern.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   If the school system's top officials did not have enough to
worry about, with Levy pushing them to be more efficient and
accountable, now he wants them to be more thoughtful, too. Music
and poetry are among the more esoteric parts of his plan to raise
the level of debate on education policy, he says. That means
focusing less on administrative minutiae, and adding intellectual
rigor to the often tedious board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion is to change the areas of conversation,'' Levy said
in a interview, ``so that we are squarely confronting some of the
great philosophical questions of our day.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Levy has enlisted his friend, Jonathan Levi _ a
novelist, jazz violinist and founding editor of the literary
journal Granta _ to be the resident intellectual at 110 Livingston
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Levi, whose official title is Executive Assistant to the
Chancellor, says that his duties include bringing board members,
school officials and students ``into the secret society that is New
York City's intellectual culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they will go willingly is another question. After all,
the members of the Board of Education _ who are appointed by the
mayor and the borough presidents _ are known more for their
political allegiances than their intellectual pursuits. At least
one has suggested that Levy stick to being a manager and let them
choose their own enrichment activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part I'm ignoring it,'' said Ninfa Segarra, one
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's appointees to the board, referring to
the clippings that Levy has been circulating from Scientific
American, The New York Review of Books and other erudite journals.
``I guess he thinks we don't read on our own. But every single
board member gets Education Week. Most of us are pretty well versed
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Segarra said she had not decided whether to attend the lectures.
As for the poems, she said she had not received them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably if I had gotten it I would have thrown it out,'' she
said. ``I'm not a poetry kind of person. I like serial killer
novels.''
</P>
<P>
   Other board members appeared appreciative, or at least tolerant,
of what one wryly described as Levy's attempt to play Henry
Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very fine line between sharing information and
being viewed as arrogant,'' said William C. Thompson Jr., the board
president. ``But I don't think Harold has fallen on the side of
arrogant. I see this as Harold constantly thinking and sharing
ideas he finds exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cammarata, one of the three board members who fought
Levy's appointment, said his attempt to spark intellectual
discourse was appropriate because the board's primary
responsibility should be to debate and create policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 110 Livingston should be an intellectually enriching
experience for anyone who walks through the doors,'' Cammarata
said. ``We should be continually thirsting for information. If he
thinks this stuff is relevant, it would be imprudent and
disrespectful of us not to give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever their reaction to Levy's recent efforts, the board
members pointed out that they had been mulling ideas long before
Levy's appointment in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always swapping stuff around,'' said Terri Thomson, the
Queens member. ``The more we can learn together, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Thomson and four other board members have signed up to
attend the cosmology lecture, at the Museum of Natural History. The
speaker will be Neil deGrasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden
Planetarium, who will provide insights on how to teach such a
complex subject. In addition to board members and administrators,
Levy has invited several dozen of the city's science teachers. For
the second lecture, Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia,
will discuss the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for them to exercise their minds,'' Levi (his
name is pronounced with a long i), the son of a philosophy
professor at Columbia, said this week. ``We want them to be doing
mental push-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   For the district superintendents, Levy has already brought in
speakers like Jonathan Kozol, who has written extensively on urban
education, and Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a
Washington-based advocacy group for poor and minority students.
And, of course, they have the violin lesson to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Levi said he and his boss would not be foisting lectures and
clippings on the board _ and violin lessons on the superintendents
_ if they did not believe their audience was already highly
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're assuming our audience is sophisticated enough to listen
to lectures at the highest level, but that in the course of their
normal days as educators, they don't get the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Segarra pointed out that Levy, a Citigroup executive, was hired
for his corporate expertise, not his intellectual vigor. She said
he had not used his managerial skills as much as she had hoped, and
that he should be focusing on the coming summer school program,
which is to be the largest in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very limited amount of time to do some very critical
things,'' Segarra said. ``He's supposed to be managing us through
some major projects, like summer school, on a very short
timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   While the plan to create a literary salon of sorts at 110
Livingston Street might not seem to fit in with Levy's efforts to
make the Board of Education more businesslike, Levi said that in
fact, the two efforts fit together seamlessly.

   ``To run a business you need to find the best resources and
apply them as efficiently as you can,'' he said. ``My job is to
look at the issue of resources more broadly, in terms of the
artistic and intellectual resources of New York City.''

<P>
   Levy did not deride his predecessors, but said that, as career
educators, most were more focused on a handful of initiatives
directly related to classroom instruction. Many of those
initiatives were abandoned when the next chancellor came in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to blow through here with an initiative or
project that won't withstand the test of time,'' Levy said. ``What
I want to do is have a public debate about the methodologies and
what the true needs of the system are.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether such a debate will lead to permanent change is as
open a question as whether Levy will become the permanent
chancellor after his temporary contract ends in July. Quite
possibly, his friend Levi said, people are reacting
enthusiastically to Levy's initiatives simply because they do not
expect him to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chancellor's office is such a revolving door,'' he said,
``you never know whether people are genuinely interested or just
nodding politely and waiting for you to depart.''

Thompson back on DL 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Rangers, while hoping Justin Thompson can
resume throwing soon, have taken him off medical rehabilitation
assignment and placed him back on the disabled list. The move
allows Thompson another 30-day rehab assignment when he's ready to
pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is coming back from shoulder surgery, and the Rangers
had hoped he could pitch Sunday against the Oakland Athletics. But
that plan was scratched when Thompson felt pain in his left
shoulder while throwing in the bullpen eight days before that
scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is planning to play catch today and have a light
throwing session in the bullpen tomorrow. If that goes well, he
will throw again in the bullpen Friday and then possibly return to
the minor leagues to pitch in a game.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin spoke with team physician John
Conway and Dr. James Andrews, who performed the surgery Aug. 27,
and they still feel Thompson suffered only a minor setback. There
are no plans for him to undergo further examination or a
magnetic-resonance-imaging exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both felt at this time it wasn't necessary to do that,''
Melvin said. ``If he still doesn't feel good, we may have to do
that.'' SIERRA GETS MINOR DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find a left-handed hitting outfielder, the Rangers
signed Ruben Sierra to a minor-league contract and assigned him to
Triple-A Oklahoma. Doug Melvin said he's basically on a two-week
trial to see if he can play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He begged us to play and give him an opportunity,'' Melvin
said. ``We had nothing to lose letting him go down there and see if
he can bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, 34, was playing for Cancun in the Triple-A ]Mexican
League, hitting .355 with three homers and 12 runs batted in in 16
games. He was released by the Cleveland Indians in spring training
and played for Atlantic City in the independent Atlantic League
last year, hitting .294 with 28 homers and 92 RBI in 112 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him it could be a very short time,'' Melvin said. ``It
might be two weeks. It might be less. If Rusty Greer comes back in
10 days or so like we expect, it probably goes for naught. We're
back to where we were originally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were the fourth major-league team to release Sierra
since the start of the 1997 season. He also failed to keep a job
with the Cincinnati Reds and Toronto Blue Jays in 1997 and the
Chicago White Sox in 1998. He has been mainly used as a designated
hitter because of his poor defense, but Melvin said he must show
the Rangers he can still play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra played for the Rangers in 1986-92 and was twice named to
the American League All-Star team. But his career started going
downhill in 1992 when he, Bobby Witt and Jeff Russell were traded
to the Oakland Athletics for Jose Canseco. RODRIGUEZ HONORED
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez was named the club's player of the month
for April. Rodriguez won the award for hitting .333 with nine
homers, a club record for April, and 25 RBI. PAYROLL WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are considering pitching either Doug Davis or Matt
Perisho Sunday against the Oakland Athletics. If they do, they
could have approximately $30 million of their $70 million payroll
sitting around doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's the combined salaries of the Rangers' six starting
pitchers _ Justin Thompson, Mark Clark, Kenny Rogers, Rick Helling,
Esteban Loaiza and Darren Oliver _ and closer John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard part about this game when you put money into
pitching,'' Melvin said. ``That's going to happen. Atlanta is
probably the same way. At least if you put it into position
players, they're out there trying to help you win games.'' nn

FIRING GRIER, BELICHICK SEEKS `A NEW DIRECTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Whispers at the NFL owners' meetings in Palm
Beach, Fla., last month had Bobby Grier gone after the draft. The
whispers turned into a loud and clear message Monday when Patriots
czar Bill Belichick, who officially holds only the title of head
coach, fired Grier, the vice president of player personnel, and his
longtime assistant, national scouting director Dave Uyrus, in what
was described as a ``change of direction in the personnel staff.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks Belichick and Patriots higher-ups have said that Grier
and the new coach could survive together. Belichick went out of his
way to say how wonderfully the two had worked together in 1996, the
year Belichick came aboard as an assistant and Bill Parcells was no
longer allowed to ``shop for the groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Belichick, Grier set up the board for this year's
draft, and all went smoothly in the Patriots' room that weekend.
Team vice president Jonathan Kraft said on Patriots.com that it was
one of the team's smoothest drafts in years.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, who was rarely seen or heard after Belichick was hired
this year, patrolled the field during minicamp. A sign of things to
come was the territorial positioning of new executive Scott Pioli
on one side of the field and Grier, Uyrus, and head of college
scouting Larry Cook on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, for now, has survived.
</P>
<P>
   Grier declined comment on his dismissal. He was in the final
year of his contract, and though criticized heavily for his drafts,
he had his best in 1999 when he landed Damien Woody and Andy
Katzenmoyer in the first round, and later picked up Kevin Faulk,
Tony George, Michael Bishop, and Sean Morey.
</P>
<P>
   But Grier had failed to come up with useful players in '97; six
of the nine players he drafted that year _ including first-round
pick Chris Canty _ are no longer with the team. A seventh, Ed
Ellis, might be the next casualty after a bad experience in NFL
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Grier defended his drafts toward the end of last season, in an
interview that seemed to do more harm than good. He was hurt by
reports that players were sneaking up the back stairs to him to
complain about former coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said over the weekend he was going to sit with Grier
early in the week, and evidently the conversation didn't go well.
Grier had said that if he were replaced on personnel matters, he
would step aside, but he never got the chance to do that. Grier's
son, Chris, is a scout with the team whose future could be in
doubt. Likewise for Andre Tippett, the former great Patriots
linebacker who assisted Grier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in and basically told Bobby we were going in a
different direction,'' said Belichick of the afternoon meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said the move was not the result of any specific
incident. He also would not characterize Grier's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't be fair of me,'' said Belichick. ``That's a very
private expression that only Bobby should speak about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Grier had an excellent relationship with the Kraft
family, it didn't matter in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick previously fired another assistant who was close to
Kraft, strength coach Johnny Parker, whom Kraft had signed to a
seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next?
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Pioli's powers will grow. Belichick will be the
coach and personnel man, and Pioli the major non-coach in the front
office. The team recently hired Ernie Adams, a former coach and
administrator with Belichick with the Browns and Giants. If Cook is
replaced, Belichick may go with one of his old standbys from the
Browns or Jets to direct college scouting. Also expect another
hiring or two of executives who can help Belichick on personnel
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just happened,'' said Belichick. ``I haven't made any
calls. I don't have anyone else in place. Over the next couple of
days, I'll think about how we go about it, but right now I'm not in
the position to be able to announce anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier, 57, spent 18 years with the Patriots, first joining the
team as running backs coach under Ron Erhardt in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots tackle Bruce Armstrong was given a clean bill of
health by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital. He's already
running and working out . . . Henry Thomas worked out for five days
here two weeks ago. He'll continue to work on his own through the
offseason . . . The Patriots will be making a push for former
Eagles center Steve Everitt, who can also play guard.

NORTHWEST TO PAY DAMAGES FORMER BAGGAGE HANDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination has
ordered Northwest Airlines to pay $200,000 plus interest in damages
to a former baggage handler after ruling the company refused to
make accommodations for her disability because she cooperated with
a sexual harassment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, released Monday, came five years after Deborah
Mazeikus maintained she was wrongfully fired for written testimony
she gave to state investigators in support of a sexual harassment
complaint brought by the family of Susan Taraskiewicz, a
27-year-old colleague who was found dead in the trunk of her car in
1992. The family, which settled its case with Northwest Airlines in
1995, claimed Taraskiewicz had been repeatedly harassed on the job
before her death.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, MCAD chairman Charles Walker ordered 12 percent interest
on the fine be assessed to Northwest for every year since 1995,
when Mazeikus' complaint was filed. The ruling also requires the
company to submit, within 60 days of the decision, a detailed plan
for training managers and supervisors in Massachusetts how to
respond to issues relating to people with disabilities. The actual
training must take place within 120 days of the MCAD order, and the
company will be required to hold another session next year.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines said in a written statement: ``The company
acknowledges the claim occurred at a difficult period of time in
the Boston operations, including the tragic, and as yet unsolved
murder of a Northwest employee, but it is confident it acted
appropriately in the matter involving Ms. Mazeikus.''
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Mazeikus, who will discuss her case Tuesday during a
press conference at her lawyer's office, said she was ``so happy
that I am on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so many different emotions,'' the 46-year-old former
airline employee added. ``This decision is wonderful. It says that
a person can come forward and do the right thing, can go against
one of the biggest airlines in the country and still get this type
of ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mazeikus said after she submitted her affidavit
in support of the Taraskiewicz sexual harassment complaint, people
she had long valued as friends stopped speaking to her. ``People
were afraid to even call and talk to me,'' she said. ``I was
recuperating from back surgery and it was devastating. It led to
tremendous stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal records indicate Mazeikus' problems began several months
after the September 1992 death of her friend, Susan Taraskiewicz,
who was one of a handful of women employed as a ground crew
supervisor for Northwest Airlines at Logan Airport in Boston. The
night she died, Taraskiewicz had left her post in the middle of the
night shift to pick up sandwiches for herself and some colleagues.
They never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   A day and a half later, Taraskiewicz was found dead in the trunk
of her car, the victim of stab wounds, strangulation, and a brutal
beating. Although the company offered a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest of Taraskiewicz's attacker, the
killer was never found.
</P>
<P>
   While state investigators searched for clues to the case,
another investigation concerning a credit-card scam at Northwest's
Boston site was unfolding, Walker noted in his ruling. The leader
of the credit-card scam was later identified as one of
Taraskiewicz's &UR;  &LR; chief harassers. He also was a suspect in her
murder but was never charged. He was, however, convicted of charges
stemming from credit-card fraud and was incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after her friend's death, Mazeikus slipped and fell
on the job, injuring her back. According to the MCAD ruling, she
took several weeks' paid leave and then returned to work. But she
again injured her back in June 1993 on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after receiving paid medical leave, Mazeikus applied
for disability benefits. She also underwent back surgery to remove
a portion of her lumbar disc. Following the surgery, she asked to
be allowed to return to work as a trainer, but her request was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Mazeikus filed one of several anonymous affidavits in
the Taraskiewicz case, in which she discussed the harassment she
either had witnessed or had discussed with her friend Susan
Taraskiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Mazeikus maintained that later in 1995, after a story in the
local press made it clear she had filed one of those affidavits,
she received a letter informing her that her employment would be
terminated on July 30. She also was told she could reapply for
positions at the company, but there was no guarantee she would be
chosen. Moreover, she could do only light duty work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many other jobs available at the time, but the
company never referred her to any of them,'' said attorney Susan
Howardscq, who represents Mazeikus. ``Yet Northwest Airlines found
ways to accommodate other employees (with disabilities).''
</P>
<P>
   MCAD concluded Taraskiewicz had been the target of ``hostile''
sexual harassment. It also found probable cause to believe
Northwest Airlines had done nothing to stop a group of male
coworkers from harassing her.
</P>
<P>
   The agency made its findings after receiving affidavits from
several Northwest employees, including Mazeikus, a veteran worker
with 15 years on the job who testified that sexual harassment had
long been a problem at the airline. Mazeikus also told
investigators that she had seen the word slut scrawled in black
marker in her workplace.

TEXAS A&AMP;M SUFFERING BIG 12 GROWING PAINS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an assistant and then head baseball coach, Mark Johnson has
been at Texas A&AMP;M for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   This one is the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, no question about that,'' said Johnson, who watched
his team rally Sunday to salvage the third game of the Texas
series, virtually assuring themselves of a berth in the Big 12
Tournament, which is scheduled for May 17-21 at the Bricktown
Ballpark in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   With a week off for exams, the Aggies (23-30, 11-16) have three
games left, against Missouri. The bad news is that even if they
sweep, they will finish the regular season with the school's first
losing record since 1960. The good news is that even if they are
swept, they are in the tournament unless lowly Iowa State (6-18)
somehow wins its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that would be something, at least ... a chance to
participate in a little postseason play,'' Johnson said. ``We
haven't achieved a lot of the goals we set. It's been a rough
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Johnson was expecting a third consecutive Big 12 title
after reviewing his losses from a 52-18 team that reached the
College World Series. A catalog of the departed includes six
starters _ Shawn Schumacher (.374, 11 HR, 53 runs batted in), Dell
Lindsey (.305, 14, 59), Steve Scarborough (.326, 6, 41), John
Scheschuk (.363, 10, 54), Steven Truitt (.345, 19, 60) and Erik
Sobek (.314, 7, 29) _ plus the entire weekend pitching rotation of
Casey Fossum (12-7), Chance Caple (8-5) and Matt Ward (8-1).
</P>
<P>
   So the Aggies opened the season with two preseason All-Americans
_ closer Chris Russ and national home run champion Daylan Holt _
and a bunch of guys wearing name tags so they could be correctly
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But even Johnson, who in 15 years as the head coach has compiled
the sixth-highest winning percentage (.704) among active coaches
and won more games (668) than anyone in A&AMP;M history, was unprepared
for the steep angle of descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very young team, and we knew the season would be a
learning experience for a lot of players _ freshmen and transfers _
who are new to our system,'' he said. ``I think they have learned a
lot, but it's just hard to have to keep losing while you're
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys have shown promise for the future. But
we've also had a lot of injuries, and some of the things I had
hoped would develop as we got late into the season didn't
materialize. Primarily, we just don't hit well when we need to. I'm
not disappointed in the players, but I'm disappointed in the
season. It's been a bad year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Holt hit his 15th home run _ he had 34 last year _ the
Aggies couldn't do much with D.J. Jones (10-3) and Beau Hale
(10-2), who won the first two games for Texas (37-12, 18-8) last
weekend. But Russ became a surprise starter in the third game,
pitching into the eighth inning before being relieved by freshman
Todd Deininger, normally a starter, who closed down a 4-2 victory
that likely killed any chance the Longhorns have of winning the
regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   That bauble will probably go to Baylor (39-13, 20-7), which got
more outstanding pitching from Chad Hawkins (9-4, 1.70 earned-run
average), Kyle Evans (9-1) and Zane Carlson (13 saves) in a
three-game sweep of Kansas, which managed one run against Hawkins
and was shut out on three hits by Evans. The Bears' final
three-game series, after a week off for exams, is against
last-place Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender, Nebraska (36-12, 19-8) will be at Texas
this weekend for a three-game series that has been moved to
Saturday-Sunday-Monday because of the Cornhuskers' exam schedules.

RANGERS PITCHERS CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE ELUSIVE PERFECT PITCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Left-handed pitcher Kenny Rogers can still throw a
fastball near 90 mph that comes in hard on a right-handed hitter.
He can also throw an 84-mph fastball that sinks away from a
right-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he also throws a curveball and a ``dead fish''
changeup, so called because it's supposed to flop on the low
outside corner of the plate. Rogers can also change speeds on his
fastball to the point where it looks like a changeup. He can also
change the angle on his curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw anything I can think of out there,'' Rogers said
proudly. ``And if you have an idea on a new pitch, let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in his search for the perfect pitch. Every member
of the Rangers staff has a basic repertoire of pitches, but each
still spends many hours looking for that new pitch that will give
him an edge, or possibly prolong his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tinkering all the time,'' reliever Tim Crabtree said.
``I'm always trying to come up with a pitch nobody else has ...
split-finger, cutter. I don't believe in not changing with the
times. If you don't, all those hitters will make adjustments with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the best pitchers make changes. When John Wetteland came to
the Rangers, he relied mainly on his fastball and slider. But the
same winter he signed, he and pitching coach Dick Bosman made an
interesting discovery during their first throwing session at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw mainly fastballs and then said, `Let me throw you a
few curves,''' Bosman said. ``He did, and I was impressed. I said,
`What are you doing with that pitch?' He said, `I just use it for a
show pitch.' I said, `I think we ought to take it to another level
and use it as an out pitch.' It's a big-league curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland did. He saved a game last week in Arlington by getting
Boston's Nomar Garciaparra to pop out on a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good pitchers are always tinkering, looking for an edge,''
Bosman said. ``It's good when a hitter sees something different in
a pitcher. You don't want to be too predictable unless you're
overpowering, and there's only one or two of those around. The rest
have to succeed through deception and good location.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitchers throw six basic pitches, beginning with the
``four-seam'' fastball, called that because the pitcher grips the
ball across four seams. That pitch is the basic high hard one. The
``two-seamer'' is a fastball that sinks. Kevin Brown has made
millions of dollars throwing that pitch 98 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the curve, slider, changeup and forkball, also
known as the split-fingered fastball.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget the knuckleball. No self-respecting
major-league pitcher would be caught dead without a knuckleball.
It's like a badge of dishonor not to have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a good one,'' Darren Oliver said. ``I haven't broken
it out yet. I don't know if I can throw it off the mound for a
strike. But I throw it on the side, and it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rick Helling: ``It is pretty good. It's not much better
than mine, but it's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman said he's always playing around with the
knuckleball, ``but it doesn't do anything. I guess I don't have the
proper knuckles.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's always the screwball, a pitch that acts the
opposite of a curveball, curving to the right for a right-handed
pitcher, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No thanks,'' Matt Perisho said. ``I've already had two arm
surgeries. I don't want another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling said he actually used a screwball in the minor leagues
as his changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for Double-A hitters,'' Helling said. ``But when
you get to the big leagues, hitters could tell it was a changeup
because of the spin. When you get to the big leagues, you want your
changeup to look like your fastball as much as possible. If they
can see the spin of a screwball, it defeats the purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling said he used to experiment in the minor leagues with new
pitches and still does _ but on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not in the game,'' Helling said. ``I try to be as
consistent as I can be with what I have. If it probably gets to the
point where I'm not getting guys out or I'm getting them out so
easily, I have to make it more fun, that's when I'll start
tinkering.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tinkering, however, is done on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are much higher in the big leagues than in the
minors,'' Helling said. ``If you go out there and start fooling
around and give up a home run that loses the ballgame, everybody is
going to ask you what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody including manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said a time may come, though, when the knuckleball is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the later part of my career when I'm coming out of the
bullpen, hanging around, trying to get in a couple extra years,''
Oliver said. ``I might try it then.'' nn

<P>
   Millions of television viewers found themselves without access
to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular ABC
television programs on Monday as a battle between the country's two
biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt Disney, reached a
fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves how much Time Warner should pay Disney,
which owns ABC, for carrying its cable channels, which include The
Disney Channel, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon. But it also
touches on larger issues dealing with the distribution of news and
entertainment programming, including longstanding antipathy between
the cable and broadcast industry, growing competition between cable
and satellite companies and Disney's opposition to the proposed
merger between America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable removed seven ABC stations from cable systems
serving 3.5 million homes _ in New York; Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif. _
at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The move came during one of television's most
competitive ratings periods, a sweeps month, when networks and
stations always trot out their most expensive shows. Disney had
offered a 24-day extension on its negotiations over the cable
payments.
 &UR;  &LR;  On Monday, ABC asked the Federal Communications Commission to
force Time Warner to restore the programming. A commission
spokesman, David Fiske, said the commission expected a response
from Time Warner by the close of business Tuesday and ``will
expedite a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is basing its request on a vague clause about sweeps month
actions in the 1992 Cable Act. In a statement Monday, the
commission encouraged the companies to resolve the issue privately.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledged that they could be damaged by the
impasse. Disney stands to lose advertising revenue and the
opportunity to draw a maximum audience for some highly anticipated
programming, including the Kentucky Derby this weekend and the
season finales of many of its series. Time Warner risks alienating
its customers at a time when satellite distribution is growing and
giving fodder to those who are arguing in Washington that the
America Online-Time Warner merger would concentrate too much power
in one company.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extension issue is complicated by the merger, with Time
Warner demanding a bargaining deadline for eight months from now _
presumably after federal regulators had approved the AOL deal.
Disney had wanted the shorter 24-day extension, presumably to
retain the merger issue as leverage in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides worked furiously Monday to present their cases to the
public. Time Warner said it was under legal obligation to pull
ABC's signals because no agreement was in place and Disney had
failed to negotiate seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It charged that Disney is trying to boost earnings by extracting
hundreds of millions of dollars in what is known as
``retransmission consent'' negotiations. Broadcast stations have
the right to seek compensation from cable systems for the right to
retransmit their signals on cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said they were close to a deal with
Disney in December that would have included turning The Disney
Channel from a premium to a basic channel, as well as adding two
other Disney cable channels, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon, to
Time Warner's cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that after the Time Warner merger with America
Online was announced in January, Disney backed off its agreement
with Time Warner, saying that the situation had changed. Disney
argues that it was concerned about maintaining free access to
opportunities created by the convergence of television with the
Internet, which Time Warner and America Online hope to explore.
Time Warner executives charged that Disney was merely using the
merger as leverage to seek more money.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Fred Dressler, the senior vice president of Time
Warner and the chief negotiator with ABC, said that Disney's new
demands added a total of $300 million to the 10-year agreement the
two companies already had in place. Robert Iger, the president of
Walt Disney, called the $300 million figure ``totally
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences about the negotiations extend well beyond
motivation and money and extended to virtually every detail of the
discussions. Both sides charge the other with engaging in
regressive negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, viewers either needed to switch to an
old-fashioned antenna or sign up for satellite delivery in order to
receive ABC's programs in the cities affected.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of ABC's programs in about 3.5 million homes _ out of
about 100 million homes nationwide with television sets _ may not
drastically affect the overall ratings for the programs, but
advertisers will expect ABC to make up for whatever shortfalls are
experienced by granting them free future commercials, known as
make-goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy network television, and all of a sudden your
schedule is not delivering the kind of audiences you're expecting,
then it's a concern,'' said Bill Cella, the director of broadcast
programming for Universal McCann. Two senior media industry
executives said ABC could expect to lose between $2 million and $3
million a day in make-good commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The timing clearly increased ABC's anger, as did Time Warner's
effort to lay the blame for the removal of the signals at Disney's
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liars and monopolists,'' said Preston Padden, the
executive vice president of governmental relations at Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Iger said, ``They told consumers a blatant lie in saying we
pulled the plug. The last time I checked they were responsible to
local authorization for their franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner executives were equally aggressive, both in
defending the company's decision to terminate ABC's signals and in
assailing Disney's negotiating tactics. Mike Luftman, the vice
president of communications for Time Warner Cable, said that
Disney's financial demands were so exorbitant there was no hope for
an agreement, and hence Time Warner would have ``violated the law''
by accepting another extension. Eventually these costs would have
been passed to the consumers, he said, adding, ``We have deep
regret for what happened because of Disney's intransigence and
greed.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, at least, ABC got backing from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who attacked Time Warner as a predatory monopoly. ``This
is an example of what happens when you let a monopoly get too
big,'' Giuliani said. ``It has a particularly bad effect in New
York City, because we're a city which, given the high buildings,
the idea of going out and getting an antenna is stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner began a program of compensating customers $15 for
the cost of a switch that would allow viewing through an antenna.
</P>
<P>
   Dressler, the senior vice president of Time Warner and its chief
negotiator in the ABC deal, said Disney was only using the merger
issue as a smokescreen for its desire to extract the most possible
revenue out of the deal.

N.Y. PASSES BILL PROHIBITING POWER PLANTS FROM SELLING POLLUTION
CREDITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.C., Tenn., W.Va., Ohio, Mich., Ill., Ky., Ind., Wis.,
N.J., Md., Pa., Del.)   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York state Legislature Monday completed
passage of a bill that seeks to reduce the amount of air pollution
that has been drifting into New York from coal-burning power plants
in Midwestern and Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would stop New York companies from keeping the money
they make by selling pollution credits, earned by cleaning their
own smokestacks, to major polluters in the Midwest and the South.
The credits are now sold on the open market to companies with older
power plants that find it cheaper to buy such credits instead of
modernizing their plants and cutting their emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations permit a company that cuts pollution below
federal levels to sell credits it has earned to a company unable or
unwilling to meet those federal emission levels. The goal is to
reward companies that reduce their toxic emissions below the
federal standard, while forcing companies that exceed the standard
to buy the right to continue polluting.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the free-market approach has resulted in cleaner air
nationwide. But there has been a glaring glitch, according to
environmental experts. Major polluters in the South and the Middle
West have found it cheaper to buy pollution credits instead of
cutting toxic emissions that have blown downwind into New York and
contributed to the state's acid rain problem.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation adopted Monday is intended to help correct that
problem, essentially penalizing power companies in New York when
they sell pollution credits to coal-burning power plants in the
Midwest and in the South, whose pollution is a major cause of acid
rain in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation essentially calls for the state to seize all the
proceeds that a utility company would receive from such polluters
as part of a transaction for pollution credits. The bill allows
state regulators to impose a fine equal to the amount of such a
sale; the fine, in turn, would be used to promote the development
and use of nonpolluting energy sources like solar power.
</P>
<P>
   The action is the first by a state that directly challenges a
major provision in the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990: setting up a
marketplace in which companies can trade the right to pollute, in
the form of credits, as a commodity. Some New York utility
companies immediately threatened a court challenge to the new
legislation, saying the law could violate constitutional
protections for interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which
administers the credit program, said it supported New York's
attempt to regulate pollution credit trading by companies within
its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for the agency, defended the credit
trading program. But, she added, ``We are also in favor of
providing maximum flexibility to states like New York in our common
effort to protect public health and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear the degree to which the legislation will reduce
pollution and acid rain in New York state, in large part because
polluters in the South and the Midwest could turn to other
companies in other states to buy their pollution credits. But
experts say the legislation will ultimately limit the amount of
pollution credits available to polluters in the Midwest and the
South and thereby force up the price of such credits.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council, an
environmental group, said the measure could help protect regions of
the state that have been ravaged by acid rain, most notably tracts
of wilderness in the Adirondacks. He said government studies
estimated that in fewer than 40 years, half of that region's nearly
3,000 lakes and ponds would be too acidic to sustain the fish and
plants that now live in them if the acid rain problem continued
unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes no sense for New York to clean up its own smokestacks
and then hand the right to pollute to its neighbors,'' said
Sheehan, whose group played a major role in pushing the bill
through the Legislature. ``This legislation puts an end to New
York's squandering of the benefits of its own responsible actions
toward clean air.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew harsh rebukes from representatives of the
state's powerful utility industry, who said it potentially violated
the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution prohibiting
states from enacting laws that restrict trade outside their
borders. Proponents of the measure say companies still have the
ability to sell credits to whomever they want but run the risk of
incurring penalties when the credits go to out-of-state companies
that contribute to New York's acid rain problem.
</P>
<P>
   Carol E. Murphy, executive director of Independent Power
Producers of New York, said she expected utility companies to sue
the state over the measure. ``Either you have a national trading
program or you don't,'' she said. ``I haven't talked to anybody who
doesn't think this law is unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, New York utility companies have sold roughly 700,000
credits between 1995 and 1998 to polluters in the other states,
according to a recent report issued by the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The credits now cost
about $140 each and allow polluters to emit one ton of sulfur
dioxide, a major contributor to acid rain and smog. New York's
pollution credits account for roughly 4 percent of all the sulfur
dioxide emitted in the United States, government and private
estimates indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate by
a 59-0 vote early Monday afternoon. The Assembly, which has a
Democratic majority, passed the bill by a 129-15 vote earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure now goes to Gov. George Pataki, who has expressed
support for such legislation in the past but whose aides said
Monday that he wanted to review the measure carefully.
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican who is the legislation's main
sponsor in the state Senate, said the state's action should send a
message to Washington that the current system had allowed utilities
in regions like the Midwest to burn high-sulfur coal at the expense
of states like New York. ``At the very least, I believe this
legislation will force Congress into action and ultimately require
the federal government to reduce acid rain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pollution credit trading system was approved by Congress at
the urging of economists and some environmentalists, who said it
would bring about pollution reduction with the least amount of
government intervention and the most efficiency. The act gave New
York utilities a windfall of pollution credits because a New York
state law had forced those companies to cut emissions in the 1980s
to levels below what the federal law requires.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation adopted Monday prohibits power companies from
selling their pollution credits to companies in 10 Southern and
Midwestern states. They are Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,
West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and
Wisconsin. It also prohibits sales to four neighboring states: New
Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The law also contains a provision prohibiting companies that buy
credits from New York utilities from turning around and selling
those credits to polluters in states that New York utilities are
not permitted to trade with directly.

LONDON AND FRANKFURT STOCK EXCHANGES TO ANNOUNCE MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In the most advanced step yet toward the
creation of a pan-European stock market, the London and Frankfurt
stock exchanges plan to announce a merger on Wednesday, according
to officials close to the negotiations by the two markets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would unite Europe's two biggest securities exchanges,
creating a market for trading securities that would far outweigh
the proposed alliance between the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But more surprising is the way that Frankfurt, which some have
considered as a backwater for trading compared with the city of
London, has jumped to the forefront of European securities
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement to be announced, the chief executive of the
combined company will be Werner G. Seifert, now chief executive of
Deutsche Boerse AG, which owns the Frankfurt stock exchange. The
supervisory board of Deutsche Boerse approved the plan over the
weekend, and the London Stock Exchange board is expected to do so
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, London will adopt the Germans' electronic trading
system, known as Xetra.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a remarkable reversal, because the London Stock
Exchange remains bigger in terms of trading volume than Frankfurt
and because London itself is the closest thing that Europe has to a
financial center, in many ways rivaling New York and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal reflects the extent to which Seifert, a former
management consultant, has expanded and redefined what had been a
sleepy stock exchange into a formidable institution.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that the Germans will exert such a dominant role
stems from their embrace of new technology as well as their
expansion into new markets. Two years ago, Seifert engineered a
merger between the futures and options exchange of Deutsche Boerse
and that of its Swiss counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The combined exchange, called Eurex, is now the world's largest
derivatives market, larger even than the formidable Chicago Board
of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   But the Frankfurt exchange's biggest advantage is in technology.
Its electronic trading system has proved more reliable than that of
London and is being used for electronic trading on the Helsinki
derivatives exchange, the Vienna stock exchange and, later this
year, on the Irish stock exchange in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is being driven in large part by demands from big
financial institutions in Europe, which have complained for some
time that securities trading there is too inefficient and needs to
be freed from national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were given further impetus with the announcement this
year of a new alliance among the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam
exchanges. That alliance, to be called Euronext, could have posed a
serious competitive threat but is likely to be overshadowed by a
union of Frankfurt and London.
</P>
<P>
   German and British exchange officials have been in talks for
years about forming a long-term relationship. Indeed, they startled
other European markets two years ago by announcing an agreement to
align with each other rather than pursue more complex negotiations
involving the other European markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Frankfurt and London have talked in fits and starts,
but their negotiations ran into repeated disagreements over who
would control how much and whose technology had the best chance of
being accepted as a common platform for trading in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Both have announced plans for collaboration with Europe's
smaller exchanges. But those talks have been even more prickly and
appeared to be heading nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of new electronic trading networks, supported by some
of the biggest financial institutions on Wall Street and in Europe,
made it increasingly clear to market officials that their
franchises would be in danger if they failed to quickly provide
pan-European trading.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what the combined entity will be called,
although the Deutsche Boerse had already planned to rename itself
Euroboard. If the merger is completed, the plan is to take the
combined company public.
</P>
<P>
   The new exchange will include the Deutsche Boerse derivatives
market but not Clearstream, a subsidiary that clears financial
transactions. The plan has been to let the London exchange handle
trading in blue-chip stocks while Frankfurt deals with trading in
derivatives and small technology stocks. But details on those
matters remained unclear Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the new headquarters was also not known.

MARKETPLACE: BEN &AMP; JERRY'S FLAVOR OF THE DAY: ROCKY ROAD? 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the founders of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc.
finally agreed to sell their company last month, the Unilever
executive credited with clinching the deal was Richard Goldstein,
who heads the company's North American business.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the founders and Goldstein gathered in New York to
discuss Ben &AMP; Jerry's future _ distribution, new products, the role
of the founders _ but it was a little awkward. And no wonder.
Goldstein, who cultivated the relationship with Ben Cohen and Jerry
Greenfield, will not be around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, two weeks after the $326 million cash sale was
approved by Ben &AMP; Jerry's board, Goldstein said he was leaving
Unilever to become chief executive of International Flavors &AMP;
Fragrances. In other words, as he was persuading Ben &AMP; Jerry's to
join Unilever, Goldstein was himself a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had spent time with him over the last five or six months,
and I knew he might not be at Unilever forever,'' Greenfield said,
calling the departure a loss to Unilever that left him ``personally
really disappointed.'' He added, ``I didn't know he was considering
something else at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gould, a spokesman for Unilever, said Cohen and Greenfield
had been assured by Unilever's co-chairman, Niall Fitzgerald, that
Goldstein's departure would not affect the agreement. ``While Dick
was the one who happened to be involved in these discussions, the
agreements are on behalf of the company, not any one individual,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield, who called Goldstein ``a person of extremely high
integrity,'' confirmed that he had spoken to Fitzgerald. ``In that
regard, I do feel good about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was a sharp reminder of the surprises that come
with being part of a consumer-products giant. Neither Cohen nor
Greenfield expects it to be the last. In an interview Monday at
Unilever headquarters, Cohen said the transition would be complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ben &AMP; Jerry's used to be is one of these smaller
`social-values-led' businesses,'' Cohen said, sitting at a
conference table in the Unilever executive suite with Greenfield
and Goldstein. ``What Ben &AMP; Jerry's is in the process of becoming
is an entity inside a larger business, trying to infuse those
values in that larger business. We expect that it will be a long
and winding road.''
</P>
<P>
   Both founders made plenty of money on the deal, which began
Sept. 8 with a letter from Goldstein. Cohen owns more than 900,000
shares in the company, which are valued at $39.3 million under
Unilever's offer of $43.60 a share. Greenfield, who had 220,000
shares, will receive $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the founders will be paid $200,000 a year to remain at
the company, where they will continue as directors, according to
the document outlining the terms of the deal. Even though Goldstein
is going to another company, he is taking a seat on the Ben &AMP;
Jerry's board, becoming the sole Unilever representative, according
to Gould.
</P>
<P>
   The offering document also describes three shareholder lawsuits
filed last month against Ben &AMP; Jerry's and its board over an
earlier plan to take the company private at a lower price of $38 a
share. Unilever, Cohen and a venture capital group called
Meadowbrook Lane Capital were part of that plan, which the board
approved in late March. Ben &AMP; Jerry's said the plan was ``never
definitively approved'' and was dropped in the end, making the
allegations unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield said he was pleasantly surprised by his meeting last
month with Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to be nice to us but somewhat
patronizing,'' Greenfield said. ``He wasn't that way at all.''
While Unilever has practical reasons for wanting to, say, preserve
the oceans, the point ends up being similar to that championed by
Ben &AMP; Jerry's, he added. ``Ben and I come at it from a
peace-and-justice point of view, that it's the right thing to do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the merger deal contains a provision in which
Greenfield can sue Unilever, at Unilever's expense, for any breach
of the terms in the deal, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a problem with that,'' Goldstein added. His last
day at Unilever will be May 31.

FINDING THEMSELVES IN THE SAME HOUSE AGAIN, GORE AND MCCAIN MEET 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush can only hope his meeting next
week with Sen &UR; .  &LR; John McCain goes as well as McCain's meeting with
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McCain met Sunday for 20 minutes with Gore at the Naval
Observatory in Washington, the vice president's official residence.
Both were appearing on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' which was being
filmed at the residence. When Gore learned Saturday that McCain
would be under his roof the next day, he called the Arizona senator
and invited him to come over early for a private chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends,'' Gore told reporters later, noting that the
two had served in the House and Senate together. ``It's not that
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood that McCain, who has suspended his own
presidential campaign, would be endorsing Bush, his fellow
Republican, for president. But ever since Gore locked up the
Democratic nomination, he has been invoking McCain's name and
making an overt play for his independent-minded supporters. On
Sunday night, Gore seemed eager to fill reporters in on the details
of their get-together, uncharacteristically allowing camera crews
to film him on his airplane discussing the matter as he flew from
Boston to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the two discussed campaign finance reform, McCain's
signature issue and one that Gore is advancing in his campaign.
``We talked about how to move the issue forward,'' he said, adding
that he expected future sessions with McCain on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that the McCain-Feingold proposal to eliminate
so-called soft money from campaigns would be his No. 1 domestic
initiative, a move some critics suspect is an attempt to inoculate
himself against criticism that his own fund raising has been too
aggressive. The Sunday session thus struck some as an effort by
Gore to bask in McCain's credibility on the issue, or what Mark
Shields, &UR;  &LR; the political columnist, calls ``innocence by
association.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also wanted to signal that he could work with
Republicans, a theme that Bush has emphasized recently while
suggesting that Gore is excessively partisan. ``I will regularly
and routinely reach across party lines,'' Gore said Sunday night,
adding that his ``natural instincts'' are to work in a bipartisan
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went even further in this direction by suggesting, in
answer to a question, that he might even name a Republican as his
vice president. ``I think that's unlikely,'' he said, but ``I would
not rule it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He ruminated further on the process of selecting a No. 2, saying
that his overwhelming goal was to pick someone who would be
qualified to become president. ``That just trumps everything
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the cameras were still rolling, Gore also poked fun at his
own comments about the Elian Gonzalez case, which has caused him
much political heartache.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest laugh came when Gore referred to a ``bit part''
that he had played in a well-received video President Clinton had
made to show at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner
on Saturday night. A reporter on the plane remembered that Gore had
made a brief appearance in the video but said, ``I've forgotten
what it was,'' inadvertently summarizing Gore's long-time
difficulty in establishing himself outside of Clinton's shadow.

VICKI SUE ROBINSON, 46, SINGER OF DISCO ANTHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicki Sue Robinson, the vivacious pop-gospel singer whose 1976
hit ``Turn the Beat Around'' became a signature anthem of the disco
era, died April 27 at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 46.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Gina Andriolo, her publicist.
</P>
<P>
   A prolific jingle singer whose 1999 off-Broadway show, ``Vicki
Sue Robinson: Behind the Beat,'' had a successful limited
engagement at the Kaufman Theater, Robinson was a powerful,
exuberant belter whose dance-oriented records were among the best
sung and least gimmicky disco records of late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiographical show, a gaudy theatrical extension of
her popular, long-running cabaret act, she showed her range as an
all-around entertainer. As both a singer and songwriter, Robinson,
who described herself as a latchkey child with a bohemian
upbringing, exemplified the New York musical melting pot in the
late 1960s and '70s with its colliding echoes of pop, rock, gospel
and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was born in Harlem, the daughter of a black actor and a
white radical folk singer. She made her singing debut at the
Philadelphia Folk Festival when she was 6. Her early influences
were folk and blues legends like Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and
Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, all friends of her mother. But she
was also influenced by jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Sarah
Vaughan, and later by Laura Nyro. While still a teen-ager, she
appeared on Broadway in the musicals ``Hair'' and ``Jesus Christ
Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Bill Good, and her mother,
Marian Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by RCA Records in the mid-1970s, she made four albums and
was nominated for a Grammy for best pop female vocalist. More
recently, a single, ``House of Joy,'' became a major dance hit in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Her show ``Behind the Beat'' was an uninhibited, sometimes campy
cabaret extravaganza that blended pop-soul oldies, personal
confessions, inspirational ballads and audience sing-alongs, and
included versions of some of her best-known jingles pitching
everything from fabric softener to the New York Telephone Co.
(``We're all connected'').

 &HT;    Candidates for governor scramble for votes in N.C.
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH _ While the state's lieutenant governor, Dennis Wicker,
barnstormed Monday in a final swing for votes, front-runner Mike
Easley campaigned closer to home, clinging to a shrinking lead in
today's Democratic gubernatorial primary .
</P>
<P>
   Last week's Mason-Dixon poll showed Easley, 50, North Carolina's
attorney general, leading with 40 percent of 407 likely Democratic
voters surveyed. Wicker, 47, had 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed a tight race on the Republican side. Former
Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot, 59, had 37 percent support among
311 Republican voters surveyed, and state Rep. Leo Daughtry of
Smithfield, also 59, had 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling and hauling, that is what it is about right now,''
Easley told George McPhaul of Maxton, one of the African-American
supporters he is counting on to help give him the edge in the race
to succeed Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, a popular Democrat who cannot succeed himself after two
consecutive terms, has served 16 of the past 24 years as North
Carolina's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who wins the party nominations for governor, the
general election promises a fight over creating a statewide
lottery, an issue that helped propel Democrats to the governor's
mansions in South Carolina and Alabama in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Democrats both support a lottery, but disagree on
how to use the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Easley would use the money to reduce class sizes in kindergarten
through third grade and for preschool programs for 4-year-olds
considered to be educationally at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Patterning his plan on Georgia's Hope scholarship program,
Wicker would use lottery proceeds to create a scholarship program
to provide a free college education to students who maintain a B
average or better.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican front-runners oppose a lottery. Daughtry said he
would veto legislation proposing a statewide lottery referendum.
Vinroot said he would allow a lottery referendum if one was passed
by the Legislature, but he would lead opposition to it.
</P>
<P>
   Easley spent Monday afternoon in his Raleigh campaign office
delivering get-out-the-vote messages to precinct leaders before
heading to Wilmington for a town hall meeting Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hopscotching by air, Vinroot flew from Asheville to Greensboro,
Raleigh and Wilmington before returning to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Easley had a bigger lead in the race for the
Democratic nomination, polling 54 percent to Wicker's 23 percent,
according to a Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research survey of 470 likely
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be a good scrap,'' said Thad Beyle, a
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, political scientist.
Noting that 27 percent of respondents in last week's poll had not
yet decided, he said, ``The key to the election is who actually
turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   State Board of Elections director Gary Bartlett predicted a
Democratic primary turnout of about 25 percent. Traditionally in
North Carolina the Republican primary turnout has been lower.
</P>
<P>
   Beyle said if turnout is relatively low, African-Americans, who
have been courted heavily by both Easley and Wicker, could make the
difference in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   Wicker, a two-term lieutenant governor, has the support of most
of the state's major black political organizations, including the
Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, one of Wicker's stops was Princeville, the Hurricane
Floyd-ravaged town founded by ex-slaves after the Civil War.

   ABC BLACKED OUT IN CABLE DISPUTE
</P>
<P>
   Millions of television viewers in major markets, including New
York and Los Angeles, found themselves without access to ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular TV programs as
Time Warner and Walt Disney fought over how much Disney should be
paid for its cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute also involved issues concerning the distribution of
news and entertainment programming, the growing competition between

WAY CLEARED FOR TEXAS EXECUTION IN HIGH-PROFILE CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
and LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court refused Monday to hear the
latest appeal from condemned killer Gary Graham, clearing the way
for a new execution date in his high-profile case.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 36, a Texas death row inmate since 1981 who now prefers
to go by the name Shaka Sankofa, could get a June execution date
later this week when Harris County prosecutors and defense
attorneys meet with state District Judge J. Michael Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling from the nation's highest court means Graham has
exhausted his appeals, possibly drawing to a close one of the most
protracted legal dramas in the history of capital punishment in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Harris County Assistant District Attorney Roe
Wilson said. ``He has exhausted all of his appeals in the court
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, Graham's lawyers and his backers continued
to proclaim his innocence at a news conference Monday, once again
offering what they say is new evidence that he was wrongly accused
of the May 1981 robbery-murder of Bobby Lambert outside a Houston
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The case has received international media attention, with
Hollywood celebrities and death penalty foes lining up behind
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Burr, a lawyer who handled Graham's appeal, was
disappointed with Monday's decision but said he would keep fighting
for his client.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now for the defense is to find the person who really
killed Lambert, Burr said, ``to prevent the state from killing an
innocent person.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Burr said he has several leads on the identity of the
``real killer,'' he said he doesn't have enough evidence to name
him.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was 17 when he went to death row for Lambert's murder.
His appellate lawyers have argued that his original attorneys
failed to fully investigate the case in 1981 and that there are
witnesses and physical evidence that can clear Graham.
</P>
<P>
   But state and federal appeals courts have reviewed Graham's case
more than 30 times and found his witnesses to be vague or lacking
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the one witness who identified Graham in Lambert's
death has never wavered in her identification.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who had a lengthy history of run-ins with the law before
the murder, was arrested May 20, 1981, by police who found him
passed out and naked in the bed of a taxi driver who accused him of
rape.
</P>
<P>
   He has since said he was responsible for other robberies and
assaults during a weeklong spree that included 22 crimes in 1981.
But he's always said he didn't kill Lambert, 53, of Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's case did result in a change in state law that allowed
defendants to bring claims of so-called ``new evidence'' to appeals
courts. Ironically, Graham's own case was turned away by the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals because the justices didn't feel it met
the legal threshold required for a new review under that statute.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court focused on whether a
1996 federal law meant to speed along death penalty appeals applied
to him. His lawyers argued it did not and that it would be unfair
to apply it because Graham's case was on appeal before the new law
was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   By declining to hear the case, however, the court essentially
upheld the ruling of a lower federal court, which said the
Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 did apply to
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   The intricacies of federal and state appellate laws seem to
matter little to Graham's supporters, who have said they simply
want a new trial for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is the evidence to heard,'' said the Nation of
Islam's Robert Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   Using Graham's case as an example of how he says the death
penalty in Texas is biased against poor, black defendants, Muhammad
and others called for a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   When Graham's previous execution date was being set in January
1999, he called for violence and asked supporters to go to
Huntsville armed with guns.
</P>
<P>
   And while no one at Monday's news conference directly called for
violence, Texas Death Penalty Abolition Movement member Njeri
Shakur said Graham's execution would be ``met with outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson, who has handled the appeal for the district
attorney's office, said Graham has gotten more than a fair hearing
and that his supporters know little about the facts of the case,
other than what they get from ``30-second sound bites.''

MEDIATOR HELPS SETTLE BALTIMORE SCHOOL SUIT
</HEADLINE>
  By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers involved in a case that has dragged through
the federal courts for 16 years said Monday they had reached a
tentative settlement concerning charges that the Baltimore public
school system had woefully neglected physically and mentally
disabled students.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement sets goals for evaluating children with special
needs and for putting special education students into regular
classes and calls for annual monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   What may be most notable, however, is the unusual procedure used
to settle the case, which was scheduled to go to trial Monday. The
parties chose a federal judge _ one not involved in the case _ to
serve as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Such a procedure, the lawyers and the trial judge said, had been
used only once before, and it proved unsuccessful. That occurred
this year in the Microsoft antitrust trial. The judge in that case,
Thomas Penfield Jackson, asked Richard A. Posner, chief judge of
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, to mediate the
dispute, but his efforts failed to produce a solution.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore case, both sides agreed in January to ask Judge
David S. Tatel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia to help them reach a settlement. Lawyers for
both sides said Monday that they were delighted with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The suit dates to 1984, when the Maryland Disability Law Center
sued the city and state, charging that little was being done to
accommodate the needs of the estimated 18 percent of the enrollment
of slightly more than 100,000 students who qualified for special
education. Similar lawsuits have been filed in about a dozen major
cities, including New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the litigation, the city was so discouraged
about its ability to do anything that it came up with the idea of
simply giving televisions, videocassette recorders and computers to
students to make up for its neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier career as a private lawyer in Washington, Tatel
represented the Baltimore school board in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Marvin J. Garbis, who was presiding over the trial, said,
``it has to be a pretty extraordinary person who once sat with the
defense'' to be deemed acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers who were suing the city said they had confidence in
Tatel because he had also once been director of the Office for
Civil Rights in what was the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ney, legal director of the disability center, said the
settlement ``sets a road map for the ultimate disposition of the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts had ruled that the city and state had neglected
children in need of special education, and the last several years
have been about how to remedy that. Under the settlement announced
Monday, the federal courts will ``disengage'' from monitoring the
city's schools if all the goals are substantially met.
</P>
<P>
   Among the requirements of the agreement, the school district
will have to place nearly 60 percent of the special education
students in regular classes, or ``mainstream'' them, in three
years. About 40 percent of such students now attend regular classes
at some point in the school day.
</P>
<P>
   The reading gap between special education and other students
will have to be narrowed in three years, and there will be annual
reporting to a special master, Amy Totenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Garbis said that while the Microsoft case involved great amounts
of money, the Baltimore case involved the ``precious resource of
our children.'' He led the lawyers in a standing ovation to Tatel,
saying, ``the people of Baltimore and its children owe a great deal
to Judge Tatel.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the court, Tatel, who was not compensated for his
work, said he believed that both sides had achieved their goals.
``They produced an agreement that calls for educationally sound but
realistic outcomes that have a good chance of improving the quality
of education in the Baltimore public school system.''

Giuliani, among upstate voters, even with Hillary Rodham Clinton,
his opponent for the United States Senate. In other polls, the
mayor is running ahead of Clinton upstate. He is not running behind

ALL IS CALM ON WALL STREET AS BIG GAUGES MOVE AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved broadly higher Monday in a session
that lacked the volatile swings that characterized so many trading
days during April.
</P>
<P>
   Major market gauges were up from the start. The gains included
technology, led by Microsoft; financial service stocks; major
retailers like Wal-Mart Stores; and biotechnology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice, consistent performance,'' said Michael Clark,
head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It was
different from what we have seen in the recent past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 77.87 points, or 0.7
percent, to 10,811.78. Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Wal-Mart led
the advance in the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.82 points, or
1.1 percent, to 1,468.25. Gains in Cisco Systems, Nortel, EMC and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter helped to fuel the gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index continued an advance that began in
earnest last week. It rose 97.42 points, or 2.5 percent, to
3,958.08. The index is now down just 2.7 percent for the year. But
it is 22 percent below its record high of 5,048.62, set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said the Nasdaq may now be poised to improve. ``The market
for Nasdaq stocks made a climactic low in mid-April, tested it in
late April and is now in an interim recovery that could continue
into the summer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think this is a temporary recovery in Nasdaq, and that
most investors who are overexposed in technology should look for
exit points.''
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks had a good day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 12.68 points, or 2.5 percent, to
518.93. The Russell is up 2.8 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Market breadth was good, but trading volumes were light. On the
New York Stock Exchange, nearly two stocks rose in price for each
one that lost value.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board was 966 million shares. On the Nasdaq
stock market 1.47 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was strong Monday. On its first trading day after the
Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge to split the
company in two, the software giant gained 3 11/16, to 73 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Monday's advance, Microsoft shares are down more than
37 percent so far this year. Some analysts said Monday they see
value in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Some portfolio managers said, however, that Microsoft's stock is
likely to remain under a cloud for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I see value in Microsoft?'' asked Henry Herrman, chief
investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, which manages about $40
billion in assets. ``Sure I see value. But I also see a company
that, while not comparable to Philip Morris, will not be a
technology leader for quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Other technology stocks that did well included Cisco Systems and
EMC Corp. Cisco gained 2 7/64, to 71 7/16. And EMC rose 3}, to 142
9/16.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks had a big day. The Nasdaq biotech index
rose 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest gainers were Genentech, which jumped 9, to
129; and Human Genomics Sciences, which rose 12|, to 89 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks gained, as investors continued to
grapple with how banks and brokerage firms will be affected by
further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup gained }, to 60 5/16. J.P. Morgan rose 1], to 129}.
Chase Manhattan climbed 1|, to 73}. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
closed at 79}, up 3.
</P>
<P>
   Policy Management Systems, a maker of software for insurance and
financial service companies, gained 5], to 18|, after Electronic
Data Systems offered to buy the company for $18 to $20 a share in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Young &AMP; Rubicam fell 5|, to 50 1/16, after WPP Group said
over the weekend that it had pulled out of negotiations to buy the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improved tone, Roth from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
said that at some point he expects stocks to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old-economy stocks and new-economy stocks will go down
together to build a real bottom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you need to see cash build up in equity accounts. Right
now, only 4 percent of money in equity mutual fund accounts is in
cash, which is the lowest number ever. That implies to me that
portfolio managers are wildly optimistic, which by itself is a
reason to be cautious.''

A&AMP;M BONFIRE PANEL DUE TO REPORT TUESDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M University will be the focus
of intense scrutiny Tuesday as a special commission studying the
deadly November Bonfire tragedy will return with a $1.6 million
report on why the log pile collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The commission meeting is expected to attract hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of spectators to the 12,500-seat Reed Arena to watch
five consultants present their findings.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants were charged not only with determining why the
1999 Bonfire fell, but also with assessing any cultural and
organizational conditions at the school that may have contributed
to the Nov. 18 disaster that killed 12 and injured 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope a lot of students are there, because it is important
that everyone get the right story, the facts, and not rely on the
media,'' said Beth Riedel, a former student who helped organize a
petition drive to maintain the Bonfire tradition.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m. Nov. 18, the Bonfire pile quivered and then
collapsed with two loud snaps in roughly five seconds, according to
some survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in five years the Bonfire had fallen. In
1994, the Bonfire stack collapsed much more slowly, allowing
students ample time to get clear. No one was injured in that
collapse, which was blamed on soft soil.
</P>
<P>
   University President Ray Bowen appointed Houston engineer Leo
Linbeck Jr. to chair the special commission investigating the
November collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation covered a variety of topics, including the
roles played in the tragedy by:
</P>
<P>
   --alcohol, which was found in the bloodstream of at least two of
the victims. Police found empty beer cans around the stack site.
</P>
<P>
   --the apparent disregard for university policy that Bonfire not
exceed 55 feet. At the time of the collapse, the stack was
estimated at 59 feet and appeared on its way to 70 feet.
</P>
<P>
   --the sloped ground where the Bonfire was built. Photographs and
an engineering report indicate that the first level of the
wedding-cake structure was leaning, while the other three followed
a true plumb line.
</P>
<P>
   --the quality of materials and workmanship that went into the
Bonfire. Eyewitnesses have said that this year's logs were more
crooked than those of previous years. Others said the logs were not
wired in place as carefully as in the past. This method was used to
stabilize the stack.
</P>
<P>
   --whether the center pole _ two telephone poles spliced together
to anchor the stack _ was unusually dry, as some witnesses have
said.
</P>
<P>
   -- crane that struck the Bonfire stack with enough force to
cause it to shudder days before the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report will not assess blame nor make
recommendations about whether the Bonfire tradition should continue
as it has for 90 years. That will be up to the university.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Bowen is expected to meet with
representatives from the Faculty Senate's executive committee,
student leaders and others before deciding what to do about the
Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M is a university steeped in traditions, and Bonfire is
but one. The massive Bonfire was lit each year during a pep rally
preceding the football game against the rival University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at Texas A&AMP;M supports the tradition, however.
Biology professor Hugh Wilson sponsors a Web site criticizing the
Bonfire. Regardless of the commission's finding, Wilson said, the
school's reputation has already been tarnished. And it will only
get worse if the tradition continues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire makes it so hard for this school to reach (Bowen's)
goal of being a top-10 state university by 2020,'' Wilson said.
``While people on campus and around this community believe that
Bonfire is an important tradition, the first thing people around
the country think about this school is Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may like that tradition, but those closer to academics,
those responsible for determining a school's reputation, see it as
a tremendous waste of resources and a huge source of pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Texas A&AMP;M campus Monday the Spring semester of classes
was winding to a close. Students seemed more worried about final
exams than talking about the Bonfire, a stark contrast from last
winter, when the campus buzzed with debate about the tradition.
Many students were unaware Monday that the commission was about to
report its findings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McWilliams, a junior studying engineering technology, said
most students spent so much time and emotion worrying about the
victims' families that they are ready to move past the Bonfire
tragedy. He expects the Bonfire tradition to continue, but with
modifications to the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty worn out with Bonfire,'' McWilliams said. ``Sure,
we want to see the results. But I believe in God, and he tells us
not to live in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   For other students, however, the Bonfire is a pressing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the student center Monday, Bonfire supporters gathered
signatures for a petition they will present Bowen during a student
forum later this month. So far, the group has more than 6,000
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas A&AMP;M Bookstore, workers prepared a display for a
book critical of the school and the Bonfire. The bookstore kept the
book, ``The Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire: Tradition &AMP; Tragedy at Texas A&AMP;M,''
off to the side until the campus finished with Parents Day and
Muster, an annual memorial for current and former students who died
during the preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be in bad taste to have it on display
before the parents left,'' said store trade book manager Brian
Wasson.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soft-money donations to the political parties are
on a pace to set a record this year, but more and more large
corporations have quietly stopped giving them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, senior executives say they want to distance
themselves from what they describe as the capital's unseemly
culture of cash and influence, while others acknowledge that their
companies are simply not getting much in return for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one corporations that in each previous election cycle
since 1993-94 contributed at least $100,000 in soft money _
unlimited and largely unregulated gifts to the parties _ have not
donated any soft money in the current cycle, covering the last 15
months, according to a computerized study of Federal Election
Commission records. The list includes prolific past contributors
like Revlon, Advanced Micro Devices, Miramax Films, and Starwood
Hotels and Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 31 companies have made statements announcing an end
to their soft-money contributions, and many still make much
smaller, federally regulated donations through political action
committees. But some executives confirmed, although not for
attribution, that their companies had adopted, or were weighing, a
permanent ban on writing soft-money checks.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few large companies _ General Motors, Monsanto,
AlliedSignal, Time Warner, none of them among the most recent 31 _
have announced in recent years that they have sworn off soft money.
Few corporations have followed suit, in at least some cases because
they do not want to risk angering legislators in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more companies out there who are refusing
to give money, but they are not advertising their decision,'' said
Charles E.M. Kolb, president of the Committee for Economic
Development, an association of corporate executives fighting for a
campaign finance overhaul that would outlaw soft money. ``I suspect
that there are more and more companies asking themselves if this is
really worth it. What's just as interesting, though, is the fact
that companies are scared to tell people.''
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said their corporations had stopped giving
soft money because they had found better use of their resources,
like lobbying, contributing to political action committees and
acting as hosts for fund-raising events. Others have stopped giving
because they believe that soft money plays an unhealthy role in the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   While more companies quietly join the ranks of those forgoing
soft-money donations, other corporate interests, senior executives
and labor unions are redoubling them. Since January 1999, the
Democratic and Republican Parties have raised $160.5 million in
soft money, according to data compiled last week by the nonpartisan
watchdog Common Cause. That was nearly double the $84.6 million in
soft money raised by the parties in the first 15 months of the 1996
election cycle. By November, the parties will have raised nearly
$500 million in soft money, some experts predict, as against $262
million in the 1996 cycle. But the addition of 31 companies to the
roster of those turning their backs on giving soft money does add
muscle to the effort of two organizations of corporate leaders that
are pushing for a soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   The effort began in 1995, when Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of the
leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., created
Campaign for America to fight for an overhaul of the nation's
campaign finance system. Kohlberg is being assisted by Warren
Buffett, the acclaimed value investor and chief executive of
Berkshire Hathaway. Last fall, Campaign for America reported that
121 companies that had given at least $100,000 each in 1994 or 1996
had since stopped contributing soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The other group, Kolb's Committee for Economic Development, has
an even larger number of corporate executives, although not all of
them have persuaded their companies to stop writing soft-money
checks.
</P>
<P>
   A senior vice president at one company that has stopped giving
soft-money donations said that ``there was not much benefit'' to
them, especially inasmuch as membership fees of the parties' most
elite donor clubs had jumped to $250,000 from $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is by the time you give the base amount to the
House Republicans, Senate Republicans, House Democrats and Senate
Democrats, it costs the company a total of $60,000 and you find you
don't get a lot of action for it,'' this executive said. ``As
companies go through cost-cutting measures, it's an expense that is
harder to justify.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said the company, which stopped giving soft money
in late 1998, had since found no negative ramifications in its
dealings with lawmakers, adding: ``When we were giving $10,000 or
$15,000, it was never enough; you are constantly asked for more.
The no-money pledge is better than the some-money pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime fund-raisers and political strategists say they
have seen recent signs of what they call ``donor fatigue,''
especially among corporate executives who are bombarded with
solicitations for the parties' elite donor clubs and almost weekly
black-tie dinners and political retreats at resort hotels. The
fund-raisers say the fatigue is the fault of both parties' enormous
appetite for soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last few weeks, I have had several clients of mine
say they are getting out of this soft-money business,'' said Lanny
Davis, a lawyer and lobbyist at Patton Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both political parties have gotten so excessive in trying to
beat the other in the soft-money hunt,'' Davis said. ``I'm part of
the problem, and I've never seen such disgust with the practice in
all my years here. It has reached critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   In past election years, the Democratic National Committee and
the Republican National Committee were the most aggressive
soft-money solicitors. This year, however, the Senate and House
fund-raising committees of each party are also pushing hard to
collect big soft-money checks. With the battle for control of
Congress intensifying, many donors are being solicited by multiple
party committees at the same time, exhausting some supporters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other fund-raisers, however, play down the danger of donor
exhaustion, noting that more corporations are writing larger checks
than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the Republican National Committee
brought in $21.3 million _ the most ever raised in a single event _
at its gala in Washington saluting the party's apparent
presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The Republicans received
six-figure contributions _ and fund-raising assistance _ from
Philip Morris, AT&AMP;T and the National Rifle Association, all three
of which are among the most generous soft-money contributors to the
party this year. The Democrats are hoping to raise a similar amount
at a tribute to President Clinton later this month.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime Republican lobbyist predicted that more
corporations would shun soft-money giving if they learned that
competitors were doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are going to see a rush to the exit, if not a
stampede,'' the lobbyist said. ``People are beginning to say it
does not make sense in the context of our budgeting and our
giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate executives began questioning the practice of
making large contributions after it was revealed the Democratic
National Committee had accepted millions of dollars in illegal
foreign money in the months before Clinton's re-election in
November 1996. The Democratic National Committee returned $3
million in questionable donations.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb of the Committee of Economic Development said his group has
enlisted more than 250 executives and retired executives to endorse
a ban on unlimited contributions. Kolb said an interesting question
would be whether companies that had stopped giving believed their
corporate interests were given short shrift by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, General Motors stopped its practice of giving soft
money. ``The term soft money is used loosely and not very well
understood and is frequently misunderstood,'' said Bill Noack, a GM
spokesman. ``Soft money contributions were perfectly legal, but a
lot of people thought soft money was under the table money and
dirty money.''
</P>
<P>
   Noack said the company has found that refusing to give soft
money has not affected its relations with Congress. ``There are so
many issues that affect us _ the environment, safety and trade _
there is something every day,'' he said. `` And I can't say our
decision has made an impact at all.'' The company, through its
political action committee, still makes federally regulated
donations, with a $5,000 legal maximum, to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Monsanto, which had given $88,700 in soft money during
the 1995-96 election cycle, had quietly stopped giving soft money.
Monsanto, which this month merged with Pharmacia, had not found
that the ban on those contributions had affected relations with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we gave _ and after we stopped giving _ we always had
wonderful relationships with the members in Congress who represent
our company in Missouri,'' said Linda Fisher, Pharmacia's vice
president for government affairs. ``We support them through our PAC
and fund-raisers, and we have found that to be the most successful
way to have our voice heard.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a possibility that some of the corporations may still
give soft money before November.
</P>
<P>
   Although some corporations have not given any money, some of
their top executives have stepped up their contributions. The
Spanos Cos. contributed $295,000 in soft money in 1997-98, and none
in the past 15 months. But its chairman, Alex G. Spanos, gave
$250,000 to the Republican National Committee in March 1999,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Revlon, nor its chief executive, Ronald Perelman, have
given any soft money this cycle. Perelman has given a total of
$7,000 in federally restricted contributions to various candidates.

STARBUCKS' SCHULTZ HEADS TO ASIA TO FOR FIRST-HAND LOOK AT GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY MULADY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It's a week of firsts for Starbucks' Chief Howard
Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   During his first overseas trip since announcing his new role as
global strategist for Starbucks Coffee, and his first trip to
China, Howard Schultz opened the first Starbucks Coffee store in
heart of Hong Kong's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz officially turns his chief executive title over to Orin
Smith on June 1 and takes on the new title of global strategist,
personally overseeing Starbucks growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is untapped potential to grow our company
Internationally,'' said Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed just before he began his current Asia trip, Schultz
said the four store openings in Asia this week reflect the momentum
of Starbucks' strategic growth internationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely excited by our success in the international
marketplace which has come earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must seize the moment following the phenomenal reception
Starbucks has received in all the international markets we have
entered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is eager to see, and understand firsthand, Starbucks come to
life in different countries and different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Schultz was in Seoul, opening the company's largest
store, a five-story, glass-enclosed Starbucks with seating for 200
in the Myondong shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   The store was packed with Starbucks fans and customers waiting
to buy copies of Schultz's book, which has been translated into
Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks first two stores open in Hong Kong Tuesday and
Wednesday. Thursday Schultz arrives in Shanghai to open yet another
new store.
</P>
<P>
   Back home last Friday, shareholders chastened Starbucks,
following the release of its quarterly financial report, apparently
unhappy with the announcement that the company is revving up its
already aggressive growth plan. Shares fell 18 percent Friday and
continued to hover around $30 Monday, down from $45 a few weeks
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz refused to be distracted by the stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always concentrated on our core business, regardless of
whether the stock was up, or in this case, it was down,'' he said
in an interview in Seoul. ``We take care of the customer and our
people, and the stock will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since opening its first store in Tokyo in the summer of 1996,
Starbucks Coffee International has opened stores in the Pacific
Rim, the Middle East and the United Kingdom. The goal of the
company, with retail locations in 15 international markets, is to
have 500 stores in the Pacific Rim and 500 stores in Europe by the
end of fiscal year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks has announced plans to open 750 stores worldwide
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to leave Seattle Friday, Schultz was looking
forward to seeing for himself how the Starbucks experience
translates in China and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an intimacy around sharing a cup of coffee, taking
time out from your day,'' said Schultz. ``There is a common thread
between our countries, we are all aspiring more than ever for that
human contact.''
</P>
<P>
   A coffee tree with red coffee berries ready to be picked, grows
in one of the lobbies of the Starbucks headquarters. It's from the
original Starbucks store in Pike Place Market.
</P>
<P>
   While coffee is still key to the company, the Starbucks
experience is what sells. The company has carefully crafted an
oasis in the chaotic world, with hints of mystery and romance to
elicit an emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to work. The average Starbucks customer returns 18
times a month.
</P>
<P>
   The concept builds on the old European coffee house traditions
Schultz was inspired by. He wants customers to think of Starbucks
as the ``third place'' after home and work.
</P>
<P>
   That third place is very relevant in China,'' said Peter Maslen,
president of Starbucks International. ``When you go into a
Starbucks in China, you see people doing their homework, talking
and meeting friends. It's very much like in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks stores are identical to their American cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Maslen, who joined Starbucks in October, is a veteran of
overseas marketing, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   He said Starbucks reliability, that the product and experience
are the same each time the customer visits, sets Starbucks apart
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said Starbucks' arrival is eagerly anticipated in Hong
Kong, where word of mouth, students returning from studying in the
United States and American movies such as ``You've Got Mail'' have
built excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Seattle roots have helped us, we are perceived as being
from a place where good things come from,'' said Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz and Maslen said women in Asia lead the rush to the local
Starbucks, then return later with their friends, husbands and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong is ready for the Starbucks experience,'' said
Michael Wu, managing director of Maxim's Caterers. Maxim's has
partnered with Starbucks in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz joined Starbucks in 1982 as its marketing director,
providing coffee to restaurants and espresso bars in Seattle. After
traveling to Italy in 1983, he hit on the idea of bringing the
coffee bar culture to Seattle. Two years later, Schultz founded Il
Giornale, offering coffee drinks made from Starbucks beans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Schultz bought Starbucks' assets, and began growing the
company. But even Schultz sometimes seems amazed how far Starbucks
has come.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told about looking at a globe with his children one
evening, pointing out the places Starbucks would be opening this
week. He couldn't help feeling a little proud as he turned the
world for them to see.
</P>
<P>
   It became clearer to him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake, we are opening in China!'' he said later.
</P>

DAVID J. MAHONEY, A BUSINESS EXECUTIVE AND NEUROSCIENCE ADVOCATE,
DIES AT 76  

</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David J. Mahoney, a business leader who left behind
the world of Good Humor, Canada Dry and Avis and threw himself
behind a decidedly less conventional marketing campaign, promoting
research into the brain, died Monday at his home in Palm Beach,
Fla. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart disease, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney, who believed that the study of the brain and its
diseases had been shortchanged for far too long, was sometimes
described as the foremost lay advocate of neuroscience. As chief
executive of the Charles A. Dana Foundation, a medical
philanthropic organization based in Manhattan, he prodded brain
researchers to join forces, shed their traditional caution and
reclusivity and engage the public imagination.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve his goals, he brought to bear the power of
philanthropy, personal persuasion and the connections he had made
at the top of the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   Using his skills as a marketing executive, he worked closely
with some of the world's top neuroscientists to teach them how to
sell government officials holding the purse strings, as well as the
average voter, on the value of their research. He pressed them to
make specific public commitments to find treatments for diseases
like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and depression, rather than conduct
just ``pure'' research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy science solely,'' Mahoney said this year.
``They buy the results of, and the hope of, science.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, aided by Dr. James D. Watson, who won the Nobel Prize
as a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, Mahoney founded the
Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives, a foundation organization of
about 190 neuroscientists, including Watson and six other Nobel
laureates, that works to educate the public about their field.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, after taking over the 50-year-old Dana
Foundation as chief executive, Mahoney began shifting it away from
its traditional mission of supporting broader health and
educational programs, and focused its grants almost exclusively on
neuroscience. Since then, the foundation has given some $34 million
to scientists working on brain research at more than 45
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney also dipped into his fortune, giving millions of dollars
to endow programs in neuroscience at Harvard and the University of
Pennsylvania. Later this month, the Albert and Mary Lasker
Foundation, which traditionally honors the most accomplished
researchers, was to give him a newly created award for
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put his money where his mouth was,'' said Dr. Kay Redfield
Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney's journey from businessman to devotee of one of the most
esoteric fields of health was as unusual as it was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   David Joseph Mahoney Jr. was born in the Bronx on May 17, 1923,
the son of David J. Mahoney, a construction worker, and the former
Loretta Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as an infantry captain in the Pacific during World
War II, he enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School. He studied at night, and during the day he worked 90 miles
away in the mail room of a Manhattan advertising agency, Ruthrauff
&AMP; Ryan. By the time he was 25, he had become a vice president of
the agency _ by some accounts, the youngest vice president on
Madison Avenue at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1951, in a move in keeping with the restlessness that
characterized his business career, he left Ruthrauff &AMP; Ryan to form
his own agency. Four years later, when his business was worth $2
million, he moved on again, selling it to run Good Humor, the
ice-cream company that his small agency had managed to snare as a
client.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, when Good Humor was sold, Mahoney became
executive vice president of Colgate-Palmolive, then president of
Canada Dry, and then, in 1969, president and chief operating
officer of Norton Simon, formed from Canada Dry, Hunt Food and
McCall's. Under Mahoney, Norton Simon grew into a $3 billion
conglomerate that included Avis Rent A Car, Halston, Max Factor and
the United Can Co.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his charm, associates said, he had a short temper and an
impatient manner that often sent subordinates packing. ``I burn
people out,'' he once said in an interview. ``I'm intense, and I
think that intensity is sometimes taken for anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The public knew him as one of the first chief executives to go
in front of the camera to promote his product, in this case, in the
early 1980s for Avis rental cars, which Norton Simon had acquired
under his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, including his own, Mahoney was living on top of
the world. He was one of the nation's top-paid executives,
receiving $1.85 million in compensation in 1982 _ a fact that did
not always endear him to some Norton Simon shareholders, who filed
lawsuits charging excessive compensation, given that his company's
performance did not always keep pace with his raises.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and trim, he moved among society's elite and was friends
with Henry Kissinger, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and Barbara Walters. He
was reported to have advised Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan, and to have met with Carter at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   But his fortunes changed late in 1983. True to form, the
restless Mahoney was seeking change, putting into motion a plan to
take Norton Simon private. But this time, he stumbled: A rival
suitor, the Esmark Corp., bettered his offer and walked away with
his company.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney was left a lot richer _ as much as $40 million or so, by
some accounts _ but, for the first time in his life, he was out of
a job and at loose ends. He described the period as a low point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stop being on the `A' list,'' he said some years later.
``Your calls don't get returned. It's not just less fawning; people
could care less about you in some cases. The king is dead. Long
live the king.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he turned his attention to public health, in which he
had already shown some interest. In the 1970s, he had been chairman
of the board of Phoenix House, the residential drug-treatment
program. By 1977, while still at Norton, he became chairman of the
Dana Foundation, a largely advisory position.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney increasingly devoted his time to the foundation. In
1992, he also became its chief executive and soon began shifting
the organization's focus to the brain. In an acceptance speech that
he had prepared for the Lasker Award, he wrote of having seen
firsthand the effects of stress and the mental health needs of
people in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   But associates recalled, and Mahoney seemed to say as much in
his speech, that he appeared to have arrived at the brain much the
way a marketing executive would think up a new product. ``Some of
the great minds in the world told me that this generation's
greatest action would be in brain science _ if only the public
would invest the needed resources,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mahoney and Watson gathered a group of neuroscientists
at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island. There,
encouraged by Mahoney, the scientists agreed on 10 research
objectives that might be reached by the end of the decade, among
them finding the genetic basis for manic-depression and identifying
chemicals that can block the action of cocaine and other addictive
substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten somewhere on about four of them _ but that's
life,'' Watson said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mahoney became convinced that a true
understanding of the brain-body connection might also lead to cures
for diseases in other parts of the body, like cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   He believed that it would soon be commonplace for people to live
to 100. For the quality of life to be high at that age, he
believed, people would have to learn to take better care of their
brains.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, along with Dr. Richard Restak, a neuropsychiatrist,
Mahoney wrote ``The Longevity Strategy: How to Live to 100: Using
the Brain-Body Connection'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons).
</P>

   Mahoney's first wife, Barbara Ann Moore, died in 1975. He is
survived by his wife, the former Hildegarde Merrill, with whom he
also had a home in Lausanne, Switzerland; a son, David, of Royal
Palm Beach, Fla.; two stepsons, Arthur Merrill of Muttontown, N.Y.,
and Robert Merrill of Locust Valley, N.Y., and a brother, Robert,
of Bridgehampton, N.Y.

   Associates said Mahoney's temperament in his second career was
not all that different from what it had been in his first. It was
not uncommon, said Edward Rover, vice chairman of the Dana
Foundation's board of trustees, for his phone to ring late at
night, and for Mahoney to sail into a pointed critique of their
latest endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher spoke of his ``kind of charge-up-San-Juan-Hill
style.'' Jamison called him ``impatient in the best possible sense
of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his first career, Mahoney never lost the good salesman's
unwavering belief in his product. ``If you can't sell the brain,''
he told friends, ``then you've got a real problem.''

PHAM VAN DONG, VOICE OF VIETNAM'S REVOLT, DIES AT 94 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pham Van Dong, who led the Vietnamese Communists' delegation to
the Geneva peace talks in 1954 that ended the French war in
Indochina and then served as Hanoi's prime minister for three
decades, died a day before the 25th anniversary of the fall of
Saigon, The Associated Press reported from Vietnam on Monday. He
was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Dong, who has sometimes been compared to China's late Prime
Minister Zhou Enlai, a charming but tough diplomat and bureaucrat
who politely played a secondary role to his country's chief
Communist leader, had been hospitalized on life support for months
before his death Saturday, officials told AP.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Dong died at a Hanoi hospital and a state
funeral is planned for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was one of the early revolutionaries who joined Ho Chi Minh
to found the Viet Minh, was imprisoned by the French colonial
regime, helped defeat both the French and the Americans and later
reunified Vietnam under Communist rule on April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He became premier of North Vietnam after independence from the
French in 1954 and headed the government of all Vietnam from 1976
to 1987. He remained a fiercely loyal Communist, but he
acknowledged to an American journalist and author, Stanley Karnow,
in 1981, that rebuilding Vietnam after decades of war was more
difficult than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we defeated the United States. But now we are plagued
with problems,'' Karnow quoted Dong as saying in his book,
``Vietnam: A History'' (Viking, 1983). ``We do not have enough to
eat. We are a poor, undeveloped nation ... waging a war is simple,
but running a country is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Dong was a government adviser but he still warned
in speeches about the dangers of economic reforms. In his final
years he was increasingly frail and nearly blind.
</P>
<P>
   Dong was born March 1, 1906, in Quang Ngai province, then part
of the French protectorate of Annam in the central part of Vietnam.
His father was a member of the elite Mandarin class and a private
secretary to one of Vietnam's last emperors.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other privileged young Vietnamese his age, he
learned nationalism in his youth at the prestigious Lycee Quoc Hoc,
in Hue, the old imperial capital of Vietnam. A turning point in
Dong's life came in 1925 when he joined a student strike in Hanoi,
and then had to flee to China when it was put down by the French.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh was organizing a covert opposition in southern
China, and Dong joined his Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth
Association, learning the precepts of Marxism and the skills of
Leninist party organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Dong returned to Vietnam to organize Communist cells,
but was soon caught by the French and sent to the dreaded prison
island of Poulo Condore in the South China Sea where he was
confined for seven years. The experience only made him a more
committed Communist, and after his release he resumed his
underground organizing in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, following another failed uprising, Dong fled to south
China again and joined his mentor, Ho, who had established a
guerrilla base there, recruiting and training soldiers and cadres
to cross into northern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Dong became a founding member of the Viet Minh, a
nationalist organization whose domination by the Communists was
disguised to draw in a wide variety of patriotic Vietnamese
disgruntled by French rule. Only later would Ho and Dong and other
Communist leaders acknowledge their true purpose. In 1960, after
their victory over the French, Dong said, ``In our country, to be a
patriot means to love socialism. Patriotism is closely linked with
socialism and the Communist is the most genuine patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of World War II in August 1945, as the French were
trying to re-establish control of their colony in Vietnam, the Viet
Minh formed a provisional government with Dong as finance minister
and Ho as president. Open fighting between the returning French and
the Viet Minh soon broke out, the beginning of 30 years of war.
</P>
<P>
   Dong journeyed with Ho to Paris in 1946 for peace talks, trying
to gain independence, but when the talks broke down, full scale
fighting resumed, with the Americans aiding the French and the
Chinese Communists helping the Viet Minh.
</P>
<P>
   At the war's end in 1954, after the French were badly defeated
at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, Dong was chosen to head the Viet
Minh delegation to the Geneva conference. It should have been a
moment of complete triumph for Dong, but he felt betrayed by Zhou,
the Chinese premier, who headed China's delegation to the talks and
seemed more interested in avoiding further war with the Americans
after the Korean War and agreed to divide Vietnam between a
Communist north and a non-Communist south.
</P>
<P>
   According to one version, Zhou invited Dong to a dinner party,
but to Dong's fury, also invited a brother of Ngo Dinh Diem, a
Catholic anti-Communist who went on to become the leader of South
Vietnam. Diem's brother was seated in the place of honor at Zhou's
left, and Dong overheard the two men talking about their love of
China's Qing Dynasty porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are the envoy to Beijing,'' Zhou is quoted as saying
to Diem's brother, ``I hope you will see more of Qing ceramics.''
To Dong, this clearly implied that not only would China agree to
the division of Vietnam, which would cost the Viet Minh half their
victory, but that China would recognize the newly created
government in South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   This was the beginning of a terrible feud between the Vietnamese
and Chinese Communists which lingered through the American war in
Vietnam, unknown to Washington, and which burst into the open in
1979 when China invaded the northern part of Vietnam. If America's
leaders had been more knowledgeable, they would not have asserted
that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to stop the Chinese
Communists. That was one of the primary reasons invoked by
Washington for becoming involved in Vietnam.

MAYOR'S WIFE TO POSTPONE HER ROLE IN `MONOLOGUES'
</HEADLINE>
  By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donna Hanover _ an actress, television personality
and the wife of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ announced Monday that she
was postponing her performance in ``The Vagina Monologues'' because
of ``personal family circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover's announcement came four days after the mayor announced
that he had prostate cancer and would spend the next two weeks
deciding on treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover had been scheduled to take a lead role starting May 30
in the Off-Broadway hit, which features monologues on topics like
orgasm and childbirth. She made her announcement in this
two-sentence statement released by her office: ``Due to personal
family circumstances, I have decided to postpone my performance in
`The Vagina Monologues.' I will work with the show's producers and
directors to set a date to join another team of esteemed actresses
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover had been scheduled to appear for two weeks in the show
with the actresses Kirstie Alley and Hazelle Goodman. David Stone,
the lead producer of the show, said Monday that he expected Hanover
to rejoin the show ``soon, in a couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover, who has led a separate public life from the mayor since
1996, had no further comment Monday. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny
Mindel, said the mayor also had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eve Ensler, the author of ``The Vagina Monologues'' and a friend
and political supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's
opponent for U.S. Senate, was traveling in Afghanistan on Monday
and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides had said the mayor would not have been able to
attend his wife's opening night performance on May 30, which would
have occurred on the same night as the state Republican convention,
where Giuliani is expected to be designated as the party's Senate
nominee. It was unclear whether Giuliani would have attended any of
the other performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is independent, she leads an independent life, so do
I,'' the mayor said last month. ``I think those discussions will be
private discussions about whether I do or don't'' attend.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Hanover's said Monday that the mayor's wife probably
made her decision not because she considered performing in the show
inappropriate right now, but because of the practical concerns of
having to perform six nights a week with two children at home while
her husband might be in the hospital or undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani said Monday at his daily City Hall news
briefing that he had met with his doctors in the morning but had
had no further tests for his cancer, which is in an early,
treatable form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even asked the doctor, `Any more tests?''' Giuliani said.
``It would be good to have another test. There are no more tests.
It's just a matter of analyzing all of the information that's
there, and figuring out the right option. Which is, you know,
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also told reporters not to expect regular bulletins on
his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give you daily medical updates,'' he said,
laughing. ``You want to know the discussions with my doctor today
and the whole thing?'' Giuliani added that after he got some second
opinions, ``which will be, you know, in a week or so, then we'll
discuss it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said again that he was ``hopeful'' that he would be
able to run for Senate, but that his health was his first priority.
``My first decision, and the way I'm going to keep my mind focused
on this is, what is the best option in terms of getting the most
complete cure? I'm still less than a week into analyzing this, and
that's what I'm going to do. Running is something I would like to
do. Being alive and healthy is more important.''

SUPREME COURT RULES IN TWO TEXAS CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case brought by sheriff's deputies in Houston,
the Supreme Court ruled Monday that local governments can decide
how they compensate employees for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In its 6-3 decision, the court resolved in Harris County's favor
a long-standing pay dispute in which 127 deputies argued that
federal law allows them, and not the municipality, to decide how
their overtime work should be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The county successfully countered that it can order workers to
take time off at their regular wage rather than pay them
``time-and-a-half'' in overtime compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In another Texas case Monday, a divided court overturned part of
the conviction of a child molester, saying state prosecutors relied
on improper testimony from the victim to secure the guilty verdict.
But the justices' 5-4 decision will not affect the life prison
sentence given Scott Leslie Carmell for having sexually assaulted
his young stepdaughter, identified in court papers as ``KM.''
</P>
<P>
   In the deputies' case, Harris County Attorney Michael Fleming
hailed the court's decision as a ``huge victory for local
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it could cost the county up to $20 million in annual
overtime compensation if the Sheriff's Department was not able to
order deputies to take time off instead of pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local taxpayers have the burden of handling the budgets of
their governmental entities,'' said Fleming, who argued the case
before the justices. A ruling for employee control of overtime pay
would have ``destroyed the ability of local entities to plan their
budgets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies' attorneys said they were disappointed by the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad day for the working man,'' attorney Murray Malakoff
said. ``The bottom line is that they will bend the rules when the
rules favor management. It just gives you cause to wonder if there
is justice for the working men and women in the public sector these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Richard Cobb said that unless Congress amends the law,
nothing more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last court of last resort,'' Cobb said.
``Congress should go back and amend the Fair Labor Standards Act so
that from now on, you have to pay everybody in cash. That would
eliminate the problem. But the cities will really squawk at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court, agreeing with the county, said the federal Fair
Labor Standards Act lets state and local governments determine
whether to reward its overtime employees with extra pay or paid
days off. The law demands only that employees receive ``timely
compensation'' for working overtime, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote
in the court's majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Thomas' opinion were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens said the federal law,
rather than giving employers leeway to set overtime compensation
rules, calls for employers and employees to agree on how extra
hours will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' dissent were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the molestation case, Carmell, of North Texas, was convicted
on 15 counts of sexual abuse from February 1991 to March 1995. The
court's decision overturns the verdicts on only four of those
counts.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, while not addressing his more serious offenses,
said prosecutors violated Carmell's constitutional rights by using
a 1993 change in Texas trial procedure that allowed the girl to
testify about all the alleged attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the court said the Constitution bars states
from making it easier for courts to convict defendants by rewriting
the rules of trial procedure to allow testimony that would have
been barred at the time the offense was committed.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of several of Carmell's offenses, sexual-assault
victims between ages 14 and 17 were barred from testifying against
their alleged attacker if they waited more than six months before
telling anyone of the alleged attack, as KM had done. The child's
testimony also had to be supported with corroborating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas, in its 1993 change, began allowing girls between 14
and 17 to testify, even if they had waited more than six months.
Juries also were allowed to convict defendants based solely on the
girl's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling marked a defeat for Texas Attorney General John
Cornyn, who had argued the case against Carmell before the
justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respectfully disagree with the court's decision, but
thankfully Mr. Carmell will remain in prison despite the court's
ruling,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, writing for the majority, said the ex post facto clause
of the Constitution forbids states from applying relaxed rules on
the admission of testimony at the trial of someone whose alleged
offense occurred before the rules were changed.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Stevens' opinion were Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, in a vehement dissent, said the Constitution does
permit states to change trial rules regarding when a child is
deemed competent to give testimony. Such an amendment does not
violate the ex post facto clause, which prevents defendants from
being charged with a crime that was not regarded as illegal at the
time it was committed, she said.

TRADE WAS GOOD FOR BOTH TEAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There might be times this season when the
Anaheim Angels will miss Jim Edmonds, but Kent Bottenfield and Adam
Kennedy _ the two players they got from St. Louis in exchange for
the Gold Glove outfielder _ are doing their best to make the trade
look like a good one for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is batting .318, has been one of the Angels best clutch
hitters and isn't hurting them with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, meanwhile, has been a welcome presence on a staff
that began the season with many question marks. Toss out a shelling
in Toronto two weeks ago and the right-hander has a 2.36 ERA in
five starts.
</P>
<P>
   In seven innings of a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay on Sunday,
Bottenfield struck out nine, walked none and allowed only a two-run
homer by Vinny Castilla. It was the third time in his last four
starts that Bottenfield (2-3) has gone at least seven innings. But
it was only the second time his teammates have scored more than
three runs for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we heard about him from the scouting reports, he's
lived up to,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ``He's a great command
pitcher. If we support him in the field and at the plate, he's
going to put up numbers like he did last year (18 wins and a berth
on the All-Star team).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Break time? Troy Glaus, who committed his third and fourth
errors of the season on Friday and Saturday night, might be a
candidate for a day off after starting the Angels' first 26 games.
The problem is Glaus, who hit his seventh homer Sunday, is playing
too well to sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably a little tired,'' Scioscia said. ``But he's
probably still the best third baseman in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Angels catchers Bengie Molina and Matt Walbeck have
thrown out 52 percent (12 of 23) of the runners who have tried to
steal against them. . . . The Angels' plan to use the DH spot to
give position players a rest worked well over the weekend. Tim
Salmon hit the game-winning, 13th-inning homer on Saturday and
Darin Erstad had two hits, a walk, a run scored and an RBI from
that spot on Sunday. . . . The Angels series next weekend in
Seattle will be their first meeting against an AL West opponent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of television viewers found themselves without access
to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular ABC
television programs on Monday as a battle between the country's two
biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt Disney, reached a
fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves how much Time Warner should pay Disney,
which owns ABC, for carrying its cable channels, which include The
Disney Channel, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon. But it also
touches on larger issues dealing with the distribution of news and
entertainment programming, including longstanding antipathy between
the cable and broadcast industry, growing competition between cable
and satellite companies and Disney's opposition to the proposed
merger between America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable removed seven ABC stations from cable systems
serving 3.5 million homes _ in New York; Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif. _
at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The move came during one of television's most
competitive ratings periods, a sweeps month, when networks and
stations always trot out their most expensive shows. Disney had
offered a 24-day extension on its negotiations over the cable
payments.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ABC asked the Federal Communications Commission to
force Time Warner to restore the programming. A commission
spokesman, David Fiske, said the commission expected a response
from Time Warner by the close of business Tuesday and ``will
expedite a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is basing its request on a vague clause about sweeps month
actions in the 1992 Cable Act. In a statement Monday, the
commission encouraged the companies to resolve the issue privately.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledged that they could be damaged by the
impasse. Disney stands to lose advertising revenue and the
opportunity to draw a maximum audience for some highly anticipated
programming, including the Kentucky Derby this weekend and the
season finales of many of its series. Time Warner risks alienating
its customers at a time when satellite distribution is growing and
giving fodder to those who are arguing in Washington that the
America Online-Time Warner merger would concentrate too much power
in one company.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extension issue is complicated by the merger, with Time
Warner demanding a bargaining deadline for eight months from now _
presumably after federal regulators had approved the AOL deal.
Disney had wanted the shorter 24-day extension, presumably to
retain the merger issue as leverage in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides worked furiously Monday to present their cases to the
public. On the channels where it had been carrying ABC, Time Warner
posted the message, ``Disney has taken ABC away from you.'' A Time
Warner spokesman said the company was under legal obligation to
pull ABC's signals because no agreement was in place and Disney had
failed to negotiate seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But Preston Padden, the executive vice president of governmental
relations at Disney, said, ``They're liars and monopolists.''
Robert A. Iger, the president of Disney, said: ``They told
consumers a blatant lie in saying we pulled the plug. The last time
I checked they were responsible to local authorization for their
franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner charged that Disney was trying to boost earnings by
extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in what is known as
``retransmission consent'' negotiations. Broadcast stations have
the right to seek compensation from cable systems for the right to
retransmit their signals on cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said they were close to a deal with
Disney in December that would have turned The Disney Channel from a
premium service to a basic channel, as well as adding two other
Disney cable channels, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon, to Time
Warner's cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides disagree on the payment terms of that
deal, both agree that after the merger with AOL was announced in
January, Disney backed off, saying the situation had changed.
Disney argued that it was concerned about maintaining free access
to opportunities created by the convergence of television with the
Internet, which Time Warner and AOL hope to explore. Time Warner
calls this a negotiating ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Padden, Disney's chief lobbyist, said the company was worried
specifically about being blocked from utilizing interactive
features like commercials with links to the Internet and digital TV
that could allow viewers to purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Disney executives began to aggressively lobby
Congress against the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Disney infuriated Time Warner by offering cable
subscribers in Houston a $99 rebate on a satellite dish when the
two sides were facing a deadline in that city. More than 15,000
people took Disney up on the offer, which Time Warner said was a
threat to its business.
</P>
<P>
   The differences about the negotiations extended to virtually
every detail of the discussions. Fred Dressler, the senior vice
president of Time Warner and the chief negotiator with ABC said
that Disney's new demands added a total of $300 million to the
10-year agreement the two companies already had in place. Iger, the
president of Disney, called the $300 million figure ``totally
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of ABC's programs in about 3.5 million homes _ a small
percentage of the 100 million homes with television sets _ may not
drastically affect the overall ratings for the sweeps programs, but
advertisers will expect ABC to make up for whatever shortfalls are
experienced by granting them free future commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy network television and all of a sudden your
schedule is not delivering the kind of audiences you're expecting,
then it's a concern,'' said Bill Cella, the director of broadcast
programming for Universal McCann, an advertising agency. Two senior
media industry executives said ABC could expect to lose between $2
million and $3 million a day worth of commercials it would later
have to offer for free.

USC MIGHT GET HURT BY SUMMER CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Henry Bibby is trying to build a competitive
basketball program at USC. He needs recruits to do that. Problem
is, few premier high school players go to sleep at night dreaming
of playing basketball for the Trojans. They'd rather go across town
to UCLA or to Duke or North Carolina, the Rolls-Royces of college
hoops.
</P>
<P>
   USC is more like a midsized sedan.
</P>
<P>
   So Bibby has a major sales job on his hands. He has to convince
these kids that USC is a viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he needs ample time to cultivate relationships with
players, to visit with them and watch them play. In essence, Bibby
needs time to make up ground on the more-established programs he
battles each year for star recruits, battles that are sometimes won
or lost during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge Bibby actually looks forward to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem being out there in the summer,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NCAA is threatening to reduce Bibby's time dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, the NCAA Division I board of directors voted to
pass a wide-ranging package of basketball reforms _ including
scaling back summer recruiting and limiting the number of men's
scholarships schools can annually award.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the summer evaluation period will be cut back from 50
days to 40 and then eliminated altogether the next season unless a
new plan can be formulated. The sweeping change is in response to
the participation of questionable coaches in summer camps run by
outside organizations such as the AAU and shoe companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unsavory influences that permeate summer basketball are
unacceptable to us and we have to shut that down,'' said Graham
Sanier, president of Penn State and chairman of the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Sanier has a point, of course. In some cases, college coaches
have to deal with summer coaches just for the chance to talk to
players. The coaches, often hangers-on or family friends or even
street agents, latch on to players with cash payments or gifts.
It's a system that invites trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, and other coaches in similar situations, understand the
need to eliminate the seedy aspect of summer camps. But to do away
with the evaluation period altogether could seriously affect
smaller schools. They need the offseason time to scout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, I have to be out there to be in the ballgame with
recruits, if only to impress them and let them see me,'' Bibby
said. ``A lot of these bigger schools like UCLA or Duke send one
letter to a kid, and he wants to go there. We have to send 100
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA took action after brushing against the edgy side of
summer basketball this year. UCLA's JaRon Rush and his brother
Kareem, who plays at Missouri, were suspended for accepting gifts
from Kansas City summer league coach Myron Piggie. JaRon also took
money from an agent. St. John's star Eric Barkley was suspended
twice this year for similar infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie was charged April 13 in an indictment with paying JaRon
and Kareem, Oklahoma State's Andre Williams, former Duke player
Corey Maggette and ex-Wichita high school star Korleone Young more
than $35,000 while they were in high school and played for him
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby agrees something needs to be done to exterminate corrupt
influences like Piggie. He just hopes the NCAA understands the
difficult task he has and that its future decisions will reflect
the challenge he faces.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA's latest plan remains in effect, the
more-established programs will gain a monumental edge over their
smaller counterparts. In the past, Bibby was rewarded for his
hustle during the summer by landing key recruits. Had it not been
for Bibby's tenacity, some of those players might not have
considered USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issues are the people involved in these summer
camps,'' Bibby said. ``So many people have their hands in the pot
at these camps that some of the bigger schools want to back off
them entirely. But doing that ends up hurting the smaller schools
that have to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Rick Majerus agrees. Majerus built a national power
at Utah with his relentless recruiting, outworking other schools
for top players. Now he might not get that chance, at least during
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're Duke, you don't have to go out and recruit. They
select who they want,'' Majerus said. ``A guy like me has to
recruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the NCAA helped contribute to problems during the
summer. Many camps and tournaments during that time are put on by
shoe companies _ the same companies that many of the NCAA's member
schools are contractually tied to.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Michigan State, the defending national champion,
agreed to make Nike the exclusive outfitter for the Spartans'
basketball team. The deal will net the school more than $1 million
in cash and merchandise each year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NCAA wants to clean up a mess it helped create. It's a
noble effort, only Bibby and Majerus and coaches from all the
lesser-known Division I schools wonder whether they'll get swept
out in the process.

   In New York at least, ABC got backing from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who attacked Time Warner as a predatory monopoly. ``This
is an example of what happens when you let a monopoly get too

the idea of going out and getting an antenna is stupid.''

   In the meantime, Time Warner cable subscribers either needed to

would allow viewing through an antenna.

   Disney spokesmen would not discuss the level of involvement of
Michael Eisner, the company's chairman, but Dressler of Time Warner
said all the Disney negotiators had said that ``Michael Eisner is
calling the shots on this and he's not going to take the deal we
had in December.'' He said the negotiating tactics were ``pure
Eisner,'' adding, ``This is Disney looking to increase revenues to
help its stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said their own senior managers, including
the chairman, Gerald Levin, were extremely involved in the decision
to refuse Disney's extension offer. But Iger said that assigning

   Compensation for programming has been an issue in numerous
confrontations between broadcasters and cable companies in the
past. Until the 1992 Cable Act, cable systems could carry broadcast
stations without offering compensation. At that time, broadcasters
won the right to negotiate with cable companies for some kind of
compensation. CBS led a move to force cable operators to pay
subscriber fees to network stations, just as cable operators do to
other programmers, like Lifetime or the Arts and Entertainment
Network. That move failed when the other networks, led, as it
happened, by ABC, opted _ instead of getting cash _ to increase
distribution for cable channels they owned. ABC won carriage for
ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast stations have rarely been pulled off cable systems.
News Corp. the parent of the Fox network, pulled its stations off
systems owned by Cox Cable late last year in a dispute over terms
of carriage of sports and movie channels owned by Fox. The matter
was settled in five days. An independent station in Portland,
Maine, pulled its signal from a Time Warner cable system in 1993,
seeking cash for retransmission consent. That dispute lasted one
day.

<P>
   Time Warner said it had not met with similar opposition in its
more recent retransmission deals with the other broadcast networks.
In late December it concluded a long-term deal with News Corp.,
which involved carriage of news sports and movie channels. Time
Warner had a deal in effect with CBS until 2003 and one with NBC
until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has reached agreement with Fox and CBS to carry new
features and stations that can be created as a result of digital
technology in the coming years. NBC is still negotiating.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of television viewers found themselves without access
to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular ABC
television programs on Monday as a battle between the country's two
biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt Disney, reached a
fever pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves how much Time Warner should pay Disney,
which owns ABC, for carrying its cable channels, which include The
Disney Channel, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon. But it also
touches on larger issues dealing with the distribution of news and
entertainment programming, including longstanding antipathy between
the cable and broadcast industry, growing competition between cable
and satellite companies and Disney's opposition to the proposed
merger between America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable removed seven ABC stations from cable systems
serving 3.5 million homes _ in New York; Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Houston; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif. _
at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The move came during one of television's most
competitive ratings periods, a sweeps month, when networks and
stations always trot out their most expensive shows. Disney had
offered a 24-day extension on its negotiations over the cable
payments.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ABC asked the Federal Communications Commission to
force Time Warner to restore the programming. A commission
spokesman, David Fiske, said the commission expected a response
from Time Warner by the close of business Tuesday and ``will
expedite a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC is basing its request on a vague clause about sweeps month
actions in the 1992 Cable Act. In a statement Monday, the
commission encouraged the companies to resolve the issue privately.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledged that they could be damaged by the
impasse. Disney stands to lose advertising revenue and the
opportunity to draw a maximum audience for some highly anticipated
programming, including the Kentucky Derby this weekend and the
season finales of many of its series. Time Warner risks alienating
its customers at a time when satellite distribution is growing and
giving fodder to those who are arguing in Washington that the
America Online-Time Warner merger would concentrate too much power
in one company.
</P>
<P>
   Even the extension issue is complicated by the merger, with Time
Warner demanding a bargaining deadline for eight months from now _
presumably after federal regulators had approved the AOL deal.
Disney had wanted the shorter 24-day extension, presumably to
retain the merger issue as leverage in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides worked furiously Monday to present their cases to the
public. On the channels where it had been carrying ABC, Time Warner
posted the message, ``Disney has taken ABC away from you.'' A Time
Warner spokesman said the company was under legal obligation to
pull ABC's signals because no agreement was in place and Disney had
failed to negotiate seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But Preston Padden, the executive vice president of governmental
relations at Disney, said, ``They're liars and monopolists.''
Robert A. Iger, the president of Disney, said: ``They told
consumers a blatant lie in saying we pulled the plug. The last time
I checked they were responsible to local authorization for their
franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner charged that Disney was trying to boost earnings by
extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in what is known as
``retransmission consent'' negotiations. Broadcast stations have
the right to seek compensation from cable systems for the right to
retransmit their signals on cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executives said they were close to a deal with
Disney in December that would have turned The Disney Channel from a
premium service to a basic channel, as well as adding two other
Disney cable channels, The Soap Channel and Disney Toon, to Time
Warner's cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides disagree on the payment terms of that
deal, both agree that after the merger with AOL was announced in
January, Disney backed off, saying the situation had changed.
Disney argued that it was concerned about maintaining free access
to opportunities created by the convergence of television with the
Internet, which Time Warner and AOL hope to explore. Time Warner
calls this a negotiating ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Padden, Disney's chief lobbyist, said the company was worried
specifically about being blocked from utilizing interactive
features like commercials with links to the Internet and digital TV
that could allow viewers to purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Disney executives began to aggressively lobby
Congress against the proposed merger.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Disney infuriated Time Warner by offering cable
subscribers in Houston a $99 rebate on a satellite dish when the
two sides were facing a deadline in that city. More than 15,000
people took Disney up on the offer, which Time Warner said was a
threat to its business.
</P>
<P>
   The differences about the negotiations extended to virtually
every detail of the discussions. Fred Dressler, the senior vice
president of Time Warner and the chief negotiator with ABC said
that Disney's new demands added a total of $300 million to the
10-year agreement the two companies already had in place. Iger, the
president of Disney, called the $300 million figure ``totally
preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of ABC's programs in about 3.5 million homes _ a small
percentage of the 100 million homes with television sets _ may not
drastically affect the overall ratings for the sweeps programs, but
advertisers will expect ABC to make up for whatever shortfalls are
experienced by granting them free future commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy network television and all of a sudden your
schedule is not delivering the kind of audiences you're expecting,
then it's a concern,'' said Bill Cella, the director of broadcast
programming for Universal McCann, an advertising agency. Two senior
media industry executives said ABC could expect to lose between $2
million and $3 million a day worth of commercials it would later
have to offer for free.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When you're a star at a NCAA Division II school
and you've played before smaller crowds in the Panhandle, Valley
Ranch can look like the King Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But Cowboys rookie cornerback Kareem Larrimore, a former West
Texas A&AMP;M star, exudes confidence after his first taste of
professional football during the team's three-day minicamp that
concluded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a small school, but we had good coaching and talent
there,'' Larrimore said. ``The only difference is when you're at a
larger school, you get 40,000, 50,000 or 80,000 people to watch you
play. At a small school, you get 13,000 at the max. The only
difference is the size of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, at this level, it's not a problem,'' Larrimore
added. ``You have to play as big as the big man. And I'm out to
play with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds of reaching NFL stardom do not favor players from
Division II schools, said Larry Lacewell, the Cowboys' director of
pro and college scouting. He said there is ``a huge dropoff''
between even Division I-AA and Division II competition.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't prevented the Cowboys from finding stars among the
lower ranks of college football.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have four players _ Guard Larry Allen (Sonoma
State), linebacker Dexter Coakley (Appalachian State), defensive
tackle Leon Lett (Emporia State, Kan.,) and tackle Erik Williams
(Central State, Ohio) _ who did not play Division I-A football who
went to the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewell said the Cowboys have three rookies from Division II
schools _ Larrimore, drafted in the fourth round, receiver Drew
Cone (Southern Arkansas) and defensive end Bryant Shaw (Mississippi
College) on their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, 5-foot-11, 190, said he was surprised, but not
intimidated, by the speed of veteran pro receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They teach you so well here that you adapt very quickly,'' he
said, adding that the minicamp was ``pretty much what I expected.
You know, TV doesn't lie. After you watch the \Rveteran players\S
on TV and see them run here, you know it's not a joke. Everything
that I saw \Ron TV\S was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore, who was timed in 4.34 seconds in the 40-yard dash at
the NFL Combine in Indianapolis, said his gameplan is to find his
niche and impress head coach Dave Campo, who said he liked
Larrimore's aggressiveness and his willingness to participate in
drills when an extra person was needed. Campo also said he was
impressed by Larrimore's courage to take on veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just starting off as a nickel back and trying to move my
way up the ladder,'' Larrimore said. ``Everything is so fast and
the coaching is so excellent, that I can't help but get better. If
I focus and do what I have to do, I'll be primed for Sundays.''

MOISO, RUSH OFF TO NBA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Continuing a recent tradition with UCLA men's
basketball, sophomores Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush will announce
today they are making themselves available for the the NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported in the Daily News on April 13, Moiso and Rush
are giving up their final two years in Westwood. Last year, point
guard Baron Davis made a similar decision and he was drafted by the
Charlotte Hornets with the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rush nor Moiso are expected to be picked that high. But
their simultaneous departure leaves UCLA without two of the
Pacific-10's premier players.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, a 6-foot-10 forward/center, averaged 13.0 points and 7.6
rebounds per game for UCLA, which went 21-12. Moiso is athletic,
but NBA scouts question his toughness. He's projected as a possible
lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a 6-6 forward, was instrumental in UCLA winning eight
consecutive games late in the season, including an upset at
top-ranked Stanford, where he made the game's winning shot.

   Rush owes $6,525 for NCAA violations that led to his being
suspended for 24 games, plus legal fees. His mother, Glenda, told
the Daily News in April she thinks her son should stay in school,
but Rush, who averaged 12.1 points and 5.7 rebounds in nine games,
impressed many in the six post-suspension games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the NBA as been a goal of mine,'' said Moiso in a
statement released by UCLA, ``and I feel this is the time for me to
take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush said: ``This is the decision that is best for my family and
me.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Steve Lavin, who was in Phoenix for the Pac-10
coaches' meetings, also issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two young men have evaluated their individual situations
and have made decisions they feel are best for them,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   With Rush and Moiso, the Bruins would have returned all five
starters and likely been a top-10 preseason pick. Now, they have
two significant holes. Reserve Matt Barnes replaces Moiso, but
there's no one on the roster to replace Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Earl Watson, center Dan Gadzuric and wingman Jason
Kopono all return, but Kapono said recently he hasn't ruled out a
jump to the NBA.

DEVILS FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS FOR A 2-1 ADVANTAGE OVER LEAFS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Following Coach Larry Robinson's
instructions almost to perfection, the Devils gained the upper hand
Monday night in their Eastern Conference semifinal series with a
5-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the goaltending of Martin Brodeur, the Devils did
everything so well upon returning home after splitting the first
two games in Toronto that they had the crowd of 18,524 at
Continental Arena chanting ``Sixty-seven, sixty-seven,''in mock
reference to 1967, the last time the Leafs won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the first two games, the Devils played tight
defense for the most part and created traffic in front of
goaltender Curtis Joseph for their shooters. This time, though, the
shooters clicked.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive wealth was spread around as five different Devils'
players scored goals on a joyous evening, reminiscent of the 1995
playoffs, when the Devils captured the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs did not get their goal until after the Devils
had scored all theirs goals. Toronto's goal, by Kevyn Adams, came
with 4 minutes 17 seconds to play. Brodeur stopped the other 22
Toronto shots; the Devils had 36 shots on Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the Maple Leafs are down by 2-1 in a
series that resumes here Thursday night is the lack of production
by their premier line of Mats Sundin centering for Jonas Hoglund
and Steve Thomas. This threesome produced 20 points in the
elimination of Ottawa in six games in the first round; against New
Jersey it has a huge zero.
</P>
<P>
   While Toronto's premier line failed, the Devils' top line of
Jason Arnott centering for Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora came alive
with a a goal from each member. The other goals came from Scott
Gomez and Alexander Mogilny.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, who had 35 goals in the regular season, also had two
assists. But it was his short-handed goal on a back-handed shot
that was the talk of the night, and left the Leafs talking to
themselves as they fell behind by 3-0 shortly before the second
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first period that was wide open, the teams
tightened up on defense in the early stages of the second period.
The game's pace picked up again after Arnott opened the scoring
with his first goal of the playoffs, 9 minutes 42 seconds into the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the slot during the third man advantage in the game
for the Devils, Arnott scored by deflecting Bobby Holik's shot from
the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   All the speculation over whether the Devils should have benched
Gomez, the league's top-scoring rookie in the regular season, never
materialized. Gomez got the least amount of ice time among New
Jersey forwards in the first two periods, but he made an impact
near the end of the second period, when he scored his second
playoff goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's goal was the second in the game for the Devils and it
was all his work. He started the scoring sequence by winning a
face-off from Kevyn Adams, and gained control of the puck as Adams
fell down in the right circle. Gomez cut into the middle and beat
Joseph with a shot under the glove with 4:57 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils continued to show more jump and desire than Toronto
for the rest of the period and were rewarded with a stunning
short-handed goal by Elias with 2:27 left in the second period.
Elias intercepted a clearing pass and skated down the right wing,
eluding a Toronto defender before he faked Joseph to his knees,
then went around the net from right to left and beat Joseph with a
backhander. It was the second playoff goal for Elias.
</P>
<P>
   The goaltending of Joseph and Brodeur highlighted a loosely
played first period that featured 25 shots on goal, 14 by the
Devils. But none found the target. For the Maple Leafs, it was the
ninth time in their nine playoff games this spring that they failed
to score in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph's biggest saves in the session came 12 minutes into the
period, , when he thwarted Holik, Randy McKay and Steve Kelly even
though he lost his stick. Luck might have played a role, too, as
one of the shots hit him while he was sitting in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   With Claude Lemieux leading the way, the Devils created traffic
in front of Joseph, but he somehow managed to pick out the puck,
infuriating Lemieux, who took a penalty for interfering with
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur's best moments in the opening period came in the 10th
minute and 17th minutes. First, he denied Igor Korolev after Devils
defenseman Colin White mishandled the puck at the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   Korolev showed plenty of patience as he stood poised to shoot
from the left of Brodeur, but Brodeur was even more patient,
denying Korolev's shot and the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes later, the crowd, again short of a sellout, gave
Brodeur a standing ovation when he stopped Dmitri Khristich's shot
and then blocked a rebound shot by sprawling in the crease.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In mid-May, Azzedine Alaia, the Tunisian-born designer
whose rare public displays of genius place him somewhere between
Charles James and the Shadow, will present his largest collection
in years. Many of the 117 store buyers who have been summoned are
expected to come, even though Alaia, who doesn't adhere to seasons
or the calendar, is presenting his fall clothes months behind the
rest of the fashion world.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this, a retrospective of his work is being planned for
the fall in New York, and Alaia, who ranks as one of the last real
couturiers _ he does everything, from the pattern making and
cutting to the pinning and ironing, with his own hands _ said he
will present a small couture collection during the shows here in
July, which would be a first.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Alaia has something substantial to show comes at a
time when many people in the business assume he has nothing at all.
It's not unusual to hear fashion editors say: ``Azzedine? Is he
still making clothes?'' when a visit to 7 rue de Moussy in the
Marais, where Alaia has his studio and employs 25 people, would
tell them that he is.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard not to feel that Alaia has managed his own
oblivion. He has done this in part by refusing, since 1992, to hold
runway shows, in the belief that they are outmoded, and in part by
delivering his clothes to stores late, or not at all. The only
American store to have carried Alaia's clothes consistently since
he began doing ready-to-wear in the early 1980s is Barneys New
York, and its executives have long been reconciled to planning
their seasonal budgets around him _ a concession granted to no
other designer. ``There is no cancellation date for him,'' J.P.
Correa, a buyer for the store.
</P>
<P>
   But while Alaia's ultra-sexy dresses may fly out the door once
they do arrive, other retailers aren't so indulgent. Jacqueline
Schnabel, who opened an Alaia boutique in the New York City
neighborhood of SoHo in 1987 when she was married to the painter
Julian Schnabel, said she had been forced to close it after five
years because of delivery problems _ a decision that drew a
characteristic reaction from Alaia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refused to even walk on Mercer,'' said Schnabel, referring
the the SoHo street, adding with a light laugh: ``Now it's OK. He
came by a couple of years ago with Julian, and we made up.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although Alaia is diminutive in size and bears a resemblance to
Gertrude Stein, as the writer Ingrid Sischy once noted, with his
pixie bangs and round, many-dimpled face, he can be intimidating.
``He'll just sort of glare at you,'' said the photographer Michael
Roberts, ``and you'll think, `What have I done?' But he's very
funny when you get to know him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Simon Doonan of Barneys sensed a few years ago that Alaia's
prestige was slipping, he created some windows filled with glowing
fan tributes. Alaia's only response to Doonan's list of luminaries
was, ``Where is the queen mother?''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons at the moment to pay attention to
what Azzedine Alaia is doing. For one thing, the current revival of
'80s fashion will mean a rush of Alaia references. No designer
defined the decade with more giddy authority. Alaia's clothes _ the
studded leather gloves, the clingy skirts and stretch dresses
inspired by Egyptian mummies _ didn't just emphasize the feminine
body. They drew a circle around it and marked it with a dot. ``He
orchestrated the collision between sex and fashion,'' Doonan said.
``It looked French. It looked severe.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Alaia's atelier was like an all-hours salon,
with 3 a.m. fittings and a surfeit of supermodels. ``Everyone used
to go around and sit for hours,'' Roberts recalled. ``It became
family. Azzedine could talk on the phone, two phones, and still be
pinning clothes on models. It was fascinating. You just don't see
that kind of thing anymore. Maybe you didn't then.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan remembers going to shows when Alaia would still be
pressing clothes at the last moment. ``Yes, the shows were totally
chaotic,'' said the model Veronica Webb. ``But let me tell you
something: Even if your shirt was still hot from the iron, you knew
you were above reproach. You might as well have had a crown and a
scepter.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Alaia isn't interested in reviving the '80s. He has put into
his archives in the basement of his house virtually every garment
he has made. It is a gold mine of style. But pull from the crowded
racks, say, a leather blouson jacket and ask him if he might repeat
it, and he will shake his head and mutter, ``No, no.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that Alaia has managed to do something rare in
the fashion world. ``He knows how to retire from the whole thing,''
said the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik. ``He was right not do any
more runway shows. Why should he do those horrible exercises, which
is like supermarket nonsense?''
</P>
<P>
   Alaia has always made clothes for private clients, but without
fanfare. Indeed, anyone who takes the trouble to drop by rue de
Moussy, where Alaia lives on the top floor with Christoph von
Weyhe, a painter who is his business manager, and a pack of dogs
and cats, might be surprised by who turns up these days. One
evening last February, Mouna Ayoub, the couture patron, came by to
discuss a long buff suede skirt that Alaia was making for her. On
another night, Bettina Graziani, a well-known model from the 1950s,
was being fitted for a suit of speckled English tweed in the
ground-floor boutique.
</P>
<P>
   And in March, at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, Carine Roitfeld
arrived straight from styling Gucci's fall ads wearing a new Alaia
gown with a leopard-stenciled calf top laced almost savagely up her
bare back. As Roitfeld said, explaining her choice that
fashion-heavy night, ``I went to Azzedine because I knew I would be
the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable thing to be so devoted to one's craft as to
be considered, almost by default, the only one. But that is exactly
what Alaia has become. He has never had backers nor licensed his
name, and though he has come close, von Weyhe said, to signing
deals for a perfume or to design another company's line (he was
approached by Dior in the early '90s), he has refused, even though
it would have meant more money. ``Quite simply, I do things how I
like to do them,'' Alaia said. ``I prefer to stay poor than to give
my name over to someone who's going to do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Brant, an art collector who is married to the model
Stephanie Seymour, and who has been talking with the Guggenheim
Museum about doing an Alaia exhibition this fall at the Guggenheim
in SoHo, said he has tried to give Alaia financial advice, but to
no avail. Alaia certainly doesn't sell as much as he did in the
'80s, and there was a while in the mid-'90s when he didn't seem to
produce much at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it affected his chic or his cult much. Five years ago,
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington flew in
just to model Alaia's clothes for the half-dozen retailers who were
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will never let me be forgotten,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaia said the business makes enough money to support his staff.
His one indulgence seems to be buying vintage couture clothes _
Charles James, Adrian, Vionnet. One imagines that this is his way
of communing with kindred spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Lesage, the embroidery maker, who has known Alaia for
years, said: ``It is easier to look at Azzedine's place in the
fashion world than to explain it. He is a little bit like a temple
of fashion. His sensibility is so much in opposition to the way to
act, to live today, that he reminds me of Balenciaga. He loves to
talk and laugh, but when he is alone, he's alone.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As much as Alaia enjoys paradox, and is frequently as vague as a
child, his clothes have always expressed an exceptional clarity.
They are about cut, line, silhouette. And it makes you realize just
how much contemporary fashion is based on obscuring the lack of
invention or thought with gimmicks and cheap revivalism. Alaia, who
usually stays up until 5 a.m. sewing and watching old movies (and
gets up again at 9 a.m.), will often spend months perfecting a cut
or pattern. For his latest collection, he has been working on
leather kilts with tiny flowers embroidered on the pleats. The
process started more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Correa has watched Alaia's ideas evolve, too, and he said he may
even see, later in May, a few things for next spring. But it's all
right if he doesn't. ``I see hundreds of collections a year, but
the trips I make to Azzedine's are the highlight of my year,''
Correa said. ``In my entire career, I will never see it again.''

SPORTS COLUMN: LEAFS CARRY THE BEACON FOR CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Toronto Maple Leafs have their own
burden of failure, their personal cross to bear, without taking on
an entire country's as well. Thirty-three years without a Stanley
Cup or even a trip to the finals is well along the road to other
droughts of lore, but there can be no getting around the
inescapable and nationalistic truth.
</P>
<P>
   The drying out of Canada as a once-bottomless well of National
Hockey League champions illuminates the Leafs as the last team from
north of the border not to go south before the second round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to confuse Edmonton and Ottawa, the only other
qualifying Canadian teams this season, with those erstwhile outfits
from Winnipeg and Quebec that have actually emigrated deep into
Nielsen Land, or any others trying to resist the bottom-line urge.
But those teams are also part of the wagon-train reality of NHL
2000, the slow and sad expatriation of the Canadian game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there is a more nationalistic approach around us because
the economics have affected the ability of the Canadian teams to
compete,'' said Pat Quinn, the Maple Leafs coach, before the Devils
wasted his team, 5-1, Monday night in Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals that the Devils lead, 2-1. ``You just hope
your players don't feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the Leafs are feeling anything more than the
frustration of the Devils shutting them out for five straight
periods, or until it didn't matter last night. While there was no
trademark contrast of styles on a night the Devils opened up and
embarrassed Toronto at its own game, there remains the obvious
polarity of what and whom these franchises represent.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Quinn contended, the Leafs are as important to
English-speaking Canada as the Yankees are to baseball-worshipping
America, then this particular series symbolically boils down to
Canadian Yankees versus YankeeNets, the pride of a nation against
the identity-challenged, sellout-deprived boys from the 'burbs. It
is another battle in the failing holy war to prevent the sport from
being ripped from its roots, for the sake of better arena and
television deals.
</P>
<P>
   If the Leafs don't rally, this will be the seventh consecutive
year that the Stanley Cup has not spent the off-season on Canadian
soil, a record. The six years from 1936 to 1941 matches the current
streak, one obliterated by Canada's domination between 1956 and
1990, when it captured 26 of 35 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Summers up north have been getting colder and drier, with
nothing to drink from. After Montreal won in 1993, Quinn's
Vancouver Canucks became the last Canadian team of the decade to
reach the finals, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest does wane,'' Quinn said, describing the malaise that
overtakes Canada as it watches the playoffs sink deeper into
America's Sun Belt. It's as if the Expos were playing the Blue Jays
every October, and if no radical restructuring of the game's
finances is done, Quinn agreed the possibility exists that Toronto
and Montreal, the original Canadian two, could eventually be the
only two left.
</P>
<P>
   In Vancouver, the 1994 run to Game 7 in Madison Square Garden
already feels as dated (for different reasons) as it does in New
York. ``They've had staggering losses over the last two years,''
Quinn said. ``What can you do? The players get a disproportionate
share of the money. It's not their fault. We give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   With more Americans and Europeans in the NHL, there is less
sentiment for smaller Canadian markets. Even Garry Valk, the Leafs
left winger who grew up in Edmonton and deplores the negativism he
hears every summer at home in Vancouver, said he doubts many
Canadian players would resent more teams relocating to the States.
</P>
<P>
   The players have become conditioned by the owners and the league
marketing gurus who pose as front-office visionaries and measure
the soul of a sport by the dollar it turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't compare what Calgary can offer to what an Anaheim
can,'' Valk said. ``It's that way in baseball, and it's that way in
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Valk and Tie Domi said they and their
teammates pulled for Montreal and Vancouver as those teams made
unsuccessful late-season playoff runs. ``You want to see as many
Canadian teams as possible because they need the postseason
revenue,'' Valk said. ``It's good for hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what players root for bears little consequence to
what they'll sign for. American cities with little hockey
orientation have greater revenue potential, foretelling a day when
Canada's string of cup-less years could be as long as the Leafs'. &QL;

 &HT;    A tradition in turmoil
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators today (Tuesday) will disclose their theory on why
the Texas A&AMP;M University bonfire collapsed in November, killing 12
and injuring 27. But the university-appointed commission will not
recommend whether the 90-year-old custom should continue. That
decision falls to Texas A&AMP;M, a university synonymous with
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, it may seem strange that a dozen deaths would not
extinguish a bonfire _ no matter how big, celebrated and cherished.
To Frank Cox III, author of 'I Bleed Maroon,' a book on A&AMP;M's
traditions, the thought of eliminating the bonfire is what seems
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that,'' said Cox, who graduated in 1965. ``To
stop it would be a slap in the face of those who gave their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cox promotes an idea of his son's, also an Aggie: A
safe bonfire surrounded by 12 smaller bonfires commemorating the
twelve deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the investigation, and as A&AMP;M officials weigh
their options, Aggies will be left trying to explain what the
bonfire represents.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Aggies call it Bonfire. ``It's like saying, 'I'm
going to church.' You don't say I'm going to the church,'' Cox
explains. ``It's an event that doesn't need a 'the' in front of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is immense in physical terms, commitment and
influence over the Aggie faithful. What began as a trash fire in
1909 had become a full-scale logging and construction project,
culminating in bonfires of record-book size.
</P>
<P>
   It includes 6,000 to 8,000 logs and is supposed to stand 55 feet
tall. The record bonfire was 109 feet, 10 inches. The incomplete
bonfire that collapsed last year was 4 feet above the 55-foot
height limit.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire involves 5,000 students cutting, loading and
stacking logs; 700 gallons of diesel to ignite it and an estimated
125,000 work-hours spent building and torching it.
</P>
<P>
   Even beyond the shared experience of building such a structure,
the bonfire's communal reach is awesome. Students and faculty watch
the mountain of logs rise on campus each fall. Aggies around the
world watch its progress on the university's Web page. Tens of
thousands witness the burning in person. It's televised locally for
those who do not brave the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   To measure the bonfire's meaning is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed over two months and burned before the football game
with A&AMP;M's rival, the University of Texas, the bonfire is intended
to demonstrate the Aggies' ``burning desire to beat the hell out of
t.u.'' In the common Aggie refrain, t.u. is meant as a derogatory
reference to UT.
</P>
<P>
   At times it has been marred by drinking, hazing and horseplay.
But Aggies say critics _ including some fellow Aggies _ are wrong
to dismiss the bonfire as a waste of time and natural resources for
a drunken pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think we throw a lot of sticks together as an excuse to
get drunk,'' said Ryan Nelson, a senior who has worked on the
bonfire for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nelson said, ``It embodies the fraternal spirt of the
student body at A&AMP;M, the willingness to devote themselves to Aggie
tradition and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 12 died building last year's bonfire has made some
even more dedicated to that spirit and optimistic about the
bonfire's future.
</P>
<P>
   Jerretta Holmes, an 18-year-old freshman, said she wants to help
build the bonfire next year, should it continue.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths, she said, ``make me want to participate more.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, a biomedical student, planned to watch the commission's
public release of the report on television in her dorm room today.
</P>
<P>
   Her longtime friend Charmika May, also a freshman, didn't agree.
An industrial engineering student, she said she wants to know first
how the commission reached its conclusion and what steps will be
made to make the bonfire safe before deciding whether it should
continue and whether she would take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play by the rules,'' she said. ``It takes only one
person to die for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire is just one of A&AMP;M's litany of traditions. Aggies
around the world recognize all the Aggies who have died the
previous year during a ceremony called Muster; they have a campus
ceremony for Aggies who died the past month, Silver Taps; and
Aggies stand during football games as the Twelfth Man ready to
enter the game if needed. Those are just a few of the prominent
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said the common joke is, ``If it happens more than once
at Texas A&AMP;M, it's a tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   No campus event other than the bonfire, however, is big enough
to unite so many, said Forrest Lane, a member of the A&AMP;M's military
Corps and student body president. He said it not only brings
together the thousands who build it, but its influence permeates
the campus and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels they have a piece of this tradition and this
university,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire maintains its hold on many graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Buster, a construction sciences major who graduated in
1998, commutes the 90 miles from College Station to his full-time
job of pouring foundations in Houston. Each autumn he helps A&AMP;M
students building the stack: ``Bonfire is one of the main reasons I
stay in town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buster said he was at the stack of logs just an hour before it
collapsed about 2:30 a.m. Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Buster is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Breen, 25 and a 1997 graduate visiting the campus to
help with the bonfire, was one of the dozen who died.
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime graduates cherish the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan lawyer Bill Youngkin, who graduated in 1969, was the head
yell leader and in charge of building the bonfire. He said he
remembers a great sense of accomplishment _ not for himself, but
for his fellow Aggies _ as they built a bonfire towering toward 100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us seldom do something that people can visually see
and say, 'Oh, my gosh,''' Youngkin said. ``You can do that at Texas
A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   Youngkin has two daughters at A&AMP;M. He said both have worked on
the bonfire and he understands that it must be made safer _ a
feeling expressed by other Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's determined that we were just lucky in the past, and we
expose kids to death every time they do it, we can live without
it,'' he said. ``Nobody wants to risk life and injury for this _
that's a sacrifice for family and country,'' Youngkin said. ``But
I'd like to believe it can be made safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who also was a head yell leader in charge of the bonfire in
the mid-1960s, agrees the multilayered bonfire can be made safe:
``I don't care if it's five stacks, four stacks or three, as long
as they let the students have the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said he would support increasing adult supervision and
putting more of the building instructions in writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty amazing that there haven't been more
accidents with people that young passing on most of that
information by word-of-mouth and on-the-job training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cox warns that the students must have the responsibility for
running the bonfire or they will lose the benefit of ``learning to
be leaders instead of bosses.'' He said the bonfire spirit would be
lost if the university removed students from the leadership roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be Bonfire if an engineering company came in and
built the biggest, most beautiful bonfire ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the university goes too far and curtails the bonfire beyond
recognition, Cox said, ``Knowing the Aggies, knowing the Corps,
they would find a way to have it off campus.''

NBA'S GOOD STUFF GATHERS BAD RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was bad enough for NBC when its National
Basketball Association ratings tumbled 21 percent during the
regular season. But the playoffs were supposed to provide relief
from the lingering effects of post-Jordan traumatic stress
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   There was false hope a week ago Sunday, when a tripleheader's
overnight ratings rose 7 percent from a comparable threesome of
games last year.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the overnight ratings slipped by 26 percent.
Then they slid by 29 percent on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected a dip this weekend because last year, all three of
our Saturday games were concluding Game 4s,'' said Dick Ebersol,
the chairman of NBC Sports. ``One Sunday game was the Miami-Knicks
game with the Allan Houston shot to win it, the other was the
Sacramento-Utah overtime game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol, the ever-sunny ratings dancer, refuses to panic over
the Saturday-Sunday numbers. But the news was dismal. Five of NBC's
six weekend games recorded lower ratings from the same time slots a
year ago. The only game to avoid a comparison was the
Knicks-Toronto Raptors game, which rated a 5.2, because there was
no game last year in the 12:30 p.m. Eastern time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Miami Heat-Detroit Pistons game produced the
weekend's biggest decline, to a 3.3, down 32.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami-Detroit series is the one big disappointment,''
Ebersol said, because of injuries to the stars Grant Hill of
Detroit and Tim Hardaway of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-rated game of the weekend, Sunday's Sacramento
Kings' victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, produced a 7.2, down 23
percent from a 9.4 for a Sacramento-Utah Jazz contest.
</P>
<P>
   So far, NBC's 12 playoff games have rated an average 5.2, down
12 percent from a 5.9 for the 11 games played to date last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol optimistically predicted that he would be pleased with
an overall ratings decline of 6 percent to 7 percent through the
conference finals. As usual, he can make falling ratings sound as
good as a roaring Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ratings do not rise or fall because of its studio show
personnel. Still, viewers need a better analyst, one less
conflicted than Isiah Thomas of ``NBA Showtime.''
</P>
<P>
   When Thomas acquired the Continental Basketball Association last
August, he saw no reason to stop working for NBC, although he had
just joined the business he covers.
</P>
<P>
   He saw no conflict in dispensing opinions for ``NBA Showtime,''
while owning a league he wants to turn into a minor league for the
N.B.A. or a rival to one it may create.
</P>
<P>
   But smart viewers must ask, ``What is he not saying?'' He is no
more proper as an NBA commentator than Bill Gates would be as a
technology analyst for CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Thomas is even more immersed in NBA business by seeking
coaching jobs around the league. Still, NBC's ardor for league
royalty is unabated. &UR;  &LR; ``He's disclosed his interest in coaching
jobs, and I haven't seen him back off on criticism,'' Ebersol said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one on ``Showtime'' will ask Thomas to name the best
candidate to succeed Lenny Wilkens as the Atlanta coach now that
Thomas is a candidate. But an exchange on Sunday's ``Showtime''
underscored his conflict. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vecsey, the show's reporter-analyst, said Thomas was
talking to Atlanta, the Nets and Indiana about their coaching
vacancies. Hannah Storm, the show's host, prodded him, but Thomas
said only, ``I'm interested in coaching,'' and that he wanted to
keep talks confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' evasiveness is fine if he is not paid for his
commentary. But when the commentator turns into a newsmaker, it is
time to step aside. Pat Buchanan has twice left CNN's ``Crossfire''
to make quixotic runs for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if Thomas were terrific, one could argue that his views
are too good to miss. But his insights are cautious and
predictable, and his energy level verges on nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Vecsey makes the program hum with his provocative style and wit.
When Storm asks questions, Thomas' muted answers are invariably
trumped by the superior energy and information contained in
Vecsey's.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff ratings of TNT and TBS, however, are rising, up
about 5 percent through last Friday, to a 2.3 from a 2.2 last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the studio show offered on those two networks, by contrast,
is almost always free-flowing fun. Its expansive new set, which
includes a basketball court, offers the announcers room to move
around, a refreshing change from NBC's claustrophobic look.
</P>
<P>
   The host Ernie Johnson Jr., playing a ringmaster's role, gets
more free rein than Storm does. Kenny Smith's exuberant analysis _
sometimes too exuberant _ usually sparkles and is not dampened by a
business agenda. Charles Barkley is, as expected, a quotation
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The TNT/TBS show offers the cast generous time to interact.
Smith and Barkley have an amusing chemistry, as do Johnson and
Smith. Only Vecsey stirs chemical reactions _ and tempers _ on the
NBC set. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DERBY BLACKOUT? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable customers in seven markets may not see this
weekend's Kentucky Derby and Stanley Cup coverage on ABC if an
impasse between Time Warner and the Disney-owned network is not
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The logical strategy would be for ABC to simulcast Saturday's
Derby and Sunday's Stanley Cup games on ESPN, its Disney cousin.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mandel, an ABC Sports spokesman, said, ``We are not
planning anything but what we've already scheduled.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BRAVES ARE STILL IN A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not even John Schuerholz, baseball's master architect, is
exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The team he designed and has redesigned annually was riding a
13-game winning streak Monday, and where was Schuerholz? Not in Los
Angeles, where the Braves were going for No. 14 Monday night. Not
in Richmond, Va., or Myrtle Beach, S.C., scrutinizing the
organization's minor league talent for the next Rafael Furcal. Not
even at his desk in the Braves' offices at 755 Hank Aaron Drive.
</P>
<P>
   No, John Schuerholz was in an Atlanta courthouse on jury duty.
Well, better Schuerholz than Andres Galarraga or Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz, however, could be away from the office and away from
the team content with the knowledge that the Braves are yet again
the wonder of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Yankees are in first place in pursuit of their third
consecutive World Series championship and the St. Louis Cardinals
are bashing everyone in sight and the Chicago White Sox have
captured the attention of people looking for good young teams and
Chuck Finley has the Cleveland Indians thinking that yes, this
could be the year they beat the darn Yankees, and Pedro Martinez
and Randy Johnson are staging an every-fifth-day domination of
their teams' opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But over there at the side, quietly going about their business,
not letting anyone forget that they are the one constant Major
League Baseball has had for a decade, are the Braves. Eight
successive seasons as division champions, the Braves have the best
won-lost record in sight en route to No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   As much frustration as the Braves have suffered by winning only
one World Series in those eight years, they inflict even more
frustration on teams trying to keep up with or overtake them. In
the immediate instance, the team that most fits that description is
the Mets, a wild-card team seriously seeking entry to the
postseason party as a division winner. Yet, before Monday night's
games, the Mets had won 11 of their last 14 games and had lost two
and a half games in the National League East standing to the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half weeks ago, neither team was in first place, but
the Braves were a half game closer to it than the Mets. When they
began their games on the West Coast Monday night, the Braves were
in first place and the Mets were in second, three games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not frustrating yet,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general
manager, said by telephone after arriving in San Francisco Monday.
``It's less frustrating this early in the season than if it was
July or August and we put a run like that together. But it's to be
expected. We didn't expect the Braves to fold up and go away. They
won 104 games last year without Galarraga and without Lopez for
most of the season. You know they're going to win their share of
games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' share of victories is just greater than other teams'
shares. In 1993, for example, the Giants won 103 games, but the
Braves won 104. The difference developed on the last day of the
season. The teams began that day with 103 victories each and a
share of first place but ended it traveling in different
directions, the Braves to the playoffs, the Giants home. These
days, at least, a team in the Giants' position could be the
wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the Braves have a very good team,''
Phillips said. ``They're not missing a beat this year. They're
hitting on all cylinders now. I feel good that with the streak
they've put together, we're only three games behind. We're not
hitting on all cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive of the Braves' eight cylinders is Galarraga,
whose comeback has been as phenomenal as any has ever been. The
venerable Venezuelan missed all of last season undergoing treatment
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and now, seven weeks shy of his 39th
birthday, he is among the National League leaders in home runs
(10), runs batted in (24) and slugging percentage (.683).
</P>
<P>
   When Schuerholz was designing the 2000 Braves last winter, he
figured that if the first baseman could come back, it would be as
if the team had acquired an additional player. It was one fewer
trade he had to make or free agent he had to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Lopez is back, too, recovering successfully from knee
surgery for a torn ligament and rendering false the whispers around
the league that had suggested he would never catch again.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the initial uncertainty about Galarraga and Lopez, the
Braves faced fallout from the John Rocker suspension for boorish
verbal behavior and the problem of replacing John Smoltz, one of
their top pitching stalwarts, whose injured elbow knocked him out
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rocker issue proved to be no distraction. The closer, in
fact, returned after the first victory of the winning streak and
gained five saves in a nine-victory span. Smoltz's absence has yet
to be felt, too. Terry Mulholland, his replacement, was the winning
pitcher in the first game of the winning streak as well as the 5th
and the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux has been himself (4-0, 2.49 earned run average) and
Glavine has been spectacular (5-0, 1.80) as the Braves' pitching
staff has compiled a 3.08 ERA, putting it in a league of its own.
The next lowest ERA in the majors is Boston's 3.76; in the NL, it
is Arizona's 3.86.
</P>
<P>
   In completing the design for this season's team, Schuerholz and
Manager Bobby Cox decided to combine youth with experience at
shortstop. With the 36-year-old Walt Weiss in place, they added
Furcal, a 19-year-old Dominican, who had not played above the minor
leagues' Class A.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the move has worked. With Cox dividing their
playing time evenly, Weiss has a .447 on-base percentage, Furcal
.392. It's just another cylinder that Schuerholz did not have to
worry about as he sat in the jury room Monday. &QL;

HARDAWAY ADDS MYSTERY TO FAMILIAR PAIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ In a series between two familiar rivals
that offers little potential for surprise, one significant question
looms over the Knicks-Miami Heat matchup that begins Sunday: will
Tim Hardaway, who has a sprained left foot, be able to play
effectively, and if not, can the Heat still win?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not answering questions like that,'' said Hardaway, whose
status is questionable for the four-of-seven-game series. ``I'm
just trying to get myself ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami center Alonzo Mourning pondered the same question as he
leaned against the gym wall at the Heat's practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're capable of beating the Knicks, period,'' he said. ``We
beat the Knicks without me sitting on the bench. I know playoff
basketball is different, but, yeah, you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it will make the job a whole lot easier with him on the
floor. But that's neither here nor there. We can't really worry
about it. We have to think about what we have now. If Timmy comes
back, that's just extra ammunition for our guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said he would not discuss Hardaway's availability as
the team's No. 1 point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's San Antonio's problem,'' Mourning said.
``They've worried about Tim Duncan instead of going out and playing
the game and trying to win. We're not going to do that. Timmy is
going to come back when he's ready. He knows what he has to do. If
he doesn't come back, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's status provides one of the few areas of suspense.
This will be the fourth straight playoff meeting between these
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But familiarity does not diminish the passions that this matchup
stirs. ``It is only fitting that we go through New York to get to
where we want to go,'' Mourning said Monday after Miami's initial
practice at LaSalle High School.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat is aware that the Knicks have won two of three playoff
series between these teams. All have gone the maximum length, with
the Knicks winning the last two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to break it down and dissect it, I didn't
play two years ago in the final game,'' Mourning said. ``Then Timmy
was hurt last year and they got a bounce with a little over four
seconds left. I mean, that's what I look at in those two series.''
He was referring to Allan Houston's winning shot that eliminated
Miami last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat is looking for redemption now, though it is careful not
to be too inflammatory about saying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to call it redemption or if you want to call them
our nemesis or whatever, so be it,'' said Hardaway, Miami's veteran
point guard, who missed all three games of the Heat's first-round
elimination of Detroit. ``We've just got to come out here and
understand what we didn't do the last two years and do it. We've
got the home-court advantage and we've got to put it to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's late shot last season sent the Heat into the
off-season vowing to redouble its dedication to conditioning. And
that work is ready to pay off now, according to the power forward
P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just believe it's our time,'' Brown said. ``We're going to
come out and play hard. We've put in a lot of hard work since `the
situation,' and we're ready to leave it all out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley, the ex-Knicks coach who coaches the Heat, responded
sarcastically Monday when the Knicks' playoff edge over his team
was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have to beat them to get over a mental hump, or is it to
make my life better?'' he said. ``Or is it to make my peace of
mind, you know, so I can wake up in the morning the next day? Or
when I'm 65 years old I won't have any nightmares? No, I'm past
that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said it is possible the Knicks may have a psychological
edge in this series, but he doubts it. ``Not the way the losses
have gone down.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach called this matchup a ``fait accompli,'' but obviously
didn't want to dwell on Miami's past failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you have to look back in order to get a bead on the
future,'' he said, ``the important thing now is to look around at
the present moment.''
</P>
<P>
   While Riley talked, Hardaway worked on his endurance on an
exercise machine. Riley made it plain that he won't answer
questions this week on Hardaway's health and said Hardaway won't,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the snail-like pace of the National Basketball
Association's playoff schedule this season, Hardaway will have some
extra time to heal. Brown, the power forward, says there are not
many surprises left in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much you can say,'' Brown said. ``Pretty much
everything that could be said, good or bad, has been said over the
last three years. We know what they're about; they know what we're
about. But I will say this is a weird series in that home-court
advantage seems to mean absolutely nothing. They feel comfortable
coming down here and winning and we feel comfortable going up there
and winning in the Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, meanwhile, is slowly easing his players into Sunday's
opener. The coach held Monday's practice to an atypically short one
and a hours and didn't discuss game strategy. ``We did not even
mention New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The team will have a similar practice on Tuesday, then head for
Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Fla., for two-a-day
practices on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is concerned about beginning his game buildup too early,
if that is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've waited a long time to reach our goals,'' the veteran
guard Dan Majerle said, ``and the Knicks are in our way.'' &QL;

HARANGUING ABOVE THE RIM BEGINS BETWEEN KNICKS AND HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the surreal instant that Tim Hardaway's blind
fling at the basket dropped through the net on April 9 in Miami,
the Heat players spun, leaped and threw up their arms as if they
were children hearing the last school bell of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a buzzer, not a bell. And it was the regular season,
not a title. It merely seemed like something much bigger because of
the Heat's response to their dramatic overtime victory against
their nemesis, the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pieces of the puzzle are all falling into place,'' Alonzo
Mourning said that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``About time something went right for us against them,''
Hardaway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a coincidence that there were 4.7 seconds
on the clock; that's about the same amount of time when Allan
Houston bounced his in last year _ ironic,'' said Coach Pat Riley,
drawing a comparison to Miami's interrupted playoff run a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the background of the Heat's jubilation, some of the Knicks
smirked inwardly. One Knick said privately, ``You think they'd
really won something.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one game of 82. Only a Heat team finishing off a season
series with a 3-1 edge against the Knicks. But as the Knicks proved
with the completion of a three-game sweep of Toronto over the
weekend, the regular season does not set a precedent for the
playoffs. The Raptors had a 3-1 edge, too, in the regular season,
but it was the Knicks who advanced.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in the sun-baked city that has become their second
home, the Knicks will open their four-of-seven-game, second-round
playoff series against _ who else? _ the Heat, at American Airlines
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said that Toronto beat us up in the regular season,''
Patrick Ewing said after the Knicks eliminated the Raptors in Game
3 on Sunday. ``They'll be saying that same thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, few people bought into Coach Jeff Van Gundy's artful
attempt to cast his playoff-tested Knicks as the desperate
underdogs against a Raptor team led by a neophyte star like Vince
Carter. While the Heat is battle tested, the team seems a bit
spooked by its New York rivals, who have eliminated them on their
home floor two years in a row. Along with their frustration, there
has been palpable contempt for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate them with all the hate that you can hate with,''
Hardaway once said. ``Can you hate more than that? If you can, I
hate them more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound bites like these merely amuse the Knicks. While they
respect the Heat, they lick their lips and rub their hands together
at the thought of eliminating Miami once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to this challenge,'' Larry Johnson said.
``It's an up note for us, nothing but happy feelings around here.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular season does not even register in the Knicks' minds.
It does not matter if they shot only 42.1 percent against the Heat
in their four games, or if Mourning mauled them for 33 points on
April 9. It does not matter if Latrell Sprewell shot only 37.7
percent in the shadow of Jamal Mashburn this season, or if Chris
Childs hit only 22.7 percent of his shots against Hardaway. It does
not matter if the Knicks lost three games by a total of 16 points,
or won one of them at Madison Square Garden by an impressive score
of 94-80.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had them at their place when Tim hit that miracle shot,''
Marcus Camby said. ``We're confident we can beat them there, on
their floor. We didn't play well against them in the regular
season, but this is the playoffs. People said we couldn't get it
done in Toronto because they handled us in the regular season, but
it didn't end up that way at all. We went there and took care of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   With time to dissect the Raptors, Van Gundy came up with the
right double-team plan _ which was implemented by a focused
Sprewell _ and the Knicks took the ball out of Carter's hands. With
no sure-fire teammates around Carter to deliver, the scheme worked.
Now, Van Gundy has five days ahead of him to prepare his team. Has
he fallen in love with the once forbidden double team? Probably
not.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat is an entirely different team than the Raptors. As
Childs put it, ``We look at them and we're looking into the
mirror.'' If anything, Van Gundy will have to purge the Knicks of
any false confidence coming off their series with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's back to work,'' Sprewell said. ``We have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat players are steeling themselves as well. It may have
seemed like a turning point against their rival at the time, but
April 9 is forever ago. And the regular season is long gone, too.
Even the Heat realizes that now. Since Hardaway's wild shot sent
the team into an uncharacteristic frenzy, the players have come
down to earth. ``These are two evenly matched teams,'' Heat forward
P.J. Brown said Monday after practice in Miami. ``It's a
flip-of-the-coin type of thing. It comes down to who plays the
hardest, like the last game played against them. It came down to
who was more desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a playoff situation, but it definitely felt good
to get those guys. I see the highlights of the ending, and say,
`Wow, what a wild shot.' It helped us, but the regular season
doesn't matter. We all thought Toronto-New York was going to be a
better series, but look what happened.'' &QL;

A STUNNING DEBUT IN DERBY: TRAINER SADDLES FOUR HORSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ J.J. Pletcher remembers the young boy who got
so angry when one of his father's horses lost a race that he would
lie down in a stall and kick and cry. He remembers the young man so
eager to become a trainer that as soon as graduation ceremonies
were over at the University of Arizona, father and son drove
overnight toward New York and Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   There, J.J. turned Todd Pletcher over to another horseman's son
to put polish on the lessons begun on the dusty back sides of
grits-and-hard-toast tracks in places like Bossier City, La., and
Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   On Pletcher's first day, Jeff Lukas, dad D.Wayne's top
assistant, handed him the lead of an expensive horse, one named
Houston who had led the 1989 Kentucky Derby for a mile before
fading to an eighth-place finish behind Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let him get loose, Jeff Lukas told Pletcher. He held on to
Houston with both hands then, and now, at 32, Pletcher has
demonstrated he has retained every horse lesson ever imparted to
him, from his days mucking stalls with his father to graduating
from the Lukas finishing school in 1995 and starting his own
stable.
</P>
<P>
   In a year where perhaps eight trainers will make their Kentucky
Derby debut, Pletcher's bow is still extraordinary. He will saddle
four starters, which in the 125 years of the race is a number
matched by only James Rowe Sr. in 1923 and exceeded only once, by
Lukas in 1996. Better is that all of his entries have proved on the
oval that they belong.
</P>
<P>
   In Graeme Hall and Impeachment, he has the Arkansas Derby (Grade
II) winner and third-place finisher. His colt Trippi captured the
Flamingo (Grade III). And Pletcher's More Than Ready lost the
Bluegrass (Grade I) by a head, has won 6 of his 10 races and has
been in the money in all but one graded stakes race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April, I was hoping I might have More Than Ready in place
to go, but then we got the big races from the other three, too, and
it was clear they all earned their way into the race,'' Pletcher
said. ``Sure we're fortunate, but the people in our program have
worked hard to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   The influence of the Lukas program is evident in Pletcher's
crisp presentation. His barns, whether here or at the home base for
his 80 horses in New York, could pass for sidewalk cafes: manicured
landscapes, silk saddlecloths and monogrammed blankets. The morning
muckout of stalls resembles a swift, silent square dance; the
grooms march into the cubicles as the hot walkers circle the horses
outside.
</P>
<P>
   But Pletcher also displays a wry, salty streak inherited from
his father, a Texan with a catalog of tales from his days
crisscrossing quarter-horse and second-tier thoroughbred tracks
across the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The father hoped a college education might keep his son away
from the unpredictable milieu of the back side. ``I told him he was
going to college and he was going to know what he wanted to
study,'' said J.J. Pletcher, who won 370 races as a trainer,
including the 1982 Oaklawn Handicap with Uncool. ``I helped him get
summer jobs with Charlie Whittingham and Lukas. He also learned
from my mistakes. I could never juice an owner into paying so much
money for a horse. I wanted him to have the option to do something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, when his assistant trainer and primary exercise
rider, Cindy Hutter, returned from an impressive workout aboard
Trippi, who went six furlongs in 1:12.96, Pletcher sounded like his
father in feigning being upset. ``I told Cindy I wanted him to go
in 1:13,'' he said. ``Four one-hundredths off. I'll scold her
later.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also perhaps more flexible than Lukas, as his handling of
More Than Ready this year has demonstrated. As a 2-year-old, the
smallish black colt ticked off five brilliant victories in a row at
sprint distances, including the WHAS Stakes here on Derby day. But
after spiking a fever that interrupted his late-summer training,
More Than Ready finished third by a half-length in the Futurity at
Belmont and followed it with a desultory fifth place in the
Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The colt was shipped to Lexington and what is the equivalent of
the equine Mayo Clinic for extensive tests. Veterinarians found
nothing wrong. So while many wrote off the colt as a precocious and
perhaps broken-down sprinter, Pletcher and his owner, Jim
Scatuorchio, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pletcher prepared More Than Ready for the Derby with
three races of increasing distances. The colt was a dead-heat
winner in the seven-furlong Hutcheson, was passed in the final
yards in the one-and-one-sixteenth-mile Louisiana Derby (Grade II)
and, after showing he could rate behind horses, dueled through the
stretch before losing to High Yield in the one-and-one-eighth-mile
Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a detail guy, an incredibly hard worker,'' Scatuorchio
said. ``But what has really been impressive is his ability to come
up with a plan and his patience to stick to it. There were times I
think both of us thought about walking him over to the Fountain of
Youth or Florida Derby because he was doing so well. He wouldn't,
and that's why we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   It paid off. Four of the horses who beat or tied him _ Bevo,
Greenwood Lake, Mighty and Summer Note _ are injured and not here
for the Derby. More Than Ready, on the other hand, is a dead-fit
threat to wrestle the Derby away from the likely favorites,
Fusaichi Pegasus, War Chant, The Deputy and High Yield. The colt
worked a brisk five furlongs in 1:00 4/5 Monday, which was even
more impressive because Hutter all but dragged her feet on the
ground to keep the obviously More Than Ready in hand. ``We're in
business,'' was the assessment of Pletcher, a onetime animal
science major.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens the first Saturday in May, Pletcher has
grown out of the behavior that sent him to his father's horse
stalls after a loss. Asked how much it might hurt his former boss
if one of his four horses runs down Lukas' High Yield at the wire,
he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``About as much it hurt me when he got me in the Blue Grass,''
he said. ``And I'll take it.'' &QL;

KINGS EXPECT DIFFERENT SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ This is how mortal Shaquille O'Neal _ the NBA's
pre-eminent scoring machine, muscleman and all-around Superman _
looked Sunday afternoon: He asked out of the game during the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For a breather. For a cup of water. For a chance to re-gather
his game, which was inexplicably out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal _ whose every vehicle has a spiffy Superman ``S'' emblem
stamped on it _ appearing, gulp, human? What happened to the guy
with the cape?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was Clark (Kent) yesterday,'' O'Neal quipped Monday
afternoon, a day after the Lakers' 99-91 defeat to the Sacramento
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But even with O'Neal playing more like Clark Kent, mild-mannered
reporter (!ital!there's a funny concept), the Lakers had their
chances to win Game 3. And with a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five
series, and another shot at eliminating the Kings tonight, the
Lakers are confident their superhero will return to form to finish
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about Shaq,'' Ron Harper said. ``Shaq knows how
to play the game. And he knows that he missed some easy shots, and
he knows that he didn't play well. But we also, as guys on the
team, have to get him some good help, too, at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, O'Neal's 8-for-22 day wasn't his worst of this
MVP season. But it was ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
   Some early fouls probably inhibited him, some pesky Kings
defense disrupted him, forced him out of prime post position. But
in the end, O'Neal said it was ``Just one of those days, brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it the best defense Sacramento has played against O'Neal or
just him having a bad day? ``Just me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just have to come out and do our part,'' O'Neal said.
``I'm going to do my part. I'm sure the other guys will do their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lakers are hoping for more from Glen Rice (13
points Sunday) and from the bench corps (11 points), everyone
understands it comes down to O'Neal _ their statistical and
emotional leader _ to knock the air of renewed confidence out of
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neal who had to catch his breath in Game 3. In a rare
moment, he asked out of the game for a rest with 9:01 left in the
fourth, the Lakers clinging to a 74-73 lead. The Lakers trailed by
a point when he returned two minutes later and they never took a
lead again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung in there for a little bit, but then we lost it,''
coach Phil Jackson said. ``We lost it on a sequence of a few
turnovers and a couple of rebounding efforts by their team that got
the ball back for them, and (Peja) Stojakovic hit a 3-pointer that
put them over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their players were really animated by that energy that the
crowd picked up, and it looked like it depleted us. We were the
team that was reacting instead of acting.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal also made just 5 of 14 free throws and, as usual, felt he
was fouled a lot more often than was called. Jackson said the
Kings' strategy is to drive at O'Neal, hope fouls are called and
get him off the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's problematic for him to be fouled a lot, maybe not
complete the free throws, be fouled a lot and not have them
called,'' Jackson said. ``A couple things happened to him out there
where all (the Kings) did was take the ball at Shaq and try to make
the referees call the foul on him, even though there were a couple
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those things, I think, exacerbated his mental toughness,
and that's the area which I think is difficult to overcome for
Shaquille. . . . I think it wears the guy out (mentally).''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, whose 35 points kept the Lakers afloat, expects his
tag-team partner to return with a vengeance tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have a better game. A lot better,'' Bryant said.
``We all know Shaq, we all know what he did over this entire
season.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Kings. And they expect a different O'Neal, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to come out smoking,'' said Kings guard Jon
Barry, a former Laker. ``I know he's upset. . . . I don't think he
got the ball much in the fourth quarter. We did a good job. I think
that's a combination of us and them. They started to rush some
shots in the fourth and I don't think he touched the ball. I don't
think he was real happy about it.''

SOUTH CAROLINA FINALLY HONORS KING  
 BABBITT NOT RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR  
 RUBIN NOT INTERESTED IN VICE PRESIDENCY  
 NADER DISCUSSES ENDORSEMENT WITH UAW LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the signature of Gov. Jim Hodges, South Carolina Monday
became the last state to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. with
an official holiday. The bill was signed despite protests from the
NAACP, which had opposed the legislation because it also created
Confederate Memorial Day on May 10. The organization said two such
contrasting ideologies should not be linked. A spokesman for Hodges
said that Hodges would have preferred a bill honoring only King but
had to accept the Confederate holiday as the price for passage. The
NAACP has also objected to a state Senate bill, now before the
House, to move the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol dome to
a memorial in front of the building. Meanwhile, officials in North
Carolina said that despite the furor in South Carolina, a
Confederate flag would be over the Capitol in Raleigh on May 10, as
is required annually under a legislative decree.
</P>
<P>
   BABBIT TO RETURN HOME
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable speculation in Arizona that once
Bruce Babbit finished his tour as secretary of the interior, he
would return to the state to run for governor, a job he held from
1978 to 1986. But Babbitt said over the weekend that he had other
plans. He would return to Arizona, he told The Arizona Republic,
but not to run for governor. ``I'm out of politics, but I'm back to
Arizona,'' he said. ``I'm a little homesick. I want to re-engage as
a citizen.'' He did not say what he planned to do. But he made it
clear that he was tired of Washington's ``witch-hunting
mentality,'' referring to the 19- month investigation into his
handling of permits for Indian reservation casinos. He was cleared
of any wrongdoing. ``Maybe I was the poster child for the repeal of
the independent counsel statute,'' he said.

   Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, one of many prominent
Democrats mentioned as a potential running mate for Vice President
Al Gore, seemed to reject the idea Monday, calling it ``a curious
notion.'' Discussing economic policy and what he saw as key issues
in the campaign, Rubin said that while he has been around politics
for many years, including a stint as a Democratic fund-raiser, he
viewed running for and serving in office as a special field,
``something unto itself.'' Rubin suggested that it was unwise to
choose a nominee who has not been tested by other campaigns. ``You
don't want somebody in a presidential campaign, which is the
ultimate of political experience in this country, who hasn't been
tested by running before.'' Rubin spoke on Political Points, the
Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News.

late May, on establishing permanent normal trade relations with
China. Nader, the autoworkers and other major unions oppose the
bill. Union officials were unavailable for comment. The union,

MORRIS MADE HIS MOVE LONG BEFORE THE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After finishing 10th at the 1996 Olympic marathon trials, an
effort that brought him little recognition and not enough money to
file a tax return, David Morris made a radical change in both his
life and his career.
</P>
<P>
   American distance running was floundering. Morris questioned
whether athletes in the United States were dedicated enough,
willing to run punishing miles in training, to regain their
competitiveness in an event dominated by Africans, Japanese,
Europeans and Mexicans. So he moved to Japan in May of 1997, began
running with a corporate-sponsored team and trained up to 176 miles
a week, 25 to 50 miles more than conventional workouts.
</P>
<P>
   He was largely unknown, so it stunned the American running
community last October when Morris finished fourth at the Chicago
Marathon in 2 hours 9 minutes 32 seconds. That time is considered
the official American record because it was run on a certified loop
course; however, most people consider Bob Kempainen's 2:08:47, run
at the 1994 Boston Marathon, a point-to-point course, to be the
real national record.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Morris has emerged as a bright exception to a generally
bleak American distance landscape. He and Joe LeMay enter Sunday's
Olympic trials in Pittsburgh as the only American marathoners to
have achieved the ``A'' qualifying standard of 2:14 for the 2000
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of felt Americans were missing something as far as
training goes,'' Morris, who will be 30 on May 17, said yesterday
on a conference call, explaining why he moved to Japan. ``Everyone
says Americans are soft.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much uncertainty about Sunday's race, given the
potentially hot weather, Pittsburgh's hilly course and the
unsettled status of Khalid Khannouchi, the marathon world
record-holder from Morocco who is trying to gain American
citizenship. Harry Gee, Khannouchi's Houston-based attorney, said
in a recent interview that he was optimistic that Khannouchi would
have his citizenship by Thursday. However, marathon officials said
privately that Khannouchi may not run because of a sore hamstring
and ankle aggravated during a third-place finish at the London
Marathon on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's a citizen, he should be entitled to run,'' Morris said
of Khannouchi, who set the world record of 2:05:42 at Chicago last
fall. ``I would just run to make the team pretty much. I'm not
going to chase after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the tattered state of American distance running, Morris
said he thought it could become a trend, with international
athletes gaining American citizenship and supplanting American-born
runners in major events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture and lifestyle aren't conducive to distance
running,'' said Morris, who has a degree in computer science from
the University of Montana. ``People don't want to work hard at
running and make a long-term commitment. They want to take a tech
job and make money. People from less fortunate countries come here,
work hard and can make a lot of money and can make the national
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to Japan to train for an Olympic marathon is not without
precedent. A Japan-based Kenyan named Eric Wainaina finished third
at the Atlanta Olympics. Morris settled in Hamamatsu, about 200
miles southwest of Tokyo, where he was sponsored in a group of 18
runners by Honda. He was paid a salary that required him to make an
appearance for half a day at the Honda factory, where he mostly
studied Japanese and answered e-mail messages. Essentially, the
sinecure allowed him to focus on his training.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans often concentrate on speed training, the
Japanese are more geared to endurance training _ higher mileage and
longer tempo runs. An average week consisted of 100-120 miles, but
one week a month, the group trained three times a day for a total
of 140 to 160 to 176 miles, with tempo runs of 12.5 miles to 30
miles, Morris said. It took six months before he could make it
through the workouts at the required speed, and a year before the
training began to result in improved racing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally I'm a lot tougher in having three years of 100 miles
a week in my legs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Morris returned to the United States, where he
lives frugally with a friend in Missoula, Mont., and has shuttled
to altitude in New Mexico every few weeks, not having a house of
his own. He grew up in Eagle River, Alaska, a suburb of Anchorage,
where he avoided video games and walked a mile to school. He
coaches himself, and on Sunday, he will learn whether his unusual
methods have made him an Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen myself as having a desk job,'' Morris said.
``I've always been good at running. When I was 10th in the '96
trials, I knew if I got in real good training, it would be my turn
to make the team in 2000.''

phone calls'' and city officials had ``abandoned'' the organizers.
The order holds hundreds of parades in Northern Ireland in the
annual ``marching season,'' which began last week.

   RUSSIA: POLICE BODIES FOUND
</P>
<P>
   The military said it had found the bodies of nine Russian
policemen near the Chechen town of Vedeno. The policemen came from
the Perm region of Russia and were part of a column ambushed on
March 29. The discovery raises the death toll from that ambush to
at least 36. Chechen rebels claim to have taken the nine policemen
prisoner and executed them after Moscow refused to turn over a
Russian officer accused of killing a Chechen woman.

   SWITZERLAND: HEALTH SPENDING

<P>
   Of more than $56 billion spent each year on health research,
less than 10 percent goes to conditions, including tuberculosis and
malaria, that account for 90 percent of the world's health
problems, a Geneva-based health group said. Health research is
disproportionately focused on diseases of concern to high-income
countries, the report said. The study said pneumonia and diarrheal
diseases are the biggest killers, but only one-fifth of 1 percent
of research dollars is spent on them.

   The government has formally rejected a request by Judge Baltasar

ADMINISTRATION FORECASTS LARGER PAY REDUCTION OF NATIONAL DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Monday that the
federal government expected to pay off substantially more of the
national debt this year than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton said the federal government
intended to pay off $216 billion in debt during the fiscal year
that ends Sept. 30, or 6.2 percent of the $3.5 trillion in national
debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the administration projected that it would pay off
$167 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a news conference
at the White House Monday that the larger reduction was the result
of the strong economy generating higher than expected tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said there had been a surge in payments for 1999 tax
liabilities made around the April 15 filing deadline and in
corporate and individual tax payments so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fiscal year, he said, the government will have
paid off $350 billion in debt since fiscal year 1998, reflecting
the shift from decades of federal budget deficits to large and
growing surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said debt reduction in April, May and June, the three
months in which the government typically takes in the most money,
should total $185 billion, up from $114 billion in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we can take satisfaction in is that as a country
we are not just making continued progress in reducing our national
debt, but we are making progress at an accelerated pace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department is reducing the debt by rebuying bonds
and other securities it has issued and by not renewing others on
maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim
to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic
expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to
calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not jeopardize the longest economic expansion in
history with risky tax cuts that threaten our fiscal discipline,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that they, not the administration, deserved
credit for putting the government back in the black and that only
by returning the surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts could
they stop Democrats from spending the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that by keeping increases in government
spending in check, there would be plenty of money for sizable tax
cuts and for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration had not yet calculated a new
surplus estimate for the fiscal year. In February, the
administration estimated that the total surplus this year would be
$179 billion, including $148 billion from excess Social Security
payroll tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's figures suggested that the surplus would be tens of
billions of dollars higher than projected _ an improvement that
would probably ripple into the surplus projection for next year,
giving Congress a bigger pool of money as it turns this week to
writing the spending bills that would finance the government's
operations in 2001.

POUL HARTLING, 85, EX-HEAD OF U.N. AGENCY FOR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poul Hartling, a former prime minister of Denmark who headed the
office of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees when the agency
won the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize, died Sunday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling was a shrewd, paternal and politically gifted
administrator, not blessed with an immense budget, who spent $500
million in 1980 on the refugee office's work. He was successful
enough in staying on equable terms with Thailand and the Communist
government installed in Pnom Penh, Cambodia, by Vietnam so that
310,000 Cambodians could return home that year.
</P>
<P>
   He was also astute at rallying other agencies to share the
burden. In 1981, no fewer than 200 private agencies helped.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned that his organization had been awarded the Nobel
for aiding the growing numbers of homeless and displaced people
around the world, he issued a statement, from his headquarters in
Geneva that accepted the award ``in the name of refugees
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His statement said that winning the prize was a message to the
world that ``refugees must not be forgotten'' and that for himself
and his staff the award signified that the ``voices of millions of
refugees in the world have been heard and acknowledged.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the $180,000 in prize money would be added to other
money to help refugees and displaced people, half of them in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, officials estimated that there were 14 million to
18 million refugees in the world. Ten million were relatively new
for his agency, having been displaced by turmoil in their
homelands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Hartling's organization had a staff of 1,000 people,
roughly two-thirds of which worked in the far-flung dreary sites
where refugees huddled. He oversaw the mission to have as many
refugees as possible returned to their homelands or resettled in
new lands.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling was an idealistic man who was a Lutheran pastor in
Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1945 to 1955. He led the
middle-of-the-road Liberal Party in Denmark for years, was prime
minister from 1973 to 1975 and later recalled those days as
horrible.
</P>
<P>
   He succeeded Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan as high commissioner for
refugees in 1978 and held the post until 1985. In those years, he
was chiefly concerned with refugees from Vietnam, Ethiopia and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan gave him the Nishan Award for helping the flow of
humanitarian aid for Afghan refugees there. Shortly before he
retired as commissioner, he was chosen to receive the Carnegie
Award for Humanitarian Service.
</P>
<P>
   His agency, which first won the Peace Prize in 1954, was praised
by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, the selection panel, as having
accomplished major work, despite substantial political problems, in
dealing with ``a veritable flood of human catastrophe and
suffering, both physical and psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hartling was commissioner, the United States, a major
contributor to the agency's budget, criticized its financial
management. Commenting in an interview in 1985, he said: ``If you
spend $500 million in 100 countries, there will be some
shortcomings. It is unavoidable. We do whatever we can to correct
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Copenhagen and received a degree in theology in
1939 from the University of Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, he married Elsebeth Kirkemann. They had four children.

JACKSON SAYS LOSS TO KINGS NOT BAD THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A 67-win season has produced some unreasonable
expectations for the Los Angeles Lakers, the first of which seemed
to be they could go unscathed in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That much is no longer possible, thanks to the Sacramento Kings'
99-91 victory over the Lakers in Game 3 of their first-round
series. But coach Phil Jackson, who sees lessons in every failure,
said the loss was not all bad, coming early in the Lakers'
championship drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing that we lost the game,'' Jackson
said Monday, ``because we didn't play well enough to win it. And if
we're going to be a team that goes on in the playoffs, we have to
play better than that. It was not a good game or showing by our
team at all, and so we have to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he clarified, ``I wasn't happy last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant sounded a similar note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought we were unbeatable. We weren't
going to go undefeated,'' he said. ``But I think it was a good test
to play in a hostile environment, here in Sacramento against a good
ballclub, early in the playoffs. I think it was good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also bristled at the idea that the Lakers had lost some
sense of being invincible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The invincibility is not on our part, it's on your (the
media's) part. You guys are the ones that have crowned us as
champions before we even got off and running in the playoffs,'' he
said. ``We have to be tested and the mettle and the wherewithal
that comes within this team to ride out tough things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have a 2-1 advantage in the series, so Jackson
disagreed with any notion that the pressure is on them tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not eliminated if we lose the next game, right?''
Jackson said. ``They're still going home (if they lose). So that's
a big difference. They still have elimination in the back of their
head.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Oh, baby: Rick Fox and wife Vanessa Williams at last welcomed
the arrival of their first child Monday, when Sasha Gabriella Fox
was born in New York. She weighed 7 pounds, 3 ounces, and both
mother and daughter were said to be doing well.
</P>
<P>
   The team said Fox hopes to be back in time for tonight's game,
and Jackson hopes he'll return with a clearer head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually all bought him a ticket to go there because he's
so distracted by the whole situation that he hasn't had his head in
the ballgame,'' Jackson said wryly. ``So we encouraged him to go,
and if he can't get back, stay, we'll be OK without him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Overlooked: The Kings seemed a bit perturbed Monday by the
notion that the Lakers gave them the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``From their opinion, they say they gave us the game,'' Jon
Barry said. ``If that's what they want to feel, that's fine. The
way I saw it was we beat them in the fourth quarter and we took the
game from them. They didn't give us anything. We played superior
offense and defense in the fourth quarter and we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the thought the Lakers will come out angry tonight,
that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think they know we're going to come out angry, too,''
Vlade Divac said. ``We're down one game. We're facing elimination,
so we have to come out very angry and try to force a fifth game.''

CABLE MODEM ADS IRRITATING EXCITEATHOME  &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Pacific Bell claims that some people find its new ``Web Hog''
television ads so funny that they're asking for copies on
videotape.
<P>
   But no one is laughing at ExciteAtHome, the country's largest
provider of cable modems, which claims the ads are misleading. The
Redwood City-based company sent a letter to Pac Bell last week
threatening to sue unless it pulls the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, designed to promote Pac Bell's speedy Internet service
over phone lines, focus on an idyllic neighborhood where residents
start signing up for superfast Internet service over cable TV
lines, like the type offered by ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the service works great, the ads report. But as more
people sign up _ all using shared TV lines _ the cable modem
service slows to a crawl, and the once friendly neighbors turn on
one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web hog!'' a group of kids yell at a middle-aged neighbor
working on his lawn. ``No. You're the Web hog!'' he shouts back.
One neighbor pours water into a neighbor's car. Others paint
garages and trucks with words like ``Log off'' and ``Web hog.'' The
ads end with the tag line: ``Get Pacific Bell DSL. Always fast.
Never shared.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell points out that its service uses telephone lines, which
run separately from each home to a nearby switching office. But
ExciteAtHome uses cable television lines, which are all connected,
much like a party line.
</P>
<P>
   But cable proponents say they can easily split a cable network _
called a node _ into smaller pieces as more users sign up.
</P>
<P>
   And even with DSL, once telephone lines reach the central
switching office, e-mail and other Internet traffic are all merged
together, just like cable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pacific Bell's own service agreement warns: ``Pacific
Bell ... operates on shared resources. Excessive use or abuse of
these shared network resources by one customer may have a negative
impact on all other customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Allison Bowman said, ``We believe that
the ads are misleading to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, ExciteAtHome quietly fired off a letter to Pacific
Bell President Bill Blase, demanding the telephone company yank the
ad, according to people familiar with the matter. In the letter,
signed by ExciteAtHome executive Byron Smith, ExciteAtHome said it
``may consider legal action'' if Pac Bell didn't pull or change the
ads. (Pac Bell hadn't received the letter as of yesterday, the
company said.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ExciteAtHome executives are exploring lodging a
complaint with a group like the National Advertising Division, the
arm of the Better Business Bureau that helps sift through false
advertising complaints, one person said. Spokeswoman Melissa Walia
said she couldn't comment on either action.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Pac Bell says ExciteAtHome is just thin-skinned
because the ads zero in on a key problem with cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're upset because it's effective,'' said Pac Bell
spokesman John Britton.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the bottom line is that both services are similar.
PC World magazine couldn't find any major differences in speed in
its tests, according to this month's issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it is more or less the same,'' said Yankee Group
analyst Fritz McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome admits there have occasionally been slowdowns in
some neighborhoods, such as in Fremont, but says such problems are
rare.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Calic, president of Fremont's cable modem group, said he
thinks the ads are largely ``accurate, but not the whole story.''
He added, though, that he thought the ads are ``very, very funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell has also had its own service problems. At least twice
in recent months, the company has acknowledged that e-mail has been
backed up for hours or days because its mail computers were
swamped.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear, though, how a judge would rule if the dispute
actually wound up in court.
</P>
<P>
   First, ExciteAtHome would have to prove that the ads are false.
But that depends on how you interpret the ad. Pac Bell claims the
ads just focus on the neighborhood level where DSL runs over
separate phone lines, but cable doesn't. ExciteAtHome claims the ad
misleads people into thinking DSL offers a direct connection to Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases where it is not a straightforward
inquiry,'' said Andrew Schau, a New York lawyer who has handled
false advertising cases. He said the case would turn on how viewers
interpret the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pac Bell says the ads have been running in San
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego since March. SBC
Communications, Pac Bell's parent company, also started running the
ads in Texas and Missouri last month. ``It's not a case where we
will just run it a couple times,'' said Beth Kachellek, SBC's
executive director for advertising.

Toronto Maple Leafs' coach and general manager, has attempted to
shift the focus off his team and on to what he considers
questionable tactics by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy might have helped before Game 1, which Toronto won
by 2-1. But it definitely did not work Monday night. The subject of
Quinn's comments this time, Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, was
obviously unruffled. For the third consecutive game, Stevens helped
hold Mats Sundin's top line without a point, and the Devils came
within 4 minutes 17 seconds of shutting out the Maple Leafs for the
second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils settled for a commanding 5-1 victory to take a 2-1
lead in the four-of-seven-game National Hockey League Eastern
Conference semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maple Leafs' morning skate Monday, Quinn accused Stevens
of trying not once, but twice, to injure Toronto players during the
series by hitting them knee on knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that kid on the other side was thinking _
there's two knees he's tried to take out,'' Quinn said, referring
to Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen that before out of him. There's something
wrong there.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whom he felt Stevens was out to get, Quinn _ who had
called the Devils a punch-and-run team before the series opener in
Toronto last Thursday _ responded that Darcy Tucker was the first
one. Quinn did not say who the second Leafs player was.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stevens did not have anything to say to reporters
before tonight's game. He did have something to say to the Maple
Leafs, however.
</P>
<P>
   As the final seconds of a scoreless first period were ticking
down, Stevens gave Sundin, the Toronto captain, a few whacks with
his stick behind the play. Once the horn sounded signaling the end
of the period, Stevens had words at the red line with Sundin, along
with Steve Thomas _ Stevens' former teammate with the Devils _ and
the Toronto tough guy Tie Domi.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 18-year NHL career, Stevens, 36, has become
expert at containing the opposing team's top line. But perhaps
never more so than this season. At least, that is what Ken Daneyko,
who just turned 36 himself, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as I've seen him,'' said Daneyko, who has been
Stevens' teammate since Stevens joined the Devils for the 1991-92
season. ``Especially at the end of the year and now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens played in his 11th All-Star Game this season and led the
Devils with a plus-minus rating of plus-30. But he has saved his
best for last.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far this postseason, the 6-foot-1-inch, 215-pound
defenseman has done a brilliant job. He and Brian Rafalski helped
hold Pavel Bure to a solitary goal in the Devils' four-game sweep
of the Florida Panthers in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   All Bure did in the regular season was score the most goals in
the league, 58, which was 14 more than the runner-up, San Jose's
Owen Nolan. But Stevens was all over Bure during the first-round
series, pounding him at every opportunity to almost single-handedly
neutralize him.
</P>
<P>
   This series, Stevens' assignment is to shadow Toronto's top
line, which is centered by Sundin, with Thomas at right wing and
Jonas Hoglund at left wing. Tonight, Stevens and Rafalski, along
with the forward line of Steve Kelly, Bobby Holik and Randy McKay,
were on the ice every time Sundin's line played at even strength,
until the Devils scored their fifth goal.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Sundin called Stevens a borderline dirty player,
albeit with a smile on his face. Tucker, who scored the winning
goal in Game 1, did not go that far. But Tucker did say that he
thought Stevens was intentionally trying to knee him Saturday night
midway through the second period of Game 2, which New Jersey won,
1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, on the other hand, did his talking with his stick. He
whacked at Sundin and Hoglund in front of net during the second
period tonight. And after the Devils scored 5 goals on 8 shots in a
16:19 span that began at 9:42 of the second period, New Jersey had
romped in its first game on home ice this series.
</P>
<P>
   And Sundin's line _ thanks in large part to Stevens _ was still
looking for its first point. &QL;

MARGINED TO DEATH _ INVESTORS LEARN PAINFUL LESSON ABOUT BUYING 
 STOCKS WITH BORROWED FUNDS 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; For long-term investors who buy stocks with cash, the violent
price plunges that shook the market early last month have been
reduced to a vaguely painful memory _ like yesterday's tooth
extraction.
<P>
   But for a beleaguered minority _ those who bought stocks with
money borrowed on margin _ April 2000 will forever be regarded as
something akin to the Great Depression and World War II combined.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, hours, even minutes, many thousands of
margin speculators had their nest eggs either wiped out or damaged
beyond hope of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage culminated on April 14, when the Dow Jones
industrial average plunged a record 617 points and the Nasdaq
composite index plummeted 355 points _ also a record.
</P>
<P>
   As prices fell, brokers, fearing that their loans were in
jeopardy, bombarded borrowers with margin calls _ demands to pour
more collateral into their accounts to back up their debts. Some
brokers, in what can fairly be described as a lender's panic,
didn't bother to formally request the money _ they just took it, by
selling out customer positions.
</P>
<P>
   While brokers were legally entitled to do this, their
pre-emptive actions caused a tremendous amount of ill will among
their margin customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several margin investors interviewed by The Chronicle said they
would have put additional funds into their accounts if they had
been given the opportunity. And, they ruefully point out, that
would have been a good idea because the market bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Market-watchers say the margin selling had an indirect effect on
nonmargin customers, accentuating the decline of many stocks _
particularly a host of fast-moving, high-technology stocks favored
by margin speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Although things went terribly wrong in April, it is easy to
understand why many investors got hooked on margin speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the margin rules laid down by the Federal Reserve,
investors can borrow up to 50 percent of the purchase price of a
stock from their brokers. That has the effect of doubling any
investment gains.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you buy 100 shares of Company XYZ at $50 per
share, you only have to come up with $2,500 of the $5,000 purchase
price, while your broker will lend you the remaining $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   If XYZ's price then rises 10 percent to $55, the $500 increase
in the value of the 100 shares represents a 20 percent gain on your
$2,500 outlay _ minus the interest and commissions charged by your
broker.
</P>
<P>
   Margin speculation has proved especially appealing to buyers of
high-tech stocks. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite _ as investors
may nostalgically recall _ rose 86 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that margin debt shot up dramatically last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of Securities Dealers, it
totaled $284 billion at the end of February _ more than double the
total as recently as October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the amount of margin debt appears to have
declined somewhat, says Charles Biderman, chief executive of Market
Trim Tabs, a Santa Rosa firm that monitors fund flows. He bases
that conclusion on discussions with executives of ``a number of
brokerage firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's April horrors ``squeezed out some of the marginal
margin buyers,'' Biderman quips.
</P>
<P>
   Those people discovered too late that the magic of margin not
only can double your gains, but also your losses.
</P>
<P>
   If, to continue our example, the value of XYZ stock drops 50
percent to $25 per share, your equity will be wiped out. The 100
shares in your account, reduced in value to $2,500, will belong
entirely to your broker, which loaned you exactly that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, brokers don't sit and wait while stocks
are declining that steeply.
</P>
<P>
   If the value of your equity declines below a certain level _
known as the ``maintenance margin'' _ either you will receive a
margin call or the broker will simply sell part or all of your
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum maintenance margin established by the Federal
Reserve is 25 percent, but most brokers require more than that.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab, for example, where margin loans have soared
to more than $20 billion from less than $10 billion at the end of
1998, the maintenance margin for most stocks is 35 percent; and for
some particularly volatile stocks, Schwab has scaled it up to 80
percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   When maintenance is at 35 percent, you will be asked to add
assets to your account if the equity in the account, minus the
margin debt, falls to less than 35 percent of the equity.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the value of what used to be $5,000 worth of XYZ stock
drops to $3,846, the broker will want you to pump more assets into
the account.
</P>
<P>
   Huma Qureshi, 36, a Sunnyvale network consultant, still laments
a $25,000 loss she suffered in her online margin account with
Dreyfus Brokerage Services.
</P>
<P>
   She had created a complicated position involving the options of
Broadvision Inc., amounting to a bet that the company's stock price
would soar. But on April 14, Broadvision fell more than 25 percent
and Dreyfus sold the position out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no effort made by the brokerage firm to get in touch
with me,'' Qureshi complains, although she acknowledges that it
wasn't required to do so. She says she would have forked over the
money needed to bolster the position if she had been given the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   She also says Dreyfus didn't make it clear enough on its Web
site that her margin position was deteriorating to the point where
she might have to deposit more funds.
</P>
<P>
   Replies Dreyfus spokeswoman Beth Basilio: ``Although this is a
situation that we do not take lightly, margin calls are standard
practice throughout the industry.'' She says the Dreyfus Web site
includes enough ``investor educational materials'' to make it plain
where its margin customers stand.
</P>
<P>
   A California state employee named Mike, who asked that his last
name be withheld, says his margin account was liquidated by his
broker ``with no notice whatsoever'' during the April 14 debacle.
In addition, the broker has billed him for $1,200 that wasn't
covered by the account's assets.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Mike's portfolio of two high-tech stocks _ F5
Networks and AtHome _ was worth about $17,000, half of it borrowed.
But both stocks fell so hard that his equity vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had notified me, I would have put in more money to
hold onto my stocks,'' Mike says. ``I knew that things would
eventually get back to normal and was willing to ride that wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 39, he is thinking of withdrawing from the stock
market permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really shocking, and pretty ugly,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking, ugly _ not to mention rude _ but it's entirely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the standard contract between brokers and their margin
customers, a broker can act peremptorily if the firm thinks its
assets are in danger.
</P>
<P>
   When stock prices are merely declining, not plummeting, most
brokers take the trouble to issue margin calls as a courtesy _ even
though it is not required. And they usually are willing to give you
three business days to beef up your account.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but if the value of your stocks shoots back up
during those three days, many brokers will withdraw their demands
for more money.
</P>
<P>
   But when the market is plunging at a record pace, etiquette goes
out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, a spokesman for E-Trade Group, a leading
online broker based in Palo Alto, says his firm tries to issue each
margin call in multiple ways _ by telephone, Mailgram, e-mail and
by posting a warning on its Web site that customers will see
immediately when they log on to their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have to tell you,'' Di Chiro adds, ``that a day like
April 14 was not a normal day.'' In many, if not most, cases, he
says, the only notification that day was the Web site warning.
</P>
<P>
   So, you were just out of luck if you happened to be a margin
customer with an imperiled account who was busy with something else
that day _ like working for a living _ and didn't bother to check
the E-Trade Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is their responsibility to make sure, if they are
transacting on margin, that they know where they stand,'' Di Chiro
says.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dunn, a spokesman for Datek Online, a leading online
brokerage and one of the industry's technology pioneers, says the
firm's computers automatically send e-mail requests for more money
to margin customers when the value of their equity falls below
maintenance levels.
</P>
<P>
   He says the system ensures that no customer in margin trouble
will go unnotified, no matter how busy the Datek staff may be.
</P>
<P>
   But New York travel agent Bob Anderson (not his real name;
margin losers tend to be shy) says he didn't receive an e-mail
before Datek liquidated his account. An e-mail finally arrived days
later, he says, too late for him to add money to the account.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn says that if Anderson's statement is accurate, he cannot
explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of bloody April, there were murmurs to the
effect that the margin rules should be tightened.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, which has the power to raise the 50 percent requirement
that's been in effect for the past quarter-century, hasn't
indicated any intentions to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Elisse Walter, NASD's chief operating officer in charge of
regulation, says her organization has ``a concern about whether
current margin levels are adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   NASD itself could impose stricter margin rules on its members,
who make up more than 99 percent of the securities industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't taken action to date,'' Walter says. ``We might or
might not in the future. We will monitor the situation very
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she says, ``there clearly needs to be much more
investor education done about this.'' Too many investors didn't
fully appreciate ``what it means to have a margin account.''

MICROSOFT TAKES ITS CASE TO THE PUBLIC 
 &HT;     BY KELLY ZITO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Microsoft lawyers work behind the scenes to prevent a breakup
of the software titan, the company's publicity machine is kicking
into high gear in the battle for John Q. Public.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a fuzzy TV spot featuring Microsoft chief executive
Steve Ballmer ran during ``60 Minutes.'' And yesterday, Microsoft
placed full-page ads in a spate of newspapers claiming that the
government's proposal to carve the company into two pieces would be
``a major setback for consumers, the high-technology industry and
the American economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dismantling of Microsoft would also send a signal that
companies in America that are `too' successful will be punished
harshly _ a signal that will be welcomed by foreign competitors
seeking to overtake America's global leadership in technology,''
said the ad's letter, co-signed by Ballmer and Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Department of Justice antitrust chief Joel
Klein used the pulpit of Sunday's ``Face the Nation'' program on
CBS to reiterate that the federal government and the 17 states who
endorsed the breakup proposal are confident the case will move
forward no matter what political party sits in the White House
after this fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential candidate,
has seemed more sympathetic toward Microsoft's position. And if the
software giant appeals the federal's judge's ruling in the case, as
it has promised, Bush could assume a major role in how the case
plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be irresponsible and futile for a new administration
to weaken'' the case, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said.
``That's totally intolerable to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Department of Justice and attorneys general from
the 17 states recommended splitting Microsoft into two separate
companies: one for Windows operating system software; the other for
Microsoft's applications, including the popular Office product and
the Internet businesses. Both the breakup and restrictions on the
company's business practices are designed to sever Microsoft's
chokehold on th PC market and spur competition in the software
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a court filing supporting the proposal, the government said
the company is using its operating systems monopoly to enter the
highly competitive Personal Digital Appliances market.
</P>
<P>
   ``(O)n July 11, 1999, less than thirty days after the conclusion
of trial in this action, Bill Gates wrote an e-mail directing that
Microsoft redesign its software in order to harm competitors. This
time, the products in question were the Personal Digital Appliances
that Microsoft heralded at trial as one of the products that might
someday undo its monopoly,'' the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail from Gates was not included in the filing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has until May 10 to respond to the remedy proposal. On
May 24, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is scheduled to
hold a hearing to consider the issue, but Microsoft said it needs
more time to prepare its arguments against a proposal suggesting
such an ``extreme'' remedy as a divestiture.
</P>
<P>
   As the case winds its way through the final chapter of the
two-year saga, both sides are taking their campaigns to the people.
But Microsoft obviously has more to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a chess game, and Microsoft has got some damage
control to do,'' said Rich Gray, a Silicon Valley antitrust
attorney. ``From now until Jackson releases his final judgment it's
in Microsoft's best interest to keep their version of the future
out there, and I expect them to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   `If I'm Microsoft, I'm not just relying on the hope that Bush
beats Gore, I'm trying to create a grassroots groundswell'' of
support against a breakup, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears Microsoft is off to a good start _ though
that's no indication of how the judge may rule.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent CBSMarketwatch /AOL survey, 47 percent of
members polled (the survey didn't give a total figure) agreed with
the idea that ``breaking up Microsoft would hamper the progress of
technology by hurting the largest and most successful technology
company in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A third of those polled believe a split would benefit progress
by ``ensuring that all technology companies have access to the
marketplace and that all can compete fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Those figures may reflect Wall Street's highly divergent
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock rallied $3.69 yesterday, closing at $73.44. But
it's unclear whether that means investors believe the company
stands a good chance on appeal or whether two Microsofts ultimately
hold more value for shareholders than one.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts pegged the combined stock prices of two
Microsoft's at a relatively high $135, others looked less favorably
on a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't embrace this theory that the company's better off
split up,'' said William Epifanio, an analyst at JP Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it became 100 percent certain that Microsoft would be
broken up, I would sell first and ask questions later.''

BEWARE OF LIMITS ON ROTH IRAS 
 &HT;     BY ARTHUR LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR; Early in 1999, I opened a Roth individual retirement account in &LR; 
 &LR; the belief that my income would be below the cut-off point for &LR; 
 &LR; eligibility. Later in the year, several limited partnerships &LR; 
 &LR; that I had gone into during the early 1980s were sold, and I &LR; 
 &LR; learned that my adjusted gross income for 1999 was pushed above &LR; 
 &LR; the Roth limits. My accountant advised me to redesignate my &LR;   &LR; 1999
contribution to 2000, but by then I had already made my &LR;   &LR; Roth
contribution for this year. What are my options? &LR;
<P>
   A: You could have wriggled out without a penalty by converting
the Roth to a traditional, nondeductible IRA, says Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller. There are no upper income limits
imposed on that type of IRA. (With a Roth, the upper limit is
$160,000, with a phaseout beginning at $150,000; for a single
person, the upper limit is $110,000 and the phaseout begins at
$95,000.)
</P>
<P>
   You had to make the conversion before the due date of your 1999
tax return. Ordinarily that would have been April 17, but if you
didn't file by that date and instead requested an extension, you
still have until August 15.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have filed, you will have to pay a 6 percent
penalty tax on the amount of your 1999 contribution. Assuming that
you contributed $2,000, you would owe a penalty of $120. Also,
Weller warns, you had better withdraw your 1999 contribution from
the Roth promptly, or you will be hit with another 6 percent
penalty for this year as well.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; New Shares for Old Stock
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been asked to help an elderly blind woman find out the
value of an old stock certificate in her name. The company is
Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp., and the certificate is dated Feb.
8, 1982. Can you offer any advice?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical, formerly based in Oakland, hasn't
been a stand-alone company since 1987. At that time it was folded
into a newly formed holding company called KaiserTech Ltd.,
controlled by British investor Alan Clore. Kaiser Aluminum
shareholders exchanged their shares for KaiserTech stock, but for
some unknown reason your friend failed to make the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   KaiserTech was bought for cash by Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam Inc.
in 1988. Three years later, Maxxam made an initial public offering
of stock in a company called Kaiser Aluminum Corp., of which the
old Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical _ still bearing that name _ is the
operating subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   You ought to write or call the Maxxam investor relations
department and find out how to cash in the Kaiser certificate. The
address: 5847 San Felipe; Houston, TX 77057. The phone number:
(713) 975-7600.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Assessment Not Deductible
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our homeowners association levied a $5,800 charge per
homeowner for the cost of fixing a hillside slide. The slide
occurred on common property and did not affect us directly.
However, the association threatened to put a lien on our house if
we did not pay.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed out that all our property values could be adversely
affected, and we would be liable for lawsuits from a neighboring
community if we did not fix the slide. Our homeowners insurance did
not cover the cost because the slide was not on our own property.
Is this fee tax deductible?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: IRS spokesman Weller says that it is not. But it might
work to your tax benefit later on, if you ever sell your property.
</P>
<P>
   Weller says you are entitled to add the $5,800 to the cost basis
of your home in figuring the capital gain _ assuming there is one _
when you sell.
</P>
<P>
   That may or may not save you tax money.
</P>
<P>
   In selling your home, you are entitled to a $500,000
capital-gains exclusion if married, or a $250,000 exclusion if you
are single. If your profit on the home sale is less than that, you
won't be taxed, so the $5,800 outlay won't help you save on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But, as we have been reading lately, the prices of Bay Area
homes continue to soar out of sight. More and more homeowners are
finding themselves sitting on enormous paper profits that exceed
the exclusion limits. It could happen to you.
</P>

EDITORIAL: PEACE OVERTURES IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 2:
</P>
<P>
   With his decision to establish a safe haven for Colombia's
second-largest guerrilla group, President Andres Pastrana is
showing admirable persistence in trying to negotiate an end to his
nation's 35-year-old civil war. The plan would draw the group, the
National Liberation Army, into Pastrana's peace talks for the first
time. Colombians have learned not to expect too much from periodic
negotiations, and a peace agreement is still a long shot. But the
inclusion of the National Liberation Army provides the best chance
in recent history to negotiate an end to the activities of a
guerrilla army whose kidnappings and bombing of oil production
facilities have terrorized Colombians.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana took office in 1998 with an overwhelming mandate to
negotiate peace. One of his first acts was to pull army troops out
of a zone that became a safe haven for Colombia's largest guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
Ensconced in a sparsely populated area the size of Switzerland, the
FARC proceeded to increase coca production, stockpile arms and
drive out local authorities. The group's bad behavior and repeated
snubs at peace talks have made Pastrana look weak and damaged the
public consensus for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an auspicious backdrop for a second safe haven _
especially because the National Liberation Army recently infuriated
Colombians by kidnapping 160 worshipers at a Catholic Mass as well
as an airliner full of people. In addition, the area proposed for
the new safe haven is heavily populated and borders on an important
oil-producing zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastrana has made a better deal this time, mainly because
the National Liberation Army is smaller than the FARC and more
enthusiastic about peace negotiations. The new enclave will be
smaller in area and easier for the army to retake if the guerrillas
violate their promises. The group has apparently agreed to release
its hostages. Crucially, guerrilla leaders will also allow
Colombian and international observers into the area.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many details to be worked out, and no guarantee
of good behavior, but the plan is nevertheless a major step. The
recent announcement by the FARC that it will ``tax'' millionaires
by kidnapping them _ which has long been its practice _ is a
setback, but there have been advances as well. The FARC observed a
cease-fire over Christmas, and is proposing another one. It has
decided to create a political party. Perhaps Colombia's rebels are
finally ready to negotiate in good faith.

2 MICROSOFTS COULD BE WORTH MORE, OR LESS, THAN ONE 
 &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;         c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
How much are two Microsofts worth?
<P>
   As little as $50 per share or as much as $135, according to
three Wall Street estimates published since Friday, when the
government proposed breaking the software giant into two parts.
</P>
<P>
   How could analysts, in many cases using the same forecasting
models, come up with a range of estimates wide enough to drive a
Ford Excursion through?
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it turns on price/earnings ratios, growth rates and
discount factors _ tools of the analysts trade.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it boils down to whether analysts think
shareholders will be better off with two monopolies or one.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme is David Readerman, an analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners, who believes that two Microsofts would be worth about $55
per share _ $20 for the operating systems business and $25 for the
applications business. (Microsoft closed yesterday at $73.44, near
the bottom of its 52-week range of $66.63 to $119.13.)
</P>
<P>
   Readerman didn't return my calls, but his report issued
yesterday called the breakup a ``corporate castration'' that will
``destroy shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   The operating system company, he says, would become ``the new
economy equivalent of a public utility.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the ``intellectual property'' associated with the
Internet browser would go to the applications company. The OS
company could incorporate one version of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer into Windows. After that, it would have to license new Web
browsers from competing (non-Microsoft) companies or develop its
own.
</P>
<P>
   The OS company would ``resemble a university research think tank
with little entrepreneurial incentive. The goal will be winning
tenure professorships and getting lucrative consulting and board
seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Readerman says his numbers reflect a ``worst-case scenario'' but
doesn't offer a best case.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme is Michael Stanek of Lehman Bros., who
thinks a two-piece Microsoft could be worth a total of $125 to $135
per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operating system company won't be as exciting,'' he
admits, ``but applications looks like a terrific business, mainly
because it will be able to merge with other companies'' such as
Ariba or other B2B Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   He figures the OS company would be worth $31 to $34 per share,
with the rest of the value in the applications business and $6 to
$9 per share in cash and equity investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say the company's going to have problems because of
all these government regulations, but it's still a monopoly and the
market will pay for a monopoly,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At both extremes _ and in the middle _ is Melissa Eisenstat of
CIBC World Markets, who believes a post-breakup Microsoft could be
worth a total of $52 to $134 per share, based on four different
valuation techniques:
</P>
<P>
   _Market cap to revenues: $52. This valuation was arrived at by
multiplying Microsoft's estimated revenues for each segment by an
average multiple for leading competitors in each segment. Eisenstat
says this is a better way to value startups with no earnings than
big moneymakers like Microsoft, and she doesn't put much faith in
this estimate.
</P>
<P>
   _Discounted cash flow: $59. This involves estimating the present
value of Microsoft's cash flow over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   _P/E to growth: $58. Eisenstat multiplied her estimated earnings
for each segment by a multiple based on the growth rate for each
segment. The result is ``almost exactly the result we achieved
through DCF  &LR; discounted-cash-flow analysis, and more closely
reflects the traditional method of valuing mature software
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   _Relative valuation: $134. Eisenstat valued the two pieces based
on P/E ratios of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to tell you it's going there (to $134). And if
psychology on the stock turns, it could go there,'' Eisenstat says.
But she thinks the two middle valuations _ $58 and $59 _ ``do the
best job of valuing the intrinsic business.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstat, who was one of the first Wall Street analysts to
downgrade Microsoft this year, says the company could be worth less
than it is now because of ``the loss of the network effect. One
product helps you sell another. You're losing that whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   KWATINETZ' NEW VENTURE: Michael Kwatinetz was one of the first
analysts to come up with a breakup value for Microsoft. Late last
year, when the stock was much higher, he estimated the company
would be worth $553 billion in a breakup, or about 20 percent more
than its market value at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Kwatinetz, who quit his job at Credit Suisse First Boston two
weeks ago to open an investment company in the Bay Area, said his
valuation was based on a breakup into three companies _ for
operating systems, applications and Internet businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they separated the company into three parts and let each
one be competitive, the (combined post-breakup value) would be 50
percent more than it is now,'' Kwatinetz said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But the remedy the government proposed Friday would ``impose
sanctions that would make both companies noncompetitive and would
bury the Internet value in the applications company,'' he said.
Under that scenario, ``I'm not sure it's worth any more than it is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwatinetz has recruited (or should I say raided) an impressive
lineup for his new venture, Azure Capital Partners. They include
three colleagues from CSFB: Paul Weinstein, an analyst covering
networking stocks; Cameron Lester, who was an investment banker in
the e-software division; and Paul Ferris, an investment banker in
the communications division.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth partner is Frank ``Quint'' Slattery, who was managing
the PBHG New Opportunities fund until April 11. The partners plan
to have offices in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Final note: CSFB took Microsoft off its recommended list
yesterday, but only because no one is covering the stock at the
moment. However, Elliott Rogers, CSFB managing director, called
Microsoft ``the Philip Morris of technology stocks,'' meaning it
could be bogged down for years in legal problems.

EDITORIAL: THE BLACKOUT BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 2:
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers woke up Monday to find that the ABC channel on their
Time Warner cable systems had gone blank. In its place appeared
Time Warner's accusation that ``Disney has taken ABC away from
you.'' The blackout also struck millions of ABC viewers in several
other cities, including Los Angeles and Houston. No ``Good Morning
America.'' No ABC news. No Regis Philbin to anoint another
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the two corporate behemoths _ Time Warner and
Disney, the parent of ABC _ are engaged in a bruising negotiation
over more than $1 billion in cable revenues. They could not agree
on another monthly extension of an agreement that expired at the
end of last year, under which Time Warner paid Disney for the right
to carry its programming. Disney wanted more money for its popular
channels. Time Warner refused and took ABC off the screens during a
critical ``sweeps'' period when the number of viewers is used to
set advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of fierce bargaining among giant
corporations, the public interest in broad access to information
has been dealt a blow by this blackout of a top-rated news and
entertainment network on television. The combatants have to
recognize that there is a public service component to what they do,
and that there will be limits to public and political patience with
blockades on the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, the current battle gives us an alarming
glimpse of the possible shape of the future in telecommunications.
Time Warner had no qualms about dumping even as powerful a
corporation as Disney/ABC, and the pending merger between AOL and
Time Warner will make the cable owner all the more powerful. The
merged company will own not only the pipeline that brings video
programming into millions of homes, but also many of the most
popular programs and Internet services provided by the cable
service. The threat to Disney is that Time Warner will give its own
cable channels better technical features than those of the Disney
channels it carries.
</P>
<P>
   The threat is real. Cable operators already control access to
the Internet, forcing customers to use the operators' choice of
Internet service provider. Soon cable companies will also offer
customers an array of digital services attached to individual cable
channels: Click here to retrieve the batting average of the player
kneeling in the on-deck circle; click there to contact the local
dealer for the sport utility vehicles advertised between innings.
</P>
<P>
   Disney fears that Time Warner will offer better interactive
technology on its own channels, like CNN and HBO, than it offers
with Disney's channels. Disney demanded that Time Warner provide
assurances that it will provide features on a non-discriminatory
basis. But Time Warner refused on the grounds that Disney should be
willing to pay for the technical benefits in bargaining over future
contracts when the services are real, not just imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has ducked the issue of
Internet and other digital services on the reasonable grounds that
it was too early in the process to know how to regulate. But the
Disney-Time Warner flap should compel the commission to take
another look. It is still too early to issue elaborate rules. But
it may not be too soon to put cable operators on notice that in the
future the commission may insist that where technically feasible,
cable operators will be required _ at least in monopoly situations
_ to make equivalent services available to all channels. Meanwhile,
would-be viewers of ABC's news and entertainment offerings should
not be shy about protesting this inconsiderate and unnecessary
interruption of the cable service they pay for.

GIULIANI TO SEEK ENDORSEMENT FROM THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after a former congressman from Westchester
County, Joseph J. DioGuardi, announced that he would seek the
Conservative Party endorsement to run for the U.S. Senate, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani declared Monday that he, too, wanted the party's
endorsement. Giuliani's aides sought for the first time to set up a
meeting between the mayor and state Conservative Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, the state party's chairman, said that he was
called early Monday by an aide to Giuliani requesting a meeting. An
aide to Giuliani confirmed the call, and said a meeting could
happen over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a credible conservative candidate is a matter of
clear concern to Giuliani's aides, since DioGuardi, running on the
right, would presumably draw votes away from Giuliani in his Senate
contest with Hillary Rodham Clinton. And DioGuardi, the former
two-term congressman, said in an interview that he wants to run as
the candidate of the Conservative, Right-to-Life and Independence
Parties.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Long and Giuliani has been strained,
and evidence remained Monday of abundant hostility between the two.
Aides to both suggested that Giuliani's prospects of winning the
Conservative endorsement remained fairly remote. Long noted he had
repeatedly said that he was open to a meeting with Giuliani over
the last year, and that Giuliani had shunned his overtures _until
DioGuardi's plans became known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they were planning to make the call anyhow,'' Long said
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a close
ally of Giuliani, attacked Long for entertaining the prospect of
running DioGuardi against the mayor. ``Mike Long has been on a
mission to destroy Rudy Giuliani,'' Molinari said. ``And now
putting Joe DioGuardi out there clearly is designed as an
opportunity to try to siphon off enough votes to make Rudy Giuliani
a loser. It doesn't elect Rudy Giuliani. It elects Hillary. If Rudy
loses, people are going to blame Mike Long and the Conservative
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was filled with maneuvering by the smaller parties who
are trying to wield some influence in this Senate race. Clinton
announced she would appear before the policy committee of the
Liberal Party on Saturday. Her aides, though, sought to play down
expectations, noting Giuliani's close friendship with Raymond B.
Harding, the party leader.
</P>
<P>
   And Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party
who controls a faction of the Independence Party, called a news
conference to assail Clinton for attacking ``extremism'' in the
Independence Party when she and Giuliani appeared before its
members on Saturday. The first lady was referring to the party's
affiliation with Fulani and Patrick J. Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   `` Clinton's slanderous personal attacks on me at the
Independence Party forum on Saturday indicate that she and her
professional advisers thought she could score some political points
by name-calling,'' Fulani said. ``Obviously, they feel completely
secure that they have the support of New York's black leadership
and that they can single me out for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, defended the remarks. ``Pat
Buchanan and his chief ally in New York, Lenora Fulani, have a long
history of making anti-Semitic and divisive statements,'' he said.
``That's why Hillary made it very clear on Saturday that she won't
compromise her principles by running on a ticket with Pat
Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Giuliani said he had expressed his interest in
winning the Conservative Party endorsement when Long called him on
Thursday to offer best wishes, after the mayor announced he had
prostate cancer. Giuliani said he had talked briefly with Long
about his political support, adding that it would be better to work
out any details in private.
</P>
<P>
   Long disputed Giuliani's account, saying the mayor never asked
for the endorsement. ``My door is open'' to discussion, Long said,
but reiterated that he would not support endorsing Giuliani unless
he dropped his opposition to bans on some forms of late-term
abortion, and abandoned his effort to run as a Liberal Party
candidate.

DEAL SIGNED FOR CASINO AT OLD CATSKILLS RESORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another round of billion-dollar poker involving a
proposed casino for the Catskills, the world's largest gambling
company announced Monday that it had signed an option to buy
Kutsher's Country Club, the oldest resort in the Catskills, to
create a 1,400-acre entertainment complex and gambling hall that
would be owned by the St. Regis Mohawks tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The resort would sit on Anawana Lake in Sullivan County, about
five miles north of the site at Monticello Raceway that federal
officials approved last month, after a four-year-long application
for a $500 million casino and entertainment complex for the
Mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of the Mohawk tribe recently abandoned that plan
and signed an unusual agreement with Park Place Entertainment,
which owns 28 gambling operations in New Jersey, Nevada,
Mississippi and overseas. The agreement grants Park Place the right
to develop and manage Mohawk casinos throughout New York.
</P>
<P>
   That new agreement is being viewed with increasing skepticism by
political and governmental officials who helped gain support for
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday by Park Place appears to be another
attempt to outmaneuver the tribe's original partners in Monticello,
Catskill Development, and seize control of a project that the
developer estimates could generate more than $1 billion a year.
Some gambling analysts doubt that Park Place truly wants a hall in
Monticello that would undercut its three casinos in Atlantic City.
The company said Monday that it would build a resort hotel with up
to 2,000 rooms in addition to the casino. The project would rival
the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut and employ 4,500 people in a
county whose resort industry has been slowly dying for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to build a destination resort on the site of
Kutsher's,'' said Clive Cummis, general counsel for Park Place.
``We'll build a hotel and casino, upgrade the golf course. This
would be a giant step forward in the rebirth of Sullivan County.''
</P>
<P>
   Cummis said Park Place believed it would inherit the federal
approval granted to the original Mohawk project and proceed
quickly, but officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the
National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees management
contracts between casino operators and tribes, said the company
would have to file a new application for Kutsher's, a process that
could take two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel K. Inouye and
other supporters of the tribal casino were bewildered by the
tribe's sudden alliance with Park Place, just when the long-sought
Monticello Raceway casino seemed assured. They had supported
Catskill Development's plan to put 30 acres in trust for the tribe
under a seldom-used provision of federal law. The trust would
establish a sovereign Indian territory for a gambling hall and
bypass New York's prohibition on casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and not prepared for this sudden change,''
said Inouye, vice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee.
``I am certain that those of us who have been trying to assist the
St. Regis Mohawk tribe would like to hear directly from them about
what has happened, or is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Local officials in Sullivan County told four Mohawk chiefs at a
meeting Friday night at the Town Hall in Thompson, Sullivan County,
that they would not look kindly on a casino at Kutsher's, or a
delay in the county's long-awaited casino project. The chiefs said
they wanted to put a casino at the raceway, according to two people
who attended the meeting, but were also considering another
location, which the two men presumed to be Kutsher's.
</P>
<P>
   Cummis struck a deal on Friday with Mark Kutsher, the head of
the family that owns the country club, under which Park Place
agreed to buy 50 acres within 60 days and a five-year option to
acquire the remaining 1,350 acres. Park Place, which said it would
transfer the 50 acres to the Mohawks, agreed to hire the Kutsher
family, as well as its employees, and to continue to use the
Kutsher name in some manner.

LEHMAN NAMED IN SUIT OVER MORTGAGE LENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lehman Brothers, a major source of financing for lenders
catering to customers with less than perfect credit, was sued on
Monday as part of a class-action suit filed against the First
Alliance Corp., a national mortgage lender in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana,
Calif., by the San Francisco law firm of Jenkins and Mulligan, one
of several firms representing homeowners who had received
home-equity loans from First Alliance Mortgage Co., the
corporation's flagship unit.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman Brothers, said on
Monday night that the company has not seen the new lawsuit and that
he could not comment on it. But in the past, Lehman Brothers had
staunchly denied any wrongdoing in connection with its financing of
First Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
March while facing a long roster of civil and regulatory lawsuits
that accused it of using deceptive sales practices to lure
homeowners into high-cost loans that drained away the wealth they
had tied up in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance had denied the accusations, insisting that
homeowners were fully informed about the terms of their loans.
Under federal court rules, those consumer lawsuits have been frozen
by the company's bankruptcy filing, although some state regulatory
actions are proceeding in Illinois and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage company, which once had offices in more than a
dozen states was one of many so-called subprime mortgage lenders
who relied on Lehman both for lines of credit and for capital.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last fall, Lehman had raised more than $100
million for First Alliance despite the accusations of predatory
lending that had been made against the mortgage company in dozens
of lawsuits filed by the AARP, homeowners and state regulators.
Those lawsuits were fully disclosed to investors in the securities
that Lehman sold.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint filed on Monday repeats many of the consumer fraud
allegations already pending against First Alliance. But it
additionally argues that Lehman Brothers provided the funds that
allowed First Alliance and its subsidiaries ``to continue their
fraudulent lending practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment bank, the complaint argues, ``had knowledge of
the fraudulent practices described above and tacitly or expressly
approved those practices in its financing of the lending
operations.'' The complaint added, ``absent this approval, First
Alliance's fraudulent loans team would not have been possible.''

2 HOSPITALS AGREE TO INTERPRETERS FOR DEAF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York City hospitals and a group of primary
care clinics have agreed to provide interpreters for deaf patients
to avoid a federal lawsuit accusing them of violating the Americans
With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The consent agreement, which was filed Monday in the United
States Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts, is believed
to be among the broadest of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office said it had investigated
complaints from deaf and hearing-impaired patients who said they
had not been able to understand health care workers and had been
denied interpreters, and decided to focus on those centers where
the complaints were most numerous.
</P>
<P>
   The institutions that entered into an agreement with the state
are Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York Community
Hospital in Brooklyn and the seven primary care centers run by
United Medical Associates in Brooklyn. Each center signed the
agreement. An agreement with a similar primary care umbrella group
is pending upstate, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than face a lawsuit, the institutions agreed to a vast
array of conditions, including a promise to provide interpreters
more or less on demand for patients who request them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the broadest consent decree we have seen,'' said the
attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer. ``This is an agreement we hope
will become a template for other institutions that have similarly
failed to be as accommodating as is called for under the ADA.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaints, deaf patients were often
erroneously told that they were not entitled to interpreters or
that they should bring their own. The disabilities act requires
employers and institutions to provide accessible services to people
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a deaf woman who could not speak sought treatment
in the emergency room of a hospital that the attorney general's
office would not identify. Unable to communicate with hospital
workers, she was told that she was well and was sent home, where
she later had a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was bleeding profusely and asked for a sign language
interpreter,'' said Hilary Klein, an assistant attorney general.
``She had no idea what was going on. She was told she was fine and
to go home. No one was called. It was communicated to her that she
was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a man with serious eye problems who needed
surgery was told that he should ask his daughter, who lived in
Pennsylvania and had accompanied him on previous medical
appointments, to move back to New York, Klein said. Other cases
included women who were unable to understand the dosage for
medications for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the hospitals and doctors'
offices will have to provide an interpreter for people who cannot
hear within an hour of their arrival. If a patient gives more than
two hours' notice, the interpreter must be available when he or she
arrives. The only exception is for Montefiore during nights,
weekends and holidays, when patients will be required to give four
hours' notice to have an interpreter available on arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The centers must also either contract with a company that
provides interpreters, or hire someone whose job description would
include that role. Interpreters usually charge about $75 an hour,
Klein said. Hospitals must also train their staff to work with deaf
people, and provide refresher courses.

KU KLUX KLAN SAYS IT WILL SEEK PERMISSION FOR A MASKED RALLY IN
NYC
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Ku Klux Klan, which created a furor when a
handful of its members demonstrated in lower Manhattan last year,
plans to reapply for a permit to demonstrate again this fall, the
group's lawyer has said.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's rally, Klan members were forced to doff their
masks as a result of a 155-year-old New York state law that forbids
demonstrators to cover their faces. City officials invoked the law
after the Klan applied for a permit.
</P>
<P>
   The group challenged the order that the masks be removed, which
was overturned by a federal District Court judge, but then
reinstated by a federal appeals court. The case is now back in
district court.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is
representing the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, said the group intended to again ask the court to allow the
demonstrators to wear masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used this statute as a pretext for denying the Klan the
right to effectively demonstrate,'' said the lawyer, Norman Siegel,
executive director of the civil liberties group. ``Once they could
not wear their masks it substantially decreased the number of
people who would demonstrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said the group planned to reapply for the permit, and
this time would ask a judge to permanently bar the city from
enforcing the ordinance. ``The Klan intends to come back and
exercise their right to wear the hood and the mask,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they were merely enforcing an existing law,
which prevents organized groups from demonstrating while wearing
masks. The law dates back to the mid-19th century, when tenant
farmers demonstrated against their landlords. Wearing disguises,
the farmers would stage protests, and sometimes riots, and escape
to the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons behind the statute are as valid today as they were
when the law was passed, and that is to create accountability for
one's actions when one is in a crowd,'' said Daniel S. Connolly, a
lawyer for the city.

JOCKEY MAKES TRIPPI A CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The mileposts fall one by one along Jorge
Chavez's road to glory, chopped down by the mightiest whip in all
of thoroughbred racing.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough track title, at Gulfstream Park in the winter of
1999. Then a big-name horse to ride, Behrens. Then a Breeders' Cup
victory _ in fact, two in a day last fall, with Artax in the Sprint
and Beautiful Pleasure in the Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the credit,'' Chavez said, meaning acclaim. ``Then I got
the horses.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he got the ultimate recognition, an Eclipse Award
honoring the Peruvian as North America's outstanding jockey of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like just another young jockey's ride to the top.
Except that Chavez, who will be aboard Trippi in Saturday's 126th
Kentucky Derby, is not so young. It took him more than a decade of
riding in the United States to become an overnight success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd been riding the horses he rode last year, it would
have happened sooner,'' said Mike Smith, a two-time Eclipse winner
who competes against Chavez, primarily in New York and Florida.
``It's just something we all have to wait our turns for.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, though, had to wait longer than most. At 38, he was the
oldest first-time Eclipse winner.
</P>
<P>
   What took so long? For the answer, refer back to that mighty
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is 4-foot-10, small even for a jockey, is known as
the most ferocious whipper in the sport. Wielding his stick in the
unorthodox ``down'' position _ holding it as one would an ice pick
instead of a baton _ he seems to fire off more blows more quickly
than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That approach, which earned Chavez the nickname ``Chop Chop,''
is only one element of an aggressive riding style that cost him 85
days of suspensions within a year of his 1988 arrival in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bettors love it _ Chavez never loses a race for lack of effort _
but the well-heeled owners of top-class thoroughbreds traditionally
prefer more graceful riders.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Chavez walked away from the easy money at New
York's Aqueduct racetrack in the winter of 1999 and began beating
the fancier jockeys at the first-class Gulfstream Park meet that he
was considered suitable company for stakes horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might look a little different out there, but whatever he
does, it works for him,'' Smith said. ``He's very dangerous on the
front end. He's very aggressive and strong, but yet he can sit
pretty patient when he needs to.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Horses will) overachieve for him a lot of times, especially
the first time he gets on them. He'll change their form a lot of
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park fans got a demonstration Sunday when Chavez made
a rare West Coast appearance to ride in a couple of the California
Gold Rush races.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mounts was a 3-year-old colt who got no closer than
fifth in his only previous start. Chavez gunned him to the lead out
of the gate, and the 6-1 shot got brave, going on to win by
one-half length.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hollywood Park jockeys' room, Chavez said he doesn't mind
being known as Chop Chop, and doesn't care if you pronounce his
first name Horhay, Horgay or George. But he dislikes the
implication that he's a one-dimensional ``speed'' rider or that his
whip hurts horses. ``Most of the time I'm just showing them the
whip or just brushing them,'' he said from beneath dark bangs.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hasn't broken his old image completely. He is not yet a
go-to rider for Kentucky Derby trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Trippi will be only his third Derby mount, following Ulises
(14th in 1994) and Adonis (17th in 1999). And this is not a horse
fit for the reigning king of U.S. jockeys. The colt named for the
great Georgia halfback Charlie Trippi has taken an end run to the
Derby, debuting late and skipping the major prep races to remain
undefeated in four starts by winning the 1-mile Flamingo Stakes at
Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, who hasn't complained about much in his career,
isn't going to start now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You say Trippi isn't one of the top horses,'' he said. ``But
if you take out the favorite (Fusaichi Pegasus), everybody else is
the same. He (Trippi) shows a lot of speed. We'll see if he can go
a mile and a quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   It's another chance for Chavez to change people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: A day after Kentucky Derby favorite Fusaichi Pegasus
turned in an impressive-looking 6-furlong workout, his barnmate War
Chant more than matched it Monday with a 1:13 4/5 clocking and a
reported :22 2/5 final quarter-mile. Trainer Neil Drysdale said he
was ``delighted'' and said he's ``equally pleased'' with the two
colts. . . . Retired jockey Gary Stevens, an assistant trainer,
rode Anees in a 5-furlong workout (1:00 2/5) and said the
2-year-old champion felt more aggressive. Stevens and trainer Alex
Hassinger have been trying different kinds of blinkers on Anees. .
. . Also among 22 horses aiming for the 20-horse Derby: Aptitude,
Captain Steve, China Visit, Commendable, Curule, Deputy Warlock,
Exchange Rate, Globalize, Graeme Hall, Hal's Hope, Harlan Traveler,
HighYield, Impeachment, More Than Ready, Snuck In, The Deputy and
Wheelaway. . . . Racing Hall of Fame voting results will be
announced today at Churchill Downs. Drysdale is expected to beat
out Richard Mandella and Willard Proctor in the trainers category.

LAKERS HAVEN'T WON A THING YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Now, don't go getting all nervous. Can the panic
attack. Forget the fast retreat, the jumping ship, reaching for the
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost a first-round playoff game. OK, more accurately,
they lost a playoff game they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   A game that a championship team does win. Champions close out a
series when it's there for the taking. They don't blow a
five-point, fourth-quarter lead. They smell blood. Go for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not. They were on their way to a methodical,
uneventful sweep to their first-round playoff series Sunday against
the Kings, when they let the little upstarts find new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing. We had a chance to land a knockout
punch,'' Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said. ``You learn
when you have a chance to end it, you've got to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A playoff series is something that's not choreographed. It's a
live event. Anything can happen. You can get flu, injuries, there
are so many variables. Rick Fox is now in New York looking after
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to end a series as soon as possible. You don't want
to give a team hope or life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chalk this up to a learning experience. When the opportunity was
there, the Lakers did not finish off the Kings the way champions
do. But here is a real news flash: The Lakers aren't champions.
</P>
<P>
   They have won nothing yet. Sixty-seven victories in the regular
season is just so much prolonged prelude to the real season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers remain a work in progress. This is a team that has to
grow before us in the playoffs. They're not soup yet, although the
simmering aroma has been intoxicating to Laker faithful ready to
fit them for rings since January.
</P>
<P>
   The press, opposing coaches, other players, have all taken turns
to lavish praise upon the Lakers and all but anoint them as NBA
champions before the first playoff tip. A league eager for its next
super team fell upon its knees. If they were made out to be any
greater, after the courts finished with Microsoft, they'd go about
busting up the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Only, the Lakers are not invincible. They are not greatest thing
since Sir Michael landed. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The invincibility is not on our part, it's on your (media)
part,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``You guys are the ones who
have crowned us champions before we even got off and running in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be tested, the metttle and the wherewithal that
comes within this team to ride out tough things and situations on
the court that make it difficult to play _ missed free throws,
those kinds of things _ are still to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have made progress on two of their long-time
problems, yet both were again evident in Sunday's 99-91 loss to the
Kings: Shaquille O'Neal remains unreliable at the free-throw line
and Kobe Bryant too often is prone to go solo.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever advances made in both areas this season, they have to
prove themselves in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers have earned everyone's respect this season, they
are not the answer to Social Security, Elian's woes or explaining
professional wrestling. They have not earned an automatic ticket to
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody in our league sees them as invincible,''
Kings coach Rick Adelman said. ``They have all the components to
get to the finals, and that's really what your goal is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in some ways, if they beat us in this playoff round, I'm
sure Phil will look back on that game (Sunday) night and say, `Hey,
this is what can happen to us if we don't take care of what we have
to do.' I think he's very good at making them understand where they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference is so competitive, if you don't come to
play your best on the road, you will lose regardless of the
opponent. The Kings are the eighth-place team, and only twice in
NBA history has a No. 8 upset a No. 1 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not play their best Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one of those days, brother,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Great teams don't have many in the playoffs. But each of the
Lakers' five championship teams in the '80s lost at least two
playoff games. They lost nine times on the way to winning their
last title in '88.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see tonight just how much mettle this contingent has. The
crowd, relatively quiet until the fourth quarter Sunday, will be in
full force from the start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a challenge, the kind great teams overcome. And the
playoffs is where greatness evolves.

STARS TRY TO SHUT DOWN, SHUT UP SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stars winger Blake Sloan doesn't know a lot about computers.
</P>
<P>
   But he does know the dot.com geeks who abound Sharks games sound
more like John Belushi in ``Animal House'' than Bill Gates at a
Microsoft shareholders meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's bad,'' Sloan said. ``Not as much the noise, but
their fans are ruthless. They have no qualms about putting anything
on signs or billboards.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes likely won't change for Game 3 tonight at San Jose
Arena. An effigy of Stars goalie Ed Belfour falls from the stadium
roof. Signs, bearing less-than-original, billion-dollar punch
lines, hang everywhere. All while Sharks fans stand and scream in
anticipation of that first goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars know the best way to shut them up is to shut them
down.
</P>
<P>
   They have just the defense capable of doing it, too. The Sharks
didn't score a goal in either game in Dallas. They were shut out
only four times in 82 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in their mind now they haven't scored in two
games,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said. ``And that's why I
think the first period is going to be big. If we are able to keep
their shots low and get just one goal, that's all we need for them
to really say `Oh God, this is happening again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' defense has a way of getting into an opponent's head.
</P>
<P>
   Stars captain Derian Hatcher invaded the Edmonton Oilers'
craniums in the first round. The Oilers couldn't talk about the
series without somehow mentioning him. Hatcher this, Hatcher that,
Hatcher, Hatcher, Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sharks, it's all about Belfour, like Jan Brady pouting
about Marcia. They put 37 shots on him in two games. They've yet to
get one by him. He hasn't allowed a goal in 138 minutes and 53
seconds. It's always Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it Eddie, Matty, Hatch?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is Eddie, Sergei, Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget Eddie, Cote and ``Charlie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of like our own little family,'' Darryl Sydor said
of Dallas' defensive corps. ``I think we really feel good together.
All six of us back there know what we have to do to get it done.
Obviously, the less time you have in your zone the better. Our
motto is to get it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what they've been doing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks come charging up to the blue line full of vim and
vigor only to be turned away by the wall of Hatcher and Richard
Matvichuk or Sydor and Sergei Zubov or Cote and Dave Manson.
</P>
<P>
   It grows disheartening after a couple of minutes. The Sharks
have been battling it for 120 minutes so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for any team,'' Matvichuk said. ``It would be
frustrating for us, too, if we weren't able to get into the
opposition's end.''
</P>
<P>
   If San Jose needs a sympathetic shoulder to cry on, call
Detroit. The Red Wings couldn't get the puck through the neutral
zone, and scored only once against Colorado goalie Patrick Roy in
the first two games of that series, before coming back with a 3-1
victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were as tough or tougher than Colorado's defense in
the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a great job of clearing out'' the crease, San Jose
forward Tony Granato said. ``We have to keep fighting, but they
have Hatcher, Matvichuk, Manson, a lot of big guys, around there.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Stars didn't feel they played that great defensively in
Game 2. Too many odd-man rushes, too many times when Belfour was
expected to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the answer to it all, but we can't continue to live on
that,'' Stars assistant coach Rick Wilson said. ``We can play
better defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about exactly what the Sharks didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let the numbers fool you. It's Game 3, but it might as
well be Game 7 for the Sharks. If they don't win tonight, their
chances of winning out to steal the series are almost as slim as
Gates' chances of filing for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   So they really need to win Game 3. The crowd, they hope, can do
what they haven't been able to: Rattle Belfour and the Stars'
defense.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars, it's equally simple. Shut the Sharks down. Shut
the crowd up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to do it is make them spend time in their own
end, more time than they want. Don't let them get started,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``It can turn quickly. I know it has been
a quiet building when they are unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   If they shut up the dot.com geeks, it's likely to be
www.starswin.com. nn
