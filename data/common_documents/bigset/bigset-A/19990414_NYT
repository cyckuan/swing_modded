FAA ORDERS TIGHTER SAFETY CHECKS AT BOEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration has told The
Boeing Co. that it cannot deliver any airplanes to customers until
it does more to verify that it has complied with safety changes
mandated by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Boeing, the FAA said it was taking the action
after two planes _ one still in production and the other already in
service _ apparently did not have changes required by FAA
airworthiness directives.
</P>
<P>
   One of those directives was issued after a 20-foot section of
wing flaps tore off a Boeing 767 while it was landing at
Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The other directive was issued after fasteners on 737 rudder
pedals worked lose, resulting in a loss of rudder control.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing official on Tuesdsay questioned the FAA's findings and
said the order will not affect production or delivery of any
airplanes. Scott Peterson, director of quality assurance for
Boeing, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the company
already verifies that applicable changes called for in
airworthiness directives are incorporated in the company's
passenger jets before they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Boeing does not believe ``that we have delivered
any airplanes that have not had the airworthiness directive
requirements incorporated.''
</P>
<P>
   An airworthiness directive is an FAA order to aircraft operators
or the manufacturer to take some safety action.
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Creedy, FAA spokeswoman in Washington, D.C., said
Tuesday that agency officials could not comment on the Boeing
letter because the matter is under investigation. But she did say
the FAA intends to make sure all Boeing jetliners include
airworthiness safety changes before they are delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not fail to verify full compliance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter notifying Boeing that it is under investigation was
sent to Peterson on April 8 by the FAA's James Robinson in the
aircraft certification office in Renton, Wash. Peterson said he did
not receive the letter until two days later, on Saturday, and that
he and others at Boeing are still trying to make sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the letter is ``very confusing'' and contains
inaccuracies. He said Robinson was out of the office Tuesday and
could not be reached to clarify what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is some question whether the letter is
accurate enough to not be retracted and rewritten in an accurate
fashion,'' Peterson said. The Renton FAA office, he said, also has
concerns about the letter, and those concerns had been passed along
to the Washington, D.C., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, the FAA on April 6 conducted an
airworthiness inspection of a Boeing 767 in production at the
Everett, Wash., plant to determine if it complied with an
airworthiness directive that was issued in 1998. It did not, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   That directive required airlines and Boeing to make a one-time
inspection of planes in service or in production to check fasteners
that connect pushrods to the rudder pedal assemblies.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the airworthiness directive, the FAA said the captain
of a Boeing 737-400 had reported that after his plane landed, the
right rudder pedal moved to its full position when it was pushed,
but failed to return to its normal position when released. The
rudder, however, remained in its neutral position.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed that the pushrod on the right rudder
pedal was not connected to the rudder pedal assembly. The bolt and
nut that holds the pushrod to the assembly had come lose.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, in its directive, said another 737 operator reported
that a pilot felt a loose rudder pedal and a subsequent
investigation revealed that the fastener connecting the pushrod to
the rudder assembly was loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions, if not corrected, could result in potential
loss of rudder control, jamming of the rudder system, uncommanded
movement of the rudder system and consequent reduced
controllability of the airplane,'' the FAA said in its directive.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rudder assembly on some models of the 747, 757, 767
and 777 are similar in design to the 737, the FAA said its
directive would apply to all Boeing planes.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Peterson, the FAA's Robinson said the 767
inspected on the Everett production line on April 6 did not have
the proper fasteners that connect the pushrod to the rudder pedal
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing inspectors had signed off on paperwork that showed
the directive had been met, Robinson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the FAA inspector was confused about the
requirements of the airworthiness directive.
</P>
<P>
   That directive only mandates that Boeing make a one time
inspection of planes in production to verify the nut and bolt are
tight, Peterson said. But after the directive was issued, he said,
Boeing engineers redesigned the nut and bolt to include a cotter
pin, which further ensures it will not come loose.
</P>
<P>
   The 767 plane inspected was line number 751. It was supposed to
have the redesigned fastener, Peterson said. All 767s starting with
number 750 on the production line are to have the new fastener, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So why did the paperwork show the new fastener was installed,
when it was not?
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an oversight by the mechanic installing the bolt and
he went ahead and installed what he had always installed,''
Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing was never required as part of the airworthiness
directive to install the redesigned fastener, Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also also took issue with the second case cited in Robinson's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wrote that on March 30 the FAA received correspondence
from a 767 operator that shims had not been installed in the flap
assembly as required by an airworthiness directive issued by the
FAA in 1997. The 767 in question was delivered by Boeing on March
2, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued the airworthiness directive after a 20-foot
section of wing flaps tore off a Delta 767 while the plane was
landing at Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport. The plane,
with 198 passengers and crew, managed to land safely.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation revealed that bolts holding the flaps to the
wing had failed. The airworthiness directive ordered 767 operators
to inspect the bolts for fatigue. Also, Boeing had to include
what's known as shims in its production 767s. And whenever the
bolts are replaced on planes in service, the shims have to be
added. Shims act like a washer on the flap bolts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that this airplane was delivered without the shims
installed as required...,'' Robinson wrote in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   But Peterson said Boeing has not been able to verify that the
shims were not installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to track down information to see what actually
was installed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson wrote that as a result of the two cases cited in his
letter, ``Effective April 8, 1999, the FAA is requiring that all
aircraft deliveries be withheld pending verification'' that
airworthiness directives are incorporated on Boeing's planes.
</P>
<P>
   This new policy will continue until Boeing can demonstrate to
the FAA that it has improved its verfiication procedures, Robinson
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a second letter to Boeing dated April 9, another FAA official
in the Renton office notified Boeing of the additional steps it
must take before the FAA will issue an airworthiness certificate
for Boeing airplanes. Such a certificate is required before a plane
can be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This added requirement in the delivery process is necessary
until Boeing provides corrective action ... that is acceptable to
the FAA,'' the sceond letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the additional steps cited by the FAA involve
mostly paperwork and will not delay the delivery of any airplanes.

CANDIDATE MCCAIN COMES OUT SWINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., formally declared
himself a presidential candidate Tuesday and immediately made a
campaign issue of the war in Kosovo by renewing his call to do
whatever it takes to win it.
</P>
<P>
   There were no balloons or pep bands as McCain made it official
that he is seeking the Republican nomination in 2000. Rather, the
announcement was made simply in a three-page news release that made
clear his intention to use the Balkans crisis to contrast his
leader ship in foreign policy with the Clinton administration's.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I hope to restore to the White House the kind of
leadership Americans expect in cri ses like this one and to reform
our institutions of government to make us proud again,'' McCain
said in the release.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in his first speech as a formal candidate, McCain seemed
to up the ante on Kosovo by accusing NATO and the Clinton
administration of ``critical tactical errors'' and by calling for
the immediate mobilization of infantry and armored divisions for a
possible ground war.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Vietnam pris oner of war and the son and
grandson of naval commanders, said the administration erred with
its ``excessively restricted'' air cam paign and its declaration
that NATO had no intention of summoning ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two mistakes were made in what almost seemed willful
ignorance of every lesson we learned in Vietnam,'' McCain told the
Center for Strategic and Interna tional Studies, a public policy
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton seems to have had neither a Plan A nor a
Plan B. If war against Serbia was necessary, then winning the war
is necessary as well. That is a trite remark, I know, but the
administration's policy is so mystifying to me that it begs such
obvious criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, McCain had been scheduled to launch his presidential
bid formally with a three-day na tional tour, beginning with an
April 6 breakfast at the Naval Acad emy in Annapolis, Md. The tour
was to have included stops in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Ari
zona, California, Utah and Massa chusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While he has continued to raise funds _ he had $4.3 million
avail able as of March 31 _ McCain said Tuesday that, because of
Kosovo, ``now is not the time for the celebratory tour I had
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was that his fre quently televised Kosovo appear
ances have earned McCain more media coverage than he could have
received on any campaign-kickoff tour, and that the crisis has
allowed him to demonstrate his strengths as a candidate: foreign
policy and national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's speech, a dozen television camera crews crowded
into the basement conference room where McCain gave his address. It
was the kind of media reception more familiar to the public appear
ance of heads of state rather than a candidate looking for an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Kosovo erupted, Mc Cain had been a critic of
Clinton's responses to foreign conflicts. The senator also had
accused the admin istration of allowing the nation's defenses to
slip.
</P>
<P>
   A recent news release by Mc Cain's presidential exploratory com
mittee had noted McCain's past criticism of Clinton's ``feckless
photo-op foreign policy'' and the administration's ``empty threats
in crisis after crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview, Mc Cain was asked by The Arizona
Republic which issues he expected would most attract voters to his
White House bid. ``National de fense'' was the first one on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tuesday's address had obvious political overtones, it
was not billed as a political campaign speech, and there was no
mention by McCain of his White House candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   A news release about the speech was issued by McCain's Senate
staff, not by the campaign office that quietly changed its name
Tues day from the ``John McCain for President Exploratory
Committee'' to ``McCain 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said his Kosovo thinking is driven by his
conscience and expertise, not by presidential politics. For that
reason, they said, the campaign will try to keep senatorial events
separate from cam paign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain acknowledged dur ing the address that his position
could hold political consequences because he will share in the
blame for American casualties. He has said that winning the war in
Kosovo must take precedence over avoiding the loss of lives, both
``theirs and ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather face that sad burden than hide from my con
science because I sought an advan tageous political position to
seek shelter behind,'' McCain said. &QL;

STARS, COYOTES TEST EACH OTHER OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Modano walked away with a black eye, and the Stars
and Phoenix Coyotes walked away with another reason to hate each
other.
</P>
<P>
   It was March 23 in Phoenix when Modano received a shiner and
seven stitches in his eyelid, courtesy of a hit from Coyotes winger
Jeremy Roenick that caused Roenick to be ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the differing opinions of how Modano was injured that
form the basis for a great conspiracy novel ... or at least a
physical rivalry that will continue at 7:30 tonight at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I don't know what to expect,'' Stars
captain Derian Hatcher said, shrugging. ``It could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way means that the Stars and Coyotes could play a
relatively clean game and respect each other professionally or they
could let subtle feelings of hate surface the first time one player
shoves another, and turn the game into a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   To compound matters, the teams are scheduled to turn around and
play again Saturday afternoon in Phoenix. That's not the kind of
scenario the Stars need to worry about as they try to get healthy
and hone their game for a first-round playoff series with Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have wrapped up the Presidents' Trophy and the top
seed through the playoffs. The Coyotes need one point in their
final three games to secure the fourth seed in the Western
Conference and home ice in the first round. So on that front,
there's little to play for. But here's a pertinent sidenote for the
Stars and their fans to consider: In a 3-0 loss to the Mighty Ducks
of Anaheim on Sunday, Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk wrestled down
Ducks winger Teemu Selanne after Selanne scored an empty-net goal.
That started a melee in which Tkachuk was ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets people know when you play us, it's going to be a
physical game,'' Roenick said proudly. ``Even if you win, you're
going to take a bunch of licks.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Stars prepared to ``take a bunch of licks'' even if they
get a victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go in worrying about bad stuff, bad stuff usually
happens,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We're looking at this
as a good game against a good team, and we're trying to get ready
for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitchcock and his players downplayed the rivalry
yesterday, their words three weeks ago were much stronger. A
sampling of the plot:
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, who had been getting knocked around by Hatcher and
Craig Ludwig in the first period, skated from 50 feet away to lay a
hit on Modano. The problem was that Modano was nowhere near the
puck. Roenick said he thought Modano, who had skated behind the net
and was obstructed from Roenick's view, had the puck on his stick.
So Roenick drove his shoulder, helmet or elbow into the side of the
head of the unsuspecting Modano, sending Modano sprawling across
the ice and forcing him to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick was handed a five-minute major penalty for boarding
(although Modano didn't hit the boards) and was ejected from the
game. The Stars scored on the power play en route to a 3-2 victory
_ and both teams hurled barbs at one another.
</P>
<P>
   Stars players Darryl Sydor and Joe Nieuwendyk called Roenick's
hit ``cheap'' and ``gutless.'' Guy Carbonneau said: ``It was a
cheap hit, but that's just how Roenick plays.'' Brett Hull called
it unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars asked for a suspension. The league declined to suspend
Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick answered the charges in his soft-spoken way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carbonneau is a \Rexpletive\R,'' Roenick said. ``Joe
\RNieuwendyk\S is a class guy, but I'm a physical player and he's
not. Hull makes comments about everything, even Russian politics.
And he's not a physical player, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line to all this, however, might be a challenge to
the Stars' physical toughness. The Stars haven't been a fighting
team since tough guy Shane Churla was traded in 1996. In fact,
they're downright civilized, averaging the third fewest penalty
minutes per game in the NHL at 12.8. That's down from 15.9 minutes
per game last season and way down from the free-swinging 23.3 they
put up in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Stars tough enough to fight back against an
unpredictable bunch of Coyotes, or would it be folly to tempt the
injury gods one week before the playoffs start?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock hinted that he will likely sit Modano in Phoenix,
where America West Arena is known to have some of the hardest glass
in the NHL and where Modano has been hurt in two of his past three
visits; he separated a shoulder there last season and missed 17
games. Hitchcock said he will play the line of Modano, Brett Hull
and Jere Lehtinen in ``two of the last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the replacement line is probably Brent Severyn,
Brian Skrudland and Jon Sim _ a trio full of punch. That's just in
case anyone worries about the Stars lacking toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good game against a good team,'' Hatcher said, trying
to throw meaning between the lines. ``I think it'll be good for
us.''

RAMBIS REMOVES FATIGUED HARPER FROM LAKERS LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ From the Los Angeles Lakers' ever-busy
Something New Every Day Dept. came this zinger Tuesday evening:
starting point guard Derek Harper benched in favor of Derek Fisher,
at least for Tuesday night's game. But for how much longer, not
even coach Kurt Rambis knows.
</P>
<P>
   It was a move that acknowledged the overuse of the 37-year-old
Harper, and the diminishing results of his heavy minutes. His
shooting percentage was a meager 28.6 percent over the previous
nine games, and he had just six assists in his past four games.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than run him into the ground, Rambis decided to cut
Harper's minutes and responsibility, hoping he'll be fresh for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that he's tired,'' Rambis said. ``Harp, when he came
here, he was supposed to be a 15-, 18-, 20-minute guy, max. But he
played so well in camp, played so well in the early part of the
year, he's getting 30 minutes. And I know how hard it is to
recover, especially when you're a guard, and playing the amount of
games we've played and in such a short period of time. It's just a
way to get his legs back fresh in time for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers trotted out their 12th starting lineup of the
season, and Fisher reclaimed the starting job he held for the first
nine games. Harper admitted fatigue was having an impact on his
game and said Rambis' decision made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking down the road,'' said Harper, who played a
season-low seven minutes. ``I have confidence in Tyronn (Lue) and
Fish to get it done. I mean, at 37 (years old), 16 years in the
league, I'm gonna take the rest....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitive person, and to say I welcome time off, I
won't go that far. I will support the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Rambis said he would keep Harper on the bench for the
rest of the regular season. But he wouldn't commit to that, or to
who would start in the playoffs, and didn't rule out giving rookie
Lue a start either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just gonna see how it goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who started the final 33 games last year, wants to stick
in the lineup this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so. It's been a crazy year, and so right now I'm just
geared to go out and do whatever the team needs me to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: The fever and sore throat that kept Glen Rice in
Los Angeles on Tuesday turned out to be a case of tonsillitis. With
the Lakers off for three days, the team hopes Rice will be ready to
play Saturday in Utah.

EDITORIAL: COSTS OF IGNORING A FINANCIAL MESS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, April 14:
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades ago, as the savings and loan crisis was
growing, the federal government tried to ignore it in the hope that
it would somehow go away. One part of that delaying strategy was to
sanction an accounting fiction allowing institutions that took over
sick thrifts to pretend they now had valuable assets. To do
otherwise would have meant closing down thrifts when Congress did
not want to appropriate the money needed to pay off depositors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989 it was clear that the ostrich approach had been a
disaster, and Congress legislated away the accounting fictions.
Unfortunately, it did so in a way that left the government open to
damage claims from thrifts that had used the fictional accounting
in making acquisitions but now were required to conform their
accounting to reality.
</P>
<P>
   That bill is falling due. The Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that
the thrifts could collect damages, and now in the first decision on
damages, Loren Smith, the chief judge of the United States Court of
Claims, has awarded $909 million to Glendale Federal Bank. The
ruling is a balanced one, giving Glendale Federal less than half of
the damages it sought, and should provide a road map for settling
other cases, of which more than 120 are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution of those cases is likely to boost the bill for
cleaning up the savings and loan mess, already at $480 billion,
above $500 billion. It would have been far less if the government
had acted earlier rather than played for time. If the financial
system ever gets into similar problems, that is the lesson that
should be remembered.

MALAYSIA'S OUSTED DEPUTY PREMIER FOUND GUILTY OF CORRUPTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Wednesday in lede cq.)  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Anwar Ibrahim, the ousted deputy prime
minister of Malaysia, was found guilty Wednesday on four counts of
corruption in a trial that has set off the greatest political
unrest this country has seen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Augustine Paul, sentenced Malaysia's most prominent
pro-reform leader to six years in prison on each of the four
charges. The sentences will run concurrently and begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guilty verdict was widely expected, the severe
sentence was not. As the verdict was being handed down, several
hundred riot policemen ringed the Moorish-style court building here
and a line of officers wielding rattan canes pushed back a crowd of
several hundred protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, mainly students, were holding placards that
said, ``The people are the judge,'' and were chanting
``Reformasi!'' _ or reform _ a word that has become a rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   In the moments before the verdict was announced, the crowd was
kept well away from the courthouse by the police, who were
reinforced by two water-canon trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's trial has galvanized Malaysia _ offering a daily drama
of lurid sexual charges that had never before been aired in this
predominantly Islamic country. From the start, Anwar treated the
trial less as a legal ritual than as a political spectacle.
Testifying in court, he aimed many of his comments at the galleries
in the back of the room, where the foreign news media sat.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, came to court every day
with one or two of their daughters. She, too, spoke regularly to
the media _ presenting evidence to exonerate her husband of the sex
charges or objecting to various court rulings. Ms. Wan Azizah, who
was trained in Ireland as an eye doctor, has since formed a
political party to challenge Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Anwar's trial has come to symbolize the personal
fallout of the regional economic crisis. Until last summer, when
Malaysia began feeling the effects of the downturn, Anwar and
Mahathir were close friends and steadfast political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, a 73-year-old physician, had groomed Anwar as his
successor. From Anwar's start as a fiery Muslim student activist,
he rose rapidly in the hierarchy of Mahathir's ruling party, the
United National Malay Organization. He eventually became deputy
party chairman and deputy prime minister _ and was entrusted with
the politically sensitive post of finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   It was as finance minister that Anwar finally came to grief with
his mentor. As the Asian financial crisis raged around Malaysia _
devastating the country's currency and reversing years of torrid
economic growth _ Anwar steadfastly kept Malaysia's markets open
and its interest rates high.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy made him popular with foreign leaders and the
International Monetary Fund who were advocating a similar remedy
for other crisis-torn Asian countries like Thailand and Indonesia.
But it angered Mahathir, who wanted to ease the pain on Malaysia's
14 million people by lowering interest rates and cordoning off the
country from the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate raged, the two men were fighting a backroom
political battle. Anwar began challenging Mahathir's leadership in
party meetings, saying the long-serving prime minister was not the
right leader for a time of crisis. At the same time, Malaysia's
police force had presented Mahathir with evidence of alleged
corruption and sex-related crimes by Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Mahathir dismissed the claims. But as the feud became
more bitter, he abruptly reversed course. On Sept. 1, Mahathir
announced that Malaysia would impose sweeping controls on its
currency and stock markets _ effectively scuttling Anwar's policy.
The following day, Mahathir ousted his deputy, saying he was unfit
to lead Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar responded by mobilizing a political movement against
Mahathir. Within two weeks, Anwar had drawn a crowd of 30,000 to
march through Kuala Lumpur, demanding the prime minister's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But before Anwar's movement could really catch fire, he was
arrested and charged with corruption and sex-related crimes.
Although the protests have continued sporadically, the movement
against Mahathir has largely run out of steam.

KNICKS TOP 76ERS, 91-72 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They played padlock defense on Allen Iverson, never
trailed and resembled a playoff team. But with every sparkling
development for the Knicks, there is an expensive toll.
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction of blowing the Philadelphia 76ers off the
Madison Square Garden floor, 91-72, on Tuesday night lasted as long
as it took Patrick Ewing to hobble from the court to the locker
room in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With his left Achilles' tendon nagging him again, Ewing is
questionable for Wednesday night's game against Washington. With 12
games left and the Knicks (21-17) in seventh place in the playoff
race, a familiar question enveloped the organization: will Ewing's
health be a factor in the post-season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can play,'' Ewing said of the game against the
Wizards. ``If it's sore, I'm not going to play. If not, I'll play.
They tell me it's going to take eight weeks of not doing anything
to be 100 percent. But I don't have eight weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a big-man burden to be shouldered, Kurt Thomas and
Marcus Camby showed they will be up to the challenge. On Tuesday
night, the forwards combined for 33 points, 12 rebounds and 3
blocked shots. Larry Johnson added 17 points, 6 rebounds and 4
assists, and Latrell Sprewell contributed 16 points on 5-of-12
shooting in 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who scored 19 in Sunday's victory over the Nets, changed
shots on the defensive end and gathered himself well each time he
rose to shoot. Thomas had 9 of his 18 points in the third quarter,
when the Knicks effectively put the game away by pushing an
18-point halftime lead to 29 midway through the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any time Ewing is hobbling, it's a bad sign. He missed
six straight games because of the tendinitis from March 11-18. The
Knicks were 4-2 without Ewing and are 7-7 since he returned from
the injury. He left the game with 3 minutes 10 seconds left in the
second quarter and did not return. Ewing was walking gingerly
upcourt for most of the second quarter and appeared to be in pain
soon after the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ewing disclosed the ailment had been bothering him
since Sunday. He said he planned to take anti-inflammatory
medication and described himself as ``day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing out and the Knicks coasting, you knew chants of ``We
want Herb!'' would be heard. The Garden zealots got Herb Williams
with 2:10 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccustomed to hearing his name called recently, it took the
40-year-old cult hero nearly a minute to finally discard his
warm-ups. With 11.1 seconds left, he garnered one of the loudest
ovations of the season by knocking down an 18-footer from the right
wing off a pretty pick-and-roll play with David Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   That shot climaxed a fairly impressive turnaround the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Williams played in a game came with his team
behind by 26 points. Since the Knicks collapsed in Charlotte and
hit their nadir last Wednesday, they have won three straight.
Despite all their dysfunction after 38 games, they found themselves
one and a half games out of fourth place in the conference entering
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Knicks had returned to respectability, Coach Jeff
Van Gundy said: ``No, because every time you think like that you
get off track. Because once you believe you've arrived, it starts
the way. Larry said something that was in the paper today that I
always say to him, `It can get bad in a hurry; it can get good in a
hurry.' And that's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the turnaround had to do with that old Knick staple of
defense. Iverson, who came into game leading the league in scoring
at 27.3 points a game, finished 4 of 16 from the field with 11
points and had 6 of 25 turnovers by the 76ers (19-18). Whether it
was Charlie Ward, Chris Childs or someone else doing the defending,
the Knicks made a concerted effort to keep Iverson in front of them
and contest nearly all of his shots. On Sunday, that same defense
throttled Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was one particular thing they did,'' Iverson
said. ``Don't get me wrong, they played good defense. But a lot of
it was me. I just made some turnovers, made some bad decisions and
I didn't make the shots I usually make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led, 48-30, at halftime, building on a 14-point lead
they had after one quarter. One sequence midway through the first
quarter illustrated New York's purpose. On one end, Ewing pinned a
shot by Iverson underneath the backboard. On the other end, four
Knicks touched the ball before Johnson knocked down a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   In a bustling and talky locker room afterward, Thomas said:
``We're not where we want to be yet, by any stretch of the
imagination. But we are a long way from where we were in
Charlotte.''

REPORTED MOVE DOWNTOWN DRAWS GIGGLES FROM DODGERS BRASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Los Angeles Dodgers officials Tuesday dismissed a
report on a possible move to a new ballpark adjacent to the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said the club
plans to move forward with a $40- to $50-million renovation of
Dodger Stadium. The original plan, made public last season, was to
spend more than $200 million on Dodger Stadium. Although that plan
has since been tailored, Graziano said it will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stadium-related issues are really a critical success factor
for ballclubs,'' Graziano said. ``We wouldn't make improvements to
Dodger Stadium if we thought (we were leaving).''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was at a fever pitch Tuesday after it was reported
the Fox Group, which owns the Dodgers, and the NFL held preliminary
discussions about the Dodgers moving to Exposition Park. The
baseball field would be on the site of the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   However, the suggestion of the Dodgers leaving Chavez Ravine
brought giggles from several team officials. The Dodgers have
played there since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will use private funding to construct luxury suites
at Dodger Stadium, expand the dugout club seating, add seats next
to the dugout, construct seats along the foul line and make
improvements to the Stadium Club.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from such ventures could bring the Dodgers an additional
$20 million a year, one club official said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $311 million sale of the Dodgers, the O'Malley
family also sold the Fox Group the Chavez Ravine land, which
Graziano pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is out there more so because of football,''
Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of obstacles a proposed Exposition Park
baseball stadium would face. The project would require a full
environmental impact report that could take up to three years to
complete, Coliseum Commission President Sheldon Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you are talking about lawsuits and construction and
you're talking six-seven years before they could move in,'' Sloan
said. ``And, I'm not sure what the state would do. I think that's a
hard deal to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas described it as an idea worth
considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we're adding something new to the area by
having another sports team,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``It's something
worth exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the NFL site selection committee are scheduled to be
in Los Angeles next week to review the plans for the Coliseum as
well as the Carson site being proposed by Michael Ovitz and further
discussions about the possibility are expected.
</P>
<P>
   But one official familiar with the discussions downplayed the
proposal and cast doubt on whether the Dodgers would agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a $300 million project, minimum,'' said the
official who asked not be identified. ``And, then what do they do
with Chavez Ravine? They'd try to sell it, but it's zoned for
agricultural use and that brings down what they could get for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the NFL and the Fox Group released separate statements
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past year, we have considered a number of possible
proposals to deal with the long-term needs of the Dodgers and
Dodger fans to enjoy a facility that is competitive with the best
of those in baseball today,'' the Dodgers/Fox statement said. ``One
such proposal ... involves relocating the team to a new stadium
located at Exposition Park. The proposal brought to us, one of many
we have seen, is too preliminary and non-specific for us to comment
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL added its own statement of vagueness. ``We have had a
number of recent discussions with Los Angeles civic and business
leaders, including Fox executives, about various NFL stadium
solutions in the Los Angeles area,'' the NFL statement said. ``We
will have additional comments after that committee meeting (in Los
Angeles) next week.''

WNBA LABOR TALKS COULD REVEAL ICICLE AT THE CORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Women's professional basketball is still alive in the
United States, but this is what you might call a mixed blessing, at
least from a political point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has the muscle and resources to will women's
professional basketball to succeed. The NBA, which runs the WNBA,
has the slick arenas and a mighty marketing arm and a standard for
success that has been the envy of every pro sports league in the
free world.
</P>
<P>
   But the opposing forces of darkness and light lurk there in the
same business suit, namely, the one worn by NBA commissioner David
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   He wants a women's league, but at what cost? The WNBA says it is
committed to the women's game, but how much, under what
circumstances and why?
</P>
<P>
   We may soon find out.
</P>
<P>
   Just months after an 11th-hour deal was brokered to end the
silly NBA lockout, the WNBA and its newly formed players union are
in heated discussions themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Thursday, the two sides have run past at least two
deadlines, trying to agree on a collective bargaining agreement. No
progress was reported Tuesdayu. Meanwhile, a predraft camp is
supposed to take place Thursday in Chicago, the draft is April 27
and the league is due to open its third season June 10.
</P>
<P>
   While the two sides have agreed on year-round insurance, the
WNBA is offering players a raise in league minimum salary, from
$15,000 to $20,000 for the three-month season. The WNBA players
union is seeking $45,000, down from an original demand for $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The players contend that $45,000 per player would amount to
about $2 million in total player payroll _ less than the average
salary of one player in the NBA and about $20 million less than
what Minnesota's Kevin Garnett makes.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is how many former ABL players will be allowed to
try out for the WNBA. The league would like for at least 52 of the
90 ABL players to get a shot. The union, showing extreme
shortsightedness for the future of the product, wants only two ABL
roster spots per WNBA team.
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop to these now prolonged negotiations is the fact
that the WNBA is the only game for women. With the demise of the
American Basketball League in December, the WNBA sits in the
glorious catbird seat.
</P>
<P>
   With no rival league, Stern (through his hand-picked WNBA
president Val Ackerman) can indeed hard-line his employees all the
way to a lockout. With no ABL, but with ABL players champing at the
bit to hook up with their next pro team, Stern can hold out longer
than the current crop of WNBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to adhere to those demands. There's no other
competition. He's got that much more leverage,'' one former ABL
player said Tuesday as she waited for word about her fate.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this a moment of truth for women's hoops.
</P>
<P>
   To what end does the NBA's chief operating officer really want
his women's league to succeed? For what purpose does this
makeshift, summertime venture exist?
</P>
<P>
   Is it to fill NBA arenas?
</P>
<P>
   Is it to keep NBA employees such as trainers, ticket sellers,
promoters and marketing geniuses busy 12 months of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Is it to help further brand the NBA logo into the impressionable
psyches of yet another demographic category, such as young girls
and their parents?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure, the WNBA is not in business because it views
itself as the champion for female sports role models and equal
opportunity. That ground was staked out by the ABL, grass-roots
enterprise that billed itself as a players' league.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for anyone who respected the ABL's business model
and social agenda, the nine-team league could not compete against
the monopolistic NBA.
</P>
<P>
   When the league shut down for good in December, ABL commissioner
Gary Calvelli said the ABL had ``offered millions of dollars to the
TV networks for air time but we couldn't obtain adequate coverage.
During the NBA lockout, the ABL (could not) buy air time.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvelli and ABL officials have discussed filing an antitrust
suit against the WNBA because the ABL found several national
sponsors and TV executives were unwilling to do business with the
ABL for fear of losing their tie-ins with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really convinced that the ABL would still be here if
we could have gotten some of the national sponsorship and
opportunities that the WNBA got because of their merchandizing and
TV tie-ins with the NBA,'' former Reign coach Tammy Holder said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ABL employees, Holder is eager to see more positive
things happen for the women's game and questions the timing of this
standoff between players and management in the sole existing
women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally are having our dreams realized, being able to be
role models and have opportunities to play and coach. It just seems
like this might be a situation where you take one step forward and
three steps back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on Stern and his WNBA now. It's bad enough one
spunky little league already has been crushed. This is no time for
Stern to act like a miserly, monopolistic crusher of spirit and
ambition.

RED SOX BEAT WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Olde Towne wants to celebrate the fast start of the Red
Sox, who shut out the Chicago White Sox, 6-0, in Tuesday's home
opener to run their record to 6-1, Bret Saberhagen says party on.
Just don't expect the team to join in yet.
</P>
<P>
   Let there be songs in praise of Saberhagen, who ignored
48-degree temperatures and gusts of 35 miles an hour to deliver
another turn-back-the-clock performance with a suddenly pain-free
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Trumpet flourishes for newcomer Jose Offerman, who gave the Sox
their first lead in Fenway Park by tripling to the triangle in his
second at-bat in home whites, driving in two runs and scoring a
third on Darren Lewis's single in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   A snappy guitar riff for Derek Lowe, who tightroped his way out
of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A clash of cymbals for Troy O'Leary, whose three-run home run
into the White Sox bullpen sealed the outcome in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Even a good-natured waaaahh-waaaahh for John Valentin, who
passed Lewis on the basepaths to kill a first-inning uprising, one
of those daffy did-that-really-just-happen? moments you expect in a
T-ball game, not on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   But Saberhagen, for one, was happy that in the winners'
clubhouse Tuesday afternoon, there was no music blaring. Only
cartoons on the big-screen TV.
</P>
<P>
   Strike up the band in October, not for an April win against the
youngest team in the American League, one that the day before being
blanked by the Red Sox lost an exhibition to its Triple A team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just go out and play ball,'' said Saberhagen, who gave the
White Sox just six singles in 6 2/3 innings and departed to a
standing ovation from a sellout crowd of 31,874 that broke through
the day's chill and left him feeling warm and fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be really tough for somebody who didn't watch the
game to come into our clubhouse after a game and tell if we won or
lost. It's good we don't have music in the clubhouse. With music
playing, everybody gets too excited when you win. Then when you
lose and don't have the music on, there's too much emphasis on one
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis here, one week into a season that represents the
team's best start in 44 years, was plain for everyone to see,
assuming they could see through the holes in their ski masks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm happy and pleased that we're 6-1,'' said old hand
Valentin, ``but you've got to put it in perspective. We've played
good ball, and we've gotten good pitching. That's the reason we're
6-1.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in seven games, Sox pitchers limited the
opposition to three runs or fewer. All of the starters save Pat
Rapp have gone at least six innings, the measure of a quality
start, and staff ace Pedro Martinez and Saberhagen already have two
wins apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who threw six shutout innings in 76-degree
temperatures in Kansas City last Wednesday, had some trouble
weathering the first two innings. He loaded the bases in the first,
walking two batters, including Magglio Ordonez on four pitches,
before striking out Paul Konerko on the next three.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, he gave up one-out singles to Brook Fordyce and
McKay Christensen, before catching two more hitters, Ray Durham and
Mike Caruso, looking at third strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scatter-brained, my mechanics were so off, I didn't
know where the ball was going,'' Saberhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, he was locked in, allowing just three more hits,
two of them bloopers, before being replaced by Lowe with two out in
the seventh after Caruso's floater to center dropped in for a
single.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, already grumbling because manager Jimy Williams
lifted Saberhagen with a 3-0 lead after a yield of 102 pitches,
threatened to turn mutinous when White Sox strongman Frank Thomas
dropped a ground-rule double just inside the right-field foul line
and Lowe walked Jeff Liefer on four pitches to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The murmurs turned louder and darker when Lowe, who had
surrendered home runs in each of his previous two outings, went to
a 3-and-0 count on the next hitter, Ordonez. A mock cheer greeted
Lowe when he finally threw a strike, but to the relief of both the
pitcher and his critics, Ordonez rapped a one-hopper back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not believe how happy I was when the guy hit the
ground ball back to me,'' Lowe said. ``After those seven straight
(balls) and those boos, I was looking for something positive to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After a winter in which the mere mention of his name caused
negative vibes, Offerman continued his rousing rebuttal. He
launched his third triple in seven games (and 15th hit overall)
after White Sox starter Jim Parque did the unpardonable, walking
the bottom feeders in the Sox order, Jason Varitek and Donnie
Sadler, with two out and nobody on.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, greeted with warm applause during pregame
introductions, received his first Fenway Park standing O after his
hit rattled around the 420-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans like him,'' said general manager Dan Duquette, whose
own name had picked up some mud after he lavished a $26 million
contract on Offerman. ``He's an exciting player, a clutch player.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's hit not only gave the Sox the lead, it also allowed
Valentin to exhale after his base-running boner in the first
inning, when the Sox had the bases loaded with one out and came
away with nothing. Valentin, who had singled after Lewis's base
hit, was on second after Parque walked Mike Stanley on a full
count.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary whacked Parque's first pitch on a line to left. On a day
when the wind wasn't howling from left field, it might have been
off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis remained a couple steps off the third-base bag, preparing
to tag and score on what should have been a routine sacrifice fly.
Routine, that is, until Valentin took the turn like Jeff Gordon
hugging the curve at Talladega and chugged past a shocked Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience,'' Valentin said, mocking his own brain lock.
``When I saw it come off the bat, I said, `There's no way this is
catchable.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Question: Did you know you had passed Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Question: And what thought ran through your mind at that
instant?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Have you ever passed a base runner before, or even
passed on the turnpike?
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: Nope. I usually do the speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Valentin, who walked ahead of Stanley, was in no
danger of getting a speeding ticket. All he had to do was jog when
O'Leary crushed an 0-and-2 pitch from lefthanded reliever Bryan
Ward over the new advertising signs on the visitors' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   New Boston reliever Mark Guthrie, who lived in Scituate until he
was 11, worked a 1-2-3 ninth, and the Fenway organ sang out the
news of another Sox win. It'll be the White Sox here again
Thursday, with Martinez bidding for win No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good pitching staff,'' said Pedro's older brother,
Ramon, who made his first appearance in a Red Sox uniform Tuesday
during introductions, though he is still rehabilitating his
surgically repaired right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get 100 percent,'' he said, ``I can help this team a lot.
If they play the same way they've been playing, they have a chance
to win a lot, like they did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, the Sox hoping to get help from a pitcher with a blown
shoulder. Who comes up with these ideas?
</P>
<P>
   That's one question nobody thought to ask Saberhagen.

L.A. SCHOOL BOARD CONTESTS UNDECIDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Story will be updated with later returns.) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The fate of Mayor Richard Riordan's bold $2
million campaign to elect a reform-minded Board of Education
majority remained undecided Tuesday evening, with most races too
close to call in early returns.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's slate -- Caprice Young, Genethia Hayes, Mike Lansing
and incumbent David Tokofsky -- hoped to turn around America's
second largest school district after years of poor student test
scores and administrative scandals. Riordan and his candidates
often framed the election as no less than an attempt to save an
entire generation of Los Angeles children.
</P>
<P>
   Young, Hayes and Lansing hoped to knock off incumbents Jeff
Horton, Barbara Boudreaux and George Kiriyama, respectively, while
Tokofsky faced a challenge from Yolie Flores Aguilar.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of local educational reform said even having one or
two new members elected to the board could help turn around the
district by demonstrating to other board members the public's
determination for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if only one new member comes in, there will have been
lessons learned,'' said Maria Casillas, director of the Los Angeles
Annenberg Metropolitan Project, which funds reform efforts in
schools. ``If you have a whole slate of new people come in, that
will send a really big message.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a year of mounting calls for reform at the
700,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District. While
Riordan's attack on the school board was the most visible and
personal -- he has called the current board evil and inept -- other
groups weighed in with their own plans for change.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence shaped the race, as incumbents and challengers
alike rushed to declare themselves reformers. And the mayor's money
turned what used to be little-noticed, incumbent-friendly elections
dominated by cash from teacher and administrator unions into
bruising political fights.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a set platform from the mayor, Riordan's hand-picked
candidates mostly adopted recommendations made by a committee of
prominent civic leaders led by Harold M. Williams, former head of
the Getty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, so great was the pressure for reform that all but one
of the incumbents targeted for removal also signed on to the
Williams plan, which calls for the school board to set overall
policies and hold Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and other
administrators accountable for implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, first step, mission accomplished,'' Williams said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Committee on Effective School Governance was widely
viewed as being allied with Riordan, it did not endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the committee would make sure those candidates who
pledged to implement the plan do not forget their promises after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either as friends or as watchdogs, we will be there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While both incumbents and challengers vowed to work for reform,
they split sharply over other issues, including Riordan's
involvement in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a tough challenge in south-central Los Angeles, Boudreaux
said Riordan's choice of another African-American woman to unseat
her amounted to ``plantation politics.'' She fought back by lining
up endorsements from many of the city's African-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But challenger Hayes, head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference's Los Angeles chapter, defended her independence, saying
Riordan backed her only well after she had decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   In board district 5, which stretches from the northeast San
Fernando Valley to East Los Angeles, Tokofsky squared off against a
candidate backed by school board President Victoria Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar sought to neutralize Riordan's endorsement of Tokofsky
by saying her opponent was guilty of the same micromanaging of the
district staff that he had pledged to end. Tokofsky responded by
saying he and Riordan shared both an emphasis on the fundamentals
of education and a determination to root out bureaucratic
inefficiency and waste.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, whose district includes Hollywood and North Hollywood,
came under fire from challenger Young for his support of the
Belmont Learning Complex project, a half-finished downtown high
school already considered the state's most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   He fought back by pointing to his record of supporting reform
within the district -- specifically the drive to end the automatic
promotion of poorly performing students -- and emphasizing Young's
lack of education experience.
</P>
<P>
   And in a district connecting Watts and San Pedro, Riordan
candidate Lansing ran on a platform of focusing on poor academic
performance, while incumbent Kiriyama insisted that the district
already had turned the tide, as shown by a slight improvement in
test scores.

BOND FOR L.A. POLICE, FIRE UPGRADES FALLING SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Will be updated with later results.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Backed with unprecedented City Hall guarantees to
deliver on promises, a $744 million bond issue for police and fire
facilities lagged behind the needed two-thirds majority in early
returns Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the City Council and top bureaucrats
publicly pledged to spend Proposition 1 funds as set out in the
bond measure -- a step necessitated by the city's failure to
deliver on bond issue promises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan campaigned vigorously across the city, particularly in
the suburban San Fernando Valley, lending his personal credibility
to the measure to try to win the two-thirds voter support needed
for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, however, Riordan refused to speculate
on what the city would do to build the needed facilities if the
measure failed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Riordan and other proponents faced was voter
skepticism that the city would be able to accomplish what it was
proposing in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overcome that concern the measure included two
committees -- one of city officials and one of private citizens
with expertise in construction -- to oversee the work. Of the
private committee, two members would come from the San Fernando
Valley northwest of downtown, which never got a police station
promised in an earlier bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   There was no active campaign against the measure although the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association filed a ballot argument against
it and a group involved in San Fernando Valley secession efforts,
calling itself No Bonds Now, held two news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of opponents complained about the size of the
measure, and No Bonds Now also questioned the timing of the measure
with the prospect of the Valley seceding from the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, city officials did not help themselves in winning voter
support when the City Clerk's Office omitted from the sample ballot
a list spelling out which projects would be built. The city was
forced to send out a supplemental mailing at a cost of $344,000 to
make good on Riordan's pledge to include the itemization in the
sample ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, two weeks before the election, the Los Angeles Fire
Department sent out a strongly worded bill for $13 to hillside
residents to pay for a brush clearance program. Because of
dissatisfaction with the warning letter, the City Council voted to
suspend the brush-clearance inspection fee.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and other supporters defended the bond issue as a way to
replace aging and damaged facilities throughout the city. Also, the
mayor argued that the facilities would be needed even if the San
Fernando Valley does secede.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious plan calls for the replacement of the Parker
Center police headquarters with a new 300,000-square-foot building
on the same site; construction of four replacement police stations
including the West Valley station; two new police stations
including one in the North Valley; 17 new fire stations and a new
Fire Department air operations facility in Van Nuys; and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new fire stations, there would be regional stations built
in Arleta, Northridge and Woodland Hills and standard stations
built in Encino, Studio City and Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was developed by two task forces analyzing future
public safety needs. Those panels envision the bond measure as the
first of three or four bond proposals over the next 20 years to
build needed police and fire seceding.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR COACHES, INDULGENCE IS A BAD RECIPE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The psychiatrist called the hotel room 10 minutes
after Larry Brown finished talking about Allen Iverson on sports
talk radio Tuesday afternoon. He was offering a personality quiz
for Brown so he might then determine the best approach to take with
his young star.
</P>
<P>
   Brown took his number, thanked him, hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept it,'' said Brown, never knowing when the next Iverson
crisis would come, where he might have to turn.
</P>
<P>
   He never knows what Iverson will do to astound, or confound.
Many nights, Iverson is truly The Answer. At any other moment, a
riddle. The spindly guard with the propulsion in his calves kept
trying to dribble behind his back last night, through double-teams,
when there was no place to go. He kept losing the ball, the
Philadelphia 76ers fell into a hole, never climbed out.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, who averages 27 points a game, scored 11 and summed up
the experience with an air-ball free throw. The 76ers lost the
game, 91-72, at Madison Square Garden and more playoff ground to
the suddenly resurgent Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of riddles and answers, the Knicks won their third
straight, convincingly, with no help from a game but sore-footed
Patrick Ewing. Attention, defenders of Ewing: This is no knock at
the proud center, but there was more evidence from a multitude of
Knicks to suggest this team is better off when its guards and
forwards drive the ball, when Ewing gets most of his shots in the
flow, spotting up for jump shots, not from his longtime home in the
post. That's how they started this 180-degree turnaround in Atlanta
last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming so obvious, even William Goldman will figure it
out. As he goes on from here, as the games get bigger, Jeff Van
Gundy's brain twister will be balancing Ewing's in-and-out presence
with the rest of the cast. If Ewing gets healthy, Van Gundy will
have to say things his franchise player has never wished to hear.
Then we will find out how much Ewing really supports his coach, and
if he, at 36, is 13 years more mature than his distant Georgetown
cousin, who leads the league in scoring and swearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear him comment that people don't want to see him do well
_ the media, the league,'' Brown said of Iverson. ``That's baloney.
I think people in the league really want him to succeed.'' The
veteran coach is pushing 60, and he did not take the 76ers' job to
promote Iverson like some soulless shoe company. When he talks
about his shooting point guard, he sounds more like his
tough-talking guidance counselor than his coach.
</P>
<P>
   Brown tries not to forget that Iverson has already come a long
way, and dragged his team of role players with him, into playoff
contention, a mini-miracle based on Tuesday night. He remembers
that too many of the young and gifted come bounding into the pros,
onto bad teams, as Ewing did 14 years ago. The chances are greater
now than ever, Brown said, that they will remain rooted in the
cycle of self-importance until it becomes their personal prison and
there is no escape, and no chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson is a long way from there, but every time he curses his
coach for having the audacity to remove him from the game, or
whatever he interprets as an unproductive show of disrespect, he
most surely takes one step closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've taken Allen out since I've been here, I've had
the same response,'' Brown said. ``Is it easy to take? No. I
understand he just wants to play, but he doesn't understand how it
affects his teammates or me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a season of dramatic improvement, the 76ers are
combustible at the core. Brown, the Dean Smith disciple, knows
Iverson has been indulged everywhere, even at Georgetown. ``I
watched him play there, and that wasn't the way John Thompson
coaches,'' Brown said. Thompson didn't handle Iverson the way he
did Ewing, but then, as Brown said, ``He only had Allen for two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing was Iverson's age, he rebelled against his coach,
Hubie Brown. When he was supposedly all grown up, he tuned out Don
Nelson, the only other coach who came along and tried to rearrange
the furniture in the Knicks' predictable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and Iverson are, of course, as different in style and
personality as they are in size. Ewing never moved with a posse,
never embarrassed the Knicks, on the court or off. But as he limps
toward the finish of his 14th season, he may have to admit what it
is that is so hard for one who has been the center of his universe
for so many years. &QL;

year. Yet today, skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy are having second thoughts.
Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996, capped by a
surge in the second half of last year, after eight years of
economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past upward
swings in productivity typically occurred early in a recovery as
economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased hiring, it
slowed again. But something seems fundamentally different this

bamboo steamer. Its central feature is a very undessert-like
display of three soft wonton envelopes, each containing a whole
kumquat and a small puddle of molten Nutella. The thing is awful.
But in Paris, it may also be the wave of the future. Fusion has
come to France, and it feels funny. By William Grimes.

   FRANCE-BISTROS (Paris) _ For generations bistros have been the
soul of Paris, casual neighborhood restaurants where regulars drop
in for local gossip and a reassuringly familiar meal. Almost as
important as the food is the setting, usually small, intimate and
aglow with stained or painted wood, etched glass and mirrors,
bric-a-brac, prints and posters. Lately there is a boom in bistros
that serve traditionally lusty cuisine at prices ranging from $20
to $100 for a complete meal for one, wine included. The concept is
so popular that some now require reservations as long as three
weeks ahead, which really compromises the spontaneous bistro
spirit. By Mimi Sheraton.

   RAW-EGGS (New York) _ Nothing unusual about the egg yolk staring
up at me from a plate of tagliatelle at Babbo one night last week.
Except that the egg was raw. Totally uncooked. Cold. This was a
little disconcerting at first, but, once mixed in with the buttery
pasta and chunks of cured pork, the egg and the dish warmed up into
an irresistible indulgence, with an aftertaste of danger. Because
raw eggs can kill you. Or so we have been told. By Rick Marin.

BOND FOR L.A. POLICE, FIRE UPGRADES FALLING SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Contains updated information. Will likely be updated

BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Backed with unprecedented City Hall guarantees to
deliver on promises, a $744 million bond issue for police and fire
facilities appeared to be coming up short of the two-thirds
majority needed in Tuesday's election.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the City Council and top bureaucrats
publicly pledged to spend Proposition 1 funds as set out in the
bond measure -- a step necessitated by the city's failure to
deliver on bond issue promises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he was disappointed in the outcome and had not yet
determined what to do next to meet the city's needs for more police
and fire facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the safeguards we had included in the measure would
convince voters,'' Riordan said. ``It would have helped us respond
more quickly to victims of serious accidents, heart attacks or
other emergencies. We will have to look at what we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan had campaigned vigorously across the city, particularly
in the suburban San Fernando Valley northwest of downtown, lending
his personal credibility to the measure to try to win the
two-thirds voter support needed for passage. It was too early to
tell on Tuesday where the main opposition to the proposal came
from.
</P>
<P>
   The bond measure would cost the owner of a $160,000 home about
$32.50 a year in additional property taxes over 25 years, city
officials had estimated. It was designed to be the first of a
four-part, $2 billion plan to upgrade police and fire facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Riordan and other proponents faced was voter
skepticism that the city would be able to accomplish what it was
proposing in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overcome that concern the measure included two
committees -- one of city officials and one of private citizens
with expertise in construction -- to oversee the work. Of the
private committee, two members would come from the San Fernando
Valley, which never got a police station promised in an earlier
bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   There was no active campaign against the measure although the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association filed a ballot argument against
it and a group involved in San Fernando Valley secession efforts,
calling itself No Bonds Now, held two news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of opponents complained about the size of the
measure, and No Bonds Now also questioned the timing of the measure
with the prospect of the Valley seceding from the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, city officials did not help themselves in winning voter
support when the City Clerk's Office omitted from the sample ballot
a list spelling out which projects would be built. The city was
forced to send out a supplemental mailing at a cost of $344,000 to
make good on Riordan's pledge to include the itemization in the
sample ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, two weeks before the election, the Los Angeles Fire
Department sent out a strongly worded bill for $13 to hillside
residents to pay for a brush clearance program. Because of
dissatisfaction with the warning letter, the City Council voted to
suspend the brush-clearance inspection fee.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and other supporters defended the bond issue as a way to
replace aging and damaged facilities throughout the city. Also, the
mayor argued that the facilities would be needed even if the San
Fernando Valley does secede.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious plan calls for the replacement of the Parker
Center police headquarters with a new 300,000-square-foot building
on the same site; construction of four replacement police stations
including the West Valley station; two new police stations
including one in the North Valley; 17 new fire stations and a new
Fire Department air operations facility in Van Nuys; and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new fire stations, there would be regional stations built
in Arleta, Northridge and Woodland Hills and standard stations
built in Encino, Studio City and Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was developed by two task forces analyzing future
public safety needs. Those panels envision the bond measure as the
first of three or four bond proposals over the next 20 years to
build needed police and fire seceding.

L.A. MAYOR STILL HOPEFUL HIS CANDIDATES WILL WIN SCHOOL BOARD
SEATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Contains updated information. Will likely be updated
again.) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- One of Mayor Richard Riordan's hand-picked school
board candidates, IBM executive Caprice Young, seized a strong lead
over incumbent Jeff Horton Tuesday evening but the rest of the
mayor's reform slate was locked in tight races.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky, the only incumbent backed by
Riordan in his bid to elect a new board majority, was in virtual
dead heat with challenger Yolie Flores Aguilar. Incumbent Barbara
Boudreaux was outpacing her Riordan-backed opponent in a close race
but faced a possible runoff. Riordan-backed candidate Mike Lansing
held a slight lead over incumbent George Kiriyama.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, who pumped $2 million into the race, said he was
confident his entire slate would win either in Tuesday's election
or in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the outcome, the fact that education is now on
the public's radar screen is a win for our city,'' Riordan said.
``I urge all Angelenos, whether they have children in schools or
not, to join me in making sure the next school board is
accountable, responsible and focused on shaking up the
dysfunctional system of education.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's slate -- Young, Tokofsky, Genethia Hayes and Lansing
-- hoped to turn around America's second largest school district
after years of poor student test scores and administrative
scandals. Riordan and his candidates often framed the election as
no less than an attempt to save an entire generation of Los Angeles
children.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of local educational reform said even having one or
two new members elected to the board could help turn around the
district by demonstrating to other board members the public's
determination for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if only one new member comes in, there will have been
lessons learned,'' said Maria Casillas, director of the Los Angeles
Annenberg Metropolitan Project, which funds reform efforts in
schools. ``If you have a whole slate of new people come in, that
will send a really big message.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a year of mounting calls for reform at the
700,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District. While
Riordan's attack on the school board was the most visible and
personal -- he has called the current board evil and inept -- other
groups weighed in with their own plans for change.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence shaped the race, as incumbents and challengers
alike rushed to declare themselves reformers. And the mayor's money
turned what used to be little-noticed, incumbent-friendly elections
dominated by cash from teacher and administrator unions into
bruising political fights.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a set platform from the mayor, Riordan's hand-picked
candidates mostly adopted recommendations made by a committee of
prominent civic leaders led by Harold M. Williams, former head of
the Getty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, so great was the pressure for reform that all but one
of the incumbents targeted for removal also signed on to the
Williams plan, which calls for the school board to set overall
policies and hold Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and other
administrators accountable for implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, first step, mission accomplished,'' Williams said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Committee on Effective School Governance was widely
viewed as being allied with Riordan, it did not endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the committee would make sure those candidates who
pledged to implement the plan do not forget their promises after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either as friends or as watchdogs, we will be there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While both incumbents and challengers vowed to work for reform,
they split sharply over other issues, including Riordan's
involvement in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a tough challenge in south-central Los Angeles, Boudreaux
said Riordan's choice of another African-American woman to unseat
her amounted to ``plantation politics.'' She fought back by lining
up endorsements from many of the city's African-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But challenger Hayes, head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference's Los Angeles chapter, defended her independence, saying
Riordan backed her only well after she had decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   In board district 5, which stretches from the northeast San
Fernando Valley to East Los Angeles, Tokofsky squared off against
Aguilar, who was backed by school board President Victoria Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar sought to neutralize Riordan's endorsement of Tokofsky
by saying her opponent was guilty of the same micromanaging of the
district staff that he had pledged to end. Tokofsky responded by
saying he and Riordan shared both an emphasis on the fundamentals
of education and a determination to root out bureaucratic
inefficiency and waste.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, whose district includes Hollywood and North Hollywood,
came under fire from challenger Young for his support of the
Belmont Learning Complex project, a half-finished downtown high
school already considered the state's most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   He fought back by pointing to his record of supporting reform
within the district -- specifically the drive to end the automatic
promotion of poorly performing students -- and emphasizing Young's
lack of education experience.
</P>
<P>
   And in a district connecting Watts and San Pedro, Riordan
candidate Lansing ran on a platform of focusing on poor academic
performance, while incumbent Kiriyama insisted that the district
already had turned the tide, as shown by a slight improvement in
test scores.

   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Unpack the defibrillator, prepare the
artificial respirator. The patient is slipping into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' as NBA championship favorites? Toss that
notion on a gurney and wheel it into the ER. Just don't expect a
medical miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Their ace shooter ill, their rebounding specialist bowing out
claiming elbow pain, the team's pulse now just a faint thudding
sound, the Lakers are crawling toward the finish line of this
regular season with barely a wheezing breath left in them.
</P>
<P>
   And with Kevorkian behind bars, no one's left to pull the plug
and end suffering like the Lakers endured Tuesday night in a 113-86
drubbing by the Portland Trail Blazers at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers on life support? Even Shaquille O'Neal seemed to
indicate as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get some heart,'' O'Neal said in the wake of the
Lakers' worst defeat of the season. ``I'm very disappointed. Guys
on this team have gotta step up to the challenge.... Forget the
plays and all that stuff. We need to bring heart to every game.''
</P>
<P>
   At the least, they need to bring players to every game,
increasingly a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One starter, Glen Rice, has tonsillitis. Another, Dennis Rodman,
developed another case of elbow soreness and could not or would not
play the second half. Derek Harper, the 37-year-old starting point
guard, was benched to protect him from overuse and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   What was left was a disjointed team that made 39 percent of its
shots, scored a season-low 15 points in the second quarter, was
outrebounded by seven and allowed 113 points _ a regulation-game
season-high _ for the second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neal's 24 points, Kobe Bryant's 20 (on 7-of-19 shooting)
and 17 from Rick Fox off the bench, the Lakers had nothing. And
nothing resembling defense, as they allowed Portland to shoot 56.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out with any fire or intensity,'' coach Kurt
Rambis said. ``They showed us how far we have to grow and how far
we have to develop as a ballclub _ how hard we have to play and how
intense we have to play in order to match up against the best team
in the league, or one of the best teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29-8, the Trail Blazers certainly look like the best, their
recent loss to the Clippers notwithstanding. The Lakers (25-15)
looked utterly outclassed.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Blazers scored in double figures in a game Portland led
from wire to wire by as many as 28 points. So deep are the Blazers,
Portland's bench outscored the Lakers' starters 63-51. Damon
Stoudamire and Isaiah Rider scored a team-high 16 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at full strength,'' Robert Horry said. ``Glen was
out and then Rodman was unavailable, and it really wasn't a true
Laker performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But championship teams are supposed to overcome such obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't, not us,'' Horry said. ``Our bench isn't as deep as
it needs to be. Look at Portland _ they've got a whole second five
they can put in.... We need everybody healthy and everybody on this
team to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Rodman, who grabbed four rebounds in 13 minutes. He
was benched toward the end of the first half, then told team
trainer Gary Vitti his left elbow was in pain. It's the fourth time
in five weeks that Rodman has refused to re-enter a game, citing
the elbow or muscle tightness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said his elbow was bothering him and I'll take it for
that,'' Rambis said. Or was Rodman simply upset over being benched
in the first half? ``That's a question you'd have to ask Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman didn't speak with reporters but told TNT he expected the
media to ``make me look bad'' over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Horry said the injury is real and that Rodman has been
complaining about the elbow ``the last three or four games.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering Rodman's track record, few others seemed as
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was hurt,'' O'Neal said. ``I hope he really was
hurt. Because if he really wasn't hurt, I need him out there with
me.''

ANGELS' OFFENSE TAKES NIGHT OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The Anaheim Angels arrived in Oakland late Monday
feeling good about themselves after beating the Texas Rangers in
three of four games. But their mood changed Tuesday night after
discovering they left their bats behind in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there was a transit problem with their equipment
on the flight from Dallas. It only seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 34 runs on 57 hits in four games against the
Rangers, the Angels were reduced to mere mortals in a 3-2 loss to
the Oakland A's before 5,377 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Mike Oquist, called up from Triple-A Vancouver to
make Tuesday's start, made the Angels hitters look like
minor-leaguers. Oquist (1-0) allowed one run and four hits in six
innings, and got relief help from 41-year-old Doug Jones and Billy
Taylor, who made his first save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had one last chance to tie in the ninth inning, but
pinch-runner Orlando Palmeiro was thrown out trying to steal second
when the A's called for a pitchout. It was the first out of the
inning, but it took the steam out of a potential rally.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks picked up where he left off from his
first start _ giving up runs. He gave up at least one run in each
of his four innings on April 8 against the Indians, and started
Tuesday by allowing three in the first inning. Matt Stairs had the
big hit, a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks made 40 pitches in the first inning alone, but settled
down after that, keeping the A's from scoring again before leaving
after six innings. He made 134 pitches, giving up the three runs
(two earned) and seven hits with seven strikeouts and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   He had to wiggle his way out of trouble in both the third and
fifth innings. In the third, the A's had runners on first and third
with one out when Eric Chavez popped to short and Mike Macfarlane
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the A's had runners on first and second with one
out when Ben Grieve struck out into a double play, Stairs being
thrown out trying to steal third.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the only offense the Angels could muster against
Oquist came thanks to a fly ball lost in the lights. Todd Greene
led off the third inning with a high fly to left field, but Grieve
couldn't find it and in fell in for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Two groundouts later and Greene scored to cut the A's lead to
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a good chance to tie the game in the fourth
inning when a hot Troy Glaus (hitting .481 going into the game)
came to the plate with runners on second and third with two out. On
a 3-2 pitch, Glaus grounded out to third.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus got another chance in the eighth inning with runners on
first and second and two out, and doubled in one run. However,
third base coach Larry Bowa held up Garret Anderson at third, and
the next batter _ Greene _ flied out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense was a far cry from the 20-hit attack one day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody tells me they can explain this game to me, I'll
listen,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``It's a strange
sport, it's why it's so great. Every game is different.

<P>
   Glendale's ``Rocket Boy'' has landed safely back in school.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising vote Tuesday night, the Deer Valley Unified
School District Governing Board, meeting in a closed session, voted
to allow David Silverstein to return to Desert Sky Middle School on
April 26.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began about six weeks ago when David, 13, was
suspended for bringing a homemade rocket to school. It ended with
hugs and tears for David, his father, Ed, and his mother, Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just looked at me and started to, well, he's kind of a
quiet kid, and he gave his little smile,'' Ed Silverstein said. ``I
walked over and hugged him and could feel the feeling of happy
tears forming in both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials can't discuss what transpires in closed
sessions. The vote count wasn't released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little bit satisfied that the board members who I
looked in the eye when I spoke, I felt, really did show human
quality, flexibility and compassion for what occurred,'' the father
said.
</P>
<P>
   David, a seventh-grader, was suspended Feb. 26, a day after a
routine locker inspection turned up his rocket, which consisted of
a potato-chip canister can, some air plane paint, paper and three
strips of adhesive bandage.
</P>
<P>
   Police called it an incendiary device, and the school district
clas sified it as a firearm, subject to the district's
zero-tolerance policy on guns.
</P>
<P>
   David built his rocket after listen ing to his dad talk about
October Sky, a movie based on a true story about four boys who
decide to become rocket scientists in the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Silverstein said he did not want his son to be interviewed
Tuesday night, but did say that he celebrated the result with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episode is behind us in as much as our first concern is
for David and his education,'' he said. ``We feel that justice has
been served in this case, albeit a little slow for us at times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Silversteins had requested that their appeal hearing, which
lasted about 90 minutes, be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of teachers from the middle school, many wearing simi lar
shirts, showed up at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to the boy affects the whole school,'' teacher
Mary Whitson said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a party atmosphere in the overcrowded room, and most
people there for the rocket case seemed to wonder why no decision
was made public. The Silversteins left the building through a rear
exit to avoid media and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what their motiva tion was for being there,'' Ed
Silverstein said of the teachers. ``I would hope that their
interests are in teaching and educating children, and that's their
first priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression was that the board treated us fairly, listened
and showed compassion. Maybe it's a new begining for them, on how .
. . hiding behind policy is very old-fashioned.''
</P>
<P>
   David, who likes rockets but also is interested in computers,
has been home-schooled by his mother since his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   His plight caught the attention of many around the country, most
of whom are critical of the school district for what they see as
stifling a youngster's scientific curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   His situation also has been a rallying cry for space enthusiasts
and others around the country. He has received phone calls and
e-mails from former astronauts, as well as from Homer Hickam, the
hero of October Sky, and others involved in the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   One Valley businessman offered to pay for David's education from
the eighth grade through high school at a private school. His
father said they are considering that offer. &QL;

CLIPPERS DEFEAT NETS, 109-101

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New Jersey Nets' blowout loss to the New York
Knicks on Sunday was no aberration. But apparently, their stretch
of five victories in six games that preceded it was.
</P>
<P>
   In an almost certain sign that the seemingly rejuvenated Nets
have degenerated back to their struggling selves, they fell hard on
Tuesday night to the Los Angeles Clippers, the team with the worst
record in the league. Destroying the Nets' deteriorating defense to
shoot 57 percent from the floor, the Clippers earned a 109-101
victory before a sparse but raucous crowd of 6,218 at the Sports
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fittingly, Sherman Douglas, the Nets' backup point guard
last season, played a large part in assuring their demise on
Tuesday night. Displaying the craftiness and leadership that had
the Nets dreading his departure as a free agent before this season,
Douglas scored 8 of his 18 points in the Clippers' 31-point third
quarter that saw them go ahead by as much as 18 points and take an
89-74 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Nets' made a feverish charge to pull within 5
points three times, Douglas, who also had six assists, helped hold
them down. His most critical play came when he picked Stephon
Marbury of his dribble, took the ball the length of the court and
drew a shooting foul. He sank the ensuing free throws with 2
minutes 20 seconds remaining to put the Clippers up 106-96.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury came back with a 3-pointer, and Keith Van Horn followed
with one free throw to pull the Nets within 5 points again, but
Lamond Murray ended the suspense by hitting a 3-pointer with less
than a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Murray led the Clippers (6-31), who assured themselves of not
having the worst winning percentage in National Basketball
Association history, with 22 points. Van Horn, playing before 30 of
his fans from his hometown in Diamond Bar, Calif., led the Nets
with 33 points. Marbury added 23 points to go with 8 assists. Jamie
Feick grabbed a career-high 15 rebounds, and Kerry Kittles added 16
points.
</P>
<P>
   Despite displaying defensive futility that allowed the Clippers
to shoot 53 percent, the Nets trailed by only 5 points at
intermission, 58-53. Murray, Tyrone Nesby and Eric Piatkowski,
juking and driving by the lethargic Nets defenders, combined for 40
points on 16-of-24 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, a 6-foot-7-inch forward who came off the bench, looked
like the All-Star he was projected to be when the Clippers made him
the seventh pick in the 1994 draft. Murray, making a mockery of the
defensive efforts of the Nets' swingmen, made 5 of 7 shots and all
six of his free throws to score 16 first-half points in just 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In one stretch, he scored 6 points, 2 of which came on an
18-foot baseline jumper in which he faked Kittles out of his
sneakers, to lead a 12-1 run that put the Clippers ahead by 43-35
midway through the second quarter. Nesby, also a swingman, was
nearly as lethal, scoring 13 points before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first quarter, Piatkowski made Kittles look as if
his feet were stuck in cement by scoring 11 points in seven
minutes. Just a minute into the game, Piatkowski drove baseline on
the Nets' shooting guard and threw down a vicious two-handed slam.
And half a minute later, he sank a running 11-footer, then followed
a Maurice Taylor jump shot with a 3-pointer and 16-footer. Kittles,
his defense having vanished, tried to hang in by sinking two
3-pointers and a 12-footer in the first five minutes, but he still
lost that battle.  &QL;

CANCER SURVIVOR WILL WALK WITH FRIENDS AT GRADUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LORI BAKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The national spotlight, the media pressure, the
onslaught of supporters made it all but inevitable: The Deer Valley
school board had to vote Tuesday to let cancer survivor Cameron
Schmidt walk with his class at commencement.
</P>
<P>
   But to thunderous applause at a packed meeting, the board took
it one step further and decided to award the 18-year-old instant
celebrity an honorary diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right decision,'' a stunned Schmidt, wearing his
ever-present baseball cap, said after the 8:30 p.m. 5-0 vote to let
him walk with his class. ``The media coverage and support from
friends has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's short three credits, even though school
officials originally told him no, Schmidt will join the Mountain
Ridge High School's Class of '99 when it graduates May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Now Schmidt can begin planning for a future that eventually will
include college and possibly a career in marine biology or as a
firefighter. He expects to complete his three high school credits
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, of Phoenix, and his friend, Melissa Robbins, had rushed
to the board meeting from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport
after flying in from New York City, where they appeared Tuesday
morning on NBC-TV's ``Today.'' The show was one of a flurry of
recent national media appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters had read about the foregone conclusion in the
newspapers, seen it on national TV and heard about it on all the
local radio talk shows. But dozens poured into the Deer Valley
Unified School District offices on Tuesday night to hear it from
the five people who could make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Cantelme said the honorary diploma was ``in
recognition of Cameron Schmidt's heroic battle against cancer, his
determined efforts to complete the required 22 credits to graduate,
and the example he has set and the lessons he has taught us all in
how to deal with life's adversities.''
</P>
<P>
   No one from the audience addressed the board before the vote.
They didn't need to. Board members were aware of the public
sentiment from the news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Schmidt's request and the support he's received
from his classmates struck a chord with nearly everyone who heard
it _ from students and fellow cancer survivors to parents,
retirees, blue-collar workers and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was overwhelmed with requests for interviews. On Monday
afternoon, he was on ``Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Schmidt and Robbins clutched hands as Katie
Couric read Monday's statement from the school district saying that
board members individually told Superintendent Gerald Cuendet that
they would grant Schmidt an exception to district policy.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said she hopes the decision will open the doors for
students in similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   Board members said Tuesday's vote did not set a precedent, but
the board plans to adopt a policy allowing honorary diplomas to
recognize students of extraordinary merit and allow them to be in
commencement exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Some Valley districts grant exceptions, but some educators are
concerned about where to draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who had battled Hodgkin's disease with a bone marrow
transplant, chemotherapy and radiation treatments, has been
cancer-free for 10 months and says he is getting stronger every
day. He has maintained a ``B'' average.
</P>
<P>
   He received homebound instruction during his junior year and
part of his senior year. He takes four classes at Mountain Ridge,
22800 N. 67th Ave. &UR; in Glendale, and two classes at home. He was
unable to keep pace with his classmates while he underwent
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   After Schmidt returned to Mountain Ridge in January, his parents
asked administrators to allow him to participate in graduation even
though he was short credits. They were repeatedly told no.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Schmidt's father, Bill, pleaded with board members
on his son's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Friday morning, when about 800 Mountain Ridge
students joined his fight, that Schmidt's plight captured national
attention. Later that day, Deer Valley officials said a committee
of administrators would study the commencement policy and leave it
to the board to grant an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley administrators will meet today to discuss the
policy. As many as 80 students who are short credits for reasons
ranging from illness to pregnancy could be affected by a policy
change, Cuendet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will clarify our policy on the graduation
ceremony requirements and we can get back to the business of
education,'' he said. &QL;

   DALLAS _ The future might look bright for the Mavericks after
all.
</P>
<P>
   In a season filled with near misses and bad luck, the Mavericks
finally stood up to one of the big boys of the NBA Western
Conference for an entire game. And they can thank their ``kids''
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the aggressive play of rookie Dirk Nowitzki and
second-year player Chris Anstey, the Mavericks crawled out of their
slumber and stunned the highly regarded San Antonio Spurs, 92-86,
last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   For the 12-25 Mavericks, the victory was huge because of the
impressive credentials the Spurs brought to town. San Antonio came
in sporting the best record in the NBA since March 1 at 19-3, while
the Mavericks dragged themselves out of bed losers in 11 of their
previous 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   But ... the unexpected happened, as the Mavericks recorded their
first win of the season in 17 outings against any of the top eight
teams in the Western Conference. Indeed, the outcome left parties
on both sides dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a business,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said. ``We go
from the worst loss of the year \R91-90 to Golden State on
Saturday\S to the best win of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy, but I just felt good about the way the young guys
played. We gave them the opportunity, they seized the moment ...
and it got us an unexpected win.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory came even though the Mavericks wrote the NBA book on
how to cave in down the stretch. But such was not the case last
night, as the Mavericks outrebounded the taller Spurs, 50-44, and
executed in crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start since Feb. 26, Nowitzki scored 12 points,
and, more important, he was attacking the glass and wound up with a
game-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge for me,'' Nowitzki said. ``All of the time you
hear you're not ready, so this was huge for my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anstey scored all eight of his points in the frantic fourth
period, and also contributed six rebounds and three blocked shots.
Anstey's block of a Sean Elliott shot led to a highlight dunk by
Michael Finley, who soared to the basket and jammed the ball in
David Robinson's face, putting the Mavericks within 81-80.
</P>
<P>
   Anstey's jumper put the Mavericks ahead for good, at 82-81.
Anstey later crammed home a rebound dunk for an 86-81 Mavericks
lead with less than two minutes left as the Spurs (25-12) departed
wondering how this could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep plugging until something good happens,''
said Finley, who scored a game-high 25 points. ``The last couple of
losses have been really hard on me personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing for me is my mom is in town, and she just told
me to keep my head up and that God will never put anything in front
of me that I couldn't handle, and I took that to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory ties Nelson with predecessor Jim Cleamons for
Mavericks victories with 28. Cleamons reached it in 98 games, while
it took Nelson 103 games.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain it? ``Even a blind squirrel is going to find a
nut every now and then,'' said Mavericks forward Gary Trent, who
scored 18 points. ``We got on them and we didn't let up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 4-12 in games decided by eight points or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether to be excited for the victory or to be
disappointed,'' said point guard Steve Nash, who had 12 assists and
two steals. ``This just pronounced how many of those close games we
should have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's part of the pain and the torture of being a young
team that's new to each other. I'm just glad that we were able to
get one, and we have to count our blessings in this case and be
happy.''

RODRIGUEZ'S 9 RBI BURY MARINERS

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Forget Hack Wilson. Juan Gonzalez needs to worry about
Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who for a time last season threatened Wilson's
single-season runs batted in record, holds most of the Rangers'
significant RBI marks. But Rodriguez stole one away from him last
night in the Rangers' 15-5 victory over the Seattle Mariners at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, with two home runs and a single, drove in nine runs
in the first three innings and set a team record for RBI in a game.
He broke the record of eight set by Gonzalez in 1993 against the
California Angels and tied by Jose Canseco in 1994 against the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez fell three short of the major-league record set by St.
Louis Cardinals first baseman Jim Bottomley in 1924 and tied by
Cardinals outfielder Mark Whiten in 1993. The American League
record is 11, set by Yankees second baseman Tony Lazzeri in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   The news was not all good for the Rangers though. Their injury
situation took another twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had shortstop Royce Clayton back in their lineup,
but now they have to worry about designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro
missing time. Palmeiro, limited to DH duty because of his knee
problems, had to leave last night's game in the first inning
because of a tight right hamstring muscle.
</P>
<P>
   He is listed as day-to-day, but there's a good chance he'll miss
at least the next two games. Trainer Danny Wheat said the injury
was similar to the hamstring problem Mark McLemore had last week
when he missed an exhibition game and the first three
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers don't think Palmeiro's injury is related to his
injured right knee. The hamstring injury occurred during the
Rangers five-run outburst in the first inning against Mariners
starter Ken Cloude. Palmeiro, with runners on second and first,
smacked a line drive high off the right-field wall and felt the
hamstring tighten as he rounded first base.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's offense helped the Rangers jump out to a 13-0 lead
after three innings, more than enough support for starter Mike
Morgan. Making his first start with the Rangers, Morgan allowed two
runs on three hits through six innings before fading in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan gave up three runs then, but still beat the Mariners for
the first time since 1979, his second season in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's spectacular display started in the first inning with
a three-run homer into the second deck in left field off Cloude.
Rodriguez is only the 12th player to reach that area since the
Kingdome opened in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez followed that with a two-run single in the second and
a grand slam in the third, his first in 112 major-league home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had a shot at the major-league and American League
records when he batted with runners at first and second with one
out in the fifth. But Mariners reliever Mac Suzuki got him on a fly
ball to center.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had a leadoff single in the seventh, giving him four
hits for the 14th time in his career.

MISTAKE HURTS AS ANGELS FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Score lots of runs, mistakes don't hurt as much. Score
a little, mistakes are magnified. Such was the case Tuesday night
when a mistake cost the Anaheim Angels in a 3-2 loss to the Oakland
A's before 5,377 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   A potential ninth-inning rally was thwarted when pinch-runner
Orlando Palmeiro was thrown out trying to steal second with nobody
out.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive baserunning? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   There was no steal sign put on, yet Palmeiro broke for second
and was thrown out easily because the A's called for a pitchout.
Catcher Mike Macfarlane's throw was on target.
</P>
<P>
   After the game there was some question as to whether the A's had
stolen a sign and called for the pitchout. But Angels third base
coach Larry Bowa made it clear the A's could not have stolen a
sign, because there wasn't a sign to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know 'em, and we don't know 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign that was on was the bunt sign, but the pitch was
too far off the plate for the hitter, Andy Sheets, to get a bat on.
And Palmeiro surprised the Angels by running _ not the A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a sign, that's all that matters,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels arrived in Oakland late Monday feeling good about
themselves after beating the Texas Rangers in three of four games.
But the offense they had in Texas _ 34 runs and 57 hits _ didn't
arrive with them.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Mike Oquist, called up from Triple-A Vancouver to
make the start, made the Angels hitters look like minor-leaguers.
Oquist (1-0) allowed only one run and four hits in six innings, and
got relief help from 41-year-old Doug Jones and Billy Taylor, who
recorded his first save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels did manage five hits in the seventh and eighth
innings, but had only one run to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nine hits,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``We
hit the ball, we just didn't get hits with guys in scoring
position. When we had guys in scoring position, they made good
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels missed an opportunity in the eighth after Troy Glaus'
two-out double scored Tim Salmon to make it 3-2. With the potential
tying and go-ahead runs on second and third, Todd Greene swung at
the first pitch by Jones and flied out to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances late in the game to win the game and we didn't
execute, including myself,'' Greene said. ``I need a better at-bat
than a one-pitch pop-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks (0-2) picked up where he left off
from his first start _ giving up runs. He gave up at least one run
in each of his four innings on April 8 against the Indians, and
started Tuesday by giving up three in the first inning. Matt Stairs
had the big hit, a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks made 40 pitches in the first inning alone but settled
down after that, keeping the A's from scoring again before leaving
after six innings. He made 134 pitches, giving up the three runs
(two earned) and seven hits with seven strikeouts and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me two or three innings to feel comfortable and get
locked in with my knuckleball,'' Sparks said. ``The ball seemed
hard and slick, so it was hard to get a feel for it. I tried to get
by with my other pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fateful first inning, five of the first six A's batters
reached base _ three with singles and two with walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sparks) walked some guys, went deep in counts,'' Collins
noted. ``He's a knuckleball pitcher _ you get in fastball counts
guys are going to hit you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had eight innings to score some runs and get back in the
game. We didn't score. It's pretty simple.''

CLIPPERS WIN AGAIN

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dealing a cheeky attitude as they roll along, the
Los Angeles Clippers have just greeted history with an obscene
gesture that requires both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Six fingers for six victories.
</P>
<P>
   Our opening testimony is given by co-starring forward Lamond
Murray, who provided a team-high 22 off the bench: ``We're trying
to ride that wave of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest bit of chest-thumping was achieved in Tuesday's
109-101 victory over the New Jersey Nets in front of 6,218 at the
Sports Arena. This result prevents the Clippers (6-31) from sinking
their sneakers in the permanent ink of history; they now can lose
their remaining 13 games and still have a higher winning percentage
than the 1972-'73 Philadelphia 76ers. Those swingin' Sixers expired
with a 9-73 mark, which translates to a batting average of .110.
The Clips - checking in with a gaudy .162 -- could whiff the rest
of the season and finish at .120.
</P>
<P>
   But there is considerable evidence to the contrary. The Clippers
now have won consecutive games for the first time in over 15
months, and three of their last four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can walk with your head up a bit more,'' said guard Eric
Piatkowski, who has spent most of the season huddled in a foxhole
with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Nets (10-27), their collection of rising talent and
pre-season hype have made them as bitterly disappointing as your
first beer.
</P>
<P>
   For the rising Clippers, it was almost nothing but net.
</P>
<P>
   When Piatkowski drilled a 3-pointer at the 2:35 mark in the
third quarter, the Clipper held an 84-67 lead and had made 60
percent of their field-goal attempts. That's almost nothing but
net.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, their baby-faced frontline of Tyrone Nesby
(20, five), Maurice Taylor (18, 12) and Michael Olowokandi (six,
11) had combined for 44 points and 28 rebounds. Taylor's howling,
multi-facial slam with 6:55 also drew a Jersey foul and gave the
Clippers - who were tripping toward skid row -- a 95-88 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that dunk was a 10,'' said Taylor, who probably should add
some extra credit for modesty.
</P>
<P>
   Piatkowski, who gunned in 11 points in the opening quarter and
finished with 17, was a bit more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of got on a roll,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran point guard Sherman Douglas, whose previous NBA stop was
New Jersey, was the man who executed Coach Chris Ford's plan. ``The
Shermanator'' scored 18 points, handed out four assists and
received a flood of praise in a rare post-game, dressing-room visit
from team owner Donald T. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was him, I wouldn't come in here much, either,'' Douglas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers signed point guard Troy Hudson for the
remainder of the season, and also have the CBA escapee under
contract for next season's training camp. Hudson, who previously
had played under back-to-back, 10-day contracts, is averaging 4.7
points and 1.7 assists per game.

CLOUDE DISSIPATES IN RANGER ROUT; RODRIGUEZ COLLECTS NINE RBI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Mariners sent Ken Cloude to Class AAA Tacoma
to start the season, this was the thinking: He would work on his
mechanical problems, experience some success and return a more
confident pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude dominated in two minor league outings and corrected his
physical flaws. But Tuesday night against the Texas Rangers, he
experienced the same kind of result that ruined his spring. Cloude
lasted 12/3 innings, allowing seven runs on six hits and four walks
in a 15-6 loss.
</P>
<P>
   He might be headed back to Tacoma. Manager Lou Piniella would
not say whether Cloude would make another start in Seattle, saying
he needed to discuss the matter with the front office first. But
with Mac Suzuki and Brett Hinchliffe unavailable after long relief
stints Tuesday night, Piniella said, the M's need an extra reliever
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stay with 10 pitchers, I can tell you that,''
Piniella said. ``We'll see what we do, but we need someone that can
give us some innings.''
</P>
<P>
   That extra pitcher will not be reliever Mark Leiter, who was
sidelined with shoulder tendinitis and will pitch the first two
innings Wednesday night for Tacoma in hopes that he can be
activated Friday. As for Cloude's future, the 24-year-old
right-hander said he is not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to (another start),'' Cloude said. ``I
don't see it happening any other way. Those kinds of things don't
bother me anymore. I try to worry about what I can control _
throwing strikes and getting people out. I don't worry about
getting sent down or making another start.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's were counting on Cloude to build off his 1998 season,
when he went 8-10 and made 30 starts. But patience might be running
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep looking for Ken to get over the hump,'' said pitching
coach Stan Williams. ``He showed us at times last year what he was
capable of, but he hasn't been able to sustain it for any length of
time. It's really time for him to make up his mind that he's going
to go out there and pitch with his mind as well as his body and
stay positive out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what's in his mind, because I don't know. But
it's time for him to kick in and get some consistency. Nobody's
pulling for him more than I am, but he's got to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella and Williams said they expected more after Cloude's
last Class AAA outing, in which he gave up a hit to the leadoff
batter, then threw six hitless, shutout innings. This game started
with two quick strikes to Texas' Tom Goodwin, but Cloude ended up
walking him, soon loaded the bases on a single and another walk _
with a wild pitch that missed the catcher's glove mixed in _ and
the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez led the Rangers' charge with a club-record nine
runs batted in, just three away from the all-time record shared by
Jim Bottomley and Mark Whiten.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude said the leadoff walk did not unnerve him. He was sharp
in his pregame bullpen session, and Williams said Cloude's arm
angle, which had been a problem in spring training, was fine this
time.
</P>
<P>
   But sideline success didn't carry over to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I threw in the bullpen before the game, I didn't think
about anything, I just threw,'' Cloude said. `` ... I go out there
on the mound, and it's as if I don't relax. That's a big
distraction, not being able to relax. It takes away from my
concentration. If anything, it's being too focused, too into it,
and you try to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude said he doesn't like nit-picking with his mechanics and
believes his problems have been more mental than physical. He found
himself trying to muscle the ball Tuesday night, causing him to
lose movement on his fastball and depth on his breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he remains in Seattle, he said he's staying positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said, ``but I'm not down on myself
right now, I know that.''

VOTERS REJECTING BOND FOR L.A. POLICE, FIRE UPGRADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Contains updated information. No further updates expected
tonight.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Backed with unprecedented City Hall guarantees to
deliver on promises, a $744 million bond issue for police and fire
facilities was falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for
passage in Tuesday's election.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, the City Council and top bureaucrats
publicly pledged to spend Proposition 1 funds as set out in the
bond measure _ a step necessitated by the city's failure to deliver
on bond issue promises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he was disappointed with the trend of returns and
expected the measure to fail. He had not yet determined what to do
to meet the city's needs for more police and fire facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the safeguards we had included in the measure would
convince voters,'' Riordan said. ``It would have helped us respond
more quickly to victims of serious accidents, heart attacks or
other emergencies. We will have to look at what we can do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan had campaigned vigorously across the city, particularly
in the San Fernando Valley, lending his personal credibility to the
measure to try to win the two-thirds voter support needed for
passage. It was too early to tell on Tuesday where the main
opposition to the proposal came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we (would) have to look at coming back with this to
the voters,'' Riordan said. ``This is something the city needs and
it's a capital expenditure that should be spread out over 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond measure would cost the owner of a $160,000 home about
$32.50 a year in additional property taxes over 25 years, city
officials had estimated. It was designed to be the first of a
four-part, $2 billion plan to upgrade police and fire facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem Riordan and other proponents faced was voter
skepticism that the city would be able to accomplish what it was
proposing in the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overcome that concern the measure included two
committees _ one of city officials and one of private citizens with
expertise in construction _ to oversee the work. Of the private
committee, two members would come from the San Fernando Valley,
which never got a police station promised in an earlier bond issue.
</P>
<P>
   There was no active campaign against the measure although the
Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association filed a ballot argument against
it and a group involved in San Fernando Valley secession efforts,
calling itself No Bonds Now, held two news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of opponents complained about the size of the
measure, and No Bonds Now also questioned the timing of the measure
with the prospect of the Valley seceding from the city.
</P>
<P>
   However, city officials did not help themselves in winning voter
support when the City Clerk's Office omitted from the sample ballot
a list spelling out which projects would be built. The city was
forced to send out a supplemental mailing at a cost of $344,000 to
make good on Riordan's pledge to include the itemization in the
sample ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, two weeks before the election, the Los Angeles Fire
Department sent out a strongly worded bill for $13 to hillside
residents to pay for a brush clearance program. Because of
dissatisfaction with the warning letter, the City Council voted to
suspend the brush-clearance inspection fee.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan and other supporters defended the bond issue as a way to
replace aging and damaged facilities throughout the city. Also, the
mayor argued that the facilities would be needed even if the San
Fernando Valley does secede.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious plan calls for the replacement of the Parker
Center police headquarters with a new 300,000-square-foot building
on the same site; construction of four replacement police stations
including the West Valley station; two new police stations
including one in the North Valley; 17 new fire stations and a new
Fire Department air operations facility in Van Nuys; and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Of the new fire stations, there would be regional stations built
in Arleta, Northridge and Woodland Hills and standard stations
built in Encino, Studio City and Sun Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was developed by two task forces analyzing future
public safety needs. Those panels envision the bond measure as the
first of three or four bond proposals over the next 20 years to
build needed police and fire stations.

L.A. SCHOOL REFORM WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Contains updated information. No further updates expected
tonight.) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mayor Richard Riordan's $2 &UR;  &LR; million bid to elect
a new, reform-minded school board majority scored at least a
partial victory Tuesday, with two of his candidates winning seats
and a third headed for a runoff against a powerful incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth race, incumbent David Tokofsky _ who had Riordan's
backing _ was locked in a seesaw race with Yolie Flores Aguilar.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan-backed candidates Caprice Young and Mike Lansing easily
beat incumbents Jeff Horton and George Kiriyama, respectively. And
in a crowded race in South Central Los Angeles, the mayor's
candidate, Genethia Hayes, took a slight late lead over board
member Barbara Boudreaux, most likely triggering a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   The returns represented a repudiation of the school board's
performance and a victory for a broad coalition supporting
educational reform.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he was confident his entire slate would win and
help turn around a school district he has bitterly criticized for
its dismal student test scores and administrative scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned the education election is the most
important of the day,'' Riordan said. ``I think we have sent a
message, a loud and clear message, that the system is in disgrace
and need to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, an IBM executive and former Riordan aide, said the
election results showed voter frustration with Los Angeles' ailing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really believe it's time for the schools to be fixed,
and the main thing we need is accountability at the school board
level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Champions of local educational reform said even having one or
two new members elected to the board could help turn around the
district by demonstrating to other board members the public's
determination for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if only one new member comes in, there will have been
lessons learned,'' said Maria Casillas, director of the Los Angeles
Annenberg Metropolitan Project, which funds reform efforts in
schools. ``If you have a whole slate of new people come in, that
will send a really big message.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped a year of mounting calls for reform at the
700,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District. While
Riordan's attack on the school board was the most visible and
personal _ he has called the current board evil and inept _ other
groups weighed in with their own plans for change.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence shaped the race, as incumbents and challengers
alike rushed to declare themselves reformers. And the mayor's money
turned what used to be little-noticed, incumbent-friendly elections
dominated by cash from teacher and administrator unions into
bruising political fights.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a set platform from the mayor, Riordan's hand-picked
candidates mostly adopted recommendations made by a committee of
prominent civic leaders led by Harold M. Williams, former head of
the Getty Trust.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, so great was the pressure for reform that all but one
of the incumbents targeted for removal also signed on to the
Williams plan, which calls for the school board to set overall
policies and hold Superintendent Ruben Zacarias and other
administrators accountable for implementing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, first step, mission accomplished,'' Williams said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although his Committee on Effective School Governance was widely
viewed as being allied with Riordan, it did not endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the committee would make sure those candidates who
pledged to implement the plan do not forget their promises after
the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either as friends or as watchdogs, we will be there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While both incumbents and challengers vowed to work for reform,
they split sharply over other issues, including Riordan's
involvement in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a tough challenge in South Central Los Angeles, Boudreaux
said Riordan's choice of another African-American woman to unseat
her amounted to ``plantation politics.'' She fought back by lining
up endorsements from many of the city's African-American leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But challenger Hayes defended her independence, saying Riordan
backed her after she had decided to run.
</P>
<P>
   In board district 5, which stretches from the northeast San
Fernando Valley to East Los Angeles, Tokofsky squared off against
Aguilar, who was backed by school board President Victoria Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar sought to neutralize Riordan's endorsement of Tokofsky
by saying her opponent was guilty of the same micromanaging of the
district staff that he had pledged to end. Tokofsky responded by
saying he and Riordan shared both an emphasis on the fundamentals
of education and a determination to root out bureaucratic
inefficiency and waste.
</P>
<P>
   Horton, whose district includes Hollywood and North Hollywood,
came under fire from challenger Young for his support of the
Belmont Learning Complex project, a half-finished downtown high
school already considered the state's most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   He fought back by pointing to his record of supporting reform
within the district _ specifically the drive to end the automatic
promotion of poorly performing students _ and emphasizing Young's
lack of education experience.
</P>
<P>
   And in a district connecting Watts and San Pedro, Riordan
candidate Lansing ran on a platform of focusing on poor academic
performance, while incumbent Kiriyama insisted that the district
already had turned the tide, as shown by a slight improvement in
test scores. &UR;

CITY OFFICIAL REACTS TO OVITZ REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Michael Ovitz has decided to withdraw his proposal for a NFL
expansion franchise in Carson, he hasn't told anyone in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, city officials had been in contact with
Ovitz representatives about details of their bid and next week's
visit by the NFL expansion and finance committees. Published
reports today say that Ovitz is withdrawing his bid and will
support the New Coliseum proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being told (by Ovitz people) that's (the report) not
true,'' said Carson City Manager Jerry Groomes Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke with his attorney (James Ellis) yesterday. We've been
trying to prepare for the NFL visit and coordinating things with
Mr. Ovitz. We haven't heard a thing about this.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Carson city officials have admittedly been wary of
Ovitz's direction since the NFL meetings in Phoenix last month. At
that meeting, league owners gave L.A. a conditional bid for a 32nd
franchise subject to NFL interests here providing a tight stadium
and financing plan within six months.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution, hammered home by NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, made it clear the league would select the site and the
ownership group and not necessarily choose between the Ovitz/Carson
proposal or the New Coliseum plan backed by L.A. businessmen Ed
Roski and Eli Broad.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also said the league wanted a broader ownership group
and hinted at the possibility of the two groups coming together as
one.
</P>
<P>
   After those meetings, Ovitz, chairman of Artists Management
Group, said he would do whatever the league asked him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are not anyone's to decide but the league,'' he
said last month. ``It only matters what they think. I think
(Carson's) the best option ... But you can't force them to choose
your site. They'll make the decision, and if they tell me to play
in a sandlot, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Ovitz representatives Tuesday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Groomes and Carson City Councilman Daryl Sweeney both have
expressed their frustrations over the last few months, or since
Tagliabue and expansion committee chairman Jerry Richardson took a
helicopter tour of the stadium site and lauded the city's effort.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered why Ovitz didn't have the same presence at the
Phoenix meetings as the New Coliseum group. Sweeney said he has
asked Ovitz and his representatives for input on making their
proposal stronger and rallying public support for next week's
visit, but there has been little substantive discussion.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, NFL spokesman Joe Browne said the
expansion committee was planning to visit both sites Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   This comes a day after the Los Angeles Times reported that the
NFL has broached a plan with Fox and L.A. city officials about a
combined project that would have the Dodgers moving to a new
stadium next to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials acknowledged the contact but said it's just one of
many proposals that's been presented since the company purchased
the Dodgers from Peter O'Malley for $311 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Dodgers say the idea was floated by NFL
officials who want to make the New Coliseum proposal look more
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There are still several NFL owners wary of returning to the
Coliseum in any fashion. Plus, the league has a credibility issue
if it accepts the New Coliseum idea as it stands now. It lacks the
fresh public funding that has been driving the league's stadium
criteria the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Carson is prepared to invest upwards of $180 million
in the stadium and mall proposal, $30 million in cash and a bond
issue worth $150 million. Ovitz's blueprint was for a combined mall
and stadium called ``The Hacienda'' built on a former landfill at
the intersection of the Harbor and San Diego freeways.

DODGERS FALL IN 16TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Three times the Los Angeles Dodgers appeared dead,
done, finished. Three times they came back from improbable odds to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The one time the Dodgers seemed in control was the time it got
away.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers scored twice in the top of the 16th inning,
the Diamondbacks countered with three in the bottom of the inning
to post a 7-6 win Tuesday at Bank One Ballpark. Dante Powell's
double off Pedro Borbon scored Tony Batista with the winning run
with one out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 6-4 lead in the top of the 16th without aid
of a hit. Raul Mondesi walked and moved to second on Todd Hundley's
sacrifice bunt. Pitcher Bobby Chouinard threw wide to first and
Diamondbacks second baseman Tony Womack hurt his ankle on the play
and wandered off the bag. Noticing it, Mondesi sprinted for third
and slid in safely.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros then lined a ball to third, but Matt Williams
misplayed it and Mondesi scored. After a Dave Mlicki sacrifice
moved runners to second and third, Adrian Beltre was intentionally
walked and Tripp Cromer grounded to shortstop to score another run.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't over. Steve Finley led off the bottom of the
inning with a single and Kelly Stinnett hit his first career
pinch-hit homer to tie the game 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Batista and Womack each singled before Powell's double.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki (0-1) picked up the loss despite pitching well in relief.
Chouinard (1-0) was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I needed help for Mlicki, but I was hoping he could get
by,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It just wasn't meant to
be. It was a great team effort. We were battling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest game in Diamondbacks history, but through the
first eight innings there were no indications how long things would
drag on.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored twice in the top of the ninth to tie the
game, but that was nothing compared to the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Diamondbacks had the bases loaded with none out
and couldn't score against Mlicki. The situation was set up on
Mondesi's throwing error. Williams led off the 11th with a bloop
single to right. He made a wide turn and Mondesi tried to throw
behind Williams at first. Eric Karros couldn't handle the bouncing
throw and Williams went to second.
</P>
<P>
   Finley attempted to sacrifice the runners over. His bunt attempt
was fielded by Karros, but the throw was high to first.
Mysteriously, Finley was credited with a base hit to load the bases
with none out.
</P>
<P>
   But Mlicki struck out pinch-hitter Bernard Gilkey, and third
baseman Adrian Beltre saved the game on a heads-up play on Damian
Miller's smash. Beltre had the ball bounce off his chest but into
his hand. He fired to Todd Hundley for the force at the plate.
Mlicki got Batista to pop to right and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona couldn't break through in the 12th either. Jay Bell
singled with one out and Travis Lee followed with a perfectly
executed hit-and-run through the shortstop side to move Powell, the
pinch-runner, to third. But a brilliant double play between Eric
Young, Cromer and Karros kept the game going.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a grounder behind second. Young fielded it, slipped
to Cromer, who pirouetted on second (or in the neighborhood) and
threw to a stretching Karros to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in five games the teams have gone into
extra innings this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied it in the top of the ninth with two runs, and
they rallied after having none on and two outs. And they came
within a few inches of winning the game in nine innings when
pinch-hitter Dave Hansen's drive to right-center field hit the top
of the wall. But the ball bounced back into play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' rally started harmlessly enough against
Diamondbacks closer du jour Darren Holmes. Mark Grudzielanek
singled to center with two outs. Beltre doubled to the left-center
field fence to pull the Dodgers within 4-3 and set the stage for
Hansen, pinch-hitter extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who is 5 for 6 as a pinch-hitter this season, smashed
the ball off the top of the wall to drive in Beltre with the tying
run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth blown save in four opportunities for Arizona's
bullpen. It also spoiled a tremendous performance by starting
pitcher Armando Reynoso. He gave up one run on five hits. He struck
out four and walked a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona second baseman Jay Bell became the ninth Diamondbacks
player to hit two homers in a game. He had solo home runs in the
fifth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ninth, everything was going Arizona's way.
</P>
<P>
   Two things pitchers need to do to be successful is minimize the
damage in any one inning, and shut down clubs the inning after
their offense provides runs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes failed to do the latter. An inning
after Gary Sheffield homered to cut Arizona's lead to 2-1, Valdes
was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Miller led off the sixth with a double off the
right field wall. He was sacrificed to third by Reynoso. Womack
flied to right to set up what should have been a close play to the
plate. But Mondesi, long regarded as one of the best defensive
outfielders in the game, had his throw sail off line, which allowed
Miller to score.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who has punished the Dodgers in the early part of the
season, continued his torrid stretch against L.A. pitching. This
time he smashed Valdes' full-count offering into the left-field
stands to give Arizona a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bell's fourth homer of the season, and third against the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes was promptly pulled by Johnson as a solid outing turned
sour. He was chased after 52/3 innings, giving up four runs on nine
hits, walking three and striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scraped for a run in the eighth off reliever Brian
Anderson when Young, who doubled, scored on Sheffield's two-out
single to center as L.A. crept with 4-2.

 &HT;    High-schoolers set their sights on scholarships via the Web
 &HT;    By Jennifer Peltz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Frank Raucci made his first stab at
designing a World Wide Web page a few months ago. Now he hopes a
Web page will help pay his way through college.
</P>
<P>
   Raucci and his teammate, fellow Suncoast High School senior
Allison Cammerata, are competing for a $25,000 scholarship by
creating a Web site about medieval Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At Palm Beach Gardens High School, senior Justin Slone is also
trying to turn his on-line skills into a scholarship. He and
classmate Gilbert Morejohn are teaming up for an on-line research
contest, with a full scholarship to Florida State University as the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years after the World Wide Web became widely popular,
Web skills have made their way into the academic mainstream _ so
much so that scholarships are emerging nationwide to reward and
court students who have on-line expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other talent, whether it be music or art or
science or athletics,'' said Timothy McDonough, a spokesman for the
American Council on Education, an organization of 1,800 colleges
and universities. ``Institutions are trying to find a mix of
students . . . (and the Web) is very much a part of the learning
environment now.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State made that point last year, when it started
offering an on-line research scholarship ``to show that FSU is
connected to learning, to offering students the best in information
services,'' said spokeswoman Fran Conaway.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors search Lexis-Nexis, a giant on-line database of
articles from newspapers and other sources, to answer complex
multiple-choice questions quickly, Conaway said. Thursday is the
deadline to register for this year's contest; the details are
available through the flashing ``Online Scholars Challenge'' icon
(www.fsu.edu).
</P>
<P>
   The contest doesn't sound like too tough a challenge to Slone,
who uses the World Wide Web ``as my main source of research.''
</P>
<P>
   While Slone has worked with computers for years, Raucci is
taking his first computer programming class. But Web design has
come easily enough that Raucci is taking a shot at the worldwide
ThinkQuest Internet Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkQuest, sponsored by Advanced Network &AMP; Services, a New York
company that helped build the Internet, asks students to design
educational Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Allan Weis started the contest in 1996 because
he'd found ``nothing that took advantage of all of the power that
the Internet could have'' to teach 11- to 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkQuest has drawn thousands of entries on subjects from sound
to Shakespeare to the programming language C++, Weis said. This
year's registration deadline has passed, but more information is
available on line (www.thinkquest.org).
</P>
<P>
   ArsDigita, a Boston company, is ready to give $10,000, not for
Web sites but Web services. The company's new contest for students
18 and younger calls for on-line creations that serve a purpose,
such as automatically reminding people to move their cars for
street cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the bar raised in terms of creating useful
and tasteful on-line services,'' ArsDigita programmer Rolf Hanson
explained. The application deadline is May 1 (information is
available at arsdigita.org).
</P>
<P>
   While only a handful of scholarships recognize on-line skills,
some have already specialized by interest and area.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting.net, an on-line information service for accountants,
reserves scholarship money for accounting students who write an
essay explaining how the Internet has changed the profession. A
Chicago Tribune scholarship contest requires Chicago-area students
to create Web sites for nonprofit organizations. In Atlanta, the
Technology Association of Georgia runs a scholarship contest for
Web sites by and about Georgia high school students.
</P>
<P>
   But these new-media scholarships are old news to the makers of
Vivarin, an over-the-counter caffeine pill.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers started giving $10,000 scholarships for
interesting Web pages on any subject in 1995, when the Web was just
becoming popular outside computer-science circles. The awards
stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet hit so fast that what was new and unique one year
became just so terribly old-hat the next year,'' scholarship
spokesman Chris Clark explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, college students are starting Internet companies
with (initial) valuations in the billions of dollars, so we feel a
little silly saying, `Show us your cool home page,' '' Clark said.

 &HT;    Police urge manager to leave children
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Nearly every Friday after the rink's 11:30 p.m.
closing time, Skateworld general manager Rick Corson takes on a job
he doesn't want _ late-night babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   Corson finds himself stuck with one or two kids, some as young
as 8 years old, whose parents have dropped them off and, for
whatever reason, failed to pick them up. Often, well beyond
midnight, the children can't reach their parents by phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a terrible spot here,'' Corson said. ``Could someone
please direct me what to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Police used to retrieve the stranded kids and try to contact
their parents, but now they say they will no longer perform
babysitting duties. And Montgomery County Children Services said it
had no legal authority to take the children into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering police have told Corson the children are no longer his
legal responsibility after the rink's posted hours have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I should turn out the lights, lock up and go
home,'' he said. ``But what about my moral obligation? It's a
different world out there these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Corson said he can't leave the kids on his doorstep for fear of
what happened to Erica Baker, the 9-year-old Kettering girl who
disappeared more than two months ago while walking her dog one
rainy afternoon near the Kettering Recreation Complex.
</P>
<P>
   And Corson said he can't drive the kids home for fear he'll be
held liable if there's a car accident or find himself accused of
child molesting.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, he ends up babysitting the kids in his lobby until
their parents can be reached _ sometimes as late as 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm lucky I haven't had to spend the night here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, when a 13-year-old Beavercreek, Ohio girl couldn't
reach her parents after 1 a.m., she insisted on walking home.
Corson said no, and had his security guard drive her and a
13-year-old girlfriend to Kettering police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The security guard and the girls waited 40 minutes for an
officer to come out to the lobby and speak to them. When he did,
Corson said, ``the officer told (the security guard), 'Don't bring
them here any more. They're not our responsibility'.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, just before 2 a.m., the guard reached the father of one
of the girls, who called the girl's mother to come and pick them
up, Corson said
</P>
<P>
   The problem became more prominent beginning last fall, when
Corson said he started drawing record crowds. The increased
business _ particularly on Friday nights _ had more kids staying
after the rink's closing time.
</P>
<P>
   It's never the same kids who are stranded, Corson said, or he
would bar the offenders from his rink and possibly report their
parents to Children Services.
</P>
<P>
   Corson said he doesn't have the same babysitting problem at
Skateworld's nearby Vandalia location. ``Parents up there don't
leave them and forget them like they do (at the Kettering
location),'' he said. ``I don't know why that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Skateworld in Kettering draws as many as 550 children on Friday
nights from Kettering and surrounding areas. The Vandalia location
draws a slightly smaller crowd _ about 400 children on Friday
nights. The average age of the skaters at both locations is between
10 and 12 years of age, Corson said.
</P>
<P>
   The few times when he has had a stranded child at the Vandalia
location, Corson said, the Vandalia police have never refused to
pick up the child.
</P>
<P>
   Vandalia Police Chief Doug Knight said his department's policy
is ``first, to make sure the child is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Knight said, Vandalia police attempt to contact the
parents to come get their child. If the parents can't be reached,
he said, the police call the Montgomery County Family Court Center
to arrange for the child's care.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering police spokesman Officer Larry Warren said Kettering
doesn't have the manpower to pick up stranded kids. ``To tell you
the truth, I find it hard to believe that Vandalia would go,'' he
said. ``If nothing of a criminal nature is going on, there's no use
in our going out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do Kettering police want Corson to drop off the kids at
their headquarters. ``We don't want to be used as a babysitting
facility,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Erica Baker's disappearance might create a sense
of urgency for children stranded at night, Warren said, ``the sense
of urgency should be from the parents.''

 &HT;    Plan works incrementally, scholar says
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a former infantryman, James MacGregor Burns is
skeptical about the effectiveness of the air war in Yugoslavia. As
a scholar who had devoted his career to the subject of presidential
leadership, he's not surprised Bill Clinton has championed that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't hear much about the perils of moderation,'' said
Burns, referring to his forthcoming book with Georgia Sorenson:
``Dead Center: Clinton-Gore Leadership and the Perils of
Moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, however, the centrist, incremental approach that
marks Clinton's strategy in the evolving conflict in Yugoslavia is
at the core of his most serious shortcomings as a president.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who lectured at Morehouse College on Monday, has come to
some rather unconventional conclusions about this president as he
faces his most serious international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's highest marks have generally been for his
domestic accomplishments, Burns believe the moderate approach
hatched within the Democratic Leadership Council and carried out in
this administration has failed to address the nation's most serious
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic peril is that it just doesn't achieve major changes.
It achieves incremental changes _ most in my view good little
policies, but not policies that deal with the fundamentals of the
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Burns believes Clinton has been unfairly
judged with respect to his handling of foreign policy. While they
have not led to the kind of changes the 79-year-old historian would
like to see in this country, Clinton's skills as a conciliator and
mediator have been ``very effective on the world scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has devoted enormous energy to international affairs,
Burns noted, and often shown a greater willingness to take a
principled approach abroad than at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been more steadfast in what's going on now than in some
of his domestic policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether steadfastness is rewarded with success in the Balkans
remains to be seen. Burns thinks the president blundered by
commiting himself so strongly to a limited bombing strategy, but he
believes Clinton will get out of that box the same way he got into
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may just sort of incrementalize us into ground forces,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns lectured Monday on the subject of ``public values vs.
private virtues,'' for which this president provides a rich field
of study.
</P>
<P>
   The two levels of morality can come into conflict, as they did
last year. Fundamental to the great unifying American value of
liberty, Burns argues, is the right to privacy, which is at greater
risk for presidents than most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's for that reason, and not the way the president conducted
himself, that Burns remains a staunch critic of the impeachment.
Clinton ``could have taken a moral stand'' and refused to testify
before the Kenneth Starr grand jury, thus precipitating a
constitutional showdown over the privacy question.
</P>
<P>
   To do that would have been true to the style of
``transformational leadership'' espoused by Burns, who,
incidentally, declares himself an ``unabashed admirer'' of Hillary
Clinton.

 &HT;    Things to do in Texas before you die
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There are three things a man ought to see before
he croaks:
</P>
<P>
   The State Fair, the Terlingua Chili Cookoff and the tryouts of
the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, I finally got a chance to attend the tryouts for
the legendary hot pants dance ensemble, held in the Stadium Club at
Texas Stadium. I am here to report that this spectacular event
beats a bowl of red and Big Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my guy friends were groveling at my feet, begging me to
take them along to these tryouts. For those unfortunates who had to
stay behind, let me report the experience was like going to a
topless bar, with tops and no drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a lot more dancers than you'd find at, say, The
Crazy Lady.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 mostly well-conditioned young ``audition candidates''
in sleeveless leotards and flesh-colored tights took turns, five at
a time, ``free-dancing'' on a disco floor.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one wave of bouncing fun after the other. They
bumped, swiveled, leaped, kicked, spun. They smiled as if their
lips were wired agape to songs with titles such as ``We Like to
Party,'' ``Get Ready to Bounce,'' and ``Where's the Party At.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between these tryouts and a topless bar? I
didn't run into anyone named Bambi, Destiny or Desiree who had more
tattoos than teeth. All of the candidates I spoke with said they
have jobs or are in college, majoring in everything from sociology
to higher education.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the tryouts, you have to be 18, have a high
school diploma or a GED and have a job or be a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning to fly airplanes, so I figured why not the Dallas
Cowboys?'' said Francine Fivash, who is in the Naval Reserve. ``I
want to be a pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked what kind of airplanes she is learning to fly. ``The
ones with the little propellers on the side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I wish Francine luck with her flight career. And when she gets a
job flying for an airline, I want to be the first to know which one
it is.
</P>
<P>
   You can't skate your way onto the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader
squad without demonstrating some smarts. Those who were fortunate
enough to make it through Saturday's preliminaries had to take an
85-question written exam during the semifinals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the test, the audition candidates were asked about the
history of the Cowboys and the Cheerleaders, as well as football
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's football questions like, 'How many points do you get
for a touchdown?' `` said Rachel Durbin, administrative assistant
for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. ``We don't want them cheering
when they (the Cowboys) just fumbled the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And, no, one of the current events questions did not begin,
``When the big hand is on the four . . . . `` They were more
difficult than that. ``Name one of the Supreme Court justices,''
Durbin said, telling me one of the questions.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would have been, ``Name one of the Supremes.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's written test was a little different than last
year's. This year, contestants had to write out the words to The
Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was the National Anthem,'' Durbin explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew the words until I started to write them,
'cause I used to sing them at football games, `` said cheerleader
candidate and school teacher Jennifer Nobra, speaking of The Star
Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all stuffy and intellectual at the Cowboys
Cheerleaders tryouts. During the finals on May 2, finalists will
perform two-minute talent presentations.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder how many versions of ``My Heart Will Go On''
the judges will have to sit through.

 &HT;    Pregnancy changes even the best of us
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My friend is pregnant for the first time, at 38,
and having a little trouble getting used to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   She is also, for some mysterious reason, feeling a tad
emotional. Her mother found that out when she suggested perhaps
they shouldn't take that planned trip to Italy this summer, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, we can't go to Italy?'' she said, sobbing.
``That makes me feel terrible, like I'm never going to have my life
back after I have a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She immediately got on the phone with me, as close friends do,
by contractual agreement, after tiffs with their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean this isn't my life
anymore!'' she said. ``Does it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a complicated question, but I knew the answer she needed to
hear: ``Of course not. I still have my life, don't I? I still go
out all the time, and get together with my friends. Being a mother
doesn't mean you're no longer a person.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is true, but not the whole truth. No need to tell
her, just yet, about the contortionist tricks you perform to keep a
semblance of the life you have known. No need to tell her it's
tough for us older first-time mothers, accustomed to doing what we
want to do when we want to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs the whole truth when she's pregnant, anyway? Plenty of
time for her to figure that out later.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the whole truth is all that bad, at that. For all the
parts of your life you give up, there are parts you reclaim: Story
hour. Halloween. Disney movies.
</P>
<P>
   And there are avenues you would never have explored, in your
wildest dreams. It's a safe bet that, without my son, Alec, I would
not have my current profound understanding of the moral,
sociological and metaphysical implications of The Simpsons. Nor
would I have found myself at a Dayton Bombers playoff game Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   I would not have seen my daughter make friends with Bucky the
Flying Squirrel, reaching out to hug him, kissing him on the cheek,
dancing with him, with a toddler's uncomplicated affection and
magical belief in anthropomorphism.
</P>
<P>
   I would not have been able to read 60 pages in my latest novel,
in spite of the PA system blasting Bad to the Bone and We Will Rock
You . An acquaintance walked by and picked up my book. ``You must
have extraordinary powers of concentration,'' he said. I nodded
absently, only thinking of the snappy comeback later.
</P>
<P>
   I should have said, ``Of course I do. I grew up in a family of
six kids.'' No, no, I should have said, ``I work in a newsroom,
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   No, no, this is what I should have said: ``Of course I do, I'm a
parent, and do you have any idea how much I'd pay for three hours'
reading time?''
</P>
<P>
   My pregnant friend heard her baby's heartbeat for the first time
only a few days after our going-to-Italy conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most amazing thing,'' she said. ``I had to turn my
head, so the doctor wouldn't see my tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The seashell rhythms of the heartbeat answered her question _
``Will it still be my life?'' _ far better than I ever could.
</P>
<P>
   It's your life, only more complicated, with not a second in the
day your child isn't lurking in your consciousness, not a plan you
can make without taking him into account.

 &HT;    Clinton's continued lack of character bad for U.S.
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ If President Clinton felt ``honored'' to be
impeached, he should feel absolutely ennobled to be found in
contempt for lying under oath and subverting the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing surprises me when it comes to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   I fully expect Clinton's public approval ratings to once again
jump skyward following U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright's
withering 32-page ruling that found Clinton had lied and misled the
court in his successful attempt to violate a plaintiff's right to
important information that could have supported her claim of sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recently told CBS news anchor Dan Rather that he felt no
shame for being only the second president in U.S. history to be
impeached. He felt ``honored'' to defend the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was revealed in 1992 that he avoided military service
by dodging the draft, I have not associated Clinton with the
concept of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The incontrovertible proof that Clinton was a draft dodger
didn't bother me as much as the fact that he was a dishonorable
draft dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Honor is the adherence to principles considered right despite
personal risks. Clinton didn't like the military. He opposed the
war in Vietnam. He didn't want to be drafted. But rather than
adhere to his principles, he gave false, misleading and evasive
information to avoid the draft. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   That was my big break with Clinton. David S. Broder, the
Washington Post's respected political columnist, has said that
early revelation of Clinton's lack of character should have been a
tip-off of problems to come.
</P>
<P>
   Other tip-offs during Clinton's first presidential campaign
included the Gennifer Flowers revelations. Clinton not only lied to
the American people about their affair, he was heard on tapes
telling Flowers how to get away with lying.
</P>
<P>
   Still eight months away from election day, Clinton and his spin
experts honed the art of changing the subject to deflect
allegations of misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Women who made allegations against Clinton had their reputations
trashed. The people behind the allegations were accused of being
involved in a radical-right conspiracy to ruin an honorable man who
just wanted to help America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor'' puts principle first. Clinton can be trusted to put
Clinton first.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder it became necessary to order all men and women in the
U.S. military to not make denigrating remarks about Clinton, who
now orders these men and women to risk their lives in foreign
military actions.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that Judge Wright held Clinton in contempt of court
for ``clear and convincing evidence'' that he gave ``false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process,'' other news reports told how there appears to be
no firm evidence that Osama bin Laden commanded the bombing of two
American embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered dramatic airstrikes in Sudan and Afghanistan to
punish bin Laden for ordering the bombing of the two embassies.
That order, and another directed at Saddam Hussein's forces in
Iraq, deflected attention from Clinton's rapidly escalating
Whitewater problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton not only lied under oath to Judge Wright, he also
disobeyed her order by discussing his testimony with his private
secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's contempt citation will be forwarded to the bar
association. Clinton should be disbarred for violating the canon
prohibiting ``dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it wouldn't surprise me if Clinton felt
``honored'' by the disbarment and that his approval ratings go up
again.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The pro-Serb view
 &HT;    By Danielle S. Sremac
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton and Slobodan Milosevic have much more in common
than one might think. Both are conducting military activities that
are resulting in the injury and death of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's attempt to disarm and disband the terrorist KLA has
resulted in Albanian civilian casualties. Clinton, in his attacks
against the sovereign nation of Yugoslavia is killing innocent
Serbian and Albanian civilians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are strong-willed, are not known for backing down, and
are generally mistrusted by the people they lead. Both leaders'
military pursuits are resulting in a staggering number of refugees.
Fighting by Yugoslav forces against the KLA has sent people fleeing
from Kosovo, while NATO bombings have compelled an even greater
number to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between the two is that Milosevic is
seeking a political settlement for Kosovo, while Clinton wants to
continue bombing _ with no exit strategy in sight.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Kosovo crisis, Clinton decided the proper
role for the United States would be that of police, judge, jury and
executioner. He dispatched his officials to Rambouillet, France, to
force a NATO ``police plan`` on the Serbs that would eventually
lead to the loss of sovereignty over the Serbian homeland of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing full well that Serbs would not accept this, Clinton, in
terms reminiscent of 1939 Germany, gave an ultimatum that
essentially said: ``Give up your land, let us occupy it, or we will
bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   While couched in terms of ``preventing a humanitarian crisis''
or ``stopping ethnic cleansing`` or fighting genocide, this war is
really nothing more than naked aggression by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, development of more democratic
international institutions, such as the United Nations, have proven
to be a preferable and effective means of resolving disputes
between nations, instead of fighting wars. It is striking that
Clinton has chosen to ignore the very body that was created to
handle such international disputes.
</P>
<P>
   By spearheading the bombing of Yugoslavia, Clinton has
jeopardized the very existence of the U.N. and undermined the core
values of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   While the Serbian people are inundated by a constant barrage of
rationalizations for Clinton's war of aggression through CNN, BBC
and other Western media sources, Clinton has not, and will not
convince the Serbian people that his actions are justified. What
they see in the Western media is unconvincing, one-sided and so
simplistic that if not for the bombs falling, it would be laughed
off as extreme naivete, sound bite policy, or feel-good liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs are the ultimate message to the Serbian people: Give up
Kosovo, or we will destroy you. That is a painful and difficult
message to a people that view Kosovo as their Jerusalem. For
centuries, empires and despots have conquered this land, and
subjugated the Serbs to harsh tyrannical rule. The 20th century saw
a degree of independence, but life in the Balkans was never as free
as hoped for. Serbs looked forward to the end of the Cold War as a
time when the nation would grow and prosper.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh reality has been quite the opposite. War, seven years
of sanctions, and now attacks by a former World War II ally have
shaken their faith in the new world order. It looks and feels too
much like the old world order.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs will continue to resist as they have become accustomed to
doing over the last millennium. They too have the strong desire for
freedom and independence that Americans had over 200 years ago.
They do not want to fight America for that freedom, but have no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, throughout this crisis, it has been the Russians
leading the way, by taking the moral high ground; seeking
negotiations, and speaking out against aggression. Russia is
holding up a mirror so that America can better see what it has
become.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn said of the
Kosovo conflict, ``Casting off the United Nations and its charter,
NATO is imposing on the whole world and the next century, an
ancient law ... whoever's strongest is right. In the eyes of
humanity, a wonderful European country is being destroyed, and
civilized governments are applauding.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wise for Clinton to look into that mirror, and see
himself as others do.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late for peace in Yugoslavia. It is not too late
to end the carnage and human suffering on all sides. And it is time
to re-examine what America stands for and what made this nation
great. It is a true statesman who is able to resist the urge to use
the tools of destruction in favor of negotiation. Let us see what
Clinton's legacy will be.

 &HT;    Net site's message: Don't panic
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Companies and universities are increasingly turning to
the Internet in their crusade to rout the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web to post status reports and inform
employees about how to make their computers recognize the Year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple good examples in metro Atlanta of how
organizations are using the Web, one of which is Emory Unversity's
Rollins School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   This school, which specializes in disease prevention research,
is ahead of the pack. It began correcting its computer systems
about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's taking the campaign to its administrators, faculty and
students through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our Web page is to get information out there,''
says William Morse, the school's director of information services.
``There were a lot of people panicking about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put a human face on the problem and take away the
fear,'' Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the school's site states up front that it will be
Y2K-ready at the end of the year. ``Our message is: Don't panic,''
says Morse.
</P>
<P>
   While the school has fixed its networks and servers, there is
still a lot of work to be done. Next, Morse is focusing on the
desktop and portable computers at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In fixing these computers, Morse must first combat the fear of
the unknown. He does that through his school's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Morse has on the site a complete and easy-to-understand
explanation of the Y2K bug and its origin. It says, for example,
that programmers in the 1950s and 1960s conserved the limited
memory available at the time by programming ``dates without the
first two digits. They knew about 2000, but expected that the
software they wrote then would be long gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins' site gives a blow-by-blow account of what the school is
doing to fix the Y2K bug. That includes what has been done so far
and what is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Morse and his team are moving onto desktop and portable
computers. ``A lot of people don't realize how complicated the
issue with desktops can be,'' says Morse.

 &HT;    That bonanza, or better teachers: You choose, Texas
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The last time Texas cut property taxes you took
the difference, bought a yacht, sailed the world and then started
your own business with the change left in your pocket. Didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   All right, well, what did you do with your tax cut?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't get one? But you did _ the biggest tax cut in Texas'
history. If I heard it said once during the campaign I heard it 300
times.
</P>
<P>
   Where did that $1 billion tax cut go? In lots of cities like
Waco, school districts raised taxes. Locally, what I did with my
tax cut was pay for school construction. I have no regrets. I voted
yes for Waco school bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature is talking about another, bigger tax cut, but
not as big as a campaigning George Bush was talking about. He
wanted $2 billion. A bill by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, backed
by Senate leadership would cut property taxes $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   I know, you can't wait to get your hands on your share of that.
How much? Well, use the handy calculation used on the Senate floor
by Sen. David Cain, D-Dallas. The Bivins tax cut amounts to about
$5 a month for the owner of a $60,000 home. Enough, pointed out
Cain, to buy a Big Mac, fries and a Coke.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a $40,000 house, deduct the fries. And that may
satisfy you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, let's say we directed that money to teacher
salaries. We would be making a huge statement about the value of
teachers _ versus, say, the value of grilled beef patties.
</P>
<P>
   The Bivins bill also includes a pay increase for teachers. The
state would pick up 100 percent of teachers' contribution to the
Teacher Retirement System (TRS) instead of about half of it as it
does now. That equates roughly to a raise of $2,000 a year on
average, based on income.
</P>
<P>
   Just passing the Bivins bill would not make this so. Texas
voters would have to amend the Constitution, which caps the state's
TRS contribution.
</P>
<P>
   A raise of this nature is welcome, but still would leave Texas
roughly $4,000 below the national average for teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Cain wants to make a major leap,
compensation-wise. He wants to exchange Bivins' $2,000-and-a-Big
Mac compensation package for a $4,000-a-year average raise by
forgoing the tax cut. Cain's bill still wouldn't elevate Texas to
the nation's average. But what an elevation it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone agrees that we don't pay teachers enough.
Unfortunately, the teacher pay issue continually, conveniently gets
hung up on rhetorical dodges.
</P>
<P>
   One dodge is the concern that we have some bad teachers in the
bunch, and we shouldn't reward them. We should fire them.
</P>
<P>
   No argument, there. But no one seems to acknowledge that one
reason why we have some bad teachers, or conversely, why we don't
draw or retain more good ones, is that we offer so little _ an
average starting salary of $21,240.
</P>
<P>
   If a $4,000 raise means we're rewarding bad teachers, at least
we'd be inviting better ones to come compete for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Never considered, on the subject of teacher pay, is the amount
to which teachers subsidize the state _ buying supplies, display
material, classroom furniture, name it. One focus group of teachers
estimated convincingly that they spend the equivalent of a week's
salary making their classrooms special places where learning takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   So those of you who complain about teachers having it easy _ you
know, long summer break and all _ don't know how easy you have it
as taxpayers because of teachers' professional devotion.
</P>
<P>
   With what teachers get in return, we can't be surprised at
alarming attrition rates, at the number of teachers hanging on
lawmakers' every word and of a mind to say, ``Take your Big Mac
and. . . .''
</P>

 &HT;    Tomorrow is another sequel
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now that efforts to get Pat Conroy to write a sequel
to Margaret Mitchell's classic Old South saga are gone with the
wind, the search is on for another candidate who can resume the
story of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara. Finding someone of
Conroy's stature, though, may be as difficult as locating the real
Tara.
</P>
<P>
   One problem any writer will face is overcoming the restrictions
that lawyers for the Mitchell estate have specified: no
miscegenation, no homosexuality and no dead Scarlett.
</P>
<P>
   That ruled out Conroy's tongue-in-cheek suggestion of opening
with Rhett and Ashley Wilkes lying in bed after making love.
``Ashley,'' Conroy has Rhett saying, ``did I ever tell you my
grandmother was black?''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta native and author of ``The Prince of Tides'' was
considered a good choice because of his glowing introduction to the
60th anniversary edition of ``Gone With the Wind,'' in which he
describes the novel as his late mother's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy, who says he backed out of the multimillion-dollar deal
over a dispute about legal fees, is the second strike for St.
Martin's Press. A manuscript by British writer Emma Tennant, author
of two Jane Austen sequels, was rejected for not being Southern
enough.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's acquired the rights for a second sequel for $4.5
million after Warner Books published the critically savaged but
commercially successful ``Scarlett'' by Alexandra Ripley in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's back to square one. To facilitate the publisher's
search, we asked some Southern authors how they would approach a
sequel _ if they had no restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct is to say: Why don't we have no more sequels,''
said Lee Smith, a North Carolina writer renowned for her strong
female characters (``Saving Grace,'' ``Fair and Tender Ladies'').
``I think it's time to bury those old stereotypes and get on with
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But assuming somebody is going to write a sequel, other writers
had ideas, from making Scarlett a shoe shopaholic to having Mammy
turn Tara into a bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rivers Siddons (``Peachtree Road,'' ``Low Country''): ``I
like the approach that Pat was going to take, telling the story
from Rhett Butler's point of view. I would do that, or tell it from
the perspective of a black person _ maybe Prissy. The problem is
that readers don't want Scarlett to change, and you can't write a
novel in which the main character doesn't grow and change. It would
be a wonderful thing to have her die. That way she would never get
old. It's about the only thing we could do that would let us
forgive her.''
</P>
<P>
   Siddons, a former Atlanta writer, lives in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Jill McCorkle (``Final Vinyl Days,'' ``Carolina Moon''): ``I
would reunite Scarlett and Rhett after an appropriate period of
suffering. Rhett would come home and they would move to a
downscaled, smaller house. They would have some more children, but
no horses on the property and a lot of dogs. Maybe they would
become early civil rights activists and maybe that poor old
Suellen, who always got shafted and had her men stolen away, can
take Ashley and they could be boring and quiet together. No matter
what happens, I can't imagine Scarlett with anyone but Rhett.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, a North Carolina native, lives in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   E. Lynn Harris (``Abide With Me,'' ``This Too Shall Pass''): ``I
would open the book with Tara in bankruptcy. Prissy would win $85
million in the Georgia lottery and buy it. Rhett and Scarlett would
have to work for her and live in the guest quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a former Atlantan, divides his time between Chicago and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Kay (``The Kidnapping of Aaron Greene,'' ``To Dance With
the White Dog''): ``I'd do the same thing Pat (Conroy) was going to
do and write from the perspective of Rhett Butler. You could have
him going to New England and becoming a powerful political figure.
The center of the book would still have to be the relationship
between Scarlett and Rhett.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay, a former Atlantan, lives in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Blount Jr. (``Be Sweet: A Conditional Love Story''): ``I
would go back a ways, to the point where Melanie and Mammy
sacrifice their lives, fighting back to back with household
implements, in a last-ditch defense of Atlanta. Their heart-lifting
biracial martyrdom turns the tide and the South wins the war. In
the final rout of Grant at Second Gettysburg, Scarlett's husband,
Frank Kennedy, trying desperately to get wounded and win her
sympathy, becomes the last Confederate fatality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still in her widow's weeds, Scarlett manipulates Ashley into
running for president of the Confederate States of America because
being first lady might be nice, though she is put out with Mammy
for dying _ Prissy is going to be useless at getting her into her
inauguration gown. At the nominating convention, Ashley proposes
that slavery be phased out ``with all deliberate speed.'' Rhett
rescues him from an angry mob. All the Confederate States secede
from each other except for the Georgia Freedom Delegation and New
Orleans, and they don't really get along. Scarlett thinks it is all
foolishness. She decides it was Rhett she wanted all along, but he
and Ashley have decided to go out West together. In a fit of pique,
she breaks up the marriage of Robert E. Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a former Atlantan, lives in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dori Sanders (``Clover,'' ``Her Own Place''): ``Maybe I would
have Mammy ironing Scarlett's hair every night and keeping her
under control by threatening to tell Rhett and Ashley about her
`dark secret.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is a South Carolina peach farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Gurganus (``Plays Well With Others,'' ``Oldest Living
Confederate Widow Tells All''): ``I congratulate that gentle
spirit, Pat Conroy, on escaping a fate worse than Sherman's march
to the sea. My own new version of Miss Mitchell's novel springs
from the voice of the only decent person in the book (Miss Mellie
excepted): Mammy _ Hattie McDaniel _ with help from a small
business loan and an advance from Rhett, refinances Tara, which is
now a thriving bed-and-breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place's haggard, oft-divorced, much-lifted hostess is none
other than a creaky yet indomitable Scarlett herself. The hoop
skirt is a retread. She is an ill-tempered, dreadful employee who
hates to give the tours again to `these washed-out Yankees.'
Scarlett survives on their tips and on Brandy Alexanders. The plot
involves Mexican-American laborers outflanking Scarlett's own will
to work. Prissy is an ob-gyn nurse, admittedly terrible in
interviews, bad under pressure, and unemployed since 1866.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, Rhett died in an early Viagra experiment. Ashley Wilkes
has finally `come out' and now manages a chic guest house in Key
West called Twelve Palms. Mammy's character, the hub of Tara all
along, is revealed to have been the single human center of both the
book and the plantation (now equipped with handsome banquet
facilities).
</P>
<P>
   ``What fee do I expect for a new novel subtitled `Oldest Living
Freed Slave Now Owns All'? Merely enough to guarantee that neither
I nor any member of my family, so help me God, will ever go hungry
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurganus is a North Carolina writer.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina author Kaye Gibbons (``On the Occasion of My Last
Afternoon,'' ``Ellen Foster'') concocts a plot wherein Prissy has
Rhett Butler's love child after she runs off with Frederick
Douglass. The baby is born deaf, mute and legless and becomes a
beggar. ``He roams the streets of Atlanta beating a tin drum to
raise money to eat brunch at the Ritz-Carlton, and starts a school
for witless novelists. Scarlett, a frenzied shopaholic, is his
first published student,'' Gibbons expounds. ``She blows her hefty
advance on shoes, and to make ends meet, is forced to waitress at a
barbecue hut, all the while awaiting the publication of her first
novel.. . .''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there would be a sequel.

 &HT;    Author explores Hispaniola
 &HT;    By Michael Shashoua
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ Americans may not know very much about
Hispaniola, but they're starting to, says Michele Wucker, author of
a new book about the island, ``Why the Cocks Fight: Dominicans,
Haitians and the Struggle for Hispaniola'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, $27.50,
281 pages).
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Dominican Republic goes, this will give people
some image of it at all,'' Wucker said. ``With Sammy Sosa and the
relief efforts for Hurricane Georges last year, Americans got some
idea of it. I'm surprised they haven't gotten more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in my family asked me if I was going there to eat
tacos. Really, you couldn't get tacos except as some delicacy
imported from Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. having sent troops to Haiti twice and the
Dominican Republican twice in this century, and one million of each
nationality living in the U.S., the island has a bigger effect on
America than many Americans realize, Wucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a huge impact in Florida and the Northeast, but a
lot of Americans aren't as aware of how big an impact the island
has,'' she said. ``I hope the book gives a human face to both
countries. I also hope by looking at how two countries in unusual
circumstances share an island, it can be a model for issues we're
facing in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Wucker first became interested in the island's culture as an
international relations student at Rice University. She first
visited the island in 1988 on a grant from the school to study the
effect of language on relations between its two countries, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti. Her interest in this particular topic
came from her own background.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was through Belgium, of all things,'' Wucker said. ``My
family's from there, and we're split between French and Flemish.
Going out to market every day, you had to figure out what language
to use. Through my experience, I wanted to see whether getting
through cultural and language differences made it possible to get
past political differences.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to the island several times in the past decade to
report stories as a journalist for a Dominican newspaper in New
York City and for publications including Newsweek and the Christian
Science Monitor. Over the years, she came to see the challenges the
island faces as similar to those faced by the U.S. The way the
island nations contend with these challenges is different, Wucker
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk much more openly about race,'' she said, describing
the tensions between Haiti's darker-skinned black people and
Dominicans, who have a lighter complexion. ``It's not like in the
Midwest (where Wucker grew up), where you don't mention `difficult'
things. People accept it and acknowledge it, unlike in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the Cocks Fight'' and its analysis of Hispaniola history
sprang from gaining a deeper understanding of their cultures,
Wucker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I was looking at language and culture as part of the
reasons. The longer I spent, the more I realized it was just a
mask,'' she said. ``It was a symptom, not a cause. The real issues
affecting them were immigration, poverty and the strongman
governments they had. I started to see it as similar to things
going on in the U.S., like the controversy over Proposition 187 in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both here and there, when an immigration issue comes up, it
usually coincides with (politicans) exploiting a weakness for their
own ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wucker's book ties together Hispaniola history of the last two
centuries with very recent events, such as Haiti's 1991 coup and
the ensuing effects of U.S. refugee policy toward the country. Even
100-year-old conflicts between Haiti and the Dominican Republic
still are fresh in the minds of many, she found.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was covering Haiti for the Spanish-language paper, just
mentioning Haiti you would have someone going ballistic about
something that happened in 1822, like it was yesterday,'' Wucker
said. ``In Haiti, people hear the word `Dominican' and they get
very defensive. It boils under the surface. It's such a good story
_ the history, the wild characters in both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Those characters include men who participate in cockfighting,
training stables of roosters like prize racehorses. Wucker shows
how, for example, in the Dominican Republic, it's a metaphor for
the country's political history; and how it's also a metaphor for
the rivalry between that country and Haiti. Yet she also carries
that history forward by exploring the current politics and
economics of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``History does repeat itself. They have the colonial legacy of a
strongman leader who's above everyone else and that myth is very
damaging,'' Wucker said. ``But they're at a turning point. Both
countries have freely elected leaders. I don't want to sound too
American by saying elections fix everything, but I have seen a new
openness and diversity in people allowed to express themselves
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between the two countries, once unheard of, has
begun in order to further economic interests. Wucker points to
their joint application to Europe's Lome Convention, a trade
agreement, which other Carribean nations who joined desired for
political reasons. With business interests such as these, and
economic exchange occasioned in part by contributions to political
campaigns and hurricane relief in their home countries, the
Dominican Republic and Haiti are also gaining perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking engagements in major U.S. cities this winter
coinciding with the publication of her book, Wucker is still
learning about the two countries and the two peoples, both in their
home countries and here in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the adults it's much better,'' she said, describing how
Haitian-Americans and Dominican-Americans get along. ``One woman
(at one of the events) told me, `I'm a teacher, and the school kids
from each culture insult each other.' But kids will always find
ways to insult each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Wucker's audiences marvel at her ability to moderate
fervent discussions that occur when Dominicans or Haitians speak or
ask questions at her talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm this little `gringa,' you know,'' she said. ``But my
Dominican friends call me `apatanada,' which means `affected by the
plantains' or `addicted to the plantains,' which are a staple of
their diet.''

 &HT;    The Chicken Soup phenomenon
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Peter Vegso was sitting in an airport
when his life changed. It was just another manuscript submitted to
his publishing company, but this one provoked an unusual response _
it made Vegso cry.
</P>
<P>
   Vegso did not know that Chicken Soup for the Soul by Jack
Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen had been turned down by 33
publishers, i.e. everybody in New York. He did not know that his
Health Communications, Inc. of Deerfield Beach, Fla. was the the
34th firm to peruse the manuscript, nor would he have cared.
</P>
<P>
   The book worked for him, therefore he would publish it.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, read the statistics and wonder: Chicken Soup
for the Soul, published in 1993, has sold 7.4 million copies; A 2nd
Helping of Chicken Soup for the Soul, published in the spring of
1995, has sold 3.1 million. The sum total of sales for the 21
titles _ so far _ in the series is 33 million copies, in 30
languages, including Thai, Malay and Serbian. No wonder Time
magazine called it ``the publishing phenomenon of the decade.'' At
one point in mid-1998, five of the ten slots on Publisher's Weekly
paperback best-seller list were Chicken Soup titles.
</P>
<P>
   The flood continues unabated. There are three Chicken Soup books
for the first half of this year alone. Chicken Soup for the
Couple's Soul was published in January, A Sixth Bowl of Chicken
Soup for the Soul this month and Chicken Soup for the Golfer's Soul
in May. For a niche publisher in Deerfield Beach, it can't get much
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that we moved into books almost by
accident,'' says Vegso, a lanky, relaxed, reserved man. ``We had
everything in place for printing magazines and brochures, so we
figured we might as well use the equipment to print and distribute
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Health Communications is headquartered in an industrial park in
Deerfield Beach, unremarkable in all aspects except that Health
Communications spreads over most of the space.
</P>
<P>
   The company began in Toronto, and when Vegso and his partner
Gary Seidler needed a change, they moved to Florida in 1976. Their
initial publication was a magazine for alcohol and drug
rehabilitation, but Vegso and Seidler _ who has since retired to
Beverly Hills _ did at least as much organizing and promoting of
conferences for counselors and therapists as they did publishing.
It was a living.
</P>
<P>
   Health Communication's first hit was Adult Children of
Alcoholics, which has moved a million copies a year since 1989.
Also successful was John Bradshaw's Healing the Shame That Binds
You, boilerplate for the recovery industry. Revenues peaked at $17
million in 1990, then went into a precipitous decline till they
bottomed out at a little more than $4 million in 1992. Employees
were laid off, and the situation was, if not ominous, difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment industry got into trouble,'' says Vegso.
``Managed care came along and told all the 30-day programs to cut
it to 11, then five, and then do it on an out-patient basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment community caved in, and treatment publishing did
too. But along came the Chicken Soup manuscript riding to the
rescue like the cavalry in an old western.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his emotional reaction to the book, Vegso had a hunch
about the writers. ``Our farm system for authors has always been
the conference system, people who could speak and communicate their
ideas to people. Between them, Jack and Mark were doing 150
speeches a year. It was direct selling all around the country. I
figured we could break even on their audience alone.''
</P>
<P>
   This is classic niche publishing to a pre-set market, an
anomalous sidebar to the conventions of New York publishing, where
executives know if a book is going to make it within a month or two
of publication. Vegso, on the other hand, says that Health
Communications can wait as long as two years before they have a
good idea of how a book will do.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the key is owning everything _ the presses, the
art direction, the binding, everything. Nearly every step in the
book production process is done in-house, which is also 180 degrees
away from conventional publishing practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why farm profit out?'' he asks. ``Keep it in the building.''
Health Communications can print, bind and ship 100,000 books every
three days.
</P>
<P>
   Also anomalous for the publishing business is the fact that
Health Communications doesn't pay advances, but they offer a very
hefty royalty of 15-20 percent right off the bat. Canfield says
that he and his partner split 20 cents for every dollar that comes
in, a royalty rate beyond that of all but the Grisham/King axis of
bestselling authors.
</P>
<P>
   So Canfield and Hansen were, shall we say, motivated to a higher
plane of shamelessness. When their initial Chicken Soup book was
published, they asked friends to buy 100 books each and give them
to sell to other friends. They persuaded Celestial Seasonings to
print little stories from the book on their tea boxes.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't feel they had a choice. ``In our minds, publishers
throw the books out, and whatever stuck to the wall, they'd put ad
money behind,'' says Canfield. ``Our commitment was that we would
do five things a day for a year. We would mail books to
celebrities, go into newspapers and ask if anybody was willing to
interview us, do radio shows at three in the morning in Sioux
Falls, wherever that is, a lot of low-level stuff. But our belief
was that every person that liked the book would tell five others.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the Chicken Soup books are full of brief
little inspirational stories and poems that tell you that there is
hope, that people can survive anything, that children are wise,
that puppies are adorable and that life is worth living. Each book
contains 101 stories _ ``a spiritual number'' according to Canfield
_ of two to three pages each.
</P>
<P>
   The first book was the culmination of 20 years of Hansen and
Canfield's speaking careers. More than half of the stories had been
used in their speeches, deriving from Reader's Digest, Parade,
Guideposts, or motivational speakers such as Tony Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   The seeding process took about a year after publication. Then
things started to happen, and the book began moving in large
numbers. It still is. All this resulted in earnings of $85 million
for Health Communications in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is issuing 30 to 50 books a year. There are
Chicken Soup for the Soul records on the Rhino label, a TV show on
PAX-TV. Employment is up to 120, and the company has 400 books in
print.
</P>
<P>
   What the Chicken Soup series has meant for Health Communications
is, obviously, money. Beyond that, and nearly as bankable, is
credibility. ``Six years ago, we would publish about 4,000 copies
of a new book,'' says Vegso. ``Now we publish 10,000-12,000. Our
titles get more of a chance in the marketplace. K-mart and Wal-Mart
are selling tremendous numbers of books for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegso has brilliantly cross-promoted the series, packaging the
books with other products; Chicken Soup for the Pet Lovers Soul is
going out with Iams dog food. A Chicken Soup excerpt is going out
with Diet Coke, along with samplers from authors Barbara Taylor
Bradford, Elmore Leonard and Maeve Binchy.
</P>
<P>
   The demographics for the Chicken Soup books are interesting.
Buyers are 85 percent female, between the ages of 25 and 55. Half
of them are married, and they read an average of four Chicken Soup
books.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen and Canfield have no fear of saturation; they plan 30
more books in the next few years, including tomes on the sailor's
soul, the prisoner's soul, and the country soul. Clearly, there is
no escape, at least not until sales drop off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year sales have gone up,'' says Canfield. ``Last year we
sold something over 13 million Chicken Soup books; the year before
that it was 11 million, but the curve is more gradual now.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegso is attempting to create other franchises to take up the
inevitable slackening of the Chicken Soup brand name. They've
already introduced Tasteberry Tales: Stories to Lift the Spirit,
Fill the Heart and Feed the Soul, as well as Puppies for Sale and
Other Inspirational Tales.
</P>
<P>
   Vegso will soon be opening Reading, Etc. at his building, a sort
of New Age reading accessory store with a motif borrowed from
Harrod's Egyptian room. ``It will be fully feng-shui,'' he
promises. That will accompany the Bikram yoga room that much of the
staff enters after a long day's work for an hour or so of
rejuvenation before the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be able to publish material that's helpful to
people,'' says Vegso. ``Bringing pleasure makes a difference.''

 &HT;    In praise of chives
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the beginning, there were chives.
</P>
<P>
   Long before basil can be planted, before the bitter leaves of
thyme have given way to fresh new growth, even before the newly
sown lettuces come close to harvest, chives burst from the earth
and soar.
</P>
<P>
   For those who love eating from the garden, chives are a tonic,
and snipping them for an evening meal is the first ritual harvest.
</P>
<P>
   So much reward for so little work. Chives, and their cousin
garlic chives, are the ultimate perennial herb. You can't kill
them. In fact, you can barely keep garlic chives in check, for
their fall seed heads scatter plants across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But ordinary chives just keep growing, the clump a little bigger
each year, but still not multiplying too fast. Division may be
necessary every eight to 10 years. Well, you can do it after five,
but if you forget to count the plant is forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Chives are the place any wannabe herb gardener _ or cook _
should start. The herb is accessible to even a novice cook who so
far has nothing beyond dried parsley on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the plant nearly indestructible, the season when it
is fresh lasts longer than virtually any other, from the earliest
of spring to late fall. That's a good reason never to resort to
dried chives, which bear no resemblance to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Chives add not only a mild onion flavor but a touch of
presentation. Minced leaves _ and those long, hollow stems are
indeed leaves _ add a shower of green. The mauve flowers _ or the
cluster of white, star-shaped blossoms on garlic chives _ can be
separated with a pinch of the fingers and scattered over salads,
soups and even pasta.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of snipped chives is the quintessential pairing with
new potatoes that are equally symbolic of spring. Some cooks never
get beyond this use, or limit chives to creamy dips and toppings
for baked potatoes. But there are other natural pairings: with eggs
in all manner of dishes from scrambled to deviled, with creamy,
mild cheeses, and grains such as rice, couscous and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   While this gentle herb is never the star of the show, chives add
to the performance when the main course is salmon, grilled, poached
and especially smoked.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best, and most overlooked, combinations pairs chives
with citrus such as lemon or orange in sauces for grilled meats,
poultry, seafood and vegetables.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the hundreds of opinion polls reported by all the news
media in the last few years of crises, I have never been polled. In
fact, I personally don't know anyone who has ever been contacted.
How can I have my opinion counted?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't volunteer. The Gallup Organization says its polls
are conducted by telephone using the process of probability
sampling. A computer uses random digit dialing to create phone
numbers from a list of all telephone exchanges, which allows
unlisted numbers to be called as well as listed numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gallup, the typical sample size for a poll deemed
to represent an adequate cross-section of the U.S. population is
1,000 adults. Your chance of being among them presumably is the
same as anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen any pictures of the pilot of the Stealth
fighter that was downed in Yugoslavia. What happened to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pilot of the F-117 fighter-bomber, brought down March 27
by as-yet unspecified causes, has not been identified by the
military. That's why you haven't seen a photo. As previously
reported, the pilot bailed out of his Nighthawk, parachuted to
earth, and was rescued within six hours by U.S. helicopter-borne
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the total length of the U.S. coastline, plus its
borders with Canada and Mexico? We're wondering how long a fence
would have to be to completely surround the contiguous states.
</P>
<P>
   A: Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the coastline is 4,993 miles
long. The U.S.-Canadian border is 3,987 miles and the U.S.-Mexico
border is about 1,933 miles (1993 boundary agreement). That adds up
to 10,913 miles. Your hypothetical fence would have to be much
longer to follow shoreline, as opposed to coastline. But that's a
different issue, involving harbors, bays, even islands, so we won't
get into that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that five pages were taken out of Anne Frank's
diary by her father before it was published. Were those pages ever
printed?
</P>
<P>
   A: An Amsterdam newspaper, Het Parool, published extracts of the
newly discovered pages last August, immediately running afoul of
the powerful Anne Frank Fund in Basel, Switzerland. In taking legal
action, the fund, which owns the copyright for the diary, argued
that the newspaper had violated its copyright by publishing the
material. But the newspaper said it had received permission from
Cor Suijk, international director of the Anne Frank Center, USA,
after he authorized the inclusion of the pages in the book ``Anne
Frank _ The Biography,'' by Melissa Muller. In November, a Dutch
court ruled in favor of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected that the missing diary entry _ written on Feb. 8,
1944, on five sides of three looseleaf pages _ will be published in
an updated version of ``The Diary of a Young Girl'' when the issue
of ownership has been resolved. It's hoped that this could happen
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The missing pages contain Anne Frank's observations of the
marriage of her parents, according to Suijk. Otto Frank, Anne's
father, ``got letters from many women, married and single, and he
didn't want people to think he was not such a wonderful husband,''
Suijk said. Otto Frank, who died in 1980, didn't want the missing
pages published in his lifetime. Suijk said another reason for the
father's keeping the pages out of the public eye was his fear that
as long as he or his second wife were alive, they could be
confronted with questions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the two guys who ran onto the field to congratulate
Hank Aaron after he hit his 715th home run? Where are they now?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 8, 1974, two 17-year-olds from Waycross ran onto the
field at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and into seemingly every
Hank Aaron highlight collection since. They were detained briefly
by Atlanta police after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Courtnay, now 42, has two children and works as an
optometrist in Valdosta. Britt Gaston, also 42, has two children of
his own and owns a graphic supply business in Isle of Palms, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had plans to attend Thursday's anniversary celebration.
Courtnay, after a long day at the clinic, managed to catch a few
minutes of the game when he returned home. Gaston was busy coaching
his son's baseball team at the time. His wife, however, taped the
ceremony for him so he could watch it later.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the expression ``coin a phrase'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: To ``coin a phrase'' means to frame or invent a new phrase,
much like the minting of new currency. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, the sentiment appeared as early as 1589. George
Puttenham, a contemporary of Shakespeare, talked in ``The Arte of
English Poesie'' of young scholars who would ``coigne fine wordes''
to impress their friends. In this context, the phrase was used
disdainfully, liking the action to the work of a counterfeiter.
</P>
<P>
   In modern usage, the Oxford dictionary's earliest citation of
the phrase, itself, being coined was an appearance in modern
British writer Francis Brett Young's ``Mr. Lucton's Freedom.'' ``It
takes all sorts to make a world,'' Young wrote in 1940, ``to coin a
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the payout to the retailer who sells a single winning
Big Game jackpot ticket? Is it a flat fee or a percentage?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Star Market, in Boston, where the winning Big Game ticket
was sold, earned a $50,000 bonus from the Massachusetts State
Lottery Commission. Had the winning ticket been sold in Georgia,
the retailer would have received $25,000. These incentive bonuses
remain fixed regardless of the jackpot size.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about Jamie Shea, the spokesman who
handles the daily Kosovo press briefings for NATO? What is his
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to a NATO biographical sketch, Shea was born in
1953 and is of British nationality. Since 1980 he has been a member
of the NATO international staff where he served in a variety of
functions, including senior planning officer and speechwriter to
the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Shea obtained a doctorate in modern history from Oxford
University, and has been an associate professor at Michigan State
University, where he taught courses on security policy and European
politics. Shea assumed his current role of NATO spokesman and
deputy director of the office of information and press on July 1,
1993.
</P>
<P>

of the daily press briefings, visit its Web site:

</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the residents of Washington, D.C., represented in
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam
and American Samoa each are represented by a delegate in the U.S.
House of Representatives. Elected by their constituents, delegates
may introduce legislation, make speeches and hold chairmanships if
their party is in the majority. Although they have voting rights in
committee, they cannot vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, has represented the
District of Columbia residents since her election in 1990. Her
spokeswoman, Donna Brazile, was quick to point out that D.C.
residents are the only American citizens who pay federal taxes but
do not have full voting representation in Congress. To this end,
Norton has consistently raised the debate over the delegate vote.
In 1993, she won the right to limited votes on the full House
floor. This decision was reversed in 1995 after the Republican
Party regained control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Norton serves on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee,
where she is ranking Democrat on the District of Columbia
subcommittee, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
She also is co-chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus.

 &HT;    Hayek a prankster with perfect almond eyes
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just five to 10 minutes, they said, and
no photos.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)No photos?!(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   ``She hasn't been made up,'' an assistant apologizes. ``You
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL) No, I do not. She'd look better after a greased pig chase
than I would after a day at Georgette Klinger. (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek, the bewitching Mexican bombshell who has boys doing
backflips, was in town recently for the Palm Beach International
Film Festival. She came for a screening of her new flick The
Velocity of Gary, but is best known for steaming, er, starring with
Antonio Banderas in 1995's Desperado. She's also a Revlon model.
</P>
<P>
   And also a tad somber. Today, anyway. Legs tucked under her,
she's perched on a couch receiving reporters one at a time.
Although a childhood prankster, Hayek, 30, isn't one to make mirth,
as if being all business will make folks take her more seriously.
(Either that, or she's never been asked which Pop-Tart is her
favorite. It's strawberry).
</P>
<P>
   With wristwatch ticking and a personal goal of seven minutes
flat, I quiz on ...
</P>
<P>
   Funniest English screwup? Transposing letters. ``I say O.B.
instead of B.O. when I mean somebody smells bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Laundry detergent? ``I have no idea, but I have a very good
maid.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst thing you did to your kid brother? ``I shaved his head
when he was about eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Colored contact lenses? ``Never in my life!'' (She has
almond-shaped brown eyes. Starlets always have almond-shaped eyes.)
</P>
<P>
   Gas or electric stove? ``Gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure flaw? ``I have one, but I am not talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Best prank in Catholic school: ``I set all the nuns' clocks back
three hours.'' (She was expelled, but not just for that.)
</P>
<P>
   Repair ripped pantyhose with nail polish or just toss 'em? ``I
throw them away. Unless they are my last pair.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas' best body part? ``His eyes. No, wait. His hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite fast-food item? ``I do not eat fast food. I eat heavy
food. Like pork.''
</P>
<P>
   Use little hotel soap or bring your own? ``I use the hotel's. I
would not stay in a place with bad soap.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite candle scent? ``Tuberose.''
</P>
<P>
   Number of failed engagements? Four.
</P>
<P>
   What gives? ``I will get married when I meet a man who has more
(chutzpah) than I do.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 2)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Something I read about the historical background of the
Serb-Albanian conflict stated that the Albanian language is related
to no other European languages. Where then does it originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most scholars believe the Albanian language is a direct
descendant of the Illyrian language. According to Encyclopedia
Britannica, the Illyrian people first settled the Balkan peninsula
and what is now modern-day Albania about 1000 B.C. Illyria was
conquered by the Romans in 168 B.C., and upon the Roman Empire's
fall was invaded consistently by neighboring empires over the next
several centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential of these was the Slavic migration of the
6th century after the crumbling of the Roman Empire. Slavic
cultural influence over the region was pervasive. Serbia, Bosnia,
Croatia and parts of Macedonia lost most of their Illyrian culture
and language. According to Nicholas C. Pano, a history professor at
Western Illinois University, the remaining Illyrians fled to the
remote mountainous areas of Albania. They fortressed into small
feudal states, which enabled them to preserve their language and
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Though Albanian is spoken by relatively few people, it is
considered its own distinct branch of the Indo-European language
family. It is one of the few unique languages of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Saturday mornings, TNT shows reruns of the ``Hondo''
series, starring Ralph Taeger. I've never seen him in any other
shows or films. What else has he starred in? And where is he today?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Hondo''was a spinoff of the 1953 John Wayne movie, adapted
from the best-selling Louis L'Amour novel of the same name. The
television series originally ran for 17 episodes in late 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Hondo,'' Taeger co-starred with James Coburn in another
short-lived adventure series, ``Klondike,'' later renamed
``Acapulco.''
</P>
<P>
   Taeger also made notable guest appearances in episodes of ``The
Twilight Zone'' and ``The Six Million Dollar Man.'' He appeared in
six films between 1960 and 1971, including ``The Carpetbaggers''in
1964, and his last one, ``The Delta Factor,'' in1971.
</P>
<P>
   Now 63, Taeger lives a relatively quiet life in Northern
California, reportedly running a firewood business and acting in
the local theater.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read a report about a Cold War Recognition Certificate
available to Cold War veterans. Could you tell me where to send the
application to receive this certificate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any member of the armed forces or any federal civilian
employee who served honorably during the Cold War era (Sept. 2,
1945, to Dec. 26, 1991) is eligible to receive the Cold War
Recognition Certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Applications must consist of two parts: a request letter, plus
documentation verifying one's service. This documentation should be
a government form that includes name, Social Security number or
military serial number or Foreign Sservice number, and the dates of
service. Do not send original documents, as they will not be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways to submit requests: mail to Cold War
Recognition, 4035 Ridge Top Road, Suite 400, Fairfax, VA 22030; or
fax to 703-275-6749; or e-mail to coldwar(at)fairfax-emh1.army.mil
</P>
<P>
   Additional information and assistance can be accessed on-line at
the program's Web site: http://coldwar.army.mil. Available help
there includes a detailed list of eligibility requirements, a
sample request letter, and an on-line request form. Another
informative link is the official web site of the Department of
Defense: http://www.defenselink.mil
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the difference between a hurricane and a tornado?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricanes and tornados are both cyclones, the word used by
scientists to refer to all spiral-shaped windstorms that circulate
in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere or in a
clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere. Otherwise, except
for both being highly destructive and potentially deadly storms,
hurricanes and tornadoes are quite dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane begins over a warm, tropical sea, with its winds
swirling around a calm central area, between 10 and 20 miles wide,
that's called the eye. The eye is encircled by storm clouds that
rise thousands of feet high. Large changes in atmospheric pressure
in the clouds create the hurricane's strong winds, which can reach
approximately 200 miles an hour although they usually are less
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   A large hurricane may extend over hundreds of square miles, and
when it hits land can cause billions of dollars in damage and
thousands of fatalities through fierce winds, torrential rain,
flooding and huge waves crashing ashore.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado, although far smaller in size than a hurricane, has
stronger, rapidly rotating winds that reach speeds as high as 300
mph. A tornado with such powerful winds can lift cattle, automobles
and mobile homes and destroy almost everything in its path.
Fortunately, most tornadoes are less severe.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes form underneath severe thunderclouds in which warm and
cold air masses are colliding. Most tornadoes, once they reach
ground, have damage paths less than 1,600 feet wide, move at about
35 mph, and last only a few minutes. Extremely destructive
tornadoes, however, may reach 1 mile in diameter, travel at 60 mph,
and last for an hour or more. Tornadoes that form over water are
called watersprouts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives
pay federal income taxes? If so, at what rate?
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. senators and representatives enjoy numerous privileges
that go with their office, but not having to pay federal income
taxes is not one of them. They, too, have to contend with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Publication 17 states, ``You must file a federal income tax
return if you are a citizen or resident of the United States or a
resident of Puerto Rico and you meet the filing requirements for
any of the categories that apply to you.'' U.S. senators and
representatives are, of course, U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The main filing requirements that determine your tax-paying
category are age, income and filing status (single, married, head
of household). These requirements determine the tax rates paid by
all taxpayers, including members of Congress. The rates range from
a low of 15 percent for low-income workers to a high of 39.6
percent for wealthier persons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Hillary Clinton offered $50 million to some
foreign country to improve its water supply. Where does she get the
authority to pledge this money?
</P>
<P>
   A: She didn't actually pledge the money; she just made the
announcement _ a timely one during her recent trip to North Africa
_ of a grant already in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting a family planning clinic in Luxor, Egypt, she
said the U.S. Agency for International Development will provide $45
million to upgrade the Luxor wastewater treatment system. Over the
past 20 years, AID, which administers the U.S. foreign aid program,
has provided $2.7 billion for water treatment in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   While in Egypt, the first lady also announced AID funding of $20
million for family planning activities and $14.5 million for
mother-child health programs there.
</P>
<P>
   Publicizing federal grants is a common political activity.
Members of Congress are quick to make the announcement when federal
funds are released for projects in their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it feasible to prepay one's funeral expenses?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is largely a question of personal choice. It is possible
to prepay funeral expenses in full, or you can buy certain items in
advance that will be needed, such as headstones. Prepaying may
bring a certain peace of mind to you, but be sure you know what you
are buying. And remember that you might move to another part of the
nation before your death.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you prepay or not, preplanning your funeral usually is
wise thing to do. Discuss your wishes with your family to ensure
your final rites will be conducted as you want. Also, preplanning
helps your survivors avoid making quick decisions and costly
mistakes by paying for a far more expensive funeral than you would
have chosen.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at
</P>
<P>
   q&AMP;a(AT)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the hundreds of opinion polls reported by all the news
media in the last few years of crises, I have never been polled. In
fact, I personally don't know anyone who has ever been contacted.
How can I have my opinion counted?
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't volunteer. The Gallup Organization says its polls
are conducted by telephone using the process of probability
sampling. A computer uses random digit dialing to create phone
numbers from a list of all telephone exchanges, which allows
unlisted numbers to be called as well as listed numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gallup, the typical sample size for a poll deemed
to represent an adequate cross-section of the U.S. population is
1,000 adults. Your chance of being among them presumably is the
same as anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I haven't seen any pictures of the pilot of the Stealth
fighter that was downed in Yugoslavia. What happened to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pilot of the F-117 fighter-bomber, brought down March 27
by as-yet unspecified causes, has not been identified by the
military. That's why you haven't seen a photo. As previously
reported, the pilot bailed out of his Nighthawk, parachuted to
earth, and was rescued within six hours by U.S. helicopter-borne
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the total length of the U.S. coastline, plus its
borders with Canada and Mexico? We're wondering how long a fence
would have to be to completely surround the contiguous states.
</P>
<P>
   A: Excluding Alaska and Hawaii, the coastline is 4,993 miles
long. The U.S.-Canadian border is 3,987 miles and the U.S.-Mexico
border is about 1,933 miles (1993 boundary agreement). That adds up
to 10,913 miles. Your hypothetical fence would have to be much
longer to follow shoreline, as opposed to coastline. But that's a
different issue, involving harbors, bays, even islands, so we won't
get into that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read that five pages were taken out of Anne Frank's
diary by her father before it was published. Were those pages ever
printed?
</P>
<P>
   A: An Amsterdam newspaper, Het Parool, published extracts of the
newly discovered pages last August, immediately running afoul of
the powerful Anne Frank Fund in Basel, Switzerland. In taking legal
action, the fund, which owns the copyright for the diary, argued
that the newspaper had violated its copyright by publishing the
material. But the newspaper said it had received permission from
Cor Suijk, international director of the Anne Frank Center, USA,
after he authorized the inclusion of the pages in the book ``Anne
Frank _ The Biography,'' by Melissa Muller. In November, a Dutch
court ruled in favor of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected that the missing diary entry _ written on Feb. 8,
1944, on five sides of three looseleaf pages _ will be published in
an updated version of ``The Diary of a Young Girl'' when the issue
of ownership has been resolved. It's hoped that this could happen
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The missing pages contain Anne Frank's observations of the
marriage of her parents, according to Suijk. Otto Frank, Anne's
father, ``got letters from many women, married and single, and he
didn't want people to think he was not such a wonderful husband,''
Suijk said. Otto Frank, who died in 1980, didn't want the missing
pages published in his lifetime. Suijk said another reason for the
father's keeping the pages out of the public eye was his fear that
as long as he or his second wife were alive, they could be
confronted with questions on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the two guys who ran onto the field to congratulate
Hank Aaron after he hit his 715th home run? Where are they now?
</P>
<P>
   A: On April 8, 1974, two 17-year-olds from Waycross ran onto the
field at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and into seemingly every
Hank Aaron highlight collection since. They were detained briefly
by Atlanta police after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Courtnay, now 42, has two children and works as an
optometrist in Valdosta. Britt Gaston, also 42, has two children of
his own and owns a graphic supply business in Isle of Palms, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had plans to attend Thursday's anniversary celebration.
Courtnay, after a long day at the clinic, managed to catch a few
minutes of the game when he returned home. Gaston was busy coaching
his son's baseball team at the time. His wife, however, taped the
ceremony for him so he could watch it later.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did the expression ``coin a phrase'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: To ``coin a phrase'' means to frame or invent a new phrase,
much like the minting of new currency. According to the Oxford
English Dictionary, the sentiment appeared as early as 1589. George
Puttenham, a contemporary of Shakespeare, talked in ``The Arte of
English Poesie'' of young scholars who would ``coigne fine wordes''
to impress their friends. In this context, the phrase was used
disdainfully, liking the action to the work of a counterfeiter.
</P>
<P>
   In modern usage, the Oxford dictionary's earliest citation of
the phrase, itself, being coined was an appearance in modern
British writer Francis Brett Young's ``Mr. Lucton's Freedom.'' ``It
takes all sorts to make a world,'' Young wrote in 1940, ``to coin a
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the payout to the retailer who sells a single winning
Big Game jackpot ticket? Is it a flat fee or a percentage?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Star Market, in Boston, where the winning Big Game ticket
was sold, earned a $50,000 bonus from the Massachusetts State
Lottery Commission. Had the winning ticket been sold in Georgia,
the retailer would have received $25,000. These incentive bonuses
remain fixed regardless of the jackpot size.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about Jamie Shea, the spokesman who
handles the daily Kosovo press briefings for NATO? What is his
background?
</P>
<P>
   A: According to a NATO biographical sketch, Shea was born in
1953 and is of British nationality. Since 1980 he has been a member
of the NATO international staff where he served in a variety of
functions, including senior planning officer and speechwriter to
the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   Shea obtained a doctorate in modern history from Oxford
University, and has been an associate professor at Michigan State
University, where he taught courses on security policy and European
politics. Shea assumed his current role of NATO spokesman and
deputy director of the office of information and press on July 1,
1993.
</P>
<P>

of the daily press briefings, visit its Web site:

</P>
<P>
   Q: How are the residents of Washington, D.C., represented in
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: The District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam
and American Samoa each are represented by a delegate in the U.S.
House of Representatives. Elected by their constituents, delegates
may introduce legislation, make speeches and hold chairmanships if
their party is in the majority. Although they have voting rights in
committee, they cannot vote on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, has represented the
District of Columbia residents since her election in 1990. Her
spokeswoman, Donna Brazile, was quick to point out that D.C.
residents are the only American citizens who pay federal taxes but
do not have full voting representation in Congress. To this end,
Norton has consistently raised the debate over the delegate vote.
In 1993, she won the right to limited votes on the full House
floor. This decision was reversed in 1995 after the Republican
Party regained control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Norton serves on the Government Reform and Oversight Committee,
where she is ranking Democrat on the District of Columbia
subcommittee, and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
She also is co-chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Something I read about the historical background of the
Serb-Albanian conflict stated that the Albanian language is related
to no other European languages. Where then does it originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most scholars believe the Albanian language is a direct
descendant of the Illyrian language. According to Encyclopedia
Britannica, the Illyrian people first settled the Balkan peninsula
and what is now modern-day Albania about 1000 B.C. Illyria was
conquered by the Romans in 168 B.C., and upon the Roman Empire's
fall was invaded consistently by neighboring empires over the next
several centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential of these was the Slavic migration of the
6th century after the crumbling of the Roman Empire. Slavic
cultural influence over the region was pervasive. Serbia, Bosnia,
Croatia and parts of Macedonia lost most of their Illyrian culture
and language. According to Nicholas C. Pano, a history professor at
Western Illinois University, the remaining Illyrians fled to the
remote mountainous areas of Albania. They fortressed into small
feudal states, which enabled them to preserve their language and
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Though Albanian is spoken by relatively few people, it is
considered its own distinct branch of the Indo-European language
family. It is one of the few unique languages of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On Saturday mornings, TNT shows reruns of the ``Hondo''
series, starring Ralph Taeger. I've never seen him in any other
shows or films. What else has he starred in? And where is he today?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Hondo''was a spinoff of the 1953 John Wayne movie, adapted
from the best-selling Louis L'Amour novel of the same name. The
television series originally ran for 17 episodes in late 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Hondo,'' Taeger co-starred with James Coburn in another
short-lived adventure series, ``Klondike,'' later renamed
``Acapulco.''
</P>
<P>
   Taeger also made notable guest appearances in episodes of ``The
Twilight Zone'' and ``The Six Million Dollar Man.'' He appeared in
six films between 1960 and 1971, including ``The Carpetbaggers''in
1964, and his last one, ``The Delta Factor,'' in1971.
</P>
<P>
   Now 63, Taeger lives a relatively quiet life in Northern
California, reportedly running a firewood business and acting in
the local theater.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read a report about a Cold War Recognition Certificate
available to Cold War veterans. Could you tell me where to send the
application to receive this certificate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any member of the armed forces or any federal civilian
employee who served honorably during the Cold War era (Sept. 2,
1945, to Dec. 26, 1991) is eligible to receive the Cold War
Recognition Certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Applications must consist of two parts: a request letter, plus
documentation verifying one's service. This documentation should be
a government form that includes name, Social Security number or
military serial number or Foreign Sservice number, and the dates of
service. Do not send original documents, as they will not be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways to submit requests: mail to Cold War
Recognition, 4035 Ridge Top Road, Suite 400, Fairfax, VA 22030; or
fax to 703-275-6749; or e-mail to coldwar(at)fairfax-emh1.army.mil
</P>
<P>
   Additional information and assistance can be accessed on-line at
the program's Web site: http://coldwar.army.mil. Available help
there includes a detailed list of eligibility requirements, a
sample request letter, and an on-line request form. Another
informative link is the official web site of the Department of
Defense: http://www.defenselink.mil
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the difference between a hurricane and a tornado?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricanes and tornados are both cyclones, the word used by
scientists to refer to all spiral-shaped windstorms that circulate
in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere or in a
clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere. Otherwise, except

 &HT;    Shaping up for the draft
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With NFL scouts eager for him to shed the 20 extra
pounds he carried to this year's combine workouts, Heisman Trophy
winner Ricky Williams undertook a formidable training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of a personal trainer, the Texas tailback
worked the weights, hit the sauna and ran wind sprints. He also
pushed a Mercedes Benz through the streets of New Orleans and
logged several miles a day on a treadmill submerged in a swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he auditioned for scouts last week, Williams checked
in at 224 pounds _ 20 pounds less than he did in February. Williams
probably made himself a few million dollars on his first NFL
contract just by getting his weight under control, even though his
40-yard times were average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, I might owe my man a bonus,'' Williams said as he
stepped off a scale at the University of California-San Diego. His
man is Tom Shaw, former Florida State sprint coach. Shaw and Chip
Smith of the Atlanta Athletic Club are two of the gurus in the
nation's hottest NFL-related business.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the annual combine workouts used to be a personal
endeavor, with college prospects laboring in solitude attempting to
shave one-tenth of a second from their 40-yard times. In the past
eight years, however, that preparation has become a burgeoning
cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important part of the whole process now,'' agent Gary
Wichard said. ``A player wants to know how you're going to help him
(be selected) higher.''
</P>
<P>
   When Shaw began his business 10 years ago, he was one of only
three trainers nationally who specialized in preparing players for
the NFL. Shaw does not advertise but still had 70 clients this year
in a program with a two-week minimum stay. ``Once you gain
credibility, they find you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's group of 40 this year was his largest. He added several
members to a staff that includes strength coaches Robbie Stewart
and Dave Allen, formerly of Georgia and Georgia Tech, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   IMG, the sports and entertainment giant, also operates a
facility, the $18 million International Performance Institute, in
Bradenton, Fla. It is strongly recommended that all clients signed
by IMG football agents Tom Condon and Ken Kremer train there under
Mark Verstagen. The facility includes on-site condominiums, large
dining areas and dietary consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time a player's season ends, up to the draft, he can
get appreciably better in all the measurable areas,'' Condon said.
``While other agents are wondering where their players are off to,
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, perhaps not as qualified, are getting into the business.
In Houston, for example, a trainer who did not return several
telephone calls, advertises ``guaranteed results'' for NFL draft
prospects. In Southern California, several gymnasiums represent
themselves as ``NFL training approved'' facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gotten tremendously competitive, and that means you
get the good and some bad,'' said Smith, whose clientele this
spring included cornerback Champ Bailey and offensive tackle Matt
Stinchcomb of Georgia. ``But we don't promote; it's strictly about
word of mouth with us. If we do our jobs, the proof is out there
for everyone to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's program of at least four weeks has attracted prospects
from all over the country. Among this year's participants were
tailback Mike Cloud and guard Doug Brzezinski of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite players this year was defensive end Nate
Stimson of Georgia Tech. Too small to play his college position in
the pros, Stimson projects to linebacker. By clocking a blazing 40
time in the low 4.4s at 260 pounds, Stimson has gone from an
undrafted free agent to possible middle-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as proud of a guy like Nate as any first-rounder we
have,'' Smith said. ``Last year, I got three phone calls from
parents who said their sons would not have been drafted without us.
That's gratifying. It's not about my resume _ it's about the
players. What we do is take their skills and refine them.''
</P>
<P>
   The players work six days a week, about three hours a day. Smith
brought many of his techniques from a 1986 stint at the Soviet
Sports Institute. Some trainers concentrate on speed; Smith prefers
to stress movements more pertinent to football that still reduce a
player's 40 time and increase the repetitions of his bench press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his philosophy, in that Chip treats every kid the same
and doesn't play favorites with the agents,'' said agent Pat Dye
Jr., who placed six players with Smith this year. ``It's not some
campout for the players, and it isn't supposed to be. It's all
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The top trainers will not disclose prices, but agents indicate
that the fees can range from $500 to $1,200 weekly per player. Most
of the agents viewed it as a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 goal in this business is helping your clients get as
much money as they can,'' Shaw said. ``The faster a guy runs, the
bigger that signing bonus.''

He did not know that his Health Communications, Inc. of Deerfield

<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECURITY (San Francisco) _ Federal authorities are
tightening security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory after
reports of spying at its sister nuclear weapons lab in New Mexico.
But the officials say they also are trying to prevent tightened
security from impeding research by burdening staffers, including
foreign visitors _ a seemingly contradictory goal. By KEAY
DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-AUDITS (San Francisco) _ For the first time ever, Northern
California has a higher percentage of people being audited by the
IRS than anywhere else in the country, according to a new study of
33 regions across the country. By MARSHA GINSBURG.
</P>
<P>
   TAXES (Albany, N.Y.) _ Ever wonder why Kool-Aid is taxed and
Tang isn't? What about baby diapers bearing taxes while similar
items for adults are tax-free? And what's the reason that
honey-roasted peanuts are taxed but salted peanuts are not? ``We
haven't the slightest idea,'' says New York state Sen. Roy Goodman,
who conducted a hearing Tuesday on the sales tax. By JAMES M.
ODATO.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT-ADS (Sacramento) _ More than ever before, the
California government wants to change the way you think. Public
officials are spending billions on new campaigns, even buying
expensive ads on prime time TV. It's called social marketing _ part
behavioral science, part propaganda, part Madison Avenue _ and it
has become the most popular political antidote to society's many
shortfalls. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSPAPERS (San Francisco) _ You're dinosaurs. But it's not all
your fault. That was the message Intel Chairman Andy Grove
delivered to a crowd of newspapers editors gathered here for the
American Society of Newspaper Editors convention. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMIT-WOMEN (San Francisco) _ More than 6,000 women are

here Friday. A major topic will be how to deal with homeless
people, 40 percent of whom are children. By GREGORY LEWIS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-PAY (San Francisco) _ The average full-time female worker
earns about 75 cents for every dollar that the average man earns.
Is that a misleading statistic, or an indicator that women still
are a long way from workplace equality? Yes, on both counts. By
DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-DAY (San Francisco) _ Since April 15 is already National
Weep About Money Day, devote a few minutes this week to pure
capitalism. If you can understand the stock market _ one of the few
places where middle-class people are earning real money these days
_ it could help your career in all sorts of ways, financial and
otherwise. By DAVE MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSPAPERS-DIVERSITY (San Francisco) A new survey of daily
newspapers finds that the proportion of minority and women
journalists falls far short of their representation in the
population at large, causing alarm among industry executives. By
JULIE CHAO.
</P>
<P>
   MACARONI (San Francisco) _ Michael Jordan's got nothing on
8-year-old Justin Ryan Cooper. Justin, a second-grader at San
Francisco's Alvarado Elementary School with a knack for art and a
taste for macaroni and cheese, will appear on 1.5 million Kraft
Macaroni &AMP; Cheese boxes to be distributed nationally beginning in
September. By GREGORY LEWIS.

</P>
<P>
   AFRICAN-FOOD (Houston) _ The Houston International Festival will
offer many of those in attendance their first tastes of biltong
(jerkylike air-dried meat strips), bobotie (South African-style
meatloaf), boerewors (farmer's sausage) and other authentic foods
from southern Africa. By ANN CRISWELL. With: AFRICAN-FOOD-RECIPES
</P>
<P>
   COLOR-FOOD (Albany, N.Y.) _ You're at the grocery store. You see
the candy bar. You grab the candy bar. You have a good excuse: It's
low fat! You know that because . . . the package is green?Or so you
think. Color plays a big role in what food products people buy,
experts say. By KATE GURNETT.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS NEWS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HENDERSON (Albany, N.Y.) _ He's a lock for the Hall of Fame. He
knows his place in baseball history is secure, that he is the
standard against which great base stealers will forever be
measured. So it would be inaccurate to say that life is beginning
at 40 for New York Mets left fielder Rickey Henderson. But his days
as a productive leadoff man are far from over. By TIM REYNOLDS.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 No Avoiding Dreaded Spam  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  Help! I am being inundated with unwanted e-mail. I'm
a computer novice and don't know what to do about this problem.
Should I change my ISP, my e-mail address, or is there some
security feature on my computer that can help?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Welcome to the club. Almost everybody who uses e-mail
knows what it's like to log on and find your in-box stuffed full of
junk mail. Also called spam, these nuisance messages usually take
the form of advertisements for sleazy products, get-rich-quick
schemes or online pornography sites _ all pretty yucky stuff. By
some estimates, spam now accounts for more than one-quarter of all
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Spam, like regular junk mail, is sent to thousands of people at
the same time, using mailing lists. Spammers get addresses in a
number of ways, often buying them outright from ISPs or marketing
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do to stop spam, and
changing your ISP or your e-mail address will bring only a brief
respite until spammers discover you again.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no truly effective spam-filtering software for
your PC. America Online lets you block messages from specific users
and Internet domains (the name to the right of the sign in an
e-mail address). But because AOL users get more spam than just
about anyone, that's not much comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, says Paul Hoffman, director of the Internet Mail
Consortium in Santa Cruz, ``you just have to learn to live with
it.'' He holds out hope, however, that new anti-spam technology
might bring relief in the near future. One San Francisco company,
Bright Light Technologies, already is selling a sophisticated
spam-filtering system to ISPs and is developing one for home users.
</P>
<P>
   My advice is to call your ISP and suggest that they get the
Bright Light system or one like it. In the meantime, you have my
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Backup System
</P>
<P>
   Q: My old Windows 3.1 backup software doesn't work with Windows
95, and there aren't any upgrades available for it. I was
considering a Zip drive, but someone suggested using recordable
CD-ROMs instead. The discs are less expensive than Zip cartridges,
and they hold much more data. Also, the data can be transferred to
any computer that has a CD-ROM drive. Is this a reasonable
direction to go for backups?
</P>
<P>
   A: Seems to me you've answered your own question. CD-Rs, as
recordable CD-ROMs are known, provide excellent backup storage. A
CD holds up to 660 megabytes of data, compared with 100 megabytes
for a standard Zip cartridge. Plus, as you say, you can use them in
almost any PC, without the need for a Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to create CD-Rs, you'll need a CD-R drive. That's
because regular CD-ROM drives can only read information off of
discs, not put data on them.
</P>
<P>
   But prices on CD-R drives are dropping fast. A basic model can
be had for under $200, though faster models can cost nearly twice
that much.
</P>
<P>
   Switching WebTV Service
</P>
<P>
   Q: We recently got a WebTV and are enjoying it a lot. My
question is: Can we use a different Internet provider? We pay
$24.95 a month for WebTV's service, but I hear others advertised
for less.
</P>
<P>
   A: WebTV would like you to use its Internet service, but the
company understands that some folks won't have a local dial-up
number for WebTV in their area, while others may want to use the
same ISP they have for their home computers. And still others, like
you, are determined to get the best possible deal on Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, you can use any ISP with WebTV. Check out the WebTV Web
site at www.webtv.com for details of their OpenISP policy.
</P>
<P>
   PC Turn On
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a new stay-at-home mother and am able to get on the
computer to access the Internet two or three times a day for short
periods. Which is better for the computer, to leave it on for eight
hours or turn it off after each use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Leave the computer on (but not the Internet connection). It
won't hurt your system, and you'll save the time it takes to boot
up each time you want to use it.
</P>
<P>

_  &UR; E-MAIL UPDATE: &LR;  In response to a question last week about using
e-mail at work for personal messages, I noted that bosses usually
can spy on employees' mail if they want. There is a way around
that, however. If you have access to the Internet at work, set up a
Web-based mail account with Hotmail or one of the big search
engines like Yahoo or Excite. That way, your mail will never go
through your company's e-mail system.

KODAK DIGITAL CAMERAS GOOD, BUT EXPENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Children love digital cameras. You snap their picture and the
kids are immediately displayed on a screen on the camera's
backside.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of a digital camera is that the instant you
snap the picture, you can take the image into your computer. Once
there, you can put the image on a Web page, e-mail it to a friend,
or electronically retouch it. The second big advantage of a digital
camera is storage: you can cram more than 10,000 pictures into a
one gigabyte hard drive _ no more bursting binders!
</P>
<P>
   But despite the allure of the digital, last year's e-cameras
were, for the most part, quite limited. Basically point-and-shoot
devices, these cameras had limited memory. That meant you
frequently had to empty the images; they had limited resolution;
and they couldn't adequately reproduce detail in bright spots or in
shadows. The cameras themselves had few features. Another problem
was in the optics: most of last year's cameras were fixed-focus,
which further reduced image quality.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras released this year are likely to be significantly
better, both as advances in computers move into these hand-held
devices, and as camera makers begin to catch their stride .
Increasingly, these cameras must stand on their own as photographic
devices, rather than electronic playthings.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning Kodak has been a pioneer in the field of
digital photography. Recently, the company released two new digital
cameras. Both are among the best available. Alas, they are also
quite expensive .
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's DC240 ($700) is a sophisticated digital camera with a
built-in zoom, built-in flash, and 8MB of compact flash memory.
It's lightweight and relatively high resolution. Standard
resolution is 640 by 480 pixels, the same as a VGA computer screen.
High-resolution is 1280 by 960, which looks pretty good printed as
a 4 inch by 5 inch photograph. Besides changing the resolution, you
can also adjust the compression setting, allowing you to get
between 30 and 160 images in a 8MB flash cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's more-expensive DC265 ($1000) camera is loaded with more
features, but of course that's what you are paying for. The DC265
has higher resolution (768 by 512 pixels standard, 1536 by 1024
pixels max) and three compression settings. The DC265 also has a
microphone that lets you record a little audio note for each photo,
and a little speaker to play it back. The camera uses this speaker
to make sound effects when you take a photo or click the buttons on
the back panel. And one feature that's super cool on the DC265 is
that it has a gravity sensor: when you turn the camera sideways, it
senses the turn automatically rotates the image back when the
picture is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The DC265 will allow you to take burst photos (several pictures
in a row) or time-lapse (taking a photo once a minute to once a
day). Burst mode is handy if the person you are photographing
consistently blinks : perhaps the first frame won't be any good,
but the second or third frame probably will. Time-lapse is useful
for surveillance, scientific experiments, and nature photography.
</P>
<P>
   Both cameras have a little LCD screen on the back that lets you
view the pictures that you have taken as well as set the camera's
controls. Both cameras have a built-in flash, which you can
disable, and both allow you to set the color balance of your scene.
That is, you can tell the camera whether the lighting is by
sunlight, fluorescent, or tungsten bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras also come with programs that allow you to control
nearly all of the camera's settings from your computer _ a process
that's much easier than fiddling with the camera's built-in menu
system. The DC240's software is more sophisticated than the
software for the DC265; besides setting controls, it actually lets
you snap a picture.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to get the images out of one of these cameras is
to take the compact flash picture card out of the camera and plug
it into your PC using Kodak's optional connection kit. The kit
comes with a PCMCIA adapter card that lets you plug the compact
flash into a laptop computer, as well as another adapter that lets
you read the card through your computer's parallel port. Once it's
attached to your computer, the compact flash looks like a big
floppy disk or a small ZIP cartridge, filled with images.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to get the images into your computer is to use the
USB (Universal Serial Bus) interface. Once attached, the camera
looks like an external hard drive. One good piece of software
engineering that Kodak has done is to create an extension for the
Microsoft Windows explorer, so that you can directly view
thumbnails without having to start up another application.
Unfortunately, despite the supposed speed of USB, viewing the
photos this way is quite slow. I suspect that the fault lies not
with USB, but with the microprocessor inside the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, these are nice cameras, but $700 or more is a lot for a
point-and-shoot and I would like to see a bit more camera for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   My first problem with these machines isn't the electronics, but
the optics. Both of these cameras have the problem that when you
hit the shutter button, they don't take the photographs
immediately. Instead, they focus, making a lot of noise in the
process. They take the photograph about a second after you press
the shutter release, and by then it's sometimes too late. Alas,
this is a problem shared by many point-and-shoots and the only way
around it is to get a 35mm SLR (Single Lens Reflex) camera.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is the lens cap: it doesn't stay on the lens.
This is especially troublesome because there is no way to replace
the glass cover over the lens and there's no way to augment it with
a transparent (and relatively low-cost) haze filter. This means
that after a year or so of heavy use, the glass lens cover is
likely to be quite scratched and need factory replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Battery drain is another problem. One of the big advantages of
digital cameras is that you don't need to keep buying film.
Unfortunately, these cameras both suck batteries dry _ you'll be
lucky if you get 50 shots from a set of 4 AA cells. Be sure to use
rechargeable batteries, if you can.
</P>
<P>
   Although these are nice cameras, the price makes them
prohibitive for most consumers. However, the features in these $700
cameras today will likely appear in $200 and $300 cameras later
this year or early next. If you do decide to buy a digital camera,
be sure that you get one that has at least 640 by 480 resolution
and 8MB of RAM. Otherwise, you'll just be shortchanging yourself.

NEWS ANALYSIS: KEY TO MUSIC DEAL IS E-PROMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the new joint Internet venture between
Universal Music and BMG seems to be an effort to squeeze out the
booming online music stores, like CDNow and Amazon.com. Indeed, the
two big record companies Wednesday introduced a site, Getmusic.Com,
that does compete with these sites by selling compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the middlemen that the record companies are
trying to cut out are the traditional media that promote music,
like Rolling Stone magazine, local radio stations and most
importantly MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of what the companies are trying to do is to use the
interactive nature of the Internet to gather the names and e-mail
addresses of their customers so they can sell more music to them by
artists they already like and to introduce them to new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promotional opportunity of the Internet, as opposed to the
commerce opportunity, is very powerful,'' said Edgar Bronfman Jr.,
chief executive of Seagram Co., which owns Universal Music.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no better sign of the venture's lack of
enthusiasm for online retailing than that prices on Getmusic.com
are often 20 percent higher than on CDNow and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Bronfman and BMG executives said that the most important
part of their venture is not Getmusic.com, the music store, but a
series of sites devoted to various music genres. These will start
with five sites developed by BMG, including Peeps.com, for hip-hop,
and Twangthis.Com, a country site.
</P>
<P>
   Peeps, in particular, has been effective in promoting new
artists. For example, the site started publicizing Britney Spears,
offering song samples that users could download, eight months
before her first album was released. It eventually collected the
names of 100,000 people who said they were interested in her music.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 80 percent of them bought the album,'' said Kevin
Conroy, a BMG senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   It is this capability to gain direct access to customers that
brought Universal into the venture, said Lawrence Kenswil,
president for electronic commerce at Universal Music. ``People
aren't our customers directly,'' he said. ``They are radio station
listeners, record store customers or MTV viewers. At the end of the
day, we need information about that that is not filtered by third
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to lure people to the genre sites with inside
information and music samples that other sites do not have. Of
course, such content is the stuff of other media outlets, notably
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   And Viacom Inc., MTV's parent, is readying a big new music site.
Fred Sieber, president of MTV Networks Online, said that it would
not be cut out of the information flow because of its longstanding
reputation with both musicians and viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists will talk to us, like they have for 20 years,'' he
said. ``Nobody doesn't want their music exposed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to its promotional goals, the BMG-Universal venture
is meant to position the record companies for the day when their
customers will be able to download digital versions of records
directly to their computers or to small portable devices, though
Getmusic does not offer such downloads today.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal copies of music, using the MP3 format, are the staple of
many college dorm rooms already. But the record companies want to
impose a system that keeps the royalties flowing their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to control the gatekeeper,'' said Thomas Middelhoff,
chairman of Bertelsmann A.G., which owns BMG. ``In the music
business of the future, it is crucial to have direct control over
the customer downloads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, by contrast, offers an expanded vision of how music
will be sold on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will buy digital music across retail channels,'' he
said. They will use kiosks in stores, push a `buy now' button on
their Internet radio stations, and they will buy using new
devices'' like portable digital players that let people listen to
downloaded music.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly clear whether the record companies, in fact, have
the upper hand in the game going forward. Many music industry
executives envision the day when popular musicians themselves will
sell songs directly to their fans from their Web sites. Record
retailers, by contrast, argue that since they have the
relationships with customers, they are in the best position to be
the center of music buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the retailers who are imperiled, it's the labels,''
said Russell I. Pillar, chief executive of the Virgin Entertainment
Group, the Virgin Group unit that owns a chain of record stores and
will soon open an online music store. ``People buy artists, they
don't buy labels. So you will buy your Cher disk from
Virginmega.com or from Cher.com. You won't buy it from the label
because you don't know who the label is.''

GET ORGANIZED WITH A PIM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalists tend to be disorganized, and I'm the worst of a bad
lot. I'd never remember an appointment if it weren't for a Personal
Information Manager program that slaps me out of a gearhead daze.
My PIM of the moment is Microsoft's Outlook. It suffers from the
usual Microsoft failings -- it eats up too much memory and runs too
slowly. But it combines a calendar, address book and e-mail which
work almost seamlessly together.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of Outlook is the chief reason I still haven't
been able to switch entirely to Linux, my favorite alternative
operating system. Try though I might, I haven't found any
Linux-based alternatives that measure up.
</P>
<P>
   However, one can rely on a Web browser and a growing number of
Internet PIMs -- Web sites that provide registered users with free
calendars and address books.
</P>
<P>
   There's a PIM site boom these days. Firms like Anyday.com and
PlanetAll are clamoring for new users. Another entrant, When.com,
was purchased by America Online Inc. last week, and is already the
Web-based calendar for AOL's Netcenter Web portal. Other top
portals like Lycos and Yahoo are also wooing visitors with online
calendars. The services are all free; the goal is to keep you
coming back to the site, where they can fling ads at your eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   As with most other free Internet services, all these sites will
eventually offer identical features, so that it won't matter which
one you use. But right now, it makes quite a difference. Some, like
Cambridge-based Anyday.com, are still in test mode and aren't ready
for serious use. And there are sizable differences among the
well-established on-line PIMs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, When.com makes a good lightweight calendar for
casual Web users. After you get a free password, you can record
appointments months or years ahead. There's also a handy little
feature called Event Tracker that keeps watch on a variety of
upcoming events you might want to track. Say you're a fan of the TV
series Law and Order. Event Tracker will remind you to tune in, and
provide a summary of that night's episode. It also tracks concerts,
the latest movies, corporate earnings reports -- quite a lot of
useful stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, When.com doesn't include an address book. Worse
yet, it doesn't offer one of the most important features for an
on-line PIM -- synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many users of on-line PIMs already have similar
software on their computers. Copying your calendar to the Web lets
you get access to it from any Internet-linked computer on earth.
But you need a way to dump data from your PC or Palm Pilot into the
Web-based PIM.
</P>
<P>
   That's where synchronization comes in. Some of these sites let
you download a program that will copy data from your computer and
send it over the 'Net to your on-line calendar or address book.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll has been offering this for some time. Their software
can synch up with Palm Pilots, or with PCs running Microsoft
Outlook. And when your Outlook address book changes, the software
reminds you to send those changes along to PlanetAll as well. Too
bad the PlanetAll software only covers the address book. It won't
let you automatically transmit appointment data to the service's
on-line calendar.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major blunder, one which Yahoo has avoided. Their
synchronization software lets you transfer both address book and
calendar data. The first transfer can take a long time if you've
got lots of data. But from then on, the software only transmits
updated files, so the job only lasts a minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've got my PIM data stashed on a Web site, it doesn't
matter whether I'm running Windows or Linux or any other obscure
operating system. All I need is an Internet connection and a Web
browser. It also helps to be the trusting sort -- after all, you're
putting a lot of personal information onto somebody else's
computer. Firms like Yahoo and PlanetAll pledge to respect the
privacy of the data you store in their PIMs, and soft-headed fool
that I am, I believe them.
</P>
<P>
   These on-line services aren't a completely adequate substitute
for PIM software on your own machine, especially if you've got a
slow modem connection to the Internet. Then again, considering how
slow Microsoft Outlook runs, it's nearly a draw.

RAYTHEON SUES 21 OVER NET CHAT POSTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a controversial case that has attracted national attention,
Raytheon Co. has sued 21 anonymous authors for allegedly revealing
company secrets on an Internet chat board and causing ``harm to its
business reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a matter involving at least two of the chatters the
Lexington, Mass. defense contractor had already reported in public
filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission some of the
information that it now alleges was improperly revealed on the Web,
a Boston Globe review shows.
</P>
<P>
   The material concerns problems at a Raytheon project to make
electronic devices in South Korea. Raytheon recorded a $54 million
charge after taxes last year because of losses on the project,
according to a company filing dated Aug. 12. Two people _ using the
screen names ``Winstoncar'' and ``bobchand'' _ made references to
the Korean project on a Yahoo message board a month later. Raytheon
now alleges their posts constituted ``disclosure of inside
financial issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Raytheon's suit, filed in February, Winstoncar
has been dismissed, a person familiar with the matter now says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Winstoncar nor bobchand could be reached to comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon won't discuss why it considers the Korean matter
proprietary given its earlier SEC filing. Postings by the other 19
anonymous writers named in the suit covered other matters, ranging
from details of union contract talks to general gripes about
Raytheon management.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that in light of Raytheon's filings, its chief
aim in pursuing the suit is to silence debate rather than to
protect company secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no grounds to say it's private, so they're just
going after people who repeat it,'' said James George, a private
investigator who has set up an Internet site devoted to the case.
</P>
<P>
   After its lawsuit caused a stir, Raytheon issued a policy
stating that employees can talk about public matters on the
Internet, but should keep quiet about proprietary information. Now,
``it makes you wonder what Raytheon means'' with its new policy,
said William Arabolos, chief executive of Akom Technologies Inc. of
Bethel, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Akom, a former supplier to Raytheon has sued the company over
the Korean project, and Arabolos says the details from the SEC
filing and the Yahoo chat relate to the same matter.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon filed suit in Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court against
21 people it describes as ``John Does,'' who the company charges
posted improper information on the World Wide Web. Raytheon seeks
damages of more than $25,000 from the group, which it believes
includes current and former employees who signed agreements
pledging not to reveal proprietary information. Raytheon also wants
the group banned from further improper chat.
</P>
<P>
   Because the messages weren't posted under users' real names,
Raytheon obtained court motions against Yahoo to gain information
about what the California Internet portal service knew about their
identities. Based on that information, Raytheon in March obtained
similar motions against America Online, Microsoft Corp. and other
service providers in the hopes of tracing the identities of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear what the Internet service providers have told
Raytheon so far, and critics have seized on the case to argue
Internet users deserve more protection of their identity in civil
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Now the latest details about Raytheon's own previous disclosures
would seem to weaken its case against the John Does, said John
Reinstein, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. ``Certainly
it's not likely they'll get an injunction against discussion of
material that's already in the public domain,'' he said. ``Nor is
it clear there's any basis for damages.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention to the suit comes at a sensitive time for Raytheon,
whose new chief executive, Daniel Burnham, has pledged to
decentralize decision making at the company. Yet Raytheon's pending
suit is also one of the most aggressive to date by a company
seeking to crack down on talk about it on line.
</P>
<P>
   The company has declined to discuss actions taken against
employees, citing their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The issues stemming from the Korean contract seem to be among
the most sensitive in the lawsuit. In all, the company objected to
29 e-mails that allegedly violated its rules against disclosing
proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   In a message on the Yahoo chat board dated Sept. 4 Winstoncar
typed: ``I heard there was a bit of a scandal in Advanced Device
Center in Andover. Someone wasn't watching the `store' . . .
closely regarding $100 million in Korean contracts. Knowing their
economy wasn't that great, they decided to look into the books,
shortly after that the comptroller was walked out the door (fired),
and the head of ADC, I won't mention names, was demoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, bobchand referred on the message board to
``the loss of 100 million on the Korea deal'' as part of a general
posting about the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Both Winstoncar and bobchand said in later postings on the chat
board that they didn't believe they were revealing inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   In a routine quarterly filing to the SEC dated Aug. 12, 1998,
Raytheon said it recorded a special charge of $54 million after
taxes. ``The special charge consisted of $27 million to writedown
to estimated realizable value certain assets the company has
decided to sell and $27 million as the current estimated asset
impairment for commercial electronics manufacturing operations
located in Korea,'' the document states.
</P>
<P>
   Arabolos said the work related to plans to manufacture office
networking products in Korea by a joint venture called RayCom.
Partners were Raytheon and a Seoul-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Akom was formed in 1996 to act as a purchasing arm of the joint
venture, according to Akom's suit against Raytheon and others,
filed in US District Court in Connecticut in February. Akom later
placed $22 million worth of orders on Raytheon's behalf, according
to the suit. However, Raytheon and the joint failed to pay for the
parts, Akom charges.

SCREEN SAVERS, THREE STOOGES ARE A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My screen saver stays on about 10 minutes and
then goes off. I think I must have made a mistake installing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ New to Computers
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NEW: Now why do people always assume they're the ones who
made a mistake when something goes kerflooey with their computers?
Trust me, most of the problems originate in faulty software design
or loony notions about how you should be forced to use your
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Screen savers are a good example. Back in the olden days, a
screen saver was necessary unless you wanted to see ``WordStar''
burned permanently into your monitor's phosphors. The way modern
monitors are designed, nobody really needs one. They're more of a
novelty, allowing you to think you're cooler than the other geeks
in the office because you have winged toasters flying all over your
screen.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not going to make fun of anybody for using screen savers,
though, because if you actually think they make you a supercool
hepcat, you obviously have much bigger problems to deal with. No,
what upsets me is how all the different screen-saving techniques
your computer employs work together about as well as the Three
Stooges on a plumbing job.
</P>
<P>
   That's your problem, New. Moe's pounding Curly over the head
with a big monkey wrench, and Larry's off on his own, digging up
the lawn, looking for the shutoff valve.
</P>
<P>
   All three are trying to blank your screen. Moe is the built-in
operating system, a program on a chip that runs the show when you
start up your computer. Moe usually has his power-saving mode
turned on, and he likes to turn your monitor and hard drive off
when he thinks you're not looking. Curly is your screen saver,
obliviously building a rat's nest of water pipes on your monitor
until Moe whacks him a good one and shuts it down. And poor, dopey
Larry is Windows, blithely off in some other world with a power
scheme all his own.
</P>
<P>
   You need to show these numbskulls who the boss is. First, tell
Moe to keep his hands off the power controls. You'll have to check
your owner's manual to get into the system setup program, but
that's where you can turn off power management. Next, yank out a
big hunk of Larry's hair so he'll pay attention. In the control
panel, click on the power management icon. Depending on your
Windows version, you may have a checkbox that lets Larry control
the power. Uncheck it. Or there may be separate settings for
turning off the monitor and the hard drive. I set them to
``never.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Curly. He's basically harmless. Let him build his
pipes.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: This is just a ``heads-up'' on a word you have
used in your column: nimrod. It is actually a great honor to be
called a nimrod. The dictionary defines ``nimrod'' as a ``great
hunter or sportsman.'' I hate having you use this appellation as
one of derision, when, in fact, it is quite the opposite!
</P>
<P>
   _ Word Czar
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CZAR: Oh, I understand now! You obviously didn't realize
that words mean what I want them to. Nimrod is simply too goofy a
word to use any other way. As for the dictionary: What a pile of
gorp! Now I suppose next you'll be telling me ``gorp'' is just
trail mix.
</P>
<P>

Casting Net can turn up a sea of fishing info 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of it as a fish Net.
</P>
<P>
   For a fisherman, the Internet is almost as handy as a good
source of red wiggler worms or a lifetime supply of Red Coachman
flies. And now that it's spring, many of us will leave the ghostly
light of the computer monitor for some time spent in the sunshine
on a river or lake.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at some of the fishing information you can
find on the Web. Since this column is produced in Georgia, we'll
also look at some sites that offer specific help for here. Don't be
discouraged if you live in another state. A few minutes with a
search engine such as AltaVista or Yahoo! will produce plenty of
localized fishing sites.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fishing, all of us are beginners. Even if you
know a lot about trout fishing, you may not know beans about
catching bluegill bream. A bass expert may be able to cite chapter
and verse on the various plastic worms available but be mystified
when it comes time to head north for a vacation fishing trip for
walleyes.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll start with a page called the Fishing Network at
www.the-fishing-network
</P>
<P>
   .com/. This is a terrific site because _ like a good tackle box
_ it contains almost everything you'll need. There are sections
that offer specific fishing advice for the various species of
freshwater fish; weather forecasts; chat areas where you can tell
your fishing story to someone who actually would like to hear it;
information on records (that way you'll know if that big bream is a
world-record-sized catch); calendars of outdoor and fishing
expositions and shows; and even a nice selection of fishing clip
art if you'd like to decorate a Web page or just add a picture of a
fish to an e-mail or newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you have gathered some information, you'll want to get
a fishing license. After all, the money you spend for the license
will be used to stock the rivers and lakes, so it's money well
spent. Besides, those who don't have a license can find that the
fines make for a very expensive trip.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you can get all the information you need about
licenses and fishing regulations at a Web site run by the state at
www.dnr.state.ga.us/dnr/wild
</P>
<P>
   /fishingreg/. You'll find out, for example, when the season
starts for various types of fish and how many you're allowed to
catch. And, for those who want to try fishing but are reluctant to
buy a license, go to www.dnr.state.ga
</P>
<P>
   .us/dnr/wild/fishingreg/freefish
</P>
<P>
   .html and find out about ``free fishing days'' in Georgia when
no license or trout stamp is required.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll want to find out where the fish are biting. A good
source for Georgia information is located at www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/GEORGIA/. You'll find a complete list of
lakes. Click on the place that interests you, and you'll get a good
report. Each report is dated, so you'll know how recent the
information is. (If you live in another state, try www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/ and check to see if your state is listed so
that you can get the same type of information.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really want to put your computer to work as a
fishing buddy, you can download a program that offers you advice.
You'll enter information about the weather, time of year, species
of fish and then get help from the program. You can download a free
demonstration version of the program at ourworld
</P>
<P>
   .compuserve.com/homepages
</P>
<P>
   /strattech/fishexpe.htm (look for the link at the very bottom of
the page). Or you can order the commercial version of the program
for $26.

Pokemon portable video game popping up everywhere 
By Jennifer Hill  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Move over, Beanie Babies. Pokemon have seized the day.
And like those cuddly, stuffed, fabled toys of yesterday's trend,
there's seemingly a million of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   If you've heard your children talking about Squirtles and
Charizards, your household has been hit by the Pokemon bug. Since
hitting the U.S. market in September 1998, Nintendo has sold 1.5
million units, making it the fastest-selling Gameboy game ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Gameboy's portability, the game is played everywhere
from morning school carpools to playgrounds or any other place a
spare moment opens up. Where only a few months ago clusters of boys
put wildly colored plastic yo-yos through their paces, now many of
those same boys are huddled playing Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   In the peculiar culture of video games, proximity can serve as
interaction. That is to say, two, three or four boys can all be
playing individual Gameboys but be communing with one another. But
with Pokemon, you advance your game by linking with another
player's Gameboy to trade Pokemon. Plus, you can also use the game
link cable to battle other players. (Of course, to do this you need
a game link cable, which costs about $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the parental purse, Nintendo makes two
versions of the game _ Red and Blue. Each game, which sells for
about $29, has a slightly different subset of the 150 different
Pokemon. So to collect all 150, you have to trade by linking up
with another player who has the other version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to find, train, collect and use the
Pokemon in battle with other Pokemon trainers. When your Pokemon
defeats another in battle, you capture it and add it to your
collection.
</P>
<P>
   When you train your Pokemon, they evolve from lovable little
critters to larger and mostly still lovable creatures with a
variety of powers. For example, Squirtle evolves into Wartortle and
ultimately Blastoise. (Certainly makes your wonder if the author of
the American version names grew up in the Bronx, doesn't it?)
Depending on how they are trained, two Pokemon of the same type
could end up having different abilities in their full-grown state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon onslaught shows no sign of slowing down. Episodes of
a cartoon show feature two-dimensional characters that only game
fanatics would know and love. According to Nintendo, the Pokemon
animated cartoon series is the top syndicated kids show in all
major U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   And as if 150 Pokemon weren't enough, there are more video
versions to come featuring new critters. Nintendo plans to release
``Pokemon Pinball'' for Gameboy and ``Pokemon Snap'' for N64 in
late June. Japanese versions are already available.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon trading cards, which appeared a few months ago, are
being snapped up with the same frenzy as Magic cards were in their
heyday. More than 50 million have been sold since December.
Currently, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle made up to like Pikachu, a
round yellow Pokemon that looks like a vertically challenged
relative of the Pillsbury Doughboy with tail, is making its way
across the country attending Pokemon trading card events.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the toymaker, has weighed in with collectible toys
featuring the Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Internet is a part of the Pokemon craze.
In addition to official Nintendo sites www.pokemon.com/ and
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, there are scores of sites
maintained by game devotees. One such site, Pikachu Centre at
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, has a wealth of information
about the current as well upcoming and Japanese versions of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Having a hard time capturing the Tauros Pokemon? Many of these
sites features tips sent in by other gamers on everything from
training Pokemon faster to help finding the rarest Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   The expected June release of the new games will likely breath
new life into the game's popularity, ensuring its fans will take
the game's slogan to heart _ ``Got to catch 'em all.''

Apple's OS 8.6 called `incredibly stable' 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer is readying the latest version of its
operating system. Called 8.6, this version of the Mac's OS is
expected to be released _ probably for free _ later this month or
in early May.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing earth-shaking in 8.6, but this version
represents a steady improvement. Indeed, the release alone shows
Apple Computer's newfound stability. The company has systematically
released OS upgrades every six months for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is not saying anything official yet about OS 8.6,
but the Internet is filled with news about it. Here are some of the
more important improvements, gleaned from credible sources such as
MacWeek and MacOS World.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6's new features include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Better multitasking. Multitasking is the ability to perform
several functions at once, such as emptying the trash and copying
files. The Mac already can handle some multitasking, but Apple
Computer will now let users launch applications while their Macs
empty the trash with 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better system stability. The current system, 8.5, has plagued
some users with random and inexplicable crashes. The bugs that
caused these crashes have been fixed. Beta testers have reported
that 8.6 is ``incredibly stable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New Sherlock interface. Sherlock is Apple Computer's new
search technology, which scans not only within files but also
across the Internet. In OS 8.6, Sherlock's window listing plug-ins
is now resizable.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Start-Up Control Panel. Apple Computer has rewritten this
mini-program so that it easily lets you connect to a server and a
network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved internal codes. Apple Computer has updated many of
its internal parts with 8.6. Among the things improved are video
drivers, laserwriter software, DVD software, Open Transport,
AppleScript and FireWire video drivers.
</P>
<P>
   While no particular item is big, all these small improvements
will add up to a lot in 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   And 8.6 is a big step forward to Apple Computer's next major
release, called OS X. OS X is Apple's answer to Microsoft's
powerful Windows NT software.
</P>
<P>
   The company says OS X will run preemptive multitasking. It will
also offer protected memory, advanced virtual memory and
multithreading.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago no one would have believed Apple could pull off OS
X. After all, it had failed to pull off two previous major system
upgrades. But there's great confidence in Apple, given its return
to profitability and success in rolling out system maintenance
upgrades such as 8.6.

<P>
   Wait a second. Wasn't entertainment supposed to be a flop on the
Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A lot of companies had high hopes that were dashed with such
entertainment concepts as online soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that money may be the answer, Microsoft spent
television-style budgets to develop a series of elaborate online
``shows'' like ``Mungo Park,'' about adventure travel.
</P>
<P>
   The surfers were not amused. And Microsoft, and many others
retreated to focus on more practical Internet services, like e-mail
and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is now a quiet resurgence of entertainment-based
material on the Internet, and companies that think they can profit
by offering it. Rather than original online programming, though,
the biggest successes are the most derivative: online extensions of
music, television shows and movies that fans already know.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing the same impulses that made People magazine and its
many imitators so popular, many people want to use the Internet to
get closer to the entertainers they love, reading interviews,
looking at photographs and listening to unreleased record tracks.
Even more powerfully, they want to share their enthusiasm with
other fans, through chat rooms, message boards and even building
home pages about their favorite performers and shows.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, building such content and community around their
recording artists is one of the principal goals of an Internet
venture announced last week by Seagram's Universal Music and
Bertelsmann's BMG, which will sell advertising in addition to
promoting the music companies' recordings. And other entertainment
companies, especially Time Warner's Warner Brothers, are building
fan-oriented sites as independent media profit centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to get more from our existing
customers,'' said Jim Moloshok, the head of Warner Brothers Online.
``It's no different from McDonald's saying, `Do you want fries with
that hamburger?' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This phenomenon has been building from many sides. Many of the
home pages that individuals create on free services like Geocities
are devoted to celebrating certain entertainers, movies or
programs. Existing entertainment providers, like Viacom's MTV, and
new Internet start-ups like Sonicnet, offer online fan forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always looked at a media business as a club house people
join, whether they're fans of rock music or the old television
shows of `Nick at Night,''' said Fred Siebert, the president of MTV
Networks Online, which is building a big new site for fans of all
types of music. ``When kids watch television, they're on the phone
talking about it to their friends at the same time. The Internet
just provides an opportunity to make that sense of community all
the closer.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the increasingly interactive Web, big entertainment
producers are looking to build direct relationships with their
customers, cut out intermediaries like MTV, and, perhaps most
important, turn the fan-oriented sites into potentially profitable
services in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney, for example, has built an elaborate site at ABC.com
(www.abc.go.com) with advertising-supported material pegged to its
television shows. The most popular areas relate to its daytime soap
operas, where viewers go for plot updates, backstage interviews and
to express their own opinions about whether any given love affair
is destined for the altar or the trash heap.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, like others, is also moving to profit from selling goods
to fans online. In a Valentine's Day test, Barbara Walters listed
her choices for the most romantic movie, book and compact disk on
her daytime television show ``The View.'' ABC.com then presented
links so viewers could buy her picks on video, including
``Casablanca'' and a Frank Sinatra compilation, from merchants
paying a commission to Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has had similar sites, supported by advertising and
commerce, devoted to its many television and movie properties. Now
it is going a step further with an elaborate offering called Acme
City (www.acmecity.com) that lets fans build their own home pages
devoted to Warner properties.
</P>
<P>
   Warner is even willing to let users incorporate sounds and
images of its characters into their own home pages, something many
other media companies officially ban because of copyright concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who create home pages devoted to your products are
the ones who will buy your albums the day they are released and see
your movies five times,'' Moloshok said. In Acme City's first 10
weeks, some 200,000 people have registered to build home pages. The
most popular topic: Loony Toons.
</P>
<P>
   But the business is hardly loony. Unlike the all-purpose
home-page sites, which Moloshok said typically charged less than
$10 for every 1,000 viewers of an ad, Warner has been able to
charge $15 to $22.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you place your ad over our site devoted to Loony Toons
you know what the content is,'' he said. ``If you are in a generic
community, the ad could be over a page on animation, knitting or
some alternate lifestyle.''

CHINA SETS UP ITS OWN WEB SITE TO LURE U.S. CONCERNS' BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first official foray into electronic commerce for the
world's fastest-growing economy, the government of China has set up
an Internet site intended to help its companies market goods to
American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.meetchina.com, which was announced Monday , is
operated for China by U.S. Business Network Inc., a San
Francisco-based company. According to Ken Leonard, the company's
chief executive, the site will be a clearinghouse of sorts for
businesses in mainland China that wish to connect with American
customers via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government will help U.S. Business Network solicit
companies that will pay $1,500 to $3,000 to participate in the
site, and receive help developing American contacts, with 20
percent of the proceeds going to the government. Participating
Chinese companies will be able to post information about themselves
and their products or services, along with contact information that
includes e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Leonard said, Chinese companies were not allowed
to make direct contact with foreign companies, but instead were
required to first seek export licenses from the government. In
recent months, China has been more liberal in issuing such
licenses, particularly for smaller companies, and dealing directly
with Western businesses. It is smaller companies that China is
trying to promote through the new site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From China's perspective, it fits perfectly,'' said Patrick
Meehan, research director for the Gartner Group, a technology
consulting firm. ``It's kind of open, but not all the way. It's
part of the `great fire wall of China' strategy, where they have a
way to funnel information in and out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Borrus, co-director of the Berkeley
Roundtable on the International Economy, the site's launch is more
notable for its political implications than as a breakthrough on
e-commerce. Observing that the government has been trying to
privatize China's state-owned industries, Borrus said, ``This will
facilitate that process by pushing them to reform via contact with
the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It also falls into the classic Chinese model of dabbling in
something long enough to see the various impacts before you commit
to it completely,'' Borrus said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who lobbied the Chinese government for a year before
receiving its go-ahead, said the site would focus first on Chinese
businesses that are involved in the information technology
industry. He added that the site was being marketed on the Internet
_ through banner advertisements on Yahoo, for example.

ONLINE MERCHANTS GROW UNEASY AS WEB PORTALS SELL MORE GOODS 
THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Internet merchants are feeling nervous these days about
their partnerships with portal sites, the gateways to the Web for
millions of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Portals like Yahoo, Excite and America Online have generated
unbridled enthusiasm on Wall Street for their ability to attract
users and a diverse roster of advertisers. Yet, while advertising
continues to drive revenues, analysts are questioning the portals'
ability to sustain growth with a business model that relies heavily
on advertising. The obvious answer: grab a piece of the growing
e-commerce pie.
</P>
<P>
   Web merchants like Barnesandnoble.com and CD Now may pay fees as
high as $5 million apiece each year to be featured on portal sites.
Some say they are not eager to see the potential e-commerce
competition from the very Web sites that carry the merchants'
customer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has created a growing sense of distrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got finished doing a panel at a conference,'' said
Michael Baum, vice president for e-commerce at the Go Network, a
portal started in January by the Walt Disney Co. and Infoseek,
which itself is partly owned by Disney. ``I told an audience of
merchants that our goal is to empower them, not compete with
them,'' said Baum, who recalled that his reassurances seemed to be
well received. ``I must have had 60 merchants come up to me
afterward and say, `Wow, I didn't know that's the way it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives say this uneasy phase in the
relationship between portals and merchants could lead to a better
shopping environment for consumers, if it leads to more choices.
But the road to that high ground is strewn with obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   First, Internet merchants fear that portals will compete with
them by selling goods directly to their users, as Lycos, a popular
portal, has announced it plans to do. With its pending acquisition
by USA Networks, which also owns the Home Shopping Network, Lycos
hopes to fulfill orders of goods directly from its own warehouse _
thus potentially circumventing the merchants that pay to be
featured on its site. Lycos' featured merchants currently include
Eddie Bauer and Etoys.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond direct competition, however, merchants are concerned that
portals will increasingly try to keep consumers on the portal site
for most or all of a shopping transaction, rather than direct them
to the merchants' sites, as is now typically the case.
</P>
<P>
   By ``taking more of the transaction,'' as the practice is known,
portals rankle retailers in various ways. The portal can capture
most of the buyer's personal information _ through a registration
process or a credit card form. Merchants fear that the portals will
then sell that information to competing retailers, which could then
market competing goods to those customers.
</P>
<P>
   There's another concern. Top-tier Internet retailers go to great
lengths to merchandise their goods effectively and implement
technological innovations, like offering shoppers a personalized
online catalog. The more time shoppers spend on a portal's general
commerce area, the less time they have for the personal,
brand-enhancing flourishes on the merchant's site.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives say that America Online has been
particularly sensitive to such concerns, by generally ushering
customers to the merchant's site early in the shopping process. And
in cases where America Online does gather customer information,
these executives say, the company pledges to its merchants that it
will not let that information fall into the hands of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Less sensitive to these issues, many say, is Yahoo, the portal
that attracts the most traffic. Though other portals offer shopping
channels that prominently feature certain retailers, Yahoo instead
offers categories of goods, like outdoor apparel or music. A Yahoo
search feature enables shoppers to find and purchase an item from
any number of stores that have bought space on the site. On Yahoo,
in other words, the product _ not the retailer _ is king.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also keeps shoppers on its site for the entire
transaction, so merchants have less control of the data, and the
shopper's experience, than they do with other portals.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brady, Yahoo's vice president for production, acknowledges
the tension such an approach has caused, but stressed that it was
meant to help customers find goods they needed, not usurp merchant
brands. ``I think it's a healthy tension, and I think that's
natural, and there's room for both sides to succeed,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marc Johnson, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a
research firm, said that this tension could cost portals like Yahoo
in the long run. So far, traffic leaders like Yahoo have been able
to justify charging merchants millions of dollars to be linked to
their sites for the same reason a television network can charge
hefty advertising rates for a popular program: because that's where
the potential customers are. But if merchants feel that a portal is
actually undermining its business, the checkbooks may slam shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these portal deals come up for renewal, merchants will
look at them much more closely,'' Johnson said. ``It's not a given
anymore that they're going to renew.''
</P>
<P>
   Arno Harris, vice president of the online retailer 911gifts.com,
which has portal deals with America Online and Excite, among
others, predicted that the discord between merchants and portals
would ``change the strategic landscape'' of Internet shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get lost by focusing on immediate business needs,
but the guiding principle in all of this is delivering the best
possible customer experience,'' Harris said. That experience
involves a multitude of merchandising and customer service nuances,
he said, adding, ``Portals will never be able to provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, some merchants are willing to share the wealth
with portal sites, if trust is established. Revenue sharing,
wherein merchants pay portals a small fee for each transaction
generated, is an increasingly common arrangement between portals
and their partners, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If portals are instrumental in making e-commerce run, I'm
willing to do a revenue share and to share limited data, if that
improves the customer conversion rate and gets more people buying
online,'' said Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of
Bluefly.com, a discount apparel merchant, which is featured on
several major portals, including Go Network and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to figure this out,'' Morris said. ``For the
most part, the portals have been modest enough to say no one knows
the best way to structure e-commerce. The ones that are
closed-minded about it are going to fail because they'll lose their
merchants.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum, of Go Network, said he was not surprised that some
merchants were fearful. ``Any time you see business models collide,
as they have on the Internet, people quickly gravitate to fearful
rather than a forward-thinking position,'' Baum said. ``I just
don't think that as a whole, portals have done a good job of
sending out the message of what we're all about.''

3 INDUSTRIES PASS TESTS FOR YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three major industries racing to prepare their computers for the
Year 2000 _ securities, electric utilities and the airlines _ all
passed important testing milestones in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The securities industry's test, which has been conducted on
weekends since early March, went through its single most important
phase on Saturday, when it simulated Monday, Jan. 3, 2000, the
first trading day next Year and the first day in the test to handle
both new trading and settlement of previous trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went extremely well,'' said John Panchery, the Year 2000
project manager for the Securities Industry Association. All of the
participating exchanges and the organizations that provide them
with clearing and other back-office services _ the backbone of the
$270 billion industry _ came through without any Year 2000
glitches, Panchery said. Results for individual brokers were not
available yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street tests are the most thorough performed by any
industry to deal with the inability of some computers to recognize
that ``00'' as a two-digit date means 2000. The tests involve
several hundred firms, virtually every type of equity they trade,
and, in most cases, the same equipment and software they use to do
business during the week.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Federal Aviation Agency focused on just one
airport _ Denver International _ and one flight in its test
Saturday night of air traffic control, but the test was hailed as a
reassuring success for an industry that many had seen as lagging
far behind the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The electric utility industry's simulation was not so much a
Year 2000 test as a drill of how it would deal with a Year 2000
disaster. More than 200 utilities in Canada and the United States
conducted exercises on Friday to see how they would respond to the
loss of voice and data communications that they normally rely on to
monitor power production and distribution. Without such
information, local utilities and then the power grids over which
electricity flows between states could become unbalanced, leading
to widespread blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   During the exercises, utilities switched to radio and satellite
communication systems and focused on making sure that the minimum
amount of information to keep electricity flowing was being passed
from substations and power plants to utility control rooms, from
the utilities to regional control centers such as the PJM
Interconnection (for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) in
Norristown, Pa., and among the regional centers.
</P>
<P>
   It will take several weeks to gather all of the data. The drill
was described as successful, but it clearly pointed to a number of
minor problems that need further attention, according to Eugene
Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the North American Reliability Council.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the concerns utilities reported: field staff with
out-of-date phone numbers; radio antennae in locations that provide
poor coverage, and employees unable to operate recently purchased
satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
   The drill was conducted alongside normal operations and did not
involve changes to actual generating and transmission equipment.
Many utilities have previously moved power plant computers into the
Year 2000 to make sure that they would not be tripped by the
transition and some have left them there. Some utilities, like
Public Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey, plan to move the
computers on much of their equipment forward to the Year 2000 in
stages this year so that only a small percentage will make the date
transition on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most revealing problem reported in the three
industry tests was a telephone problem affecting the securities
traders that had nothing to do with whether computers will
correctly handle Year 2000 dates. A breakdown in a device that
controls phone traffic into computers at the National Securities
Clearing Corporation on Friday was not repaired before the industry
test began on Saturday. It delayed entries of trading and
bookkeeping information for an undetermined number of firms for
several hours, according to Panchery.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of equipment problems are common, and although we
hadn't planned on it during the test, we got to work on our
contingency plans,'' said Panchery. In a sign of the times,
Clearing Corp. was unable to immediately get all of the incoming
traffic transferred to its backup phone lines because Bell Atlantic
had them tied up in some independent Year 2000 testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much time left and everyone is rushing to get
their testing done,'' Panchery said.

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON ENTICING YOUNG COMPUTER MAJORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RUTH SCHUBERT   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Most University of Washington undergrads toil for two
nail-biting years before they can even apply for admission to the
highly competitive Computer Science and Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
   But in a bid to lure superstar high school seniors to the
University of Washington instead of losing them to places such as
MIT or Stanford, the university will now let a few outstanding
freshmen directly into the major.
</P>
<P>
   The new early admissions program is crucial to getting the best
and the brightest computer scientists of the future, say UW
administrators who pushed for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Washington is unusual in that students
choose their majors relatively late, so if you have your heart set
on a competitive major, that can be a drawback when you're choosing
schools,'' said Ed Lazowska, chairman of the Computer Science and
Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want great Washington state students to feel like they
ought to choose an institution other than the UW.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a major as competitive as computer science, which
regularly turns away a good two-thirds of those who apply, some
students have reservations about giving freshmen coveted slots in
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me goes, `Well, that's not fair because I didn't have
that opportunity,''' said Erin Moore, a senior in computer science
who was admitted to the major a year after transferring from
Bellevue (Wash.) Community College. ``But I think it would be OK as
long as it doesn't push out other people.''
</P>
<P>
   This academic year, the computer science and computer
engineering department admitted a combined 148 students out of 355
who applied and enrolled 135.
</P>
<P>
   To students on the traditional route who may cry ``unfair,''
Lazowska and others say freshmen are limited to no more than 10
percent of those admitted. The freshmen also will have to meet
yet-to-be-determined ``satisfactory progress'' requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trap door,'' said Denice Denton, dean of the UW
College of Engineering. ``What I would say to that other student
is, `Look, this student got this early admission and now they're
going to have to prove that they merit that.' ....It's not really a
special benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The UW's Computer Science and Engineering Department ranks in
the top 10 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of student computer science is hoping to lure to the UW
is someone like Steve Zhang. Under different circumstances, he
might have gone to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang is a UW freshman who, as luck and hard work would have it,
had enough advanced placement and community college course credits
to apply to the computer science major his first year. With nearly
all of the prerequisites under his belt, he was accepted into the
department during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came to the University of Washington because of their
Computer Science and Engineering Department and how good it was,''
Zhang said. ``I really wouldn't have a second choice at the UW, so
if I hadn't gotten into the computer science department, I would
have considered transferring.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Zhang would have been rejected. He graduated
from high school in Beaverton, Ore., with a 4.0 GPA, scored a
perfect 1600 on the SAT and had a couple of summers at Intel under
his belt _ all by age 16. Zhang also had offers from MIT, Cal Tech
and the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Lazowska said that, like Zhang, virtually all students admitted
under the new program wouldn't have reason to worry about getting
into the major prior to their junior year. But the early admission
gives a higher degree of certainty.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of the application decisions complete, the UW
this year admitted 145 freshmen who declared ``computer science''
or ``computer engineering'' as their intended majors.
</P>
<P>
   Other departments are watching computer science to see how the
early admissions program works. It might be extended to other
engineering departments, Denton said. She cites national data
showing that 40 percent of college students who intend to major in
engineering do not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just feel isolated,'' Denton said. ``There's a lot of
reasons to believe that bringing them into the loop earlier and
bringing them into the engineering community earlier would be
beneficial from an academic sense.''

 McCAIN REJECTS INTERNET PROVIDERS' DEMANDS ON HIGH-SPEED DATA  
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The battle over access to high-speed Internet
connections moved Tuesday to the Senate Commerce Committee, whose
chairman, John McCain, R-Ariz., said he would seek a study on how
to make the technology more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three hours of testimony from industry leaders,
McCain rejected calls from America Online Inc. chief executive
Stephen Case and others that cable companies be forced immediately
to open their networks to competitors for high-speed data, or
broadband, services. Instead, McCain said he would file a proposal
with bipartisan backing that would require the Commerce Department
and the Federal Communications Commission to ``analyze the facts
and issues on the deployment of broadband technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC decided in February not to conduct a formal study of
cable broadband services but said it would continue to monitor the
evolving marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, McCain said, he wants to make sure rural and
low-income Americans are not left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-speed Internet access is only available to about 2
percent of all America households today,'' said McCain. ``Given the
huge investments necessary to build these networks, there is
growing concern that rural and disadvantaged areas will lag behind
the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement followed a hearing that focused largely on
whether cable companies should have to play by the same rules as
telephone companies and open their network to competitors. Cable
lines offer Internet connections at speeds dozens of times faster
than a standard telephone line. As consumers move their Internet
connections from telephone modems to high-speed services offered by
cable companies through a single provider, companies like America
Online are concerned that their business will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Case said Tuesday: ``Instead of offering consumers choices,
cable is requiring consumers who want a high-speed cable connection
to the Internet to buy the Internet service affiliated with the
local cable company _ even if they have another Internet service
they like and want to keep it. Consumers who want any Internet
service other than cable's will have to pay twice or not get it
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Brewer, chief executive of Mindspring Enterprises, an
Internet service provider based in Atlanta, echoed Case, insisting
that the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which forced telephone
companies to open their lines, should be imposed on any industry
offering telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   But James Robbins, chief executive of Cox Communications Inc., a
leading cable company, argued that government intervention would
slow investment by companies like his and only increase the cost of
access for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere suggestion from government that such risky
investments could be subjected to old-fashioned cost-of-service
regulation would have a chilling effect on going-forward
investments and would slow down the roll-out of these new advanced
Internet services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members, for the most part, were careful not to take
sides in the debate, emphasizing repeatedly that their focus was on
what was best for consumers, not for any particular segment of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, however, complained that they had been excluded
from the hearing. McCain, responding to suggestions that they had
been intentionally left out, said he planned to call their leaders
to testify at future hearings.

DISNEY INTERNET SPINOFF RUMORED
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rumors emerged Monday that The Walt Disney Co.
will take advantage of Internet mania and convert its Web holdings
into a separate publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Infoseek, the entertainment giant's Web partner, had
no comment on a Wall Street Journal report that the companies are
exploring the spinoff of an Internet company. But Wall Street
reacted enthusiastically, pushing Disney shares up 93.75 cents to
$35.4375 -- its highest close in nearly a month -- while Infoseek
soared $9.75, or 12 percent, to $87.125.
</P>
<P>
   Disney and Sunnyvale-based Infoseek launched the Go Network
portal site in January as a way of luring customers and advertisers
through an easy-to-find ``hub'' for entering the Internet. Disney
bought 43 percent of Infoseek in June for $70 million and $165
million in promotional support when the stock was trading in the
$30 range, but it cannot expand the stake until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors may reflect investor impatience with Disney's stock,
which is 14 percent below May's all-time high. Disney stock rose
slightly after launching Go.com, but Web operations of
conglomerates have generally received lower valuations than
stand-alone Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Anya Sacharow, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, said an
Internet spinoff by Disney would not be a surprise in light of
similar moves planned by Time Warner Inc., CBS Corp. and Barnes &AMP;
Noble. ``I would view it as an aggressive way to consolidate and
grow the business,'' she said. ``With Disney's incredible marketing
power, Go will definitely continue to be one of the major sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Butt Jr., a Forrester Corp. analyst, said he was somewhat
skeptical about the report, despite the attraction of soaring
prices on Wall Street for Web properties. He cited Disney's and
Chairman Michael Eisner's reputations for keeping tight control
over assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Splitting it off seems to go against the Disney grain, so
doing it would mean the potential valuation would have to far
outweigh everything else,'' he said. ``If we were talking about
Rupert Murdoch, it would happen in a minute.''

SEARCHING FOR THE ESSENCE OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gazing through a computer screen onto the vast expanse of the
World Wide Web, one feels like an explorer perched at the edge of
an endless wilderness. It's a bit of a letdown, then, to learn how
very finite the whole place really is.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at a company called Alexa Internet, using computers
to automatically plumb the depths of this ocean of information,
recently estimated that, as of last summer, the Web was three
terabytes in size _ three trillion bytes of information, about
5,000 CD-ROMs. Just about the whole thing would fit onto Sun
Microsystem's top-of-the-line StorEdge A7000 Intelligent Storage
Server, an array of speedy hard-disk drives occupying less than 150
cubic feet. This cyberspace that people have been romping around in
could be squeezed inside a bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the size of the Web that matters. As the world is
increasingly coming to appreciate, physical space and cyberspace
operate according to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   In what they describe as a new science of Webology, computer
scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Silicon Valley
recently funneled a large portion of the Web, about 55 million
pages (leaving out the pictures), onto 400 billion bytes of disk
space. Held in captivity in Palo Alto, this Web in a Box is poked
and prodded, studied like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor
the researchers prefer, like an ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of this simulation, and by probing the real,
living Web with electronic signals, they seek laws by which the
members of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet has
become a living laboratory, a place to study mass human behavior
with a precision and on a scale never possible before.
</P>
<P>
   ``No central authority has cultivated the Web as a beautiful
garden,'' said Dr. Bernardo Huberman, an Internet ecologist at
Xerox PARC. ``It grows on its own like an ecosystem.'' Informavores
hunting down an interesting site link it to their own, and that
site is soon linked to others, forming a vast spider web of
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer reach and structural complexity of the Web makes it
an ecology of knowledge, with relationships, information `food
chains,' and dynamic interactions that could soon become as rich
as, if not richer than, many natural ecosystems,'' Huberman wrote
in a paper last year with his colleagues Peter Pirolli, James
Pitkow and Rajan Lukose.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to find the right metaphor for something so
strange. Viewed in real time, with data seekers buzzing from site
to site, the Web can seem like a swarm of virtual insects, one
whose flutterings (in the form of mouse clicks) can be recorded and
sifted for clues to behavioral laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing computer science,'' Huberman said, ``but
something more akin to social science.'' What strategies do people
use to hunt down information? Why, for no apparent reason, do
storms of activity suddenly surge through the Internet, causing the
whole thing to grind to a halt? And why, just as mysteriously, do
these information fronts suddenly subside?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Web began to burgeon, barely under human control,
people have been straining to relate it to something familiar _ an
ecosystem, the weather, an unruly crowd at a rock concert. The Web
is a great ocean on which you surf from site to site. It's a
cyberspace with a topology of its own: Two points distant in
physical space can be adjacent in cyberspace, a single mouse click
away. But an e-mail message sent in an instant to a neighbor next
door might be routed through a maze of links extending thousands of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Lada Adamic, a Stanford University graduate student working on
Xerox PARC's Internet ecology project, recently found that
cyberspace, like the world described in the John Guare play ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' is a small place indeed. Just as any two
people on Earth are said to be connected by a human chain of
acquaintance with no more than a few links, so can you pick two Web
sites at random and get from one to the other with about four
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   The research quantifies what Web users intuitively know: Because
of the high density of connections, it can be surprisingly easy to
find information in what amounts to a library without a card
catalog, filled with unindexed books.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorms of congestion on the Net, another study found,
can be analyzed in terms of crowd behavior. (Meteorology, sociology
_ the metaphors inevitably clash.) Sudden clots of congestion can
sometimes be traced to obvious causes, like the recent virtual
lingerie show of Victoria's Secret. More often they arise and
quickly dissipate for obscure reasons best understood using what
social scientists call game theory.
</P>
<P>
   You log on to the Internet and find the playing field uncrowded.
With Web sites popping up as quickly as you touch their links, you
click more and more, downloading video files and sound tracks with
little regard for the capacity, or ``bandwidth,'' you are
consuming. Millions of other players are selfishly doing the same.
Inevitably the activity reaches a threshold and connection speeds
start to crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Should you stay around, knowing that others will soon give up in
frustration, leaving you more room? Or will you gain in the long
run if you help relieve the congestion, logging off until the storm
has probably blown by? You must decide, in terms of game theory,
whether to defect from the common good or cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a classic social dilemma, a vastly larger-scale
version of what happens when you are confronted with a steady busy
signal at the theater box office and must decide whether to call
back later or set your phone on constant redial. Short spikes of
congestion are followed by lulls _ a pattern that can be predicted
statistically and verified by ``pinging'' the Net, as the engineers
say, bouncing thousands of packets of information off a particular
site and timing in milliseconds how long they take to return.
</P>
<P>
   From measuring millions of mouse clicks, another study has
derived a mathematical ``law of surfing'' predicting how many pages
one typically visits within a single Web site _ about 1{, a finding
that has been of keen interest to Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web continues to grow exponentially (with everyone
someday as likely to have a Web page as a street address), it will
become an ever richer distillation of human behavior. Even the
dead, discontinued pages will be around for scholars to scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Internet Archive in San Francisco has
collected and stored on disks and tapes more than a billion Web
pages, exceeding 13 terabytes. (The entire Library of Congress has
been estimated to contain 20 terabytes of text.) The plan is to
provide snapshots, year by year, of just what the great terrestrial
brain has been thinking.

KINDER, GENTLER COMPUTERS OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- ``When it comes to computers,'' said Michael
Dertouzos, ``people should be able to do more with less.''
</P>
<P>
   As David Clark, Dertouzos' colleague at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, sees it: ``Everything is going to have a
computer in it. Everything will be connected to the network.
Tomorrow's networks must be consumer friendly and cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another MIT computer scientist, Victor Zue, believes the
machines of the future will be addressed and reply with the spoken
word, when, for example, a user says: ``Let me know when Microsoft
stock is over $160 a share'' or ``call me a half-hour before I must
leave for the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing on Tuesday to these 21st century cyber-visions
was Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who told scientists on the MIT
campus: ``In the future, all your personal and professional
information will be stored in a 'cloud' on the Internet. But
retrieval and privacy still pose a challenge. These are tough
questions that we have not yet answered.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasion that brought Gates to Cambridge was the 35th
anniversary of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science, a
cutting-edge facility Dertouzos has directed since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   MIT marked the event by announcing a new home for the lab, to be
built after Gates sent a check to the university from his family
foundation for $20 million to underwrite construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new home should be ready in 2003, well into a fresh
five-year research project, also announced on Tuesday, aimed at
decoupling personal computers from their traditional desktop
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Dertouzos has dubbed that effort Oxygen. He and his MIT staff at
the lab spent much of the day explaining is goals, which are to be
met through a tax-payer funded $38 million grant from the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, an arm of the Pentagon
that brought the Internet into being in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to liberate ourselves from the tyranny of 'going to
the computer,' Dertouzos said.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oxygenated future, users will carry a universal portable
device that looks something like a cell phone but also has a small
display screen. Dubbed ``Handy 21,'' it will include a digital
video camera, a global positioning system receiver and an infrared
detector, all under the control of a tiny but powerful computer,
which will also be designed at the MIT lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a chameleon,'' Dertouzos said, ``the unit can change at
the flip of a (software command) from a cell phone to a two-way
radio a TV, a beeper, a handheld computer, a pointing device and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Complementing the Handy 21 will be the Enviro 21, a sensory
network to be placed in office walls, homes and cars. These units
would bear the same relationship to the portable devices as do
power sockets to batteries, offering much greater storage capacity,
communication speed and processing power.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology will link all Oxygen devices to each other and
offer speech-recognition, making the system easy to use as a
natural part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   The lab plans to build on the Oxygen project by providing four
user services:
</P>
<P>
   -- A friendly, knowledge-access system that helps you find data
you need while you work in your own familiar way and that remembers
all prior forays onto the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   -- An automation technology that lets you tell the machine what
routine work it should off-load from human shoulders -- for
instance, how and when to interrupt you.
</P>
<P>
   -- A collaborative scheme that helps groups work together by
tracing discussions and keeping track of issues, documents and even
snippets of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   -- A customization approach that adapts Oxygen to the needs of
individual users.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no more shrink-wrapped software,'' Dertouzos
said. ``Everything will be downloadable.''

Net site's message: Don't panic 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Companies and universities are increasingly turning to
the Internet in their crusade to rout the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web to post status reports and inform
employees about how to make their computers recognize the Year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple good examples in metro Atlanta of how
organizations are using the Web, one of which is Emory Unversity's
Rollins School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   This school, which specializes in disease prevention research,
is ahead of the pack. It began correcting its computer systems
about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's taking the campaign to its administrators, faculty and
students through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our Web page is to get information out there,''
says William Morse, the school's director of information services.
``There were a lot of people panicking about Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to put a human face on the problem and take away the
fear,'' Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the school's site states up front that it will be
Y2K-ready at the end of the year. ``Our message is: Don't panic,''
says Morse.
</P>
<P>
   While the school has fixed its networks and servers, there is
still a lot of work to be done. Next, Morse is focusing on the
desktop and portable computers at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In fixing these computers, Morse must first combat the fear of
the unknown. He does that through his school's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Morse has on the site a complete and easy-to-understand
explanation of the Y2K bug and its origin. It says, for example,
that programmers in the 1950s and 1960s conserved the limited
memory available at the time by programming ``dates without the
first two digits. They knew about 2000, but expected that the
software they wrote then would be long gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins' site gives a blow-by-blow account of what the school is
doing to fix the Y2K bug. That includes what has been done so far
and what is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Morse and his team are moving onto desktop and portable
computers. ``A lot of people don't realize how complicated the
issue with desktops can be,'' says Morse.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the school has gotten rid of every computer with a
80486 or older microprocessor. Most of these machines cannot be
upgraded to handle the Year 2000, in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The desktop computers that remain, says the Web site, will be
given a thorough inspection, making sure all software is
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will give you a complete report of what was found so that
if you have some problems with your data or programs, you will be
able to fix it well before January 1, 2000,'' says Morse on the
school's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Rollins' site is at
www.sph.emory.edu/is/computing/y2k/index.html.

 Plans for Billion-Dollar `Ultimate' Internet  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telecommunications giant Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC yesterday said it
will build a billion-dollar phone network in the United States that
will handle Internet and data traffic at blur-fast rates. The
network will be available in 60 metropolitan areas, including the
Bay Area, by the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The American subsidiary of the London company, Cable &AMP; Wireless
USA, announced it is now spending $670 million on 15,000 miles of
fiber-optic cabling for the as-yet-unnamed network, whose price tag
eventually will top $1 billion. When complete, the new network will
deliver voice, data and Internet services at speeds more than 10
times faster than the commercial Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating the ultimate Internet for consumers and
businesses,'' said Art Medici, senior vice president of marketing
at Cable &AMP; Wireless USA in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The vast network eventually will be hooked up to Cable &AMP;
Wireless' global Internet network, with operations in Europe and
Asia. Cable &AMP; Wireless USA plans to make segments of the U.S.
network available as soon as they are ready. Half a dozen unnamed
cities are scheduled to be switched on in September.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the network has not been finalized, Medici said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable &AMP; Wireless _ which paid $1.75 billion for MCI
Communications Corp.'s Internet business last year _ is in the
midst of a five-year, $1 billion plan to construct a similar
high-speed network in Europe. The British company is already one of
the largest telecom companies in Asia through its majority stake in
Hong Kong Telecommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom rivals are scrambling to develop global phone services
using Internet-based technology to cash in on an online boom. The
number of Internet users is expected to double, to 300 million, by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Among the competitors creating worldwide networks:
</P>
<P>
   _AT&AMP;T Corp. and British Telecommunications PLC said they will
join forces to sell global phone services to multinational
companies using Internet-based technology.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet2, a coalition of 130 universities and high-tech
companies, in February flipped the switch on a key segment of its
private research network that connects 70 college campuses. The
3-year-old nonprofit organization includes the University of
California at Berkeley and Stanford University, as well as
corporate sponsors Cisco Systems, IBM and Qwest Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The 13,000-mile Internet2 network is up to 45,000 times faster
than the commercial Web, but it is not available to the public.
Only researchers and employees at the colleges and corporate
sponsors can use it. Consumers eventually will be able to use
cutting-edge applications created on Internet2 but only after they
have been developed and sold by Internet2 members for commercial
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   _Project Oxygen (www.oxygen.org) _ a $10 billion commercial
venture that hopes to leapfrog the nonprofit Internet2 _ would pump
video, sound and data at speeds up to 5.5 million times faster than
the Web to users in 78 countries. The underwater network of
fiber-optic cables will traverse the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they have raised $1.8 billion from investors,
loans and corporate sponsors such as Lucent, Pacific Telesis,
Japan's NEC and France's Alcatel. They also said they have deals
with 40 telecom carriers. Launched in mid-1997, Project Oxygen will
undergo several phases before it is completed in early 2003.

 Going, Going, Gone _ `Bay Traders' Sold on Auctions  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want to make it big as an Internet entrepreneur? You could
start up a company, search for financing, hire staff and go public.
Or you could just clean out your garage.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gina Ward of Columbus, Ohio, got started. Ward, 47,
fretted about her future after she got ``downsized'' out of her
executive secretary job at Borden Inc. last year. Then a friend
prodded her to put some of the junk she had acquired at yard sales
up for sale on eBay, the giant Internet auction house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this sugar bowl I'd bought for 50 cents. I put it on
eBay for $7.99, and I started getting letters from people saying,
`Do you know what you have there?'''
</P>
<P>
   The sugar bowl turned out to be a rare Noritake humidor for
sugar cubes. Ward's 50-cent investment netted her nearly $400 _ and
she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ralph, 57, retired in June, and the two have made
trading on eBay their business ever since, buying up pottery,
dishes, sheet music, thimbles, Depression glass and fishing lures
at yard sales and auctions in Ohio and selling them for a profit on
eBay. They now post 25 to 100 items a week for sale and, some
months, bring in as much as $5,000 in gross revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Wards are part of a new breed of ``Bay traders,'' people who
make a living selling stuff on the Internet. Most of them prefer
eBay, which has 85 percent of the online auction market.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``day traders,'' who work full-time buying and selling
stock online, Bay traders spend endless hours at their computers,
checking the latest bids on their auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Bay traders say they get higher prices at auctions than at swap
meets or collectibles shows because bidding generates excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is two people who want the same thing, and the
price goes up,'' Gina Ward said. And the Internet's worldwide reach
makes multiple bids more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to sit down and work, they can make a small
fortune on eBay. You just have to find something other people want
and sell it,'' said Ray Geeck, who with his wife, Anne, works seven
days a week auctioning off antique dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The couple used to sell at doll shows or at their store in Lake
Panasoffkee, Fla. But in the fall of 1997, they ventured online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting $300 and $400 on eBay for things we couldn't
sell for $125 at the shows,'' said Ray Geeck. They gave up the doll
shows and stuck to their computer _ which eventually became several
computers and a staff of 10. Last year, the business grossed about
$1 million, and a few weeks ago, the Geecks paid cash for a
three-bedroom house with a perfect view of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay isn't about auctions. It's about connecting buyers and
sellers. It's enabled people to do something they couldn't do
before _ faster, better and cheaper,'' said Meg Whitman, chief
executive officer of the San Jose company and herself a new
stock-option billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Maron spent a dozen years selling animation cels _
individual hand-painted pictures used to make cartoons _ to some 30
or 40 galleries from his offices in suburban Chicago. A little more
than a year ago, he shifted all of his business to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied beyond anything I could have imagined,'' said
Maron, who has twice outgrown his office space since making the
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many people are full-time eBay sellers. Late
last year, the company singled out 10,000 people and crowned them
PowerSellers, signifying sales of more than $2,000 a month. But not
everyone has quit their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Drum, who sells antique stock certificates from his home in
Toledo, Ohio, has made enough from eBay and from his own Web site
to buy a new computer desk, fax machine, printer, scanner and a new
Mercedes Benz. But, newly married and 34, he's not ready to give up
his job as a supervisor at a plant that manufactures Hunt's
snack-pack pudding. There's no telling, he said, how long the
auction business will hold out.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sperber, a longtime coin dealer in Lincroft, N.J., said
she uses eBay because it saves her money. She pays $1,500 for an ad
in a coin magazine with 75,000 readers. A listing on eBay costs her
$2 or less and has a potential reach of 2.1 million people.
Although not all 2.1 million are interested in old coins, Sperber
said some of her auctions have had as many as 10,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   If the item sells on eBay, sellers must pay a commission of 1.25
to 5 percent. Sperber expects her business, Legend Numismatics, to
do about $1 million in sales on eBay this year.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions also let people operate from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 500 miles from the nearest city, Detroit, and we don't
get much traffic in the winter months _ and winter is most of what
we're about up here,'' said Judy Owen, an antique-furniture dealer
in remote Traverse City, Mich. About a year ago, she put a few
pieces up for sale on eBay, and in three weeks, she'd made $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like any small business, Bay traders still have to worry about
things like shipping, billing and bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wards have filled their basement with boxes, bubble wrap,
plastic peanuts and other packaging materials, mostly salvaged from
other people's trash. Their family room is full of computer
equipment for posting merchandise and keeping track of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Many have invested in digital cameras, so they can show their
wares on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers have set up credit-card accounts and daily United
Parcel Service pickup. But the Wards like to keep things simple.
Ralph Ward makes a few runs to the post office and the UPS office
each week. And they still take checks, though they always wait for
the check to clear before shipping. Out of 1,000 sales, they've had
just two bounced checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you know what kinds of people will give you
trouble, what the red flags are,'' said Ralph Ward. Buyers who want
to wriggle out of a deal often appear to be looking for faults in
the merchandise, or they may become overly particular about how and
when an item can be shipped, he said.

HOW WALL STREET CAN HELP YOUR CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Since April 15 is already National Weep About
Money Day, devote a few minutes this week to pure capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   If you can understand the stock market _ one of the few places
where middle-class people are earning real money these days _ it
could help your career in all sorts of ways, financial and
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't a fashionable thing for a lot of career counselors
to talk about. You should have a career you love, they say, and
then the money will take care of itself. What they overlook,
though, is that having money gives you more career options, such as
starting your own business, working part time, or doing something
you love that doesn't pay much.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some things you should understand about the stock
market, and how they can help your career:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet has changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be hard for small investors to keep up with the news
about individual stocks; the daily newspaper and the Wall Street
Journal could give you only so much. Now there are tons of Internet
sites with news and statistics.
</P>
<P>
   At work, it's the same thing. Job hunters need to realize that
if they don't know much about a company or what their salary should
be, they haven't done their homework. Internet sites like
jobsmart.org have salary comparisons, and most companies have Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be said loudly enough: If you're an investor or a
job hunter and you don't use the Internet, you're operating under a
severe handicap. And if your prospective company doesn't have a Web
site, think twice about how long it's going to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand all the risks.
</P>
<P>
   People are intimidated because stocks have bad days or months or
even years, and that sounds too risky for them. What they overlook
is that having plain old savings accounts also carries a risk:
Inflation and taxes can wipe out any interest they receive.
</P>
<P>
   Changing jobs or careers or even quitting a job outright all are
risky. But staying in the same job for 20 or 30 years also carries
a risk: If you're laid off, finding another job can be almost
impossible because you don't have the variety of experience that
employers are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dividends can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors think that a stock that pays a dividend is better
than one that doesn't. Not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   If a stock has a dividend, it usually means that the company
can't come up with anything more attractive than giving the money
back to shareholders. Many fast-growing companies don't pay
dividends because they can put the money to better use expanding
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Each time you get a raise or a bonus, think about whether you
really need the extra money immediately. If you don't, buy yourself
some future career options by investing it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The more established you get, the more important
diversification becomes.
</P>
<P>
   People who run mutual funds preach the virtues of
diversification. Their funds own lots of stocks and sometimes
bonds, so you won't be hurt much if one or two stocks crumble. You
can take advantage of the stock market's long-term growth without
putting too much emphasis on any one company.
</P>
<P>
   But diversification limits rewards as well as risks. If you put
a lot of your money in one stock and it skyrockets, no mutual fund
will be able to match that.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest career risks _ trying to be an actor or professional
athlete, starting your own business _ also offer the biggest
rewards. If you try to hedge instead of diving into them
passionately, you almost certainly will fail. But just as with that
risky stock, you have to know when to cut your losses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you've gotten to where you want to be,
diversification helps you protect it _ and maybe even improve it.
</P>
<P>
   People who build strong networks and continually add skills are
not only more likely to find a job if they get laid off, they're
less likely to get laid off in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Think long term.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous investors run into trouble because they buy or sell out
of panic, not logic. Try this: Don't think about buying a great
stock; think about buying part of a great company. If it's a great
company, it will succeed. And if it succeeds, its stock will go up
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Your career might have as many ups and downs as the stock
market, but good workers generally end up with good jobs. Those who
succeed keep both their triumphs and disasters in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch your assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even great companies don't necessarily stay great forever.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they get tripped up by the competition; other times by
their own arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Think about how many athletes or actors fade away because they
either take success for granted or they just can't keep performing
at their peak.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the top is hard. Staying there is even harder.

STATISTICS ON EQUAL PAY SOMETIMES DECEIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The average full-time female worker earns about
75 cents for every dollar that the average man earns. Is that a
misleading statistic, or an indicator that women still are a long
way from workplace equality, 36 years after the federal Equal Pay
Act was passed? Yes, on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   The federal statistic is misleading because it simply compares
the median earnings of all full-time workers of both sexes, not
taking into account experience, education, ability or even the type
of job involved.
</P>
<P>
   Women were at 74 cents per men's dollar in 1997, the last full
year for which figures are available. In the first quarter of 1998,
the figure rose to 76 cents, mainly because of increases in the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not say that all of that is pure discrimination,''
says Susan Bianchi-Sand, executive director of the National
Committee on Pay Equity in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from the committee's Web site
(http://feminist.com/fairpay.htm), women were at only 60 percent of
men's earnings until 1980, but increased to 72 percent by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the gap has actually closed is that men's wages
have stagnated,'' Bianchi-Sand says. ``You don't close the gap by
holding men's wages down. No one is interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Policy Institute in Washington says that through
1997, the inflation-adjusted median wages for women had grown just
0.8 percent during the 1990s. Wages for men had fallen 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wage gap is a flawed statistic, experts say women
still are being underpaid for several reasons _ including
discrimination. In the late 1980s, the President's Council of
Economic Advisers found that 12 cents of the wage gap could not be
explained, says Kelly Jenkins-Pultz, a policy adviser in the
Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's Web site (www.aflcio.org/women) points to wage
gaps in a variety of jobs. It says, for example, that female
lawyers earn nearly $300 per week less than male lawyers, and
female professors are paid $170 per week less than male professors.
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi-Sand says much of the gap is because many jobs
traditionally held by women don't pay as well as jobs traditionally
held by men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot about attitude, which in some cases translates into
overt discrimination,'' she says. ``Attitudes are harder to change
than laws, it appears.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes discrimination laws are of little help because they
apply only to jobs that have workers of both sexes, Bianchi-Sand
says. She explains that social workers (typically female) have many
of the same duties as probation officers (typically male), but are
paid substantially less. That is not discrimination under the law
because they are different jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among jobs available to people without a college degree, many of
the highest-paying involve danger or physical labor. Those jobs are
traditionally held by men _ in some cases because few women want
them.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins-Pultz agrees that many women are in low-wage jobs like
cashiers and secretaries, or in low-wage industries like service
and child care. Still, she is encouraged because more women are
ending up in managerial and administrative jobs, or in high-paying
professional jobs like doctors and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not nontraditional jobs for women anymore,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins-Pultz also is encouraged because more bachelor's degrees
now are being awarded to women than men, and more women are
developing the kind of work experience that can get them better
jobs. She says women traditionally have had less education and less
work experience than men, two legitimate reasons for part of the
wage gap.
</P>
<P>
   Three other factors can contribute to the gap: perception,
pricing and parenthood. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Perception: Sometimes even those who agree that women are
discriminated against don't recognize that they're part of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Romac International survey of human resources executives
found that 52 percent believed that women were being paid less than
men for comparable work, but only 21 percent thought it was
happening in their own companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pricing: Sometimes female workers don't negotiate as hard or
as well for a high salary as their male counterparts do. Or they
may find other aspects of the job that are worth more to them than
money.
</P>
<P>
   Leon A. Farley, a San Francisco executive search consultant for
27 years, says men and women earning more than $500,000 a year tend
to emphasize compensation equally. For those whose compensation is
$150,000 to $500,000, however, he sees men pushing harder for the
extra pay than women do.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is because of family, Farley says. More of the women
in that category have spouses who also work, so they may be more
concerned with a good opportunity or other benefits than with
bringing in extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Age can be a factor as well. Although he acknowledges there are
plenty of exceptions, Farley says younger women _ who grew up
playing sports and being encouraged to compete more than their
mothers had been _ are more likely to push for equal wages.
</P>
<P>
   But not always. Take the results of a study by John Jost, an
assistant professor of organizational behavior at Stanford
University's Graduate School of Business. He asked 132 Yale
University undergraduate students to write an essay about computer
shopping, then put a price tag on the essay.
</P>
<P>
   A panel judged that the essays of the female students were just
as good as those by the male students, but the women set their
price 18 percent less than the men did.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parenthood: When families have children, mothers are far more
likely than fathers to leave the work force for several years to
raise the kids. When people leave the work force for several years,
their skills get rusty and their careers suffer.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem goes deeper than that, Bianchi-Sand says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vicious circle. Because of the fear that female employees
will have children and leave, she says, some employers won't give
women the same training or opportunities that men receive. So the
women don't do as well and don't earn as much money.

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bill Archer of Houston might be expressing the
frustrations of millions of Americans when he says: ``I want to
tear the income tax out by its roots so it never grows back
again.''
</P>
<P>
   That anti-tax sound bite often uttered by the Republican
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee might seem
particularly appropriate on Thursday as procrastinators scramble to
get their tax returns postmarked by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them might wonder: Whatever happened to those
much-ballyhooed GOP plans to overhaul the tax system?
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the graduated income tax was a rallying cry for
the new Republican majority when the GOP took control of the House
in 1994 for the first time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But ``tax reform'' is now little more than a wistful memory _ or
a campaign slogan _ for most lawmakers. It has become a casualty of
a robust economy and political reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happened on the way to tax reform, and that's a
booming economy,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of congressional
relations at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of good economic times, new legislation to curb
abuses by the Internal Revenue Service, and a weakened Republican
majority in the House have blunted efforts for a tax overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Except for such true believers as Archer, who champions a
national sales tax, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey, the
Irving Republican who wants a flat tax, few lawmakers on Capitol
Hill even talk much about overhauling taxes anymore. They prefer
instead to focus on tax cuts in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tax season,'' Armey said. ``We always find the affection
the American people have for the flat tax grows between January and
April.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the flat tax would do away with the current
graduated income tax, with its five rates, from 15 percent to 39.6
percent, and impose a single rate for all taxpayers. Armey, for
example, proposes a rate of 17 percent and says the tax returns
could be done on a form the size of a postcard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I always knew that was a long-run project,'' said Armey,
who began touting the flat tax in 1994. ``I knew that it would take
me at least 10 years to pass it into law. I believe I'll pass it
into law by the end of the year 2002. But between now and then,
we've got to get that tax relief which is available to the
overtaxed American taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who will retire at the end of this Congress, will be
turning from overhauling taxes to the equally formidable task of
saving Social Security from insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman hasn't lost any interest in reforming the tax
code,'' said Trent Duffy, spokesman for the Ways and Means
Committee. ``Having said that, with the president's interest in
Social Security reform, we're going to be seizing on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer and Armey have cultivated a friendly rivalry as each
promoted his respective version of tax code change, but lack of a
Republican consensus on a single approach was only one problem. As
the GOP majority diminished in the 1996 and 1998 congressional
elections, the Republicans are left with a six-vote majority and a
dim outlook for a tax overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lawmakers' success in getting a
taxpayer-friendly IRS bill passed last year and making some tax
cuts, such as a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, helped
reduce the urgency for radical changes in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   In the 106th Congress, which convened in January and runs for
two years, there are no hearings planned, no bills in motion _ in
short, no momentum whatsoever to a tax overhaul effort that once
appeared an unstoppable juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone is giving up on it _ especially those ordinary
folks out in the hinterland who have been listening to the
pronouncements of presidential hopefuls on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's fallen out of fashion in Washington,'' said Ken
Johnson, press secretary to Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La. ``But it
hasn't fallen out of favor with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, who advocates a tax on consumption, plans to introduce a
bill Thursday calling for a 15 percent national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Fair Taxation, a national sales tax group based in
Houston, takes a slightly different approach. It wants a 23 percent
national sales tax rate, which would also eliminate payroll taxes
that now fund Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only pure consumption tax,'' said Laura Dale, a
consultant to the nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Linbeck Jr., chairman of Americans for Fair Taxation, said
the plan was ``developed like a product _ by asking focus groups
and polling what people value and what their interest was in seeing
reform of taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has spent $15 million over the past 31/2 years
developing and promoting its plan through an extensive grassroots
campaign. It expects to spend $90 million on the entire effort.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said he expects the plan to be introduced in Congress
before the summer break. He would not say who the sponsors might
be.
</P>
<P>
   Political forecasters are looking to the 2000 presidential
campaign, however, to breathe new life into the concept. ``It'll
probably take presidential leadership,'' Wittman said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a favorite for the Republican
presidential nomination, has not taken a position on a specific
plan. But others, such as magazine publisher Steve Forbes and
social conservative Gary Bauer, are pressing for a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes helped make ``flat tax'' a household term, at least in
political circles, in the 1996 presidential race and is ready to
take up the flat tax banner again, advocating a 17 percent rate. On
Thursday, he will stage an event in Portsmouth, N.H., to call for
``tax code termination day.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he has spoken to Bush about the concept of reducing
taxes and overhauling taxes. ``I think he's pretty much in tune
with the rest of the party,'' Armey said of the governor.

CRITICS IGNORE IMPROVEMENTS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Kosovo is the current international crisis
that engages the attention of American policymakers and military
forces, but I wonder whether another is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to China, the world's most populous nation, whose prime
minister just visited the United States, the world's most powerful
nation. Premier Zhu Rongji's American sojourn has prompted the
usual suspects, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to demonize
China over its human rights record, its illegal donations to U.S.
political campaigns and suspicions that it has stolen U.S. nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   I admit to a degree of identity crisis. As an American-born
ethnic Chinese, I embrace the freedoms of our society yet honor the
cultural heritage of my immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   In my lifetime, their homeland has undergone monumental changes
_ from civil war to totalitarian Communist rule to significant
stability under capitalist-inspired economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking here of improving the lives of more than 1
billion people. Why are some American leaders so venomous toward
China? It could not be because China poses an immediate strategic
or economic threat.
</P>
<P>
   While in this country, Zhu asked why some Americans apparently
fear China when the United States has more than 6,000 nuclear
weapons compared to China's two dozen. And the U.S. economy is 10
times bigger than China's. Why exactly is the King of the World so
paranoid about China?
</P>
<P>
   I can't help thinking back on a trip I took to China four months
ago. (Most of my two-week visit, except for the plane fare, was
paid for by the Chinese government.) I visited high-tech
industries, historical sites and cultural institutions in four
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions about politics were not on our agenda, but I managed
to talk with several young Chinese who were not part of the
official itinerary. I asked them whether the lives of ordinary
Chinese people have improved. All gave an unqualified yes.
</P>
<P>
   I did not see large areas of abject poverty when touring
Guangzhou, Xian, Hangzhou and Shanghai. What I saw were throngs of
people in modern department stores that sell a rich variety of
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Do ordinary Chinese think about acquiring greater individual
freedoms, including political rights?
</P>
<P>
   A young teacher said ordinary Chinese today have more freedoms
than they had a decade ago, such as greater access to information
and more freedom to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Another _ a tall, slender young man who works at a
pharmaceutical company _ said he believes the Chinese people will
become freer with continuing economic modernization.
</P>
<P>
   I asked a 23-year-old journalist whether Chinese people think
much about having more individual freedom and political power.
</P>
<P>
   She said such thoughts were remote or nonexistent among ordinary
Chinese, who are too busy trying to survive.
</P>
<P>
   One of my traveling companions, a Chinese-American radio
journalist from New York who grew up in China, said that,
historically, the Chinese people have believed in honoring the
father in a family relationship. The emperor became the nation's
father and the people obeyed him without question.
</P>
<P>
   The father authority figure remains an animating force in how
ordinary Chinese people view their leaders, he said. But he quickly
added that modernization is slowly changing how the Chinese feel
about this.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the complexities of transforming a once-feudal
society, China has made big strides in economic reforms and some
advances in political freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't the China-bashers at least willing to concede that?
</P>

   &UR; Roy Sorrels  &LR; was watching a game of three-card monte in
Manhattan when a voice yelled, ``Cop!'' The dealer disappeared and
three cards fluttered to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Picking them up ``was the beginning of my yearlong hunt for one
full deck of found playing cards,'' he writes in the latest issue
of Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he created a display on which to glue the found cards,
no more than three at a time by his own rules. When friends accused
him of eccentricity, he created his own rationale. ``I want to
spend at least part of my time doing things that don't necessary
make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, he was short only one card, the three of
clubs. Then he came upon the same three-card monte man, shuffling
the cards at the site at which the collecting had begun. ``I
stopped 20 feet away from him and yelled, `Cop!' He kicked over the
boxes and ran.''
</P>
<P>
   There on the sidewalk, Sorrels found his card. ``Everyone

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's treasured national documents, including
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, are being
bathed in a greenhouse gas.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good.
</P>
<P>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration chemists recently
used a laser-based instrument to determine that airtight cases
containing the two documents and the Bill of Rights have not
leaked.
</P>
<P>
   That means the documents, which are viewed by more than 1
million people a year at the National Archives here, are still
being protected by the mixture of helium and water vapor in which
they were hermetically sealed nearly 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The laser-based instrument _ built to allow NASA chemists to
measure atmospheric levels of water vapor, a greenhouse gas _ was
used to assay the thin film of gas surrounding the three ``Charters
of Freedom'' without opening their sealed cases.
</P>
<P>
   The laser beam was shot through the cases near the edges, where
it did not strike the documents inside. By analyzing the way the
film of gas changed the properties of the beam as it passed
through, the chemists were able to identify the gas mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the laser was back in its customary place, attached
to the underside of the wing of a NASA research plane flying over
the southern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Its brief trip to the world of priceless historical documents
was an example of a growing trend among museum curators and
archivists to use Space Age technologies to deal with age-old
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tools that sound like they belong in a laboratory or aboard a
man-made Earth satellite are enabling the keepers of treasured
objects of art and history to detect forgeries, plan restorations,
even study the careers of long-dead painters and sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
fluorescence and xeroradiography can peer into areas that otherwise
are beyond the reach of art historians and museum curators:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before the Air and Space Museum restored the Wright Brothers'
1903 Flyer, the first plane successfully flown by the aviation
pioneers, irreplaceable bolts were X-rayed so curators would know
which way to turn them when the plane was disassembled.
</P>
<P>
   _ A treasured object thought to have been created by a master
painter or sculptor can be shown to be the skillful work of a
forger. At the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., an instrument
known as a Fourier transform infrared spectroscope was used a few
years ago to bombard a sample of paint from a ``rare 18th-century
chest'' and expose an ingredient that did not exist in the 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   _ A famous painting can be shown to have gradually faded so that
it looks dramatically different from how it looked the day it was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   _ By analyzing brush strokes and other techniques throughout the
lifetime of an artist, scholars can learn how various traits
evolved during the artist's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution Center for Materials Research not
only maintains a tool box filled with sophisticated instruments for
studying antiquities, fossils, and art treasures, but it also
supports research in such areas as the actual chemical and
biological processes in the deterioration of materials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to working with individual Smithsonian institutions,
the center has provided assistance to the FBI and the Army.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the documents at the National Archives, the need
to find out what kind of gas occupies the space less than an eighth
of an inch thick in their glass cases developed after curators
noticed what appear to be small areas of deterioration in the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page Constitution, its letter of transmittal, the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights were encased in
the helium-water vapor mixture in 1951 and 1952 by the National
Institute of Science and Technology, then known as the National
Bureau of Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Joel S. Levine, the NASA scientist who performed the test
confirming that the same encased atmosphere still surrounds the
documents, said the mixture is approximately 99 percent helium, an
inert gas that will not corrode the sheepskin parchment on which
the documents were written.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 percent water vapor is intended to prevent flaking of the
parchment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   The test was possible, he said, because all gases, including
water vapor and helium, absorb light at specific and unique wave
lengths.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is how the greenhouse effect works. Visible light
from the sun passes through the atmosphere at wave lengths that are
not affected by gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and water
vapor.
</P>
<P>
   But infrared radiation, given off by the Earth's surface after
it is heated up by the sunlight, does interact with those gases.
They absorb the infrared heat and keep it from escaping into space
while more heat comes in from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   To measure water vapor over various parts of the Earth, NASA had
a laser already tuned to the wavelength with which the water
molecule interacts.
</P>
<P>
   When it is attached to the underside of NASA's Douglas DC-8
research plane and directed at a receiver in the cabin, the laser
beam is weakened slightly by the water vapor molecules it
encounters along the way. By measuring the degree of change in the
beam, scientists can record an extremely precise inventory of water
vapor in the air the plane flies through.
</P>
<P>
   The same process, Levine said, allowed him and his NASA
colleagues to assay the air inside the Charters cases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an Archives spokeswoman said there are plans to build
a new generation of cases for the Charters of Freedom.

   TRAVELS OF THE CHARTERS
</P>
<P>
   Between 1776 and 1814, the Declaration of Independence traveled
with the Continental Congress, rolled and unrolled whenever it was
used.
</P>
<P>
   It remained in Philadelphia until late 1777, when it was taken
to Baltimore along with the Congress, which had moved out of
Philadelphia because of invading British.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, Congress passed a law giving the Department of Foreign
Affairs, later to become the State Department, ``the custody and
charge'' of all national papers and documents.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration
of Independence, became secretary of state and custodian of the
document, along with the new Constitution, the Bill of Rights and
the letter of transmittal of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1814, during the War of 1812, the documents were removed from
the State Department under orders from President James Monroe, to
keep them from falling into British hands. Packed in coarse linen
and bags, they were hauled to a grist mill in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1841, Secretary of State Daniel Webster suggested the
documents be moved to a new building built for the U.S. Patent
Office. The Declaration was hung _ in a single frame along with
George Washington's commission as commander in chief _ on a white
wall opposite a window, resulting in prolonged exposure to
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1876 the Declaration was moved to Independence Hall in
Philadelphia, where it was originally signed, for exhibition in a
special safe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1877 it was placed in a cabinet in the State Department
Library, a room that had an open fireplace and in which smoking was
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1894, the State Department announced the document was too
badly deteriorated to be displayed any longer, so it was wrapped
and placed in a steel case.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, the Declaration and the Constitution were turned over
to the Library of Congress, where the Constitution was to be placed
on exhibition to the ``patriotic public.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, 1941, the librarian of Congress, worried about the
possibility of World War II leading to some incident that would
damage or destroy the documents, asked that they be locked up at
Fort Knox in Kentucky. They were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Congress appropriated money to have the documents
turned over to the National Archives and preserved for the public
to see.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, following studies by representatives of a gas
manufacturers and officials of the Archives and the National Bureau
of Standards, the glass cases that currently hold the objects were
built.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's treasured national documents, including
the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, are being
bathed in a greenhouse gas.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good.
</P>
<P>
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration chemists recently
used a laser-based instrument to determine that airtight cases
containing the two documents and the Bill of Rights have not
leaked.
</P>
<P>
   That means the documents, which are viewed by more than 1
million people a year at the National Archives here, are still
being protected by the mixture of helium and water vapor in which
they were hermetically sealed nearly 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The laser-based instrument _ built to allow NASA chemists to
measure atmospheric levels of water vapor, a greenhouse gas _ was
used to assay the thin film of gas surrounding the three ``Charters
of Freedom'' without opening their sealed cases.
</P>
<P>
   The laser beam was shot through the cases near the edges, where
it did not strike the documents inside. By analyzing the way the
film of gas changed the properties of the beam as it passed
through, the chemists were able to identify the gas mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the laser was back in its customary place, attached
to the underside of the wing of a NASA research plane flying over
the southern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Its brief trip to the world of priceless historical documents
was an example of a growing trend among museum curators and
archivists to use Space Age technologies to deal with age-old
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tools that sound like they belong in a laboratory or aboard a
man-made Earth satellite are enabling the keepers of treasured
objects of art and history to detect forgeries, plan restorations,
even study the careers of long-dead painters and sculptors.
</P>
<P>
   Technologies such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray
fluorescence and xeroradiography can peer into areas that otherwise
are beyond the reach of art historians and museum curators:
</P>
<P>
   _ Before the Air and Space Museum restored the Wright Brothers'
1903 Flyer, the first plane successfully flown by the aviation
pioneers, irreplaceable bolts were X-rayed so curators would know
which way to turn them when the plane was disassembled.
</P>
<P>
   _ A treasured object thought to have been created by a master
painter or sculptor can be shown to be the skillful work of a
forger. At the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., an instrument
known as a Fourier transform infrared spectroscope was used a few
years ago to bombard a sample of paint from a ``rare 18th-century
chest'' and expose an ingredient that did not exist in the 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   _ A famous painting can be shown to have gradually faded so that
it looks dramatically different from how it looked the day it was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   _ By analyzing brush strokes and other techniques throughout the
lifetime of an artist, scholars can learn how various traits
evolved during the artist's life.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution Center for Materials Research not
only maintains a tool box filled with sophisticated instruments for
studying antiquities, fossils, and art treasures, but it also
supports research in such areas as the actual chemical and
biological processes in the deterioration of materials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to working with individual Smithsonian institutions,
the center has provided assistance to the FBI and the Army.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the documents at the National Archives, the need
to find out what kind of gas occupies the space less than an eighth
of an inch thick in their glass cases developed after curators
noticed what appear to be small areas of deterioration in the
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page Constitution, its letter of transmittal, the
Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights were encased in
the helium-water vapor mixture in 1951 and 1952 by the National
Institute of Science and Technology, then known as the National
Bureau of Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Joel S. Levine, the NASA scientist who performed the test
confirming that the same encased atmosphere still surrounds the
documents, said the mixture is approximately 99 percent helium, an
inert gas that will not corrode the sheepskin parchment on which
the documents were written.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 percent water vapor is intended to prevent flaking of the
parchment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   The test was possible, he said, because all gases, including
water vapor and helium, absorb light at specific and unique wave

</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is how the greenhouse effect works. Visible light

KCET VIEWERS TREATED TO CEREBRAL MURDER MYSTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(``Tonight'' refers to Thursday, April 15)  
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ P.D. James is sort of the thinking person's Agatha
Christie. Like Christie's, her mysteries are intricately plotted,
but unlike Dame Agatha's tidy endings, James' are usually knotty
affairs. ``Mystery's'' dramatization of James' 1998 best seller ``A
Certain Justice'' is a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Certain Justice &UR; , &LR; '' airing in three parts starting tonight
on KCET, marks actor Roy Marsden's 10th time as James'
introspective poet/detective Adam Dalgliesh. This time he is called
on to investigate the murder of high-powered barrister Venetia
Aldridge (Penny Downie).
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious and abrasive Venetia had recently successfully
defended Gary Ashe (Ricci Harnett), accused of brutally murdering
his aunt, a prostitute, in their London home. Venetia was fairly
sure that Ashe was guilty, but that hadn't deterred her from doing
her job.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, however, it's another matter when her
18-year-old daughter Octavia (Flora Montgomery) _ recently home
from boarding school and alienated from mother _ announces that
she's fallen in love with Ashe.
</P>
<P>
   Though voicing her opposition, Venetia doesn't have a chance to
break up the relationship. The barrister is found in her law-firm
office stabbed to death with a letter opener that replicates the
sword of justice, a barrister's wig _ a classic heirloom long in
storage _ on her head, and covered in blood that is not her own.
</P>
<P>
   Dalgliesh and his assistant, Detective Inspector Kate Miskin
(Sarah Winman), are faced with a multitude of suspects besides
Ashe. The investigation centers on a number of Venetia's co-workers
whom she has offended or who felt their positions were in jeopardy
were she to become head of the firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is, like other James' works, a complex web that involves the
past. The unsettling conclusion leaves as many questions as it
raises. Not about the whodunit, which is wrapped up quite nicely,
but about the nature of justice, and if we somehow determine our
own.
</P>
<P>
   While ``A Certain Justice'' is a smooth adaption of James'
novel, it is Marsden's quiet, thoughtful presence as Dalgliesh that
gives these productions an added edge.

LABOR BACKS BILL TO OVERHAUL CALIFORNIA OVERTIME LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A labor-backed bill in the California Assembly
would restore daily overtime and affect millions of primarily
nonunion, hourly employees.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los Angeles, pits
organized labor against businesses and some wage earners who like
the flexibility allowed under the state's current law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 16-month-old overtime law, workers can work longer
hours on certain days in exchange for working fewer hours another
day, in effect jamming a 40-hour work week into less than five full
days.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco restaurant worker Nancy Hahn said the flexibility
permitted under this system made both her and her boss happy. She
gets time during the week for personal business or leisure, while
her boss doesn't have to pay any overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is a lot happier this way,'' Hahn said, referring to
her fellow workers at the Fog City Diner. ``A lot of people are
working double shifts now because they want to, not because they
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor organizers counter that that argument is just an excuse to
take advantage of employees. The Knox bill would restore a system
in which workers begin to earn overtime if they work more than
eight hours in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flexibility at a cost isn't what we need,'' said Walter
Johnson, secretary-treasurer of the San Francisco Labor Council.
``This situation without any control is really a form of slavery to
the people who have no control.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the 40-hour rule, which was approved by the
Industrial Welfare Commission under former Gov. Pete Wilson, has
saved businesses $1 billion in overtime since it went into effect
Jan. 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the University of California and the AFL-CIO
criticized the 40-hour-week overtime law, making the case that
women would be disproportionately affected by the lack of daily
overtime because many work in hourly positions such as clerical,
service and sales jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Knox bill, at least in concept, is expected to be received
favorably by Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat who pledged during his
campaign to return to the eight-hour work day.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, as currently written, addresses some of businesses'
flexibility concerns by including a clause that lets workers take
up to four hours off a week and make up those hours during the
week, provided they have their employer's consent. In addition,
Knox's bill would give workers the right to vote on exceptions,
such as alternate shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses in particular balk at the proposed changes to
the overtime law since a higher percentage of them are nonunion
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hauge, head of the Small Business Network in San
Francisco, described the process of voting on exceptions as
cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at his company, Cal Insurance &AMP; Associates, get every
other Friday off by working shifts longer than eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you vote on every issue? How do you vote on child care?
How do you vote on parent-teacher conferences? There are so many
things that can come up,'' Hauge said.
</P>
<P>
   When California changed its overtime laws, it joined the federal
government and 47 other states _ all of which count overtime as
work beyond 40 hours per week, rather than eight hours per day.

   COAL (Parkville, Mo.) _ Twenty-six cars of a Burlington Northern
train headed from Lincoln, Neb., to Kansas City, Kan., derails in
downtown Parkville shortly before midnight, dumping 135,000 tons of
coal, wiping out two buildings, cutting power, gas and water lines
and forcing Park College to close. Five residences also were
evacuated. But no one was hurt. A miracle?? The cause is believed
to be a wheel bearing that caused an axle to drag and catch on the
train switch. Photos, graphic depicting the derailment sequence and
detail of wheel showing how accident happened. with SAFE: Who's
responsible for freight train safety? And what would have happened
if the train was carrying nuclear waste or chlorine gas? (Both will

`HANDS-ON' DRIVING OUGHT TO MEAN WHEEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've heard a lot about aggressive driving, speeding, tailgating
and myriad other motoring transgressions that can lead to car
wrecks, traffic tickets and even to that most dreaded of
contemporary highway hazards: road rage.
</P>
<P>
   But all that pales in comparison to a modern menace that may
pose the greatest threat to driving safety since the advent of
drive-through liquor stores: the cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Exaggeration, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. At least one reputable study has suggested that
talking on the phone while driving can be as potentially dangerous
as driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe it, start paying attention to those nitwits
who swerve in front of you in traffic, who meander mindlessly from
lane to lane, who suddenly speed up or slow down for no apparent
reason. Note how often that a driver who does such things is
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've noticed already. If you haven't noticed, maybe it's
because you're one of the people who insists on driving and talking
on the phone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you are driving and talking it's because you are
capable of doing both without being distracted. You wouldn't make a
nuisance of yourself on the highways and byways.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers can drive and talk, and some can't. Like the one
who was quoted in a Fort Worth Star-Telegram story on the subject:
``Most people know if they can do two things at once. I know I
personally can drive with one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing to it. You just gotta know your capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   There must be untold numbers of people who can drive and (choose
one): eat breakfast, shave, apply mascara, read the newspaper, feed
the baby, play with the dog, program the buttons on the car radio,
count the loose change in the ashtray, search for a pack of
cigarettes in the glove compartment, take a nap ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe just a catnap.
</P>
<P>
   We know that people can do this stuff because they are out there
doing it, morning, noon and night, on every street and highway and
freeway in America.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have any number of laws that make it illegal to
drive like an idiot, so you'd think that drivers who don't pay
attention to their prime responsibility _ which happens to be
driving the car, in case anyone forgot _ would be racking up
traffic tickets as fast as the cops could write them. As we know,
however, the police almost never pull someone over for erratic
driving caused by eating a Big Mac with one hand and finishing up a
tax return with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is, an all-out crackdown on disengaged drivers
would leave law enforcement officials little time to pursue serious
lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't stopping state and local lawmakers around the
country from stepping up to the plate to take on the growing peril
of car phones.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Texas, where not so long ago a person could drive and
guzzle a six-pack of beer without fear of arrest, the Legislature
is pondering a bill that would outlaw the practice of driving and
talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Telegram quoted the bill's sponsor, Democratic Rep.
Paul Moreno of El Paso: ``I think that if we make it specific that
perhaps we can save a life. It's a dangerous thing _ we all know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno's bill would prohibit motorists from using hand-held
phones while driving _ which wouldn't necessarily solve the
problem, because the same study that equated the use of car phones
with drunken driving suggested that using a hands-free phone is
just as dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the problem is one of concentration. Maybe some
people can drive with one hand and hold a telephone with the other,
but they still have only one brain to think with.
</P>
<P>
   Is it the state Legislature's job to force people to use their
brains for driving instead of talking?
</P>
<P>
   An Arlington cop told the Star-Telegram that it would be better
if drivers policed themselves in their use of car phones. He's
absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   And the odds of that happening are about the same as those of
winning tonight's Lotto drawing.
</P>

NUCLEAR WEAPONS LABS WILL UNDERGO SECURITY UPGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Federal authorities have announced that they are
tightening security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory after
reports of spying at its sister nuclear weapons lab in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials said they also are trying to prevent tightened
security from impeding research by burdening staffers, including
foreign visitors _ a seemingly contradictory goal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizens will receive uniform treatment regardless of their
national origin, the officials said at a news conference Tuesday at
the lab, to assuage any concerns that any Americans' security
clearances might be dependent on their ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns arose because an American citizen of Chinese
ancestry has been accused of spying for China at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico. Both nuclear weapons labs are
run by the University of California under contract to the U.S.
Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, non-Americans from politically ``sensitive'' countries
might be subject to more intensive scrutiny if they seek to work at
Livermore, located in the East San Francisco Bay area, at Los
Alamos or the other main nuclear weapons facility, Sandia National
Laboratories in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Energy Department officials stressed the
importance of tightened security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real issue,'' said Ernie Moniz, undersecretary for
the Energy Department. Even if the fuss over the alleged Los Alamos
spy hadn't erupted, the security upgrade would have been needed
sooner or later because ``the threat environment of today is very
different from the environment of 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Moniz explained, the Cold War of 10 years ago _
when the United States faced off with the Soviet Union _ has been
replaced by threats such as terrorist groups and Internet hackers.
</P>
<P>
   About a week ago, Livermore officials shut down all
security-related computers to update them with new protective
``firewalls'' to make them less vulnerable to espionage and
hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system remains down pending further modification,
Moniz said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, Energy Department secretary Bill
Richardson announced new initiatives to guard the weapons labs
against espionage.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would:
</P>
<P>
   _Ask Congress to boost the department's counterintelligence
budget next year by $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   _Impose ``stricter document controls'' for all secret and top
secret documents concerning weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   _Review the security of the department's program that brings
foreign scientists to work in U.S. labs. The review will be led by
former CIA chief John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Newsweek magazine reported this week that CIA
technicians found 31 secret files in Deutch's home computer soon
after he left the CIA post in December 1996.

NEWSPAPERS SEE LITTLE PROGRESS IN MINORITY HIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new survey of daily newspapers found the
proportion of minority and women journalists falls well short of
their representation in the population, causing concern among
industry executives who have struggled for years to diversify
newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of journalists who are Asian, black, Hispanic and
Native American was 11.55 in 1998, up from 11.46 percent the
previous year, according to a survey released Tuesday by the
American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE).
</P>
<P>
   It also found that women accounted for 36.88 percent of newsroom
staff and 34 percent of newsroom supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sell newspapers to people if you don't reflect their
communities,'' said N. Christian Anderson, publisher of the Orange
County (Calif.) Register and incoming ASNE president. ``It's a
simple business equation as well as the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the sluggishness in diversifying newsrooms are
varied, news executives said. Many journalism students are more
drawn to television than newspapers and magazines; some leave the
industry because of lack of advancement opportunities; others avoid
journalism altogether, opting for careers in more-lucrative fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rekindle enthusiasm for print journalism,'' said Ed
Seaton, president of the ASNE and editor-in-chief of the Manhattan
(Kan.) Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   A Newspaper Association of America (NAA) study indicated that
ignoring minority markets opens the door to competitive media, even
though researchers heard ``advertising directors saying advertisers
don't want `those people,''' said Chris Manai of the NAA.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE newsroom census, which has been conducted annually
since 1978, surveyed 958 of the country's 1,456 daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the survey included a count of women.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of minority reporters, photographers and editors
has remained around 11 percent for several years, while the
minority population in the United States is now 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the disparities continue, newspapers will pay the price,''
said Pam Johnson, executive editor of the Arizona Republic and
president of Associated Press Managing Editors. ``If we have
coverage that is not relevant to large parts of our community, we
will continue to see the erosion (of readership) we have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaton noted a couple bright spots. He said minority journalists
make up 25 percent of all new hires and one-third of interns.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the biggest problems is retaining minority
journalists, Seaton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have as many going out as coming in,'' he said. ``We're
sort of on a treadmill here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Oppel, ASNE board member and editor of the Austin (Texas)
American-Statesman, said his newspaper tries to retain minorities
through promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that kind of mix, there's a greater comfort
level for minorities to come and stay and see they're rewarded for
good work,'' he said. ``What I've seen at some very good papers is
the top (levels of management) is not changing. Sooner or later,
frustration sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 91 percent of newsroom supervisors were
white.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Montiel, president of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for
Journalism Education in Oakland, Calif., said what is needed is a
cultural change at newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that until 30 years ago was nearly all
white and within this century was nearly all male,'' he said. ``We
really need revolutionary change. What we're getting is incremental
change that is glacial.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Maynard, the late publisher of the Oakland Tribune and
founder of the Maynard Institute, Montiel and a group of other
journalists helped push ASNE in 1977 to set a goal of racial parity
in hiring by 2000. Controversy erupted last year when the ASNE
board decided that goal was unattainable and proposed scaling it
back.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it decided to aim for achieving parity by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE is holding its annual convention in San Francisco this
week.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ They call themselves the first Christians _
heirs to an ancient covenant, builders of the world's earliest
churches.
</P>
<P>
   But here the congregation of St. Michael's Ethiopian Orthodox
Church carries out ancient traditions in a way their ancestors
could never have foreseen.
</P>
<P>
   They still remove their shoes, as Moses did when the angel
appeared to him in the burning bush. They guard against temptation,
with gauzy veils and separate pews for women. But under the gothic
arches of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, thousands of miles from
home, these Ethiopians are only visitors in another's temple.
</P>
<P>
   Since they spoke their first prayer in a Boston Lutheran church
10 years ago, the 200 members of St. Michael's have dreamed of
their own house of worship. Last year, after a decade of prayer at
a half-dozen altars, they resolved to buy or build their own.
Though church members have raised $100,000 so far, leaders say
soaring real estate prices have stalled the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But as St. Michael's celebrated its high holiday, Orthodox
Easter this month, the search for a building revealed a deeper
struggle, one that strikes at the heart of fledgling immigrant
groups: how to preserve ties to a distant past, while letting go of
the divisions and old arguments carried over from the homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant refugees who never thought they would leave their
homeland, many Ethiopians say their American community is at a
crossroads. As it tilts further from the conflicts engulfing
Ethiopia and toward a long-term future in the United States, the
need for foundations here has become more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the foundations have been established: newsletters,
restaurants, Sunday school classes, an economic niche in the
parking garage industry, a partnership that aids families in
mourning _ all signs of growing cohesion. But a home for their
ancient faith is a critical missing element.
</P>
<P>
   As a community of some 10,000 Boston-area immigrants pools
scarce resources and searches for unity, it remains divided by old
alliances and new mistrust. The conflicts erupted in two lawsuits.
The first, in 1992, splintered the congregation of St. Michael's.
The second, filed in 1997 and still unresolved, has locked two
groups in a struggle for control of a community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the pangs of a community trying to find itself and
its leaders,'' said Antene Tamiru, a parking lot manager who lives
in Boston. ``It is a problem for all countries that don't have a
history of democracy. We don't always know how to understand our
differences and live with them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the conflicts simmer, the passing on of a national culture
and an unbroken Christian legacy hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an Ethiopian Christian is not just an ethnicity. It's a
covenant with God,'' said Getachew Selassie, a member of St.
Michael's who left Ethiopia in 1970. ``Our forefathers handed down
to us a tradition that was uninterrupted for centuries. And we are
throwing it down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Huge, hollow abdomens and bony limbs: To most Americans, the
dominant image of Ethiopia remains one of famine, which swept the
East African country in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   That was the country Genet Bekele fled in 1982, when she walked
for seven days to reach Sudan. But the Ethiopia she recalls is one
of proud legacies, not human tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   From the International Institute in Boston, where she counsels
refugees, Bekele, 39, invokes a history of scholars and diplomats;
a people who guarded their nation against Islam and the waves of
European colonization that swept the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Ethiopia I knew, moving from one city to another was a
big deal, not to mention mass exodus,'' said Bekele, who left 17
years ago but can barely bring herself to speak about her flight.
``We had no history of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in 1974, a 20-year chapter of Marxist rule scarred
that history, toppling the country's Emporer Haile Selassie. Under
a regime many call ``The Red Terror,'' thousands were persecuted,
imprisoned, or killed, letting loose a tide of 2.5 million refugees
who fanned out from Africa, through Europe, and into the United
States. Chronic instability and civil war triggered smaller waves
of refugees in the '80s and '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The largest numbers of Ethiopians settled in Washington, D.C.,
Los Angeles, and Atlanta. But a small group trickled into Boston,
drawn by its colleges or by family members. Some were students who
had come before 1974. As revolution gripped the country, they
sought political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Tamiru, who manages the Pilgrim Parking garage in Boston, was
attending Boston College at the time. The son of a developer, the
17-year-old who had planned to continue the family business
suddenly found he had no tuition money, no work experience, and no
connection to his new home. He worked as a day laborer for weeks
before finding a job in a restaurant. And he waited patiently, as
many did, for the communists to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea of being a refugee, we just didn't know what hit
us,'' said Tamiru, now 45. ``We all assumed we would study and go
back. It took us years just to accept that we were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, they planted roots, spreading out from Boston to
surrounding surburbs. Most who stayed without proper immigration
papers were granted amnesty in 1986. In the past five years,
newcomers have come through a federal lottery program that grants
thousands of visas to different countries each year.
</P>
<P>
   But as they climbed to higher positions and professions, most
Ethiopians told themselves their stay was temporary, and lived on
the wish that return was imminent.

   PHOENIX - How many parents have hunkered down with their
children in an attempt to do something constructive _ feed them,
read them a story, frantically try to persuade them to stop
screaming until they throw up _ and failed in the effort?
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, how many haven't? Any?
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just coincidence. The little devils seem to have
their own agendas. You can tell by the looks on their faces that
they're up to something.
</P>
<P>
   If only we could tell what they were thinking. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Parent, smiling maniacally: OK! It's time for lunch! Let's just
put this bib on so we don't get too messy.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Oh great. Just choke me, why don't you? And what's this?
``Daddy's little girl'' _ gee, that's original. And you wonder why
I spit up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Let's see, what looks good today? Creamed spinach?
Creamed corn? Beef and vegetable medley?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Anything but prunes. Explosive results. You don't want to
have to do laundry again.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Let's go with these leftover creamed beets. . . . Wait a
second, sweetheart. Sit up straight in the high chair. Where do you
think you're going?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Are you kidding? Have you ever eaten creamed beets? They
tasted like dirty bath water when they were fresh. Leftovers? I'm
outta here.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: All right, that's a good girl. You're strapped in now.
Isn't that better?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Belt . . . too . . . tight. Stomach . .. squished. Feeling
. . . faint.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: You're certainly holding still now. OK, let's try a
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Well, maybe just one.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Good girl! Hmm. Now that's a funny face.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Arggh! This is worse than the dog treat I found under the
couch!
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Let's try another one. Aw, now come on, honey. This is
good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: That's what you said about immunizations, pal. I may have
been born at night, but it wasn't last night.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Choo-choo-choo. Here comes the train. Open up the
tunnel. Whoo-hoo!
</P>
<P>
   Baby: How embarrassing for you.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Come on, baby. Just a bite. Look, it's an airplane!
Bzzzzzzzzz.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Ha. I wish we had this on film.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Shoot. Come on, baby, just try a little bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Poor guy. He's working so hard. But I'd rather grow
another tooth than eat this rot. Wait, I have an idea. That's
right, bring that spoon a little closer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Good girl! Now open . . . Hey! Let go of the spoon!
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Ha, ha. This always gets them.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Keep your hands out of it. It's sticky!
</P>
<P>
   Baby: And now, for the grand finale.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: No! Keep it out of your hair!
</P>
<P>
   Baby: You'd think they would learn faster.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: OK, if that's how you're going to behave, it's not going
to be fun anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: I love a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: If I'm going to have to pry your mouth open, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: What? What's he doing?
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Let's just get a little of this in there, and . . .
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Ugggle. Some of it got in my mouth! I hate to do this, but
desperate times call for desperate measures.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: OW!! Don't bite me! Man, those teeth are sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: All right, fun's over. I'll just use the spoon to pry
your mouth open. Bite away!
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Ack. This isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: There you go. Now it's going down.
</P>
<P>
   Baby: No! (shudder) Yuck! Think!
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Isn't this yummy?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: I've got it!
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Good gi. . . what are you doing?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: This never fails.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Eww. What's that smell?
</P>
<P>
   Baby: Heh-heh.
</P>
<P>
   Parent: Aw, baby. Now I've got to change your diaper. Sigh. OK,
let's go.

AN OUTSIZED LIFE AMONG THE ELEPHANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tallulah walked the well-used paths, trying to track her family
down, snaking her trunk along the ground to sniff as she went.
Occasionally, she would call out and then pause to listen. At the
first response, she dashed through tall grass and was soon in the
thick of her family group. They entwined trunks, trumpeted, and
rumbled in greeting. Tallulah let out ``a resounding rumble of
reunion.''
</P>
<P>
   From her base camp in Kenya's famed Amboseli National Park,
Cynthia Moss has been describing scenes like this for more than a
quarter century. Here, in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, she has
set about recording the daily lives of about 1,600 wild African
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, Moss has perched in a vehicle _ first a Renault,
later a Land Rover _ hour after hour, quietly observing the complex
lives of elephants unfold in what she likens to a tautly plotted
page turner.
</P>
<P>
   She has observed birth and death, power struggles, social
relationships, kidnapping, sex, tragedy, and joy (``It may not be
similar to human joy or even comparable, but it is elephantine joy
and it plays a very important part in their whole social system'').
She has outlined family structure, attachments, gender differences,
and behavioral complexity. Through books such as ``Elephant
Memories'' and ``Echo of the Elephants,'' she has taught readers
about ``greeting ceremonies,'' ``mating pandemonium,'' ``sneaky
copulators,'' and the loose-limbed, carefree movement called
``floppy running.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the breadth of her scientific inquiry, Moss, 58, does
not possess a piece of parchment declaring her a scientist.
According to the book ``Elephant Woman,'' by Laurence Pringle, her
lack of scientific degrees renders her ineligible for some grants,
though much of her work is funded by the African Wildlife
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Ossining, N.Y., Moss was always surrounded by cats
and dogs and horses. Yet, after graduating from Smith College, she
started her professional life as a journalist for Newsweek magazine
in Manhattan. Within a few years, however, she reports, her
feelings for nature were reawakened, and a trip to Africa forever
changed her life. There, among elephants, lions, zebra, and
giraffe, she had an overwhelming sense that she was home.
</P>
<P>
   Degree or no degree, Moss has harnessed her unwavering
fascination to produce the longest, most detailed study of wild
elephants ever _ a feat that she downplays. ``I've only watched
those elephants for 27 years _ half a lifetime of one of these
animals,'' she says by phone from New York during a US lecture
tour. ``I'm really just beginning to scratch the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's a pretty ample surface. Research from her camp has
yielded a number of discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   With other colleagues, Moss has begun to crack the code of
elephant communication.
</P>
<P>
   Elephants have a vast repertoire of vocalizations, some too low
for the human ear to detect. Using sensitive recording equipment,
Moss and Katy Payne, an acoustic biologist, have begun to eavesdrop
on these ``rumble'' communiques. In the wild, elephants amble over
vast ranges but stay in touch with infrasound, which can roll
around trees and rocks and travel as far as 6 miles. This explains
the coordinated movements of elephants, which had puzzled
researchers for years.
</P>
<P>
   Another great mystery was something called ``musth.'' So little
was known of this strange and powerful hormonal cycle, scientists
weren't even sure African bull elephants experienced it. The
Amboseli camp not only proved that they do, but its observations
are also providing intriguing details. When these bulls get tanked
up on testosterone, Moss has observed, they are feared by other
males yet welcomed by receptive females and their cheerleading
families.
</P>
<P>
   When in musth, these big bulls, who can weigh in at 12,000
pounds, carry themselves differently. Their silhouettes change.
They leak fluids from temporal glands, and they dribble urine
constantly. They reek of virility. ``When he arrived upwind of us,
his smell almost knocked us sideways. It was a pungent, sharp,
somewhat musky scent which I had grown rather partial to,'' Moss
wrote of one in ``Echo of the Elephants.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss's long-term study has injected color and texture into a
previously sketchy portrait of the world's largest land animals. In
addition, her books and contribution to TV films, such as PBS's
``Echo of the Elephants,'' provide an intimate glimpse of the lives
of elephants. We now know how they live on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
   And so much of that life depends on the wise old matriarch _ the
eldest females of a species that can live to 70. All the elephants
in her group depend on her to negotiate two kinds of terrain: the
land, with its ever-shifting resources; and a complicated social
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Basic social units _ families _ consist of adult females and
their offspring of both genders. And those families are small parts
of a larger mosaic of clans and other communities. Males go off
sometime after the age of 10, spending time alone or joining loose
(and we mean this in all senses) bachelor groups.
</P>
<P>
   Moss's study site in Amboseli has allowed her to observe
elephants whose lives are more secure and stable than those of many
other populations. Tourists, scientists, and the Masai, who seldom
hunt wildlife, have warded off the heavy poaching other areas
experienced _ between 1973 and 1989, 85 percent of Kenya's
elephants were slaughtered for their ivory.
</P>
<P>
   A year-round water supply _ provided by the runoff from the
snows of Kilimanjaro _ enlivens the dusty alkali park with veins of
greenery and salad bowl swamps, keeping the elephants close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this fantastic body of knowledge that I'm most proud
of,'' Moss says, as she credits colleagues and field assistants.
``Elephants have the most extensive network of relationships of any
land mammal, and maybe any mammal, but we just don't know enough
about the whales and dolphins yet to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss could return to school for that piece of paper that
declares her a scientist. Although Cambridge University has invited
her to do just that, she has never wanted to take time out from
watching elephants. And while she has spent so much of her life
studying these family-oriented animals, she has never found time to
start her own family.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Moss has felt compelled to leave camp to bring a
message of elephant conservation to the world. She is attempting to
establish an endowment to secure the future for the Amboseli
elephants.
</P>
<P>
   In this time of shrinking habitats, is she optimistic? ``I am
hopeful for certain populations, especially those in areas not
suitable for humans. I'm hopeful that they can survive well into
the 22d century.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss is also battling to save the elephant's ancient way of
life. In Amboseli today, elephants are still able to follow
migration routes that their ancestors did 500 years ago. Here they
can be at their complex best. And that's what intrigues this
graduate of the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elephants are always mysterious,'' Moss says. ``They are
always revealing new things. And they will always puzzle me.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American industry is awash in computer data.
</P>
<P>
   From the burgeoning electronic commerce industry to today's
complex software to the millions of e-mail messages exchanged
daily, corporations say the volume of data is growing 50 to 100
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are bursting at the seams with trillions of bits of
critical data that must be stored _ some in duplicate and
triplicate _ and managed, in branch offices, data centers, and
corporate headquarters around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle to keep track of the seemingly endless flow of
data has created a booming business for EMC Corp. of Hopkinton,
Mass., the nation's largest independent disk storage company, as
well as for other leading hardware suppliers such as IBM Corp., the
Clariion division of Data General Corp. in Southborough, Mass.,
Seagate Technology, and Storage Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has spawned a new generation of software and services
companies providing ways for corporations to monitor and manage
their data, back up and protect it, find and fix disk-storage
bottlenecks, and warn desktop computer users to clean out their
hard drives before they run out of space.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is home to a number of these new storage
start-ups, some launched by former employees of EMC and Data
General and some with initial investments coming from former EMC
top management.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the attraction is the huge market potential. For
every dollar a company spends storing one megabyte of data on a
computer hard drive, it spends more than $4 on software, services,
and personnel to manage the information.
</P>
<P>
   According to research firm Dataquest, storage resource
management _ the monitoring and tracking of the physical location
of a company's data _ is expected to be a $1.2 billion market by
2002, up from just $210 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette Corp., for example, spends nearly one-third of its
computer systems hardware budget on new disk storage systems,
according to Patrick Zilvitis, chief information officer of the
Boston-based consumer products company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest growth in information comes from our transactions
systems where, for example, our Mach3 product is tracked from
manufacturing to customer order and collection of cash and
everything in between,'' said Zilvitis. ``All the pieces are bits
of data that have to be turned into information and then into
knowledge to run the business better. Data is a company's jewels.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the telephone industry, Peter Bell is
offering corporate America an alternative to the hefty purchases of
data storage and related services. He wants to rent or lease data
storage services to corporations for a monthly fee by creating a
nationwide network of regional storage farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as businesses don't own the telephone switches or the
electric power generators to keep the lights on because it is
easier and cheaper to buy these services from utility suppliers,
why not do the same for data storage?'' said Bell, president of
StorageNetworks Inc. of Wellesley Hills.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks, which expects to raise $50 million in venture
capital this fall, is perhaps the most ambitious of the growing
group of small companies addressing data-storage issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and chief technology officer William Miller cofounded
StorageNetworks last summer with $10 million: $8 million in venture
capital from Greylock Management and Sigma Partners, and $2 million
from Roger Marino, a cofounder of EMC Corp., where Bell spent 10
years in marketing, operations, and sales.
</P>
<P>
   So far StorageNetworks has built its first disk storage farm,
known as a point of presence (POP), in Houston, catering to four
companies in the oil and gas industry. To ensure the data arrives
quickly, StorageNetworks builds a high-speed fiber-optic link _
called a Fibre Channel _ between its POP and each customer's data
center.
</P>
<P>
   By this summer the company plans to open similar data storage
farms in Somerville, to serve the Boston market, and in Weehauken,
N.J. and Brooklyn, N.Y., to handle the New York financial services
market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said StorageNetworks revenues should reach close to $5
million this year, quadrupling to around $20 million in 2000.
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. estimated that storage
outsourcing will become a $500 million-a-year business by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Astrum Software Corp. of Charlestown, Mass. has created a
program it says helps Ford Motor Co. and others monitor the
disk-storage usage at each PC and computer server within a
department. The software keeps track of PC and server storage
systems rapidly filling up with data and sends out messages to
prevent a system crash. It can also automatically purge old data
from networked PCs and servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies with many personal computers know their users have
stored lots of electronic mail messages, Internet downloads, and
other information that is simply old data,'' said Robert Infantino,
who formed the five-person company with $250,000 of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting employees to clean out their computer's hard disks is
a big problem, as some companies don't have formal policies. And
some users don't know how to save data to a floppy disk.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston University, Astrum's software is used in the
biochemistry department to manage storage and monitor potential
e-mail problems, such as a user storing too many messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 150 users who, on occasion, get carried away storing
huge files,'' said Anthony Abruzzese, the department's network
administrator. ``Sometimes I have to say, `Get your files off, or
I'm going to get them off for you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   HighGround Systems of Marlborough, Mass. provides storage
research management software and services at the corporate level,
with customers from the Walt Disney Co. to Kmart Corp. The nearly
four-year-old company has raised more than $20 million and has
licensed part of its technology to Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months disk storage systems will be further
stressed, said HighGround marketing vice president Thomas. H. Rose,
as companies launch year 2000 compliance testing to ensure that all
programs work properly when the clock strikes midnight on Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And while many large corporations routinely back up their data
each night, several new companies such as Connected Corp. of
Framingham, Mass. are developing products that will do it more
efficiently, particularly for people who travel and use laptop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   David Cane launched the company after his wife lost more than 60
pages of her doctoral thesis when her computer's hard drive
malfunctioned. She failed to routinely back up the data on floppy
disks. So Cane created an automated backup service that allows
laptop computer users with a PC modem and a standard telephone
connection to back up their internal hard drive each evening.
Several corporations, including Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose,
Calif., have signed up their traveling employees to use the
service, which costs from $19.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backup process takes less than a couple of minutes, and it
allows the road warrior to also check e-mail,'' said Glenn Gaudet,
Connected's director of product marketing.
</P>
<P>
   On a much larger scale, Network Integrity Inc. of Marlborough is
offering software that enables companies to more easily back up
their software during the day rather than at night. The software,
after initially copying an entire data base, records only the
changes made during the day. This approach, the company says,
reduces labor and equipment costs.
</P>
<P>
   As promising as the storage management and backup business is,
some older storage companies have run into problems after soaring
to an early success. Storage Computer Corp. of Nashua, N.H., which
enjoyed spectacular growth from 1993 to 1997, is now trying to
rebuld after some of its disk subsystems and software ran into
major quality control problems in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year sales dropped to $17 million _ less than half the $37
million it reported in 1997 _ as the company lost $10.9 million, or
97 cents a share. In 1997, Storage Computer earned nearly $3.6
million, or 33 cents a share. And the company's stock, which had
traded at nearly 20 a share two years ago, now trades at under 2 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disks we bought from a company failed and some customers
lost their data,'' said Ted Goodlander, president of Storage
Computer, stressing the company has switched suppliers and should
become profitable again this quarter. ``The market is still very
strong and I believe we will recover.''

SHOOTOUT SHOULD BE SHOT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shootout to decide drawn matches was initiated in the North
American Soccer League in 1977. Similar to hockey's penalty shot,
the shootout was among the gimmicks, such as a 35-yard offside line
and pyrotechnic goal celebrations, designed to glamorize soccer.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA did not approve of the shootout, in which the attacker has
five seconds to shoot from 35 yards and the goalkeeper can move off
his line, and no top level league seriously considered adopting it
until Major League Soccer revived it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, FIFA made two subtle changes. The value of a victory
was increased to 3 points and goalkeepers were prevented from
handling backpasses. The adjustments were made late in the day, but
now soccer has regained its fashionable world image and games have
become fast-paced spectacles. Even in Italy, Serie A games are wide
open, caution thrown to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the shootout, then, is its superfluousness. As
a gimmick to attract attention, it has been made obsolete by the
awarding of 3 points for victories. And this is the main objection
to the shootout during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Since no other country uses the shootout, it is considered a
novelty. But the shootout is losing its charm because of
overexposure. MLS officials should seriously consider either
abolishing the shootout or relegating it to a lower division. Or,
they could limit its use to the playoffs, when the stakes are
greater and a winner is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Wynalda was injured in a shootout last season and never
fully recovered for the World Cup. Cobi Jones had a close call for
Los Angeles last week. Players are soon going to realize the
shootout is not worth risking injury for a single point. And MLS
should not place its assets at risk for the sake of novelty,
especially when the pace of the game is accelerating at a rate that
should satisfy even the most obtuse observers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ajax down the drain?
</P>
<P>
   Ajax's disappointing results continued with a 4-1 loss to
Cambuur Leeuwaarden, a team that includes US national team defender
Gregg Berhalter. Ajax, which has won four of the last five
Eredivisie championships, is on the verge of failing to qualify for
European Cup competition and is facing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Several players have accompanied Louis Van Gaal, who coached
Ajax to the 1995 European Champions Cup title, to Barcelona and the
famed development program is not producing as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gaal received derisive whistles during a recent tribute
match to honor past greats such as Johan Cruyff and Marco Van
Basten. Ajax supporters are understandably upset that Van Gaal
continues to take away their players. Barcelona's Ajax colony will
increase to seven when Jari Litmanen joins next year.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Ajax is breaking with the past, partially in
reaction to the Jean-Marc Bosman Ruling, the European Court of
Justice decision that opened the way to free agency. The club built
the Amsterdam Arena to replace the 19,000-seat De Meer Stadium, and
now is branching out by investing in satellite clubs, including one
in Capetown, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The club's plans might be overly ambitious and the directors
could have underestimated supporters' resistance to the
predominantly foreign composition of the team. But Ajax is forging
ahead, and the next step is a tour that will include a July 21
exhibition against the Revolution at Foxboro Stadium. Mixed in
among the Brazilian, Danish, Georgian, Nigerian, Russian, and Dutch
players will be an American _ John O'Brien, a midfielder whose
family roots extend to Boston. O'Brien is currently on loan to
Utrecht but is expected to rejoin Ajax next season.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Barcelona reigning
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid coach John Benjamin Toshack could only feel
``humiliated'' after his team was routed by Celta, 5-1, in Vigo.
Real Madrid fell 10 points behind first-place Barcelona and
relinquished its title hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Celta moved into second place, 7 points behind. The
result indicated the wide-open play of the Spanish Liga. Celta is
the country's westernmost club, named for the Galician region's
Celtic tradition, and ``Gallegos'' are often considered outcasts by
Barcelona and Madrid. But Celta has restored pride to the area with
an effective mixture of players. Mazinho, who played for Brazil in
the 1990 World Cup and struck out in Italy, has been a driving
force in midfield. Russians Valeri Karpin and Alexandre Mostovoi
and the Israeli Haim Revivo were especially effective against Real
Madrid, and Bulgarian Luboslav Penev scored three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Mijatovic returned as a reserve for Real Madrid after a
one-game protest against NATO bombing in Yugoslavia that cost him 5
million pesetas.
</P>
<P>
   Other Serbian players made anti-war statements in Italy's Serie
A. Most players displayed shirts promoting aid to refugees from
Kosovo, but Lazio's Sinisa Mihailjovic's shirt read, ``Peace, no
war.'' Mihailjovic was red-carded late in the game after clashing
with Roma's Brazilian striker, Paulo Sergio, in a 3-1 loss. Lazio
holds a 4-point lead over Milan in Serie A.

</P>
<P>
   Home-grown talent
</P>
<P>
   The American Soccer League, which existed from 1921-31 before
falling victim to internal strife and the Depression, was dominated
by foreign players, but eventually produced top American players
also.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Battles, who developed with the Boston Celtics (a soccer
team long before the basketball team), set a still-standing club
record of 44 goals in a season for Hearts of Midlothian in
Scotland. Billy Gonsalves, who made his reputation with Lusitania
Recreation in East Cambridge, started in the 1930 World Cup at age
21 and refused offers from Brazilian and Italian clubs to stay in
the US. In recently-released ratings by the International Football
Historians and Statisticians, Gonsalves was ranked the sixth-best
player in the history of the CONCACAF region, the only US-born
player in the top 11.
</P>
<P>
   The ASL also had the first African athlete to compete for a New
England pro team, Tewfik Abdallah, an Egyptian who played 80 games
at inside forward for Providence, Fall River, and Hartford.
Abdallah, nicknamed ``Toothpick,'' played for Derby County and
Hartlepool (England), Cowdenbeath (Scotland), and Brigend (Wales).
The next prominent African athlete in the area would be Eusebio,
the Mozambican-Portuguese striker who joined the Boston Minutemen
in 1975.

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Rocha ready to run
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Rocha, who was released after a dispute with Revolution
player-coach Walter Zenga, joined the Boston Bulldogs of the
second-division A League. Rocha will be available for the Bulldogs'
season opener Friday at Jacksonville, Fla.

   TAKE-BOS  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... was imminent.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then came children. Investments. Businesses. Slow success. By
1991, when the Marxist government fell, many found their US ties
outweighed memories of a land now plagued by civil war and a new,
equally volatile ethnic-based government.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, they found themselves ill-equipped for life here.
Fixated on each political ripple back home, they had paid little
attention to community-building. Independent by nature, they had
not plugged into networks with other immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought it would be as it was 20 years ago, but we have
all changed,'' said Binyam Tamene, who runs the Ethiopian Community
Mutual Assistance Association. ``If we are not going back, then who
are we? What kind of community do we want? We are just now
exploring how to know ourselves in this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as he advocates unity from a tiny, gray office in Central
Square, Tamene himself has become one of the community's most
divisive figures. While he says the center and radio program he
runs remain apolitical, others _ including St. Michael's church
leaders _ say Tamene has polarized Ethiopians, hand-picking his own
board and ignoring community input into the center.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a community of exiles thirsty for democracy's freedoms
and deeply suspicious of any who would call themselves leader,
quiet conflicts continue to play out in the mirror image of
Ethiopia's own turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday, in the fall of 1992, the congregation of St.
Michael's nearly came to blows.
</P>
<P>
   Half a world away, Ethiopian rebel forces had come to power,
toppling the Marxist regime and replacing the church's highest
office, its patriarch, with a new, state-appointed figure.
</P>
<P>
   Divided over his legitimacy, a tense, shoving congregation
crowded outside the doors of St. Peter's, each side demanding the
other be thrown out. When the doors opened, they prayed under the
watch of police.
</P>
<P>
   The fight split one flock into two _ St. Michael's and St.
Mary's, which now worships in the South End. It was a painful
reminder that the church, long a refuge from political strife,
could also be engulfed by it. And it underscored a contradiction
facing many immigrants from developing nations: Even as they
embrace democracy, they find themselves reverting to the only
political models they have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the experience of revolution and socialism has
affected many Ethiopians,'' said Ephraim Isaac, who heads the
Institute for Semitic Studies at Princeton University and lived in
Boston for 15 years. ``Those ideas of revolution have sown seeds of
dissension among the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissension sapped energy, members, and resources from a
community already dreaming of its own church. But over time, St.
Michael's grew to one of the largest Orthodox congregations in the
Northeast. In 1997, a visit from a bishop jump-started the search,
drawing $40,000 in pledges.
</P>
<P>
   But money was only the first of many obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   A building in Harvard Square won strong congregation approval,
but its price tag was too high, and leaders dismissed it.
Properties in suburban Boston were considered. But the community
resisted, saying transportation for many would be difficult, if not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For a people raised in a land where the state has always funded
churches, the slow progress has frustrated many.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who say, `You have $100,000. Why don't you
have a church?' '' said Solomon Lemma, a church committee member.
``But they don't know about zoning, about parking. They don't
completely understand what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   As church leaders tried to reassure their members, and the
wounds of a broken church began to close, dissension resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of Ethiopians began to challenge Tamene's authority over
the community center. This time, with state and federal funding for
the nonprofit center at stake, suspicions of abuse grew, and
mounting criticism began to echo Ethiopia's upheavals _ charging
Tamene with abusing his power and stifling opposition. Tamene
maintained he was fulfilling his vow to keep the center apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion came to a head at a community meeting in April,
1997: In a sweeping vote, more than 150 Ethiopians elected a new
board, ousting Tamene and the board. Tamene ruled the elections
illegal, triggering the community's second round of litigation in
five years. After two years, the conflict remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   For Tamene, the charges of exploitation only underscore the
lessons Ethiopians still must learn about their place here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't always have the experience of nonprofit
institutions and how they work,'' he said. ``These are things the
community has to open itself up to and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dispute festers, those on both sides hang their prayers
for resolution and new unity on a church _ legacy of every
Ethiopian, and healer of past divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad what is happening now, but I believe the community,
and the church, will unfold no matter what,'' said Mehretu
HaileGiorgis, church committee chairman. ``The church is the place
where the markers in our lives are performed, from baptism to
remembrances of those who have passed. And in times of crisis, it
is the place where we go to seek salvation.''

KOSOVARS ALSO FINDING ENEMIES AMONG THEIR HOSTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Aziz Sallahu began his refugee odyssey afraid
only of the Serbs, who drove his family out of the Kosovar town of
Suhareka into the hills of northern Albania. Tuesday, he stood
shivering in the rain, fearing a new threat: Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   As explosions rocked the neighboring hills, indicating that Serb
forces had made an incursion across the border, reports flew
through the refugee camp that Albanian gangsters were on the prowl
for unarmed Kosovars, and local police said bandits had hijacked a
refugee vehicle on its way to Tirana the night before. A mob
attacked a US military helicopter delivering humanitarian relief
Tuesday morning, according to officials, looting stacks of tents
and food.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most refugees still gushed with gratitude for the
Albanian government that has received them with open arms and
Sallahu, 18, said he felt ``safer than in Kosovo.'' But he shook
his head in disbelief when he considered that the refugees are
being victimized twice, saying he still felt surrounded by danger.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Foresti, an Albanian who works as a French teacher, said
those fears were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``we are more Serbian than the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Violence has always been a fact of life in northern Albania,
where the central government has virtually no presence and local
arms dealers are unofficially king. In recent days, however,
several outside agencies stepped up security following carjackings
in the border district of Tropolje, including an attack Monday
afternoon when three Albanians brandishing Kalashnikov rifles
overtook an Land Rover operation by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe and ordered the passengers out.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian agencies have begun warning refugees about the
dangers of traveling the winding northern roads, particularly at
night. Jeff Rowland, a spokesman for the United Nations World Food
Programme, said it was only a ``matter of time'' before incidents
such as the hijacking Monday night occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody should know that road isn't safe,'' he said.
``Bandits travel that road all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen O'Sullivan, director of the OSCE office in Kukes, said
groups of armed robbers began staking out the border crossings
immediately after the refugee influx began, ``eyeing attractive
vehicles, eyeing girls for export.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency had even received reports of a kidnapped
baby, although it couold not be independently verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had reports of stolen vehicles, racketeering, and
tractors being stolen that (refugees) had to buy back,'' he said.
``Everything depends on the flow of refugees. Obviously, if there
is more traffic on the road, there is more opportunity for the
gangsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of local residents stealing food intended for refugees
have caused some alarm as well. The problem in part has been the
result of chaotic distribution, particularly by local Albanian
governments, which only sporadically monitor the who is the aid
intended for refugees. Tuesday, a local aid truck tosssed piles of
clothing and food out the back as it sped along an open field to
the refugees, as locals ran behind picking up what they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no control whatsoever of who gets what,'' said
Catherine Bertini, executive director of the UN World Food
Programme after watching socks and sweathers fly through the air.
``What's happening with the distribution on the part of the local
prefect is disturbing. It's not a good way to be sure that relief
gets distributed to the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   When two helicopters carrying an American aid shipment landed
Monday night, there were no distribution trucks to meet them.
Dozens of local residents sneaked into the camp where the shipment
had been unloaded and stole perhaps half of the 40-ton delivery of
nutritional formula, sleeping bags and tents, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although refugees were among the looters as well, villagers were
seen carrying cartons of supplies into town here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And yet to some of the refugees, at least, the concerns in
Albania seem overshadowed by their fear of the Serbian troops
aseembled along the border, particularly as shelling continued and
reports reached here Tuesday afternoon that Serb troops had overrun
the Albanian border town of Kamenica. The United Nations has rated
the area as ``security level number 3'' on a scale of one to five.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said, ``The refugees need to be aware of how close the
threat is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a trailer with a family of 20 inside, I would take
that threat 18 kilometers away very seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Serb incursion into Kamenica ended quickly, OSCE
monitors said, several refugees who were planning to go to Tirana
Tuesday night said they would rather risk the bandits than the Serb
forces they had fled.
</P>
<P>
   Sallahu said he was ``not really afraid. ... I would still
rather be there than there.''

<P>
   It appears that Godolphin, the international stable owned by
Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum of Dubai, will send a powerful two-horse
entry of Aljabr and Worldly Manner to Churchill Downs in the
outfit's first attempt to capture the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Aljabr, a son of Storm Cat, assured himself a trip when he won
the second trial race that Godolphin held among its own horses last
Thursday at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. Worldly Manner, a son of
Riverman, won the first trial March 21 with Aljabr second, and did
so well that Godolphin did not find it necessary to race him in the
second trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Aljabr took the trial by a neck over Mitchigan,
with five second-stringers trailing far behind. Aljabr, who was
ridden by Frankie Dettori, was timed in 1:48 1/5 over the distance,
which was just short of a mile and one-eighth. A winner of three
races in Europe as a 2-year-old, Aljabr is obviously talented.
Mitchigan, who was bred in Ireland, had won both of his races in
Europe and was considered s worthy opponent for Aljabr, although
Mitchigan is not nominated to the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very pleased with Aljabr and the way he went about his
business,'' said Simon Crisford, Godolphin racing manager. ``He
will have benefited a lot from this second trial as he needed more
experience racing on sand. We were very happy with the way he
finished, and the next steppingstone will be the Kentucky Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldly Manner, ridden by Jerry Bailey (in Dubai for the World
Cup), defeated Aljabr by a length in the first trial at the same
distance. Worldly Manner, who won the Del Mar Futurity when trained
by Bob Baffert, was purchased by the Sheikh for $5 million from
John and Betty Mabee. ``Worldly Manner doesn't need another race,''
said Crisford. ``He's on the top of his game at the moment and in
tremendous condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin also spent $3 million to purchase Comeonmom after he
won the Remsen at Aqueduct last year. But the son of Jolie's Halo
never caught up to his fellow 3-year-olds. ``We were a little bit
diappointed with him,'' said Crisford. ``He's not working as well
as we hoped he would. We've decided not to push him; so,
effectively, we're ruling him out of the Triple Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   The 125th Kentucky Derby will be run May 1. Godolphin plans to
fly a dozen horses, the other 10 to run in various races at
Churchill Downs, from Dubai to the United States in a private
charter, with a stopover in Shannon, Ireland, next Monday. The
horses will spend 48 hours in quarantine at Keeneland and then be
vanned to Churchill.

   Valenzuela cleared
</P>
<P>
   An armed robbery charge against Pat Valenzuela, who rode Sunday
Silence to victory in the 1989 Kentucky Derby, was dismissed in Los
Angeles County Superior Court last Friday. Valenzuela had been
charged with robbing a cab driver of $150 at gunpoint near Santa
Anita in February. ``There was no evidence,'' said attorney Donald
Calabria, who represented Valenzuela. ``Pat could not be identified
in court as the one involved. Pat has had trouble in the past, but
this wasn't part of that pattern. It was an out-and-out case of
mistaken identity.'' Valenzuela, 36, has been troubled by substance
abuse and has not ridden since 1997. He hopes to mount a comeback
but must complete rehabilitation for a knee injury before he
attempts to ride again . . . Julie Krone, 35, the winningest female
jockey with 3,541 victories, announced her retirement last
Thursday. She will ride Desert Demon Sunday in the Lone Star Derby
and will continue on only if Desert Demon goes to the Kentucky
Derby. Krone, who was hospitalized several times after taking
spills on the track, recently came back from a knee fracture to
enjoy a fine meeting at Fair Grounds, winning 76 races to finish
third. ``I'd rather go out on top both emotionally and
physically,'' she said. ``I enjoy riding full time, but it has
become a little too much for my ankles and knees. There is no
chance of me riding again after the 18th (other than the Derby).''
Krone, who hopes to work as a television commentator, is the only
woman to have won a Triple Crown race, tallying with Colonial
Affair in the 1993 Belmont Stakes, and she rode five winners on one
card at Saratoga Aug. 23 of the same year, when she was at the top
of her game . . . Suffolk Downs will give away a $1,000 wager on
the $25,000 Helena Stakes, the feature race of the Patriots Day
card. The bet will be awarded by random drawing and you must be
present to win.

   Polishing up `Silver'
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is hard at work trying to return 1997 Derby winner
Silver Charm to peak form. After the big gray bled and finished up
the track in the Dubai World Cup, Baffert went back to the drawing
board and put blinkers on Silver Charm for a workout at Santa Anita
last Friday. Silver Charm, a 5-year-old, has not worn blinkers
since finishing second in his first race in August 1996. Blinkers
help a horse keep his mind on business, and that's what Silver
Charm, who has lost his last three starts, might need to do to
improve . . . Straight Man, a promising 3-year-old for Baffert, ran
poorly in the Gallery Furniture.com Stakes at Turfway. But he'll
get another chance in the Lexington at Keeneland Sunday after
working five furlongs in 1:00 at Churchill Wednesday. He'll be
joined by Doneraile Court, a $1 million yearling trained by Nick
Zito, who worked five panels in 1:02 at Keeneland last week . . .
Reraise, last year's Eclipse Award winning sprinter, made a
triumphant return with an easy score in the Count Fleet Sprint at
Oaklawn Thursday. Reraise, who had not raced since winning the $1
million Breeders' Cup Sprint at Churchill in November, zipped six
furlongs in 1:08 2/5 under Corey Nakatani, winning by nearly three
lengths. ``We came here because that timing and the money was
right, and he's a good shipper,'' said trainer Craig Dollase, who
is based in California.

SUNNY ADVICE FOR SENIORS, OR JUST MOONSHINE?

</P>
<P>
   ``The Cremation of Sam McGhee'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just one week ago I wrote: ``Some Harvard quack is pushing a
book called `Living to 100,' which I plan to ridicule under
separate cover.'' Quicker than you can say anti-aging miracle
compound dehydroepiandrosterone, I received a letter from Margaret
Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careful who you call `quack'!'' Mrs. Simmons warned me. A
longtime friend of the quack's coauthor, Margery Silver, Simmons
wrote: ``Read the book and then swallow your smart-mouth remark!''
</P>
<P>
   Hot on the heels of Simmons's snail-mailed remark came this
e-missive from Dr. Thomas Perls: ``Dear Alex, I guess I am the
quack you referred to today. Please let me set you straight. . .
.'' Perls is indeed the principal author of ``Living to 100,'' and
a professor at the Harvard Medical School. To paraphrase, Perls
said I unfairly conflated his views with the ``seductive claims and
promises of hucksters seeking to capitalize on the age explosion.''
(The quote is from his book.) ``I have actually taken a very strong
stand in being a voice of moderation in this world of anti-aging
fads and promises of getting people to 200 or to 100 for that
matter,'' he wrote me.
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I am pro-aging not anti-aging. I believe the
trick is not staying young, but rather, aging well. Please don't
trash me and my book. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   After promising to buy Perls's book, I fired back this salvo:
``You seem to indulge a rather epigrammatic approach to a very
serious, indeed a mortal issue, e.g. `Aging is an opportunity';
`the older you get, the healthier you've been.' Not to mention the
title of your book, and the Life Expectancy Calculator you include
with it. Who are you trying to kid? This is `medicine' in the grand
style of TV sports doc Bob Arnot (author of `The Breast Cancer
Prevention Diet'), who's willing to coin money selling women on the
idiotic notion that, by consuming more flax seed, they will avoid
breast cancer. How cynical.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynical? The trademarked Life Expectancy Calculator _ cynical?
More like inane. Try it yourself at www.livingto100.com. As I
pointed out to Perls, once you put your foot in this stream, the
water has moved on. For instance, as a former smoker, I had always
been interested in the state of my lungs. For many years, doctors
believed that the body recovers from the effects of smoking after
seven years without cigarettes. But a study released just last week
on the perils of youth smoking demolishes that conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little ungracious of me to try to come between Dr. Perls
and his payday. Deep down, I wish that he and his coauthors might
have asked: Should you want to live to 100? Why? In Perls's
delightful centenarian fantasyland, interview subjects like
102-year-old Tom Spear play 18 holes of golf three times a week; he
consistently shoots ``15 strokes under his age.'' Lucy Boring,
``despite some memory loss,'' plays winning bridge at age 109.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very nice. But the cruel fact is that most men and
women over 65 are burdened with the maladies and concerns of old
age. Dr. Perls wishes it were not so, and his book purports to
contain useful tips on aging healthily: Floss after meals! Keep a
positive attitude! etc. etc.
</P>
<P>
   I yield the last word to Dr. Perls:
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to show people, using centenarians as an example, that
life after 65 can be tremendously fruitful, with years of
opportunities and possibilities. I can see why you might feel
differently, but that is the attitude we are trying to change.
People don't have to look at aging as a terrible thing. With a more
proactive approach it really can be an opportunity. . . . We just
can't be lazy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say (make lifestyle changes) and you will live to
100. . . . We say, do these things because you will add healthy
years to your life and it is worth the effort. . . . There is
nothing free-lunch about our book. Just an optimistic and
empowering point of view about aging.''

<P>
   Bill Bradley is one of those cerebral-type politicians who don't
want to leave you with the impression that any of the nation's
problems have simple answsers.
</P>
<P>
   If Bill Clinton is the Music Man, a saxophone-tooting,
fast-talking smooth-dancing, ear-nibbling salesman with a roving

reasonable shot at disinheriting Al Gore for the Democrats'
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For the D's, the voters have a simple choice: one from Column A
(Vice President Gore) or one from Column B (Bradley). Republican
voters must winnow their way through a grab bag of 11 warring
candidates. In Gore and Bradley, Democrats choose between two
non-Clintons, both of them strait-laced dudes with Ivy League
credentials, brainpower to spare, and a penchant for wonking on and
on about the greenhouse effect, tax policy, or nets _ Gore's an
Internet junkie and Bradley was a professional basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will bowl you over in the oratory department. Both are
experienced Senate veterans with clean rap sheets and heavy duty
intellectual equipment. In a trash-TV-tabloid environment, they'll
both fade to pale gray in the thong wars of contemporary
journalism. But Democrats will be well served by a campaign of
lengthy, lofty, high-brow-issue debate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, it seems, will be a hard guy to draw out. In a
conversation of more than an hour Monday with Globe editorial
writers and editors, Bradley was precise, if not concise,
analytical without being particularly revealing, comfortable in his
new role as challenger, if not totally sanguine about the eventual
outcome. He adopts the mantle of fatalism acquired by the mature
politician. Like so many other capable senators of the last
generation, he had a bellyful of the ``world's greatest
deliberative body,'' and opted out.
</P>
<P>
   On the most pressing issue of the day, Clinton's aggressive
prosecution of the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia,
Bradley was unwilling to say what he would have done differently
from Clinton when forced to choose among the admittedly ``no good
options'' in the Balkan war. Focusing for more than 20 minutes on
Kosovo, Bradley did a typical senatorial big-picture tour of the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   I have to support the troops in the field, he said, and support
the president in his role as commander-in-chief. That said, he
skewered the administration for screwing up the Balkans, to wit:
``I've always believed you do not commit military force into some
place without figuring out how you get out of that place.'' He
criticized Clinton's decision to bomb in Bosnia in '96, and for
committing US troops as peacekeepers there. ``I said in a speech in
the Senate that we just created the next Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lectures that ``we have to be rather modest'' in our
ability to halt ethnic cleansing around the planet; and, yes,
``Milosevic is abominable . . . but there are no good choices.''
Constantly pointing to shortcomings between Clinton's professed
goals (halting ethnic cleansing, keeping Milosevic out of Kosovo,
keeping the war from spreading, restoring the refugees) and the
record on the ground, Bradley emphasized, ``our relationship with
Russia is enormously important in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he argued, this country's vital interests are nowhere
near as important in the Balkans as they are with Russia, China,
the Mideast, Iraq, and North Korea. By my count, that implies
Bradley says Kosovo is only our sixth most important global
challenge, and, again by implication, not worth the effort
Clinton's led us into. ``You don't deploy military force on the
cheap; it always has unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   But, senator, what would you do differently from what Clinton
did, given the choices he faced when he faced them? ``If I'm in
Clinton's shoes, I'd have intervened much earlier in Bosnia and
Kosovo.'' OK; how? ``The first problem was on (George) Bush's
watch,'' when the US went along with Germany's recognition of
Bosnia as a separate state. ``That was the beginning of the
unraveling.'' But that was then, this is now; do you support the
NATO bombing, senator?
</P>
<P>
   Bradley refused to answer. ``Because right now (our military)
people are in the field, and right now I'm not going to make
criticisms of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. This is not George McGovern waging political war on LBJ's
Vietnam conduct. We'll put Bradley down as probably, but silently,
opposed to the NATO bombing. It may not be as complete an answer as
one might expect from a candidate who vows ``to go out and tell
people what you believe.'' But we'll have nine months more to check
back with Bill.

A NEW MOVIE MAKES A CASE THAT SATIRE ISN'T DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Before the debut of his satire series on the
Bravo cable network, Michael Moore complained to Scott Simon on
National Public Radio. ``Satire has been forgotten and millions of
Americans are ironically illiterate,'' he said. ``The Brits, the
French, the Canadians get satire, but Americans don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Satire depends on wit. Moore's latest ambush-interview saga
relies on stunts. Because Washington, D.C., is the capital of
self-parody, satirizing politics is too easy. Moore's Puritan
pecksniffs can not compete with the pack of pharisees assembled by
Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore's ``The Awful Truth'' were a play, it would follow what
George S. Kaufman, the sardonic playwright, predicted in the 1930s:
``Satire is what closes on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   What about satirizing television itself? Nobody did it better
than Mary Tyler Moore in the 1970s. The movie ``EDtv'' succeeds on
the model enunciated by the eminent writer of the American
Southwest, Paul Horgan: ``The object of our satire is the other
face of our love.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Moore is one of the familiar cameos in ``EDtv,'' a
comedy which some film critics have unflatteringly compared to last
year's fable of television, ``The Truman Show,'' which took itself
as seriously as the critics did.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ron Howard's cast is so television-rooted that viewers
can only chuckle, not seethe. Ellen DeGeneres as a cynical network
executive? Not our winsome Ellen. Her boss, Rob Reiner, is both
vapid and villainous, having reached the top after starting ``as an
associate producer on `Good Morning Fresno.' '' He is still as
cuddly as Meathead was in ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson's character may have lingered at too many last
calls at ``Cheers,'' but he is as beguiling as Martin Landau,
operating gear slightly updated from his days on ``Mission:
Impossible.'' Swiping several scenes is a subdued Dharma of
``Dharma and Greg,'' Jenna Elfman, the Lucille Ball of the 21st
century if the network suits get out of her way.
</P>
<P>
   Ed of ``EDtv'' is Matthew McConaughey, not a television actor,
but suited to the role of Everyman as star of sitcom and soap
opera, a human life lived under a 24-hour television stakeout. The
characterizations are winning, even if the plot is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden celebrity was a staple of screwball comedy. ``EDtv''
balances Frank Capra's gee-whiz earnestness in ``Meet John Doe''
with the mordant mockery of Ben Hecht in ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``EDtv'' is filmed in San Francisco, where a sign of its appeal
can be found on Grant Avenue. The video store where the McConaughey
character works is now busier, attracting the kind of crowds that
chug-a-lugged at ``Cheers'' in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's heart is in Mayberry, the North Carolina town where
Howard, the director, grew up as ``Opie,'' the sheriff's son in
``The Andy Griffith Show.'' In 1957, before his television career,
Andy Griffith starred in one of the first movie satires about
television, ``A Face in the Crowd,'' written by Budd Schulberg and
directed by Elia Kazan. As Lonesome Rhodes, a sudden celebrity
turned influential lout, he utters the fearful mantra of television
that echoed in Paddy Chayefsky's ``Network'' 20 years later: ``All
them millions of people believing in me. Doing what I tell them to.
It scares me.''
</P>
<P>
   Television does not scare Howard, or his audience. His
director's path has traveled widely in a Capraesque village of hope
and fantasy. ``Splash'' and ``Cocoon'' gurgle with the warm milk of
coziness, not the vinegar of satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satire flourishes in a stable society and presupposes
homogenous moral standards,'' Evelyn Waugh once wrote. Remote
controls and multiple channels explain why defiantly stiff animated
features lose their fizz. As George Frazier might have said,
whatever happened to Beavis and Butthead? But don't disturb them on
my account. South me no Parks and Bart me no Simpsons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the products Microsoft Corp. has created, none will be
more important to the company than its Windows 2000 operating
system software. Windows 2000 is supposed to finally establish
Microsoft as a producer of ultrareliable software for use in the
biggest, toughest computing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the computer industry was stunned last week when
two key Microsoft executives hinted that they might share the
secrets of Windows 2000 with the world.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and most other software companies make billions by
selling programs that work even though users don't know exactly how
they work. The underlying computer instructions or ``source code''
are guarded as closely as the ingredient list for Coca-Cola. Why
should Microsoft open the black box of Windows 2000 and let rivals
peer inside?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' comes the reply from the leaders of a powerful
alternative software movement. The news last week proves that
Microsoft is beginning to listen.
</P>
<P>
   After years of obscurity, the ``free software'' or ``open source
software'' movement is winning allies in remarkable places. Once
considered a radical notion promoted by programmers on the fringe
of the software industry, the open source principle is now being
embraced in the boardrooms of the world's top computer companies.
Firms like IBM Corp. are producing open source software products.
Apple Computer Corp., notoriously protective of its Macintosh
operating system, has said it will open part of the Mac's source
code.
</P>
<P>
   There are various ideas about what open source software means.
But all of its supporters agree on one thing: The underlying source
code of a program should be freely available, rather than concealed
by the company that sells the software.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, open source is now perceived as a significant
threat to the power of Microsoft. But the movement is also a threat
to itself _ stressed by internal disputes that could one day tear
it apart.
</P>
<P>
   The open source movement has been fueled by the explosive growth
of the Internet. First, the Internet makes it possible for
programmers in the open source community to constantly collaborate.
And the Net itself is based entirely on open software standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web server'' software that distributes Web pages to other
computers depends on these open standards. Microsoft and other
companies sell proprietary Web server software. But by far the most
popular Web server software is an open source program called
Apache, cobbled together by an international alliance of
programmers and distributed for free. Apache's reputation for
excellence is so strong that IBM Corp. last year began distributing
copies of it to customers buying IBM server computers.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the case of Larry Wall, who developed a new
computer language called Perl in 1987, just to solve a particular
problem he had run across at work. ``I had a job I needed to do and
none of the tools available to me were good enough,'' says Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Having invented Perl, Wall gave it away on the Internet. Today,
Perl is one of the Web's most popular programming languages, used
by thousands of Web site developers to add sophisticated
capabilities to their pages.
</P>
<P>
   But the best-known open software product is Linux, a powerful
operating system that's an alternative to Microsoft's flagship
office product, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   The core of Linux was created in 1992 by a Finnish computer
science student named Linus Torvalds. By 1998, Torvalds was on the
cover of Forbes magazine. Last year, Linux became the fourth-most
popular operating system for running powerful ``server'' computers,
which drive corporate networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Major firms like IBM Corp., Dell Computer Corp., and Intel Corp.
are investing in companies that produce Linux software. IBM and
Dell are even selling computers with Linux preinstalled, because
many corporate clients are asking for them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, firms like Oracle Corp., Lotus Development Corp., and
Corel Computer Corp are making Linux versions of their major
business application programs. You can download Linux from the
Internet without paying a dime, but many users prefer to buy it on
CD-ROM disks from firms like Red Hat Software Inc., which charges
$50 and throws in free technical support.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he pays for Linux or not, the owner is free to give
copies of the software to anyone he chooses. In addition, the owner
is free to rewrite features of the software that don't suit him.
Linux comes with source code that lets programmers modify the
software however they please.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the ``free'' in free software really means. This is
the kind of freedom that Richard Stallman had in mind when he
founded the Free Software Foundation in 1985. The winner of a
MacArthur Foundation ``genius grant,'' Stallman, who operates from
a cluttered office at the MIT Computer Lab in Cambridge, Mass.,
could be pulling down hundreds of thousands of dollars at any of a
hundred software firms. Instead, he's is leading a crusade to
liberate software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the goal, the vision of an operating system where every
part of the system was made of free software,'' says Stallman,
strolling the halls in his stocking feet.
</P>
<P>
   So he and hundreds of volunteers around the world launched the
GNU Project to create a free version of the powerful Unix operating
system, then owned by AT&AMP;T Corp. GNU created hundreds of programs,
distributed for free, that performed key functions. By the early
1990s, the only thing GNU lacked was a vital core called a
``kernel'' that governs the basic interaction between the
computer's hardware and software.

 &HT;    PARENTS STILL BEHIND IN RACE FOR COLLEGE SAVINGS
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. With COLLEGE-DATA.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most parents are saving too little, and too
inefficiently, for their children's college education, the College
Savings Plans Network warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,000 parents of school-age children in 34 states
found that about 49 percent of the parents said they were trying to
save more than $10,000 for college costs, but 24 percent had lower
goals and 27 percent weren't saving anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Savings of less than $10,000 could be gobbled up very early in a
student's college career. The College Board estimates that the
average budget for an undergraduate runs $6,445 a year for a
commuter at a public two-year college, $10,458 for a residential
student at a public four-year college, and $22,533 a year for a
resident at a private four-year college. Those sums include
tuition, fees, room and board, transportation, books and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Of parents who told the survey they were saving something,
nearly half put all or some of the money in passbook savings
accounts, which pay interest at rates lower than recent annual
increases in college costs of 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passbook savings plans are terrific products for certain
savings objectives, but they're the wrong instrument for long-term
savings for future college costs,'' said Mississippi's Treasurer
Marshall Bennett, chairman of the network, which is sponsored by
the National Association of State Treasurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do traditional savings accounts lose market value as
they fail to keep up with college inflation, they are so easily
accessible that families are tempted to reach in and take them out
for other expenses,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Other common choices were mutual funds (37 percent), U.S.
savings bonds (16 percent) and life insurance (7 percent). Only 4
percent said they obtained the tax advantages of state-sponsored
plans.
</P>
<P>
   In those plans, earnings on deposits are not subject to state
taxes until they are withdrawn, and some states offer state tax
deductions on deposits as well.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1995, only nine states offered some kind of
college savings program. The number ballooned to 34 last year,
after a federal law also exempted the earnings of all such accounts
from federal taxation until they are withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The network reported that this year:
</P>
<P>
   _ 19 states offer a prepaid college tuition plan, which
guarantees that the earnings on deposits will at least match the
inflation rate for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   _ 17 states offer a savings plan, sometimes with a guaranteed
rate of return, which will accept deposits large enough to cover
college costs other than tuition.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10 states have enacted savings plans that will be operational
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 46 plans are in 44 states, because Massachusetts and
Virginia offer both types.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who
sponsored the law protecting the accounts from federal taxes until
withdrawal, are pushing this year to exempt the withdrawals as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of states have concluded that prepaid
tuition and college savings plans work,'' Graham said. ``Congress
should defer to their judgment and put the tax code on the side of
educational security.''
</P>
<P>
   With 19 other co-sponsors, Graham and McConnell hope they will
be able to add their provision to a tax bill considered this year
or next year.
</P>
<P>
   Details of each state's plan (including some that don't require
the beneficiary or saver to live in that state) can be obtained
with a toll-free phone call to 1-877-CSPN-4-YOU (1-877-277-6496) or
on the Internet (http://www.collegesavings.org).
</P>
<P>
   The network consists of officials who run state-sponsored
education savings programs with more than $4 billion in deposits in
the accounts of more than 800,000 children.

 UNDATED: ... and software.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's when Stallman found out about Torvalds, who was cobbling
together a Unix-like kernel. Torvalds contributed his kernel to GNU
and a powerful new operating system was born. Stallman, with the
pride common to wizard programmers, is annoyed that the resultant
product is called Linux. The proper name for it is GNU/Linux, he
insists, because the GNU Project wrote far more of the software
than Torvalds did.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it, GNU/Linux is mainly popular because it
often works better than Windows and other commercial software
products. Linux is particularly renowned for its stability _ the
software rarely crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Such excellence is surprising. Just as a movie script written by
more than two writers is usually bad, software tends to get buggier
and less efficient as more people work on it. Thousands of people
have worked on Linux, yet it's more reliable than commercial
software.
</P>
<P>
   It made no sense to programmer Eric Raymond. ``I was determined
to become part of the community and to figure out how they got away
with it,'' Raymond says. He wrote up his conclusion in a famous
essay, ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar,'' published on the Internet
_ a reference to the elitism of proprietary software and the
openness of free software code.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond found surprisingly simple reasons for the excellence of
Linux. For example, all programmers who contributed to the project
published their code in open forums on the Internet. Other
programmers from around the world were free to examine it,
criticize it, improve upon it. ``People are less willing to write
sloppy code, because a lot of people will see it,'' says Raymond.
And any flaws that are present will quickly turn up when 100 or
more people start poring over the code.
</P>
<P>
   In a sort of peer review system, open source projects like
GNU/Linux invite smart people around the world to contribute, thus
tapping into more brainpower than even a firm like Microsoft can
muster.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's essay became the intellectual manifesto of the open
source movement. Among its readers were the desperate managers of
Netscape Communications Corp., reeling from the declining market
share of its Internet browsers. Raymond's work played a major role
in encouraging Netscape to announce last year it would design its
next browser, code-named Mozilla, as an open source project. The
company invited programmers around the world to help.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, however, no date has been set for the release of
Mozilla. A key executive with the project, Jamie Zawinski, angrily
resigned on April 1, bitterly criticizing the project's slow pace.
A Netscape official insists that Mozilla is still on track and says
that a trial version of the open source browser will be released by
autumn. Mozilla's woes prove that the open source process doesn't
guarantee the rapid creation of good software.
</P>
<P>
   And the open source movement faces more serious threats.
</P>
<P>
   Linux was designed to emulate Unix, a powerful operating system
invented in the 1970s at AT&AMP;T Corp. Since that time, over a dozen
different incompatible versions of Unix have appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Already there are signs of the same thing happening to Linux.
Several firms offer their own versions of the product. For now,
they're generally compatible. But because the Linux source code is
open, each distributor could introduce modifications to make his
particular Linux package work better. In no time, Linux could
become divided into squabbling fiefdoms, while Microsoft grabs the
lion's share of the market by offering a single standard.
</P>
<P>
   To avert this, many of the leading Linux companies have joined
the Linux Standard Base, an organization to standardize Linux
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology also divides the movement. Richard Stallman believes
with religious fervor that all software should be provided with
source code and users should be free to modify it at will. But many
companies have begun writing ``unfree'' software to run on Linux
machines. The code for these programs is kept secret in the
traditional way. For instance, a copy of the current Netscape
browser is included with the Linux program offered by leading
distributor Red Hat Software Inc. But Netscape won't release the
source code for this browser. For that reason, says Stallman, ``I
can't recommend that anybody buy a Red Hat CD.''
</P>
<P>
   To Raymond, this attitude is absurd. Linux and other open source
products will only become popular if traditional commercial firms
make programs to work with them. Inevitably, most of this software
will not be open source, but that's no reason to reject it, he
argues. ``Richard would cheerfully accept a world of inferior
software if everything was shared and open,'' says Raymond. ``He
cares more about doctrinal purity than about success.''
</P>
<P>
   For now the two men remain friends, and agree to disagree.
Raymond will continue to encourage firms to write commercial
software that's compatible with Linux and other open source
products; Stallman will continue to write pure, free code. And
together with thousands of other programmers, they'll continue to
make the top people at Microsoft very nervous indeed.

PLAYING FAST AND LUCE WITH AMERICAN CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, New York University's journalism department
announced the results of a survey ranking the century's 100
greatest works of American journalism. The results were the sort of
grab bag you might expect: a lot of usual suspects (Woodward and
Bernstein's Watergate coverage, No. 3), a healthy dose of
Volvo-left cant (Jonathan Schell's ``The Fate of the Earth,'' No.
59), and, yes, the occasional welcome surprise (Nick Lemann's ``The
Promised Land,'' No. 67; Jane Kramer's ``Europeans,'' No. 91).
</P>
<P>
   Now think of all the J-school students who can sleep soundly at
night, knowing that so many city-room dust-ups have at last been
definitively decided: Herbert Bayard Swope on the Klan (81) vs.
Hunter S. Thompson fearing and loathing on the campaign trail
(100)? ``In Cold Blood'' (22) vs. ``The Executioner's Song'' (72)?
``The Making of the President'' (26) vs. ``The Selling of the
President'' (99)? Casey Kasem, that avatar of connoisseurship
quantified, couldn't have done it any better.
</P>
<P>
   This is a list so uplifting and high-minded it makes you want to
run out and watch ``MacNeill/Lehrer'' reruns (first place went to
John Hersey's ``Hiroshima,'' second place to Rachel Carson's
``Silent Spring''). It's also so self-congratulatory and
muddle-headed it makes you want to raise a glass to the memory of
Spiro Agnew and tell Tina Brown all is forgiven. Certainly, it
would never deign to include something written by a publisher, let
alone a news-slanting, Republican-moneybags one. And therein lies a
problem. For if _ and it's a mighty big if _ one were so misguided
as actually to want to single out the most influential piece of
American journalism to appear since 1900, a very obvious candidate
(which, needless to say, failed to show up on the NYU list) would
be Henry Luce's ``American Century'' editorial from the February
1941 issue of Life. A couple of million people, tops, read it then.
But several billion have had to live with its fallout since.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it was this nation's destiny to control the
remainder of the century, and by so doing benefit the rest of the
world, to boot, Luce (the man who founded Time, Life, Fortune, and
Sports Illustrated) not only contributed a highly useful phrase to
our cultural vocabulary. He presented a vision of America and its
place on the planet that _ however overblown, however jingoistic _
has stayed central to any understanding of international relations
since. Mock Luce's idea or embrace it, his conception remains as
relevant to our concerns today _ tomorrow, too _ as it did in the
months before Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound exaggerated, but Luce's basic premise is what
writers as eminent, and divergent in outlook, as Paul Kennedy,
Samuel Huntington, and Garry Wills grapple with in World Policy
Journal (spring) and Foreign Affairs (March/April). Kennedy, in the
former publication, is the most explicit, calling his essay ``The
Next American Century?'' As recently as 10 years ago, such a title
would have sounded insane _ as Kennedy's best-known book, ``The
Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' would have been the first to
point out. But the collapse of the Soviet Union, along with the
restructuring of the US economy and the Japanese slump, has changed
all that. Once again, the century is looking red, white, and blue _
and maybe the next one, too. Both Huntington and Wills fret about
this (Kennedy, still comfortable with the conclusions of ``Rise and
Fall,'' simply points in the direction of Carthage and Rome).
Huntington fears that we are mistaking what he calls a
uni-multipolar world for a unipolar world _ the United States is
strong, but not that strong _ and that misunderstanding is a
prescription for trouble. Wills's title, ``Bully of the Free
World,'' is pretty much self-explanatory: Red, white and black and
blue would be his Pax americana color scheme. Either way, it's only
fitting both articles should appear in Foreign Affairs, since for
more than 50 years now it's been de facto recording secretary at
American Century board meetings.

   The last few years have been difficult ones for The New
Republic. It enjoyed the best of times during the '80s and early
'90s with a run of spectacularly opposable presidents (Reagan,
Bush) and spectacularly good editors (Michael Kinsley, Rick
Hertzberg, Andrew Sullivan). But that was then, and not only is
Bill Clinton now, he has been for almost six years. Kinsley's at
Slate, Hertzberg's at The New Yorker, and Sullivan writes a column
for The Sunday Times of London. TNR has had trouble with plagiarism
(Ruth Shalit's), editorial fabrication (Stephen Glass's), and a
very messy firing (of Sullivan's successor, Michael Kelly). Worst
of all, the magazine has simply seemed tired for a long time. Well,
now at least it doesn't look tired. A special double issue (April
26 &AMP; May 3) introduces a complete redesign. It's still recognizably
TNR, but where the overall feel of the old design was an airy
elegance that verged on the finicky, the new TNR has a strong,
assertive look that verges on the overbearing. Body and headline
type have been beefed up. There's now color inside, and a lot more
photos. With its heavy reliance on bold blacks and reds, the
redesign makes TNR look a little bit like Time, of all things
(there's that Henry Luce again).

   Okay, you want to see the new ``Star Wars'' movie,``The Phantom
Menace.'' I want to see it. My 82-year-old Uncle Bill who hasn't
gone to a movie in 13 years wants to see it. But the overkill
really has started to enter hyperspace. Vanity Fair (May) puts
Natalie Portman on the cover. She plays Queen Amidala, the
prequel's Princess Leia equivalent (minus the cinnamon-bun braids,
of course). So what if this is VF's third ``Star Wars'' cover since
December. Wired (May) has Mr. Star Wars himself, on the cover,
George Lucas, and that publication at least has the wit to
acknowledge the PR blitz (``Believe the Hype'' is the cover line).
But Vogue (April), of all magazines, Vogue, gets into the act, with
a feature on ``Star Wars Couture,'' photographed by Irving Penn, no
less. How about Cosmopolitan and ``Star Wars Sex Tips''? Cooking
Light and ``Star Wars Calorie Counters''? Commentary and ``Star
Wars Judaism''? And that's just magazines whose name begins with C.
Hey, now that they've told us what the century's top 100
journalistic works are, the NYU J-types might want to tackle the
question of where ``The Phantom Menace'' ranks on the 100
most-hyped events of the century. May the Force be with them.

ANOTHER VICTIM OF DRIVE-BY FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a Georges Bank that was treated like a cornfield, dredged
and trawled as if by a farmer's combine, it must be some divine
intervention that the animal that might keep the boats idle at the
barn door is the barndoor skate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an international gathering of biologists warned that
this fish is on the verge of extinction in the northwest Atlantic.
It was a critical discovery precisely because the fish, despite
being one of the world's largest marine rays, was not a food fish
(unlike some other species of skate). A flat, winged bottom glider
that can grow up to 3 feet across and 5 feet long with no previous
commercial value, the barndoor skate is a victim of drive-by
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, the skate's population, as it was caught by cod
fishermen and scallopers, has dropped by 90 percent. ``Clearly
we're not keeping our finger on the sea's pulse,'' said Elliott
Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute.
``The drastic decline of the barndoor skate says we need refuges in
the sea where wildlife can live, grow, and reproduce . . . without
being killed off.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning comes just as scallopers are fine-tuning their
dredges in hopes of returning to Georges Bank. Scallops have
recovered abundantly in a part of the bank called Area 2 after five
years of fishing closures. Scallopers have leaned heavily on
Senator Ted Kennedy and US Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has responded by pressuring the New England Fishery
Management Council to open Area 2 to scallopers by June 15. The
problem is that June 15 is far too soon for scientists to know
whether the return of the scallops is a symbol of a general renewal
or merely an opportunistic outbreak in a more lifeless sea.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the barndoor skate is evidence that we should be
concerned about the latter. In the midst of growing fears that we
are fishing swordfish, wild salmon, and sharks into commercial
extinction, the barndoor skate is on the verge of becoming the
first extensively documented full extinction of a marine fish.
</P>
<P>
   Its crash has occurred from the waters off New England all the
way up to Newfoundland _ wherever fishermen have been. In a study
published last year in the journal Science, university researchers
from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia estimated that the population on
St. Pierre Bank off southern Newfoundland had decreased in the last
half-century from 600,000 to 500 by the 1970s. Barndoor skates were
a common bycatch in the 1950s, being caught in 10 percent of
trawls. There has been no recording of a barndoor skate bycatch in
the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Jill Casey and Ransom Myers, wrote that the skate
was ``driven to near extinction without anyone noticing. If such a
large, easily identified species has been allowed to disappear in
an area that is well surveyed, the fate of little-known species is
likely to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   On Georges Bank, the barndoor skate appears to be making a
comeback, possibly in response to current fishing restrictions and
closures. But a reopening of the bank raises serious questions
about the creature's ability to survive.
</P>
<P>
   When born, it is already big enough, at nearly a foot in width,
to be caught by fishermen. There is a high chance of being caught
long before it reaches sexual maturity, which takes at least a
decade. Even when it lays eggs, it produces only about 47 a year,
hardly enough to compensate for the dredges.
</P>
<P>
   These are more reasons why Georges Bank should not be reopened
in knee-jerk fashion, as if it were just another government farm
program. Fishermen habitually refer to their catch as a
``harvest.'' It is highly misleading. You can reseed corn. Fish are
not so easy. ``Scientists know so little about the habitat of many
fish species that they are starting virtually from scratch,'' said
another article last year in Science.
</P>
<P>
   As well, scientists have only scratched the surface of knowing
how high-tech fishing combines ``harvest'' the sea. ``How many
passes of a trawl is equal to a single sea scallop dredge?'' asked
Peter Auster, science director of the National Undersea Research
Center at the University of Connecticut at Avery Point. ``That kind
of exercise has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Until those experiments are done, any return to the banks is a
high-risk exercise in extinction. Casey and Myers wrote: ``Perhaps
the only hope for the long-term survival of this species is to
designate an area protected from trawling on all the banks that is
sufficiently large to allow for a self-sustaining population.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken to its logical conclusion, any decisions on Georges Bank
cannot be made as if this were just a field left fallow to sow one
crop. While fishermen compare themselves to farmers, in too many
cases they are more like lumbermen carelessly slashing a clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   Until scientists learn a lot more about the impact of fishing,
the boats should remain at the barn door. Skating on thin knowledge
is no way to manage the oceans.

FOOD PACKAGING: NO LONGER AS EASY AS BLACK AND WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATE GURNETT  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You're at the grocery store. You see the candy
bar. You grab the candy bar. You have a good excuse: It's low fat!
You know that because ... the package is green?
</P>
<P>
   Or so you think. Color plays a big role in what food products
people buy, experts say. It's the top consumer clue.
</P>
<P>
   Take Campbell's soup, Marlboro cigarettes and Coca Cola packaged
in red and white. Red is the most stimulating color; white gives
the best contrast, said Mona Doyle, author of ``Packing Strategy:
Winning the Consumer'' (Technomic Press, 1996). Yellow means happy
(think Cheerios and Domino Sugar). As diets change over time, so do
our color preferences, said Doyle, president of the Consumer
Network of Philadelphia and a packaging and consumer preference
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are popular colors. There are fad colors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black, once a symbol of no-frills, now emits elegance or
gourmet.
</P>
<P>
   Now back to green.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy being green back when Kermit the Frog was a young
croaker. Then, green was a ``barf'' color with monstrous
associations, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, green is as hot as pink. Green says environmentally
responsible. It says decaffeinated. It says low fat. Manufacturers
of products from Healthy Choice to Hershey's Sweet Escapes have
wrapped their products in green.
</P>
<P>
   But don't snatch up those sweets just yet. First hear this
O'Henry tale.
</P>
<P>
   There once was an O'Henry candy bar, wrapped in a yellow
wrapper. Along came Brian Wansink, director of the Food &AMP; Brand Lab
at the University of Illinois, who wrapped it in green.
</P>
<P>
   He distributed it to consumers, then asked them what they had
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, they reported, this candy bar, the same old
O'Henry, now in new clothes, had fewer calories and more protein!
</P>
<P>
   ``People tended to see it as having 20 percent less of all the
bad stuff,'' Wansink said. ``Less fatty and caloric. They said,
`It's got a lot less cholesterol.' They also thought it had a lot
more vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote one consumer: ``I like this even better than those Snack
Wells!''
</P>
<P>
   That's some color!
</P>
<P>
   People generally make subconscious judgments about places,
people and things within 60 to 90 seconds, said Eric Johnson, head
of Research Studies for the Institute for Color Research in
Chicago. ``Up to 92 percent of that decision is based on color
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Packaging is the front line in grocery sales, he said. ``When
you're walking down a grocery store aisle, two things are
happening. First, people seek product identity. I want a Tide box.
And we all know what Tide boxes look like.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Pepsi lost a chunk of its market when it came up with
new blue cans, said Johnson, who is writing a textbook on color
response.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if it's a new item, they notice the color. ``Colors for
food must be fairly congruent with what the food is inside. Except
for children's cereals or children's foods, then marketers can get
away with the really strong colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue is uncommon in food packaging, unless it's for seafood,
which has an association with water and fish, Johnson said. Purple
is less common, unless it means grape or children's products.
</P>
<P>
   Orange means cheap. ``Yellow and orange combined means this is
highly affordable, pick me up fast! Like Burger King.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as diets change from the 1950s meat-and-potatoes staple
to tofu and power bars, such variety is reflected in packaging,
Doyle said. ``It's like sneakers and kids' clothes. Anything goes.
Bright colors are more acceptable. Flamboyant colors, shining
colors, holography. You have dimensionality and translucent labels.
People are printing directly on packaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, people are so free these days they'll even buy green
oranges, Doyle said. That consumer move was unheard of two decades
ago. And those old black-and-white store labels are now dressed up
in four-color, shiny packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says to people, `This is all dressed up. The outside is
fancy so the inside must be fancy, too,' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that new shapes, bottles with waistlines and silhouettes
and ovals and rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Such packaging beseeches: ``Come like me. Love me. Take me home
because you want me on your table. Feel me. Caress me. Enjoy me,''
Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a mistake to assume that all manufacturers know all
this stuff, Wansink said. ``They sit around and say, `My wife likes
blue. Maybe we should put it in blue.''

UNIONS TAKE FIGHT OVER CEO'S PAY TO SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, while speaking before the Council of
Institutional Investors, AFL-CIO president John Sweeney argued that
labor unions must use their influence as shareholders to rein in
chief executives' escalating pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must challenge the . . . widening gap between the pay of a
handful of top executives and everyone else in American society,''
Sweeney told the coalition of public-employee, union, and corporate
pension funds that collectively control some $800 billion in
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the gloves came off.
</P>
<P>
   Union pension funds and union-related groups are flexing their
muscles on Wall Street by filing a slew of shareholder resolutions
seeking to curb, cap, or control the compensation of the nation's
corporate executives. They join other activists who have made
executive pay a big issue in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One success so far for the unions: UAL Corp., which is
employee-owned, agreed in January to a union proposal that will tie
a portion of top executives' compensation to worker satisfaction,
starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor has always been resentful of CEO pay, but now unions are
becoming much more sophisticated in their objections and their
presentation,'' said Alexandra LaJoux, editor of The Director's
Monthly, the newsletter of the National Association of Corporate
Directors in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really seeing right now is the cost of doing
business,'' Ted Jadick, a partner at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, said
about spiraling salaries. ``If you are looking for a top CEO, and
you have to find that talent in an open and competitive
marketplace, then you must pay the market price. That means
offering competitive compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, nine union-related resolutions were filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning executive
compensation. This year, 23 proposals were filed. Such shareholder
resolutions _ targeting skyrocketing executive pay, golden
parachutes, and stock option packages _ are proposals that require
approval by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   One example: the AFL-CIO's Staff Retirement Fund, which wants to
tie the price of stock options awarded to Dean O'Hare, the chairman
and chief executive of Chubb Corp., to the company's performance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare earned more than $2.8 million last year, including a
bonus payment and other compensation, according to a 1999 executive
survey in The Wall Street Journal. The AFL-CIO pension fund
resolution maintains Chubb's chief executive could gain an
additional $3.8 million from last year's grant of 99,250 stock
options ``by achieving a mere 5 percent annual shareholder return
over the term of the grant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get at the fact that this company and others are
giving out stock options no matter what the CEO does or what the
company does,'' said William B. Patterson, the AFL-CIO's investment
expert. ``When the stock market goes up, they are rewarded
regardless of their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Chubb and its compensation committee are
opposed to the measure. In a written statement, the insurer argued
that indexing, or linking O'Hare's stock options to company
performance, would not be beneficial to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indexed options are rare among US corporations,'' Chubb said
in a statement. ``The use of indexed options would depress and
artificially add volatility to the corporation's earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shareholder resolutions rarely rally enough votes to pass.
One reason: Shareholders tend to back management when companies are
posting gains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unions can take heart in the success of UAL employees.
Stephen Sleigh, director of strategic resources for the
International Association of Machinists in Washington, D.C., said
United Airlines's unions spearheaded the drive to tie pay to worker
satisfaction when it submitted a shareholder resolution demanding
the changes as a way to gain more CEO accountability. UAL's union
employees hold 60 percent of the airline's shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed a resolution, but the company agreed to it so we
withdrew it,'' said Sleigh. ``Since we hold a substantial number of
shares, we were able to have a real dialogue . . . and senior
executives agreed to it. It made sense to them.''
</P>
<P>
   A UAL spokesman said the plan will also tie pay to customer
satisfaction and company performance.
</P>
<P>
   This year, shareholders will be asked to approve several
union-related resolutions. These include:
</P>
<P>
   --At Sherwin-Williams Co., stockholders through the Electrical
Workers' pension fund have proposed that the board of directors
seek shareholder approval for all executive officer severance pay
agreements. The board opposes this proposal.
</P>
<P>
   --At Chiquita Brands International, a resolution filed by the
Carpenters and Pension Annuity Fund of Philadelphia would curtail
the repricing of stock options awarded to top executives.
</P>
<P>
   --At BankAmerica, shareholders through the Teamsters pension
fund urge the board to adopt a policy that all board members be
independent, with no professional or personal affiliation with the
company or chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, United for a Fair Economy, a Boston coalition of
union and community groups, is cosponsoring nine shareholder
resolutions through its Responsible Wealth project, which is made
up of 425 wealthy individuals. Eight of the proposals would tie
chief executives' pay at companies to a multiple of the pay earned
by their lowest paid employees _ a suggestion that shareholders
will likely vote down.
</P>
<P>
   Responsible Wealth isn't expecting a victory this year. Its
intent, a spokesman said, was to raise public awareness and,
perhaps, provide the push needed to launch a populist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to start a public debate on how much is enough,''
Scott Klinger, the director of Responsible Wealth, said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's resolutions would cap total compensation to
executives at Citigroup to a multiple of the lowest-paid workers'
total compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean CEO pay wouldn't go up,'' noted Klinger.
``It means Citigroup's chief executives couldn't make more than 200
times the lowest-paid workers. If the top executives wanted to make
more, they would have to raise everybody's pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup was an obvious target: chief executive Sanford I.
Weill, who shares management of the company with John S. Reed, was
the nation's highest paid chief executive last year. He took home
$166,855,600 in salary, bonus, stock options, and other
compensation, according to the survey by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing against the measure, Citigroup said: ``The proposal
would require the board of directors to establish an arbitrary cap
on the total compensation of the chief executive officers, thereby
diminishing the significance of more pertinent factors, such as
corporate and individual performance.''

   Who knew banking could be this interesting?
</P>
<P>
   Like almost anything these days, banking becomes more compelling
to investors when you do it on the Internet. Our latest company
pulled from obscruity to the spotlight via the Web: Atlantic Bank &AMP;
Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the tiny Boston institution traded at 11 1/8 on April
5, the day before the first of two on-line banking announcements.
As usual, the Internet news sent normal stock activity into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic stock traded as high as 52 1/4 Tuesday, before settling
down to finish the session at 41 1/8. The 4.1 million Atlantic
shares that changed hands Tuesday by far exceeded the stock's
trading volume for a full year before the April 5 announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy? Atlantic president Richard Wayne isn't going to be the
person to tell you so. ``I'm not in the business of predicting
stock prices,'' he said. ``It is where it is. All I can say is that
I'm happy where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you've never heard of Atlantic Bank &AMP; Trust. Fleet
Financial Group makes more money in two days than Atlantic earns in
an entire year. It maintains a headquarters office in downtown
Boston and one branch. Even after the spectacular recent run,
Atlantic's stock market value is still just $170 million.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic specializes in wholesale banking, buying packages of
loans or pieces of big loans another institution originates. This
keeps overhead to a minimum so it can offer modestly higher
interest rates to depositors. It is a small but profitable and
growing business.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Atlantic shareholders, their bank announced its
Internet expansion at about the same time bullish sentiment was
building for two banks that conduct their business exclusively on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If a strong wind was pushing Atlantic stock higher, a hurricane
sent shares soaring at Net.B(at)nk Inc. of Atlanta and Telebanc
Financial Corp. of Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk stock has zoomed from 68 to 235 1/64 this month
alone. The shares were up 76 33/64, in part on news of a 3-for-1
stock split.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc shares, which traded at 47 3/8 three weeks ago,
finished Tuesday at 140 1/2. The stock was up 33 1/8 in Tuesday's
session alone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the enthusiasm seems to have been sparked by recent
comments by Net.B(at)nk executives, who say deposit account growth
is exceeding their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Internet stock explosions, news and hype bounces
around the Web itself as individual investors drive huge trading
volumes in lots of 100 or 200 shares at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity and investor relations companies that conduct
``interviews'' with executives and then make the audio available on
Internet sites become part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic executives were involved in an interview conducted and
posted by one such service, Vcall Corp., last week. Another
service, talk-stock.com, was scheduled to arrange a similar
conversation with officials at Virtuallender.com today.
</P>
<P>
   Though Atlantic has enjoyed a bit of Web stock euphoria, it's
valuation can't compare with those of the pure Internet
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Net.Ba(at)nk, which has a smaller business than Atlantic at the
moment, carries a stock market valution of $2 billion, more than 10
times larger than that of Atlantic. Telebanc, the larger Internet
bank, is valued at $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic announced on April 6 that it had signed an Internet
banking services agreement with a contractor to build a banking Web
site with hopes of getting it up and running by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, an Atlantic subsidiary touted a new on-line
system to generate small-ticket office equipment leases that could
be originated on the spot at stores just as car loans are arranged
at dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Bank customers who were too expensive to service can become good
business over the Internet. The Web's lower overall expenses can
make it possible for banks like Atlantic to offer better interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne won't say how much Atlantic expects the Internet to impact
it's business. ``The technology is here, we all know that,'' he
said. ``I expect we'll participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic stock was in the dulldrums before its Internet
announcements and may have been undervalued at the time. Analyst
Robert Schwartzberg of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey raised his rating
on Atlantic to a ``strong buy'' on Feb. 17, when it traded at 12
1/2, and cited 18 per share as a price target.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzberg said Tuesday he didn't know how much value
Atlantic's Internet business could create, but has maintained the
same strong buy recommendation. He hasn't issued any new price
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would we.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CAPITAL HONOR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Venture Capital Association will honor famed
investor Peter Brooke with a lifetime achievement award at a dinner
Thursday in Boston. Brooke, founder and chairman of the global
venture firm Advent International, also was a founder of TA
Associates in 1968.

FROM DADS TO STUDENTS, THERE'S A BIBLE FOR YOU

 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First there was The Word. Today, there are Words, and Words and
Words.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bible has always been the world's best-selling book,
the number of different Bibles jamming bookstores has exploded in
recent years, driven by a phenomenal boom in Bibles catering to
special interest groups ranging from mothers to recovering
alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 3,000 different Bibles on the market today,
with more coming. For instance, Whittemore's, New England's largest
Christian bookstore, stocks 1,000 different Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   From harried fathers to struggling high school students to
stressed-out businesss people, millions of Christians are buying
these specialty or ``niche'' Bibles, whose packaging and marketing
promise words of wisdom to meet their specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These specialized Bibles have become enormously popular,''
said Phyllis Tickle, contributing editor for religion at Publishers
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Stroll down the Bible aisle at your local bookstore and you
might find: ``The New Adventure Bible,'' geared toward children,
with recommended activities related to Scripture passages; ``Holy
Bible: Woman Thou Art Loosed,'' featuring prayers and essays by
evangelical personality T.D. Jakes; and ``The End Times Bible,''
containing references to millennial prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Some stores stock Bible-buying charts to help customers wade
through a sometimes overwhelming selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone walks into a store saying, `I'm looking for a
Bible,' it might be a scary 20 or 30 minutes because there are so
many choices,'' said Craig Featherstone, vice president of
Nashville, Tenn.-based Thomas Nelson, one of the nation's largest
Bible publishers.
</P>
<P>
   These specialty Bibles do not alter any of the basic narrative
of Christian Scripture. If they did, they couldn't be considered
genuine Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   What makes specialty Bibles distinct is what surrounds the
sacred text _ commentaries targeted at specific audiences,
graphics, and inspirational words linked to certain important
verses.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Women's Devotional Bible,'' for instance, includes ``a new
collection of daily devotions from Godly women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Adventure Bible'' has a colorful graphic translating
the 10 Commandments for children, including this as the Second
Commandment: ``You may not worship, or put more importance on any
person or thing, other than God. You must worship only the Lord,
not your parents, not a friend, not a movie star or sports hero,
not a car or boat or or skateboard. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These Bibles provide an avenue for people who may otherwise
find it difficult to find a way into Scripture,'' said Laurel Book,
Bible buyer for Family Christian Stores, the country's largest
chain of Christian stores with about 320 retail outlets. Specialty
Bibles generally cost from $20 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   The specialty Bibles use different standard translations or
versions of Scripture. The King James Version, once the leader, has
been supplanted by the New International Version, which was
published 25 years ago and has become a mainstay of Protestant
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Another version, the New Living Translation, has sold 3 million
copies since it was published three years ago. The official Roman
Catholic Bible sanctioned by the US Catholic bishops is the New
American Bible.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to determine just how popular Bibles have become
because no single group track sales and Bibles are sold as
fundraisers in stores and over the Internet. But the top five Bible
publishers, including Thomas Nelson, Zondervan Publishing House and
Tyndale, say Bible sales have increased 30 percent to 40 percent
throughout the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a Bible that's going to speak to you and where you
are in your relationship to God and where you are in your life,''
explained Nancy Langevin, who owns two Bibles but prefers to
regularly read a special devotional Bible for people in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to go into specifics, Langevin says she has
``struggled with some addictive behaviors'' and the devotional
Bible helps her ``recognize that when God is in control of my life
things are much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth in specialized Bibles also is fueled by an enormous
appetite for spiritual nourishment, an increase in church-based
Bible study groups and a greater availability of inexpensive
Bibles.
</P>
<P>
   Another key reason, say book industry analysts, is savvy
marketing. ``Let's face it, we're talking about slick packaging and
smart advertising,'' Tickle said. ``Nobody is changing the Bible.
They're just presenting it differently. But it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians worry that the flood of specialized Bibles is
becoming excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Bibles does any man, woman or child want or need to
have?'' says Ginny Van Meter, general manager at Whittemore's,
based in Needham, Mass. ``A woman who appreciates the `Women's
Devotional Bible' may not need a `Mom's Devotional Bible' or a
`Parenting Devotional Bible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others question whether Bible publishers are more interested in
profits than in spreading the Good News.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure Jesus would smile at what's going on right now in
the Christian world,'' said Rob Wilson, who tracks Christian
businesses and is senior vice president at Bustin and Company, a
Dallas-based business development firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mockabee, senior vice president and publisher of Bibles for
Zondervan Publishing House, based in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
acnknowledged the fine line publishers of sacred texts straddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take seriously the idea of representing what God would have
us say to today's culture, and do it without too much hip hop,''
Mockabee said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christian scholars and ministers also warn that specialized
Bibles filled with ancillary notes and commentary could lead to
confusion between what is sacred text, and what has been added by
the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reader could easily think that since this is the Bible that
everything, including all the extra notes, have similar weight,''
notes Mark Coppenger, president of Midwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Kansas City, Mo. ``An innocent reader walking into a
bookstore will find a familiar name or attractive packaging or
fetching title and take it as something trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Whitesel, who has bought several different kinds of
Bibles for her family and as gifts, also said she prefers to draw
her own conclusions rather than subscribe to someone else's views.
Still, she notes, the quality and readability of Bibles has
improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bible publishers insist that inhouse editors scrutinize every
word to ensure that specialized Bibles do not lead readers astray
and are in line with accepted biblical scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask why publish a women's bible?'' Featherstone said.
``And I say because I'm not convinced that 75-year-old gray haired
scholars have as much sensitivity to women's issues as women
scholars would. You can't have the same scholars speak equally well
to the needs of all people in all denominations at all stages of
their lives.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 KINGSTON, R.I.: ... to him.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Harrick Jr. often refers to his father as ``coach'' and
``Jim Harrick.'' He played for his father at Pepperdine, and
understood then that their's must always be a relationship in which
both are mindful that the father-and-son role must take backstage
to professional issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got into this business I quickly realized there is a
business side to Jim Harrick and there is a social side to Jim
Harrick,'' said Jim Jr. ``And I understood the business. I
understand who I am, that I am a direct reflection of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult to be in this busineness. It's not
always played out to my favor or to my benefit, but I've taken the
good with the bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Harrick Jr. said his father enjoyed URI and wanted his son
at his side but was also interested in coaching at the major
college level again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process happened way too quickly for him,'' said
Harrick. ``He's not one of those guys who makes emotional
decisions, and the pressures of the time frame Georgia was putting
him under and the pressures of having to make that decision quickly
without evaluating all the intangibles caused him to have a lot of
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim Harrick is a loyalty guy, first and foremost, and that's
why he was bothered, because the people at URI had been so good to
him. It's always, always difficult leaving a good situation. And he
didn't have a good situation here, he had a great stiuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said his father told him about Georgia's offer as the
two prepared to go to the NCAA championship game March 29 in St.
Petersburg, Fla. Following the game, he said his father told the
other coaches he was leaving and invited them to come to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he said, `I want to talk to Ron (Petro) and the
people in Rhode Island because I'm not sure I don't just want to
sit down and work it out,' '' said the younger Harrick.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next morning his father flew back to URI to meet
with school officials. The coaches flew back later in the day and
met with him that evening. Harrick said his father received a
counter offer that ``blew him away'' and had spelled out for him
all the reasons why he should stay.
</P>
<P>
   But to the son's surprise, Harrick said he was taking the
Georgia job. ``I was very shocked. At that point I felt very
disappointed, because there was a chance it might not happen for
me. But I was happy if that was what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said his father left for Georgia and because both were
busy the following day they did not correspond. ``Then on Thursday
morning, I got two or three calls from both of my brothers saying
he was struggling with his decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them it's a hard decision and transition is emotional.
And they said, `No, he's struggling with you, because he got down
there and it doesn't look like he's going (to get past the nepotism
issue).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Harrick said he heard his father had changed his mind. At
about 6 p.m., he spoke with his father from the URI basketball
office where, unknown to him, a crowd of more than 300 people was
swelling outside, ready to give Jim Harrick Sr. a hero's welcome
for returning to the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brothers were on the other line, and (Harrick Sr.) asked me
if I was OK with his decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20. If I had my druthers now, I would have
said, `I really want you here. I enjoy us working together. I like
our program. I love Rhode Island. Let's stay.' What I said to him
was, `If you want to go down there, I'll support you there. If you
want to come back here, I'll really support you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he hung up and the next thing I heard was he was going
(to Georgia).''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick said he spoke with his father two hours later, and told
him about the people who were standing outside the coaches'
offices. He said he asked his father if he was certain he wanted to
leave, but by then Harrick's second commitment to Georgia was
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business you learn what is done is done and it's hard
to undo things,'' said the younger Harrick. ``I'll always support
him professionally in any decision he decides to do. And obviously,
I'll support him as a son would always support his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few weeks have been eventful for URI players. The team
lost to North Carolina-Charlotte in the first round of the NCAA
tournament in Milwaukee, then returned home, believing their 20-13
season was capped with that defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we come back from spring break and heard that coach
Harrick was going to Georgia,'' said freshman guard Tip Vinson, who
played for DeGregorio at St. Thomas Aquinas. ``That hurt because
(Harrick's) such a great guy and all of us like to play for him. It
was kind of a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   But Vinson said he didn't pay attention to reports Harrick was
having a change of heart, so when he heard the coach was heading to
Georgia again he said it did not faze him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect coach Harrick and wish the best for him, as he
would for us,'' he said. But he added, ``Around campus people are
always asking us why did it happen. They ask a lot of questions.
Sometimes, you avoid trying to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days a new coach could be in place at URI and the
talk will likely subside. Undoubtedly most URI officials hope so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate, because Jim Harrick had 600 great
days in Rhode Island,'' said DeGregorio. ``It would be unfortunate
if people would define or remember Jim Harrick for two bad days.
Time heals wounds. If the program moves forward, succeeds or stays
at the level it has been, I think people will forget those two
days.''

NEW MEXICO SCHOOL PREPS NATIVE AMERICANS FOR COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROWE, N.M. _ The memories are so vivid, so painful, that many of
the high school seniors speak of them as if they were their own.
</P>
<P>
   The students recall the chopped-off braids of their ancestors
and the beatings they received for speaking their own languages.
The bitter taste of the English names assigned to new students.
Surviving until graduation was a feat, college all but an
impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   As Wizipan Garriott, a 19-year-old Lakota, explained, ``I
guess'' white people ``didn't want us to succeed, and I guess we
didn't expect to.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than a century after the first federal boarding
school for Indians was founded, success is being celebrated on a
campus tucked away in the piney hills 45 miles southeast of Santa
Fe. The Native American Preparatory School is about to graduate its
first class, and each of the 22 seniors is college bound. So far,
not a single rejection letter has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As acceptances roll in at the only privately funded school for
Native Americans, the seniors must decide between Occidental and
Grinnell, Antioch and Amherst. Several are waiting to hear from
Stanford, Dartmouth, and Vassar. Wizipan, who felt unprepared for
the Ivy League after graduating from a reservation school in South
Dakota, spent a year readying himself in Rowe. In the fall, the
aspiring architect will head to Yale, where, he said, he will be
the first student there schooled on a reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My other school was a typical reservation school,'' Wizipan
said, as he showed off a model of the tool shed and greenhouse he
designed as part of his hands-on coursework. ``How can I be
diplomatic but honest without cutting it down? The expectations are
just higher here. The whole goal is completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   At Native American Prep, one central goal is to give students
the book learning and life experience necessary to succeed in
college, and the confidence to know that they can. Another is to
begin building a network of graduates to rival any East Coast prep
school, able to assist one another and their tribes for decades to
come. Many of the teenagers vow to use their educations to improve
reservation life and reduce massive Indian unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   As Sven Huseby, who formerly ran Vermont's Putney School and
came out of retirement to take over in Rowe, noted, many of the 71
students come to the school from the poverty of the nation's
reservations. Between them, they represent 33 tribes in 11 states.
About half of Native Americans do not graduate from high school; of
those who enroll in college, only a tiny percentage finish. Even at
Native American Prep, more than half of the freshmen enrolled in
1995 have since left the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids know that if they do well'' colleges will ``want more
of them,'' said Whitney Laughlin, the campus's college counselor.
``If they don't, they won't. They know they're ambassadors for the
school and for Native Americans. They're pioneers, and they're
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   For four years now, the students have prepared themselves in
small classrooms where about half of the faculty is also Native
American. Students study the academic core _ English, math, and
science, for example _ as well as extras that emphasize their own
tribal histories and traditions. Traditional prayers, songs, and
medicines are not only allowed, they are taught, along with Indian
authors and folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contrast between what I experienced and they experience is
huge,'' said John Anthony Reyna, who teaches world cultures to
sophomores part time. ``We never had classes in Native American
history, in Native American anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with four applicants for every acceptance, the school
has not gained easy acceptance among some Native Americans. Despite
the newfound wealth of many tribal nations that have ventured into
casino gambling _ and launched schools of their own _ the vast
majority of the prep school's $2 million or so annual budget comes
from white sources such as foundations, corporations, or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Actor Val Kilmer, who lives nearby, made a film about the school
that is used for fund-raising, and he recently dropped off bags and
boxes of used clothing for the youths.
</P>
<P>
   Only two students _ one a white teenager from Santa Fe who
applied and had to be accepted under the school's admission
guidelines _ pay the full, $24,000-a-year tuition. The others
typically pay about $900, with parents able to work off those
payments by helping out on the sprawling campus, where modest
dormitories and classrooms are designed to fit into their wooded
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, some parents have to be convinced that the school
their children want to attend is not the school of their own
childhoods. Even today, education specialists said, many of the 180
or so Indian schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are dim,
crumbling places with no money for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents come into my office and revisit the nightmare of
their boarding school days because they're hoping we're
different,'' said Edison Eskeets, the associate head of the school
who ran 38 miles a day for six days to raise $90,000 for student
scholarships. ``They were asked not to speak native languages, not
to bring their native traditions with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikke Nez, one of the seniors who regularly dash off opinion
pieces to a New Mexico newspaper, felt shut out in both the white
world and the Indian world until she arrived at Native American
Prep. Part white, part Navajo, she said she was ridiculed for her
heritage at both a public school she attended and a federally
funded Indian school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I knew of my culture was what the media fed to me,'' said
Nez, who plans to be an ethnobotanist. ``Even at the Indian school,
I was like, `Why do I want to be an Indian if everyone rejects me?'
I've learned a lot about me here. . . . But as far as giving back
to `my people,' that's a cliche. They didn't give anything to me.
I'm giving back to this school.''
</P>
<P>
   Like teenagers everywhere, many of the students snicker at the
stories of hardship they hear from their parents and grandparents,
and from the Indians who are now their teachers: planting corn,
herding sheep, walking 10 miles to school. Like typical teenagers,
they also have trouble articulating exactly what their own school
has meant for them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they point to specific experiences: group trips to
visit colleges around the country; attendance at summer workshops
emphasizing everything from sports to computers; the semester a
student studied in China; and the senior year two students are
spending in Spain, part of a program sponsored by Massachusetts'
Phillips Andover Academy. Every year several also attend the summer
program at Cushing Academy in Massachusetts. The girls' basketball
team also won the district championship, despite the lack of a gym
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But the rigidity associated with many prep schools is absent at
Native American Prep. At a recent ``morning gathering,'' students
lined the wall to hear announcements, read poetry, and thank the
staff for the Indian fry bread they had feasted on that Friday
night. Then, urged on by the science teacher, a dozen of them
demonstrated the country line dancing they had learned over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the push I needed,'' said Jolene Abeita, 18, a senior
from the Santo Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico who has been accepted
by nine schools so far and plans to major in English. ``I never
even thought about college before I came here. I'm expecting it to
be hard, but now I'm used to hard. I'm ready, and I'm going.''

JEAN DRISCOLL IS BACK AND READY TO ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Jean Driscoll, the queen of the Boston Marathon
women's wheelchair division, has a fire in her belly.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll won her event seven consecutive times from 1990 to
1996. She seemed on the way to No. 8 in 1997 until her wheel caught
a streetcar track and threw her at Cleveland Circle. Victory eluded
her again last year when Louise Sauvage caught her at the finish
line in the closest Boston finish ever. How close? So close that
they posted the same times (1:41:19).
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, 32, is on a mission this year. She has relived her
past two setbacks and comes to Boston with a new mindset.
</P>
<P>
   Replaying last year, Driscoll said, ``I had thought about that
race many times, and there are two very interesting things.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, after we climbed Heartbreak Hill, I thought I was in
pretty good position. I felt comfortable. I had a good lead on
Louise. Then, approaching Cleveland Circle where I took that tumble
on the streetcar tracks two years ago, I started thinking about it.
It was like playing a mind game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit my brakes hard three times approaching the Circle. I
really didn't have to but I was afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind games. Driscoll seemingly gave up inches while Sauvage
gained yards. Still, at that instant, it didn't figure much in the
overall picture.
</P>
<P>
   Said Driscoll, ``I think maybe I lost the race right there when
I think about it. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll's second replay confirms what many watchers suspected
last year: She wasn't aware that Sauvage was so close to her at the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were approaching the finish line after I turned onto
Boylston Street,'' said Driscoll. ``I turned the corner and had
maybe a 50-meter lead on Louise. I felt very comfortable as I was
making my final pushes. Then I heard the announcement from the
finish line, `Jean Driscoll wins her eighth Boston Marathon.' When
I heard that, I figured I had at least 20-30 meters on Louise. I
was just raising my arms to cut the tape at the finish line when _
whoosh _ Louise passed me. I was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that the people at the finish line thought Louise
was a male wheelchair entry. Well, it wasn't a he, it was a she. It
was Louise. She won. What can I say? She beat me in the sprint and
the sprint is the strong part of her races. My strong point is the
hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll wasn't making an alibi, she just told it as it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tumbled two years ago at Cleveland Circle, Boston fans
cried for me,'' said Driscoll. ``It was the same last year. There
were more tears for me at the most quiet finish line I ever saw.
The Boston fans seem to love me, and I love the Boston fans. I
cried too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, you can't take anything away from Louise. She never
gave up. She never quit, and I admire her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Smith, Driscoll's trainer at the University of Illinois,
said, ``Jean's in great shape. Her workouts have been great. I'll
tell you, she really wants to win at Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll didn't do much training late in 1998. She was making
appearances for her sponsor (Ocean Spray) and spent little time in
her racing chair. She worked out in a hand cycle most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while I even thought about not going back to Boston,''
said Driscoll. ``That feeling didn't last too long, though. I got
an itch, and in December I got that fire back, that fire in my
belly I had in Boston the first three times I won. Not that I
didn't have fire the past six years. I just don't think it was as
intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started serious training, bought a new racing chair and I've
been serious since then. I want Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I will not have a feeling that I'm guaranteed a
victory. I know I have to make an all-out effort and race smartly.
I do have that fire back. It's a fire that I think was lacking
maybe a bit the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll didn't come to Boston 10 days in advance of the race as
she did the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that I had too much time to think about the
race in recent years,'' said Driscoll who will arrive Thursday.
``The anticipation gets to you. You know, all the interviews and
hoopla. I do like that. But the nights are long and tough to cope
with. Too much time to think. After my workouts I was in a friend's
home or a hotel with plenty of time to think. That's why I'll come
in Thursday. I'm doing exactly what I did my first three years in
Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll always sees a silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a support group with me,'' said Driscoll. ``Five
friends took off for Cape Cod in a van last week. They'll vacation
there and be at the race. Three more are flying out. That makes
eight, and they all belong to same church I do.
</P>
<P>
   `You know, I think I have a God-given fire in my belly.''

JULIE KRONE'S LONG RIDE COMES TO AN END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice _ straight out of Munchkinland _ makes her seem like a
little girl.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be a mistaken impression. Julie Krone, 35, the
winningest female jockey of all time, is a complex personality _
one who had already left a lasting impression on her sport before
she announced her retirement last week.
</P>
<P>
   She belied her voice and her size _ 4-feet-10 1/2, 100 pounds _
with winning performances that could have her alternately playing
the role of gracious winner or female wrestler or motorcycle moll
before reverting to charming spokeswoman for her sport. Consider
two tales from her colorful career:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Image No. 1: Rough and tumble
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A journeyman jockey, Miguel Rujano, took exception to Krone's
riding tactics in an ordinary race on a weekday in 1986 at Monmouth
Park in New Jersey. They argued while on horseback and Rujano then
hit her on the head with his whip. After dismounting, Krone began
punching Rujano, who defended himself with his whip. The argument
ended in the locker room where Krone picked up a chair and hit him
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those girls who tries to act macho around the
boys,'' she told reporters later. `I'm competitive on the track and
feminine off it . . . but I'm not going to stand around and let
someone strike me like that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Image No. 2: Friend of the family
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The walking ring at Saratoga in August. With families having
picnic lunches on the grass behind the grandstand, the Saratoga
crowd is unlike most racetrack gatherings. Fathers hold up young
children to see the horses and jockeys before they head out onto
the track. The code for jockeys, of course, is to ignore the fans.
Not Krone, there's a smile for all the children, some waves, a few
hellos, and maybe even a few blown kisses.
</P>
<P>
   It was this combination of charisma and toughness that helped
make her a star in thoroughbred racing. But that couldn't have
happened had not the toughness combined with a great skill for
riding horses that made her a champion jockey at Gulfstream Park,
Monmouth Park, and the Meadowlands and made her one of the top five
jockeys in New York for a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughbred racing is a multi-tiered competition with horses,
trainers, and jockeys competing and thousands of fans betting. It
is also one of the few arenas where women can compete with men
under similar conditions. In some situations _ such as Krone's size
_ women have an advantage. So, for a time, was her ability to
communicate with the horses, to direct 1,200-pound animals to the
correct area of the track for clear running or extract extra energy
in the drive to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   She has won 3,542 races, including 277 stakes races, and in 1989
her 368 victories ranked third in the country. She was the first
female jockey to win a Triple Crown race when she rode Colonial
Affair to victory in the 1993 Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1993, she won five races in one day at Saratoga
competing against some of the best jockeys in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, however, she was injured in a horrific spill at
the top of the stretch on the Saratoga turf course. She was sent
flying in the air before smashing into the ground and having a
horse's hoof kick her in the chest. It would have killed her had
she not been wearing a protective vest.
</P>
<P>
   But the fall was bad enough. He broken leg required two plates
and 14 screws to reconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   She mended and returned, only to fall again on Jan. 13, 1995,
and break both hands. That seemed to take its toll. She mended and
returned again, but her victories dwindled and she was forced to
leave the high-powered New York racing circuit to again find
success. It did not come easily and only in small portions.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, she tried something entirely new, riding at the
Fairgrounds in New Orleans. She finished third in the rider
standings against a group of jockeys who would have a hard time
finding one mount on an August afternoon at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Successful race riding requires a combination of courage and
recklessness along with great timing. An absence of one means
mediocrity. And that's where Krone found herself in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on top, I'm 35 years old, and I don't want to do this
anymore,'' Krone said. ``I don't want to get hurt any more, and
I've got nothing left to prove. I'd go to sleep at night, and my
ankle hurt and my knee hurt and I'd think, `I just want to get this
over with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And it will be over when she rides her final race Sunday at Lone
Star Park in Texas, but her place in race history is secure. It is
one thoroughbred racing fans can see in every program at nearly
every track in the country where the jockey standings are listed:
Women are among the leaders. It's almost a given. Before Julie
Krone, it wasn't.

JIM HARRICK JR. CAUGHT IN A TRYING TEST OF LOYALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, R.I. _ Jim Harrick still coaches men's basketball at
the University of Rhode Island. He has not gone anywhere. He is
still committed to helping to make the Rams a major college power.
But he admits the past few days at the school have been some of the
most trying of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Before you think there has been another twist to one of the most
bizzare farewells in college basketball history, the Harrick
employed by URI is assistant coach Jim Jr., son of the former head
coach. Jim Harrick Sr. two weeks ago said he would take the vacant
post at Georgia, changed his mind and said he would stay at URI,
then changed again and left for Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of Jim Harrick's three son's, Jim Jr., 34, joined
his father's staff last season after stints at San Diego State,
Marshall, and Valparaiso. He considers his current job the best
he's ever had and hopes to stay in Kingston for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Yet each working day he enters the coaches' office and takes his
position between a rock and a hard place.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, there is the loyalty to the father he loved working
with, the man he figured would not depart Kingston unless a
professional job opened. He was surprised and disappointed when his
father left for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, there's his loyalty to URI, where he watched
his father go from one of the school's most popular persons to one
of its most vilified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult in the fact that they've had two
unbelievable years here, two years they've never had at this
school,'' said Jim Jr. ``They've gone to the Elite Eight and won
the Atlantic 10 championship. They've had a lot of good coaches in
this program, but they've never been places Jim Harrick took them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has their feelings hurt and their egos struck, but
people jump to conclusions and make snap reactions and they have
paralysis by analysis. They overanalyze a lot of things. To react
in a despondent way of rejecting Jim Harrick and making negative
comments about him, obviously that's personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable (that people were hurt by Harrick's
departure). My feelings are hurt. But the bottom line is that Jim
Harrick took URI to places it has never been before, and I know URI
will do well without Jim Harrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, athletic director Ron Petro said the school's
selection committee for a new basketball coach submitted six
finalists to the school's affirmative action officer and added it
will likely name Harrick's successor this week.
</P>
<P>
   Petro declined to say whether the list includes former Celtics
great Dave Cowens, URI assistant Jerry DeGregorio (who is interim
head coach), or former assistant Larry Farmer. They have been
rumored to be among the candidates for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the situation plays out, it promises to be
another intriguing offseason for URI basketball, which just last
month enjoyed one of the most thrilling moments in program history
when sophomore sensation Lamar Odom sank a trey at the buzzer to
give the Rams a 62-59 triumph over Temple for the school's first
Atlantic 10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   Last offseason, questions about Odom's eligibility made national
headlines. Two years ago, it was the hiring of Harrick that drew
major attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Harrick's departure) was disappointing, not so much that he
left, but disappointing in the way it ended, with him changing his
mind in going back to Georgia,'' said Petro, referring to the fact
that before departing Harrick did not meet with players and failed
to attend a scheduled press conference to announce his return.
</P>
<P>
   Petro, who said he hasn't spoken to Harrick since the coach
departed the second time, said he understands much of the shock and
dismay associated with the decision. ``It was a very unusual
situation. Jim had never acted like that before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was expected to be there (for the press conference)
and he wasn't it was disappointing. We had made calls to boosters
and the players were excited, and after he didn't show it was
difficult as to why he didn't tell us sooner and why he didn't call
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we really appreciated him being here for a good two
years, and as for the bad days we'll move on. We have a strong
program with good players. We just have to make a right decision on
a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   For DeGregorio, who has had head coaching stints at St. Thomas
Aquinas High School in New Britain, Conn., and Mattatuck Community
College, last week was, as he put it, surreal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and the other URI coaches have offers from Harrick to
join his Georgia staff should URI choose to go in another
direction. Jim Harrick Jr. must wait and see if Georgia will relax
its nepotism laws to allow him to work with his father again.
</P>
<P>
   But he said as of now, DeGregorio is committed to holding the
program together. Many believe the top priority is Odom, one of the
members of the selection committee, who is said to be pushing for
DeGregorio to receive the job. Many have speculated Odom might
leave for the NBA if that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Others want DeGregorio to get the job so the coaching staff can
remain in tact. Moreover, Odom is part of a close-knit New York
contingent on the team that some fear will dissolve if Odom leaves.
Then there are members of URI's exceptional recruiting class who
reportedly are also pushing for DeGregorio and inferring they might
go elsewhere if he does not get the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my responsibility is to hold it together as long as I
can,'' said DeGregorio, ``and I have confidence in the kids and
their parents that if the University of Rhode Island chooses to go
another way and hire another coach other than myself, I'm confident
these players and their parents will support the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for for Lamar, if he wants to play college basketball next
year, he has to play at the University of Rhode Island, whether I'm
here or not. His decision should not be based on what happens to
me, and I've stressed that to him.''

RECEIVING CLASS HAS DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Patriots and many other NFL teams made a huge
mistake leaving Randy Moss off their draft boards a year ago. There
is no such dilemma this year. While there are good receivers
available, such as Torry Holt, David Boston, and Troy Edwards, the
Patriots may not regret a decision to bypass any of the three with
their two first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet don't be surprised if the Patriots decide to buck their
anticipated center-running back mindset and take a receiver to give
Drew Bledsoe more weaponry and to guard against Terry Glenn
breaking their hearts again.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, from North Carolina State, appears to the prize. At 6
feet, 192 pounds, with 4.5 speed in the 40, Holt already is an
accomplished receiver who has excellent hands, can seperate from
defenders, and runs superb routes. He has a chance to be an impact
player in the right situation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Holt's size, he not only can go deep, but can catch
the ball over the middle. It doesn't appear Holt will get out of
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's Boston also has good size (6-1, 215) and displays
tremendous athleticism. He caught 74 passes for 1,330 yards and 14
touchdowns last season and possesses superb punt return skills,
making him even more of a prize. Boston needs to refine his route
running, but like the Patriots' Tony Simmons, that part of his game
will likely improve with experience.
</P>
<P>
   Some draft experts have Edwards dropping to the Patriots with
the 20th pick. The Louisiana Tech star is a smaller receiver at a
shade under 5-10 and 190 but is also prolific, as evidenced by his
102 catches, 1,707 yards, and 13 TDs last season. A former running
back, Edwards is also a kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's Peerless Price could be around in Round 2. The 5-11,
180-pounder has 4.4 speed and can be a deep threat, but his hands
need work. Syracuse's Kevin Johnson, who lost the quarterback job
to Donovan McNabb three years ago, has developed into a fine
receiver. He's 5-11, 194 pounds and is an intriguing athlete who
can do a little of everything. Equally intriguing is Northwestern's
D'Wayne Bates, another tall receiver at 6-1 1/2, 215, who already
has had to overcome several injuries but still managed 83 catches
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch are Ohio State's Dee Miller, Arizona State's
Kenny Mitchell, Auburn's Karsten Bailey, North Carolina's Na Brown,
and Kentucky's Craig Yeast.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the best year for tight ends. North Dakota's Jim
Kleinsasser, a Division 2 All-American, is the highest-rated of the
bunch at 6-2 1/2, 272. Mississippi State's Reggie Kelly and
Nebraska's Sheldon Jackson are also highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's Rufus French is considered the best receiver in
the group. At 6-4, 253, French caught 45 balls last season. He may
be more of an H-back, but could get big enough to become an
effective blocker. Georgia's Larry Brown, a 6-4 1/2, 280-pounder
who also played on the basketball team, could be a sleeper. He has
proven pass-catching ability (31 receptions) and may develop into a
good blocker.

HENDERSON GIVES THE METS REASON TO GLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for HENDERSON)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's a lock for the Hall of Fame, most likely on the
first ballot. He knows his place in baseball history is secure,
that he is the standard against which great base stealers will
forever be measured.
</P>
<P>
   So it would be inaccurate to say that life is beginning at 40
for New York Mets left fielder Rickey Henderson. But if his start
to the 1999 season is an indication, Henderson's days as a
productive leadoff man are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, in his 21st major-league season, was batting .375
with 10 runs scored through eight games, leading the Mets to the
top of the National League East with a 6-2 mark. He also led the
National League in runs, walks and extra-base hits, was second in
doubles and on-base percentage and fifth in slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for this team to get off to the start we
have, to set the tone,'' Henderson said. ``It was more important
for the team, not for Rickey, to get off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson struggled a year ago, hitting .189 in the first three
weeks of the season for Oakland. His on-base percentage through
eight games this year was .571.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Rickey gets on base is unbelievable,'' Mets pitcher
Bobby Jones said. ``You watch him sometimes, wondering how he draws
so many walks. He gets it done, but everybody has to get it done,
not just a couple guys. That's been the key for us so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson signed a one-year contract with the Mets on Dec. 13,
12 days before his 40th birthday. General manager Steve Phillips,
second-guessed for the move by skeptics in the New York media, has
so far resisted the urge to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rickey sets the stage,'' Phillips said. ``But we've been
getting good things throughout the lineup. There's a lot of guys on
this team who can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   None, though, has anything close to Henderson's credentials. He
is sixth all-time in runs scored (2,025) and third in walks behind
Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. He needs one stolen base to reach 1,300
in his career, 362 more than any other player in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a good player,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He plays the game with a lot of intensity and that's what we
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson channels that intensity into tremendous patience at
the plate. In 1998 with Oakland, he took the first pitch in nine of
every 10 plate appearances, and led the American League in both
walks (118) and stolen bases (66), the fourth time he has pulled
that double.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes with experience,'' Valentine said. ``Most
experienced hitters know their strengths and weaknesses, and like
to wait for their pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson spent parts of five seasons in New York as a Yankee
from 1985-1989, so he's used to the high expectations of New York
fans. He clearly reveled in the warm greeting the fans gave him
during Monday's home opener at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what Rickey's capable of doing and they know what he
isn't capable of either,'' Henderson said. ``I've just got to go
out and do what I've got to do.''

INGRID KRISTIANSEN SAYS 2:20 IS LONG OVERDUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The highlights are numerous.
</P>
<P>
   There were the dominating Boston wins in 1986 and 1989. There
were the four wins in the London Marathon. There was the course
record in the Houston Marathon. There was the stretch when she
became the only person to simultaneously hold world records at
5,000 meters, 10,000 meters and the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   In those mid-1980s days, the magic time of 2:20 for the marathon
seemed well within the reach of Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen.
Besides Kristiansen, Grete Waitz, also of Norway, and Joan Benoit
Samuelson of Freeport, Maine, were doing their share to push the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Kristiansen put up a 2 hour, 21 minutes and 6 seconds time in
the London Marathon in 1985, breaking Samuelson's two-year-old
record of 2:22:43. The race for 2:20 was on.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kristiansen said, someone was going to break the
2:20 barrier _ probably running closer to 2:18 _ and it might as
well be her.
</P>
<P>
   That was then.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Kristiansen took a couple of runs at 2:20, but
never quite pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has anyone else. Kristiansen's 2:21:06 in London is
still considered the women's record because most feel that the
2:20:47 that Kenyan Tegla Loroupe posted last year at Rotterdam was
not a valid record because she received too much assistance during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kristiansen remains surprised that no one has cracked
2:20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very surprised,'' she said this week from her home in Oslo.
``And I'm not sure why it has not been broken. I felt I could have
done it twice. Once in London (1987) for sure. But I got cramps in
my legs wuth 10 kilometers to go. I finished the race and won in
2:22 something, but it was so, so disappointing. With eight
kilometers to go, I was on pace for a 2:18 or 2:19.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a marathon, you have to finish the whole race for your
pace,'' she said. ``Nothing helps if you say you were good enough
and did it half the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, takes not a thing away from what Kristiansen
has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, she comes back to Boston to celebrate just one of those
many highlights. She is one of the guests invited back in what has
become a yearly ritual to honor former winners. She will be here
and plans to run Monday on the 10th anniversary of her second
Boston win.
</P>
<P>
   What a win it was. Little drama, lots of domination.
</P>
<P>
   At first, as usual, she thought of 2:20 mark or at least a shot
at her world record, but Boston that day was way too warm, pushing
70 degrees, and she settled for a win. She ran 2:24:33, 22 seconds
faster than her Boston winning time in 1986 and more than four
minutes faster than runnerup Marguerite Buist of New Zealand. Just
as impressive, only 25 men beat her that day. Samuelson, fighting
injuries, finished a gutsy ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think Ingrid is the world's best athlete, you're
kidding yourselves,'' Samuelson said that day.
</P>
<P>
   Kristiansen has been back to Boston twice since. The 100th
running in 1996 was fun and she ran a 2:39 to finish second in the
Masters division. She ran in 1991 and that was not nearly as much
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going real good for halfway and then almost broke
down,'' she said. ``I came in fifth place or something (actually
sixth in 2:29:51). The course was tough and everything was tough.
When you're used to winning the race, it's tough to come in fifth
or sixth.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, she had adjusted her approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so many years now since I really did push
training,'' she said this week. ``Now I feel I'm turning 43 (which
she did last month) and my time is over and a whole new generation
of runners is coming. The first year or two was tough. I still felt
OK, but as a runner I wasn't good enough. I tried to compete, but I
didn't make it. That was tough. In 1996, that was nice. I went into
the race just for fun. I was looking around, speaking to everyone
and running because I like it. It's easy now. I put no pressure on
myself and nobody else has any pressure on me. Then it's easy to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, said her husband, Arve, their son Gaute, 15, is the
runner in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster than his mother and his father,'' Arve said. ``But
we're very, very conservative with exposing him to competition.
It's something about having been in this running monkey business,
we are very careful about doing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaute is the oldest of the Kristiansens' three children. Ingrid
coaches with a local club and one of her runners is in the
Rotterdam Marathon this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she waits for someone to break 2:20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Elana Meyer from South Africa could do it, but now I
think maybe she is a better half marathoner,'' Kristiansen said.
``Of course, a lot of Japanese runners maybe could have done it but
they're pushing too hard. And the Kenyans maybe are running too
many races. To be a real good marathon runner you need some years
to prepare. Young girls need some years, but I don't think Kenyan
girls get all the years. They have too many races for a few years
and then they are breaking down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she heads back to the site of a couple of her
greatest triumphs, little concerned about race times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fun runner, and I mostly ski in the winter,'' she said.
``I hope to run good enough to be between 2:45 and three hours. I
have not been running too many long runs. I will try and I will
see, but the most important thing now for me is to have fun. I do
it for fun. I will be happy if I do a good race, of course, but
it's not so important anymore.''

CHRIS FARRIS'S FORTUNES HAVE TURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kris Farris doesn't understand it. How did he go from being one
of the best offensive tackles in college football last season _ the
best, if you put stock in voting for the Outland Trophy _ to
someone who is ``soft, disinterested,'' and not worth a first-round
pick in Saturday's National Football League draft?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the whole thing is absurd,'' Farris said Tuesday from
his Southern California home. ``I didn't stop being a good football
player because I did or didn't do a few things in the NFL combine.
There's no doubt in my mind that whomever drafts me is getting the
best offensive tackle in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is open for debate. If you believe the
draftniks, Farris, the former UCLA standout, is no better than the
fifth- or sixth-best tackle in a draft that is deep in offensive
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Patriots, who need to restock the offensive line,
should consider Farris, who opted to pass up his senior season
because of what former New York Giants general manager George Young
labeled the ``planet theory of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he selected a huge lineman, Young once said,
``There are only so many people on the planet that size that can
play offensive tackle in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 7 inches, 310 pounds, Farris fits that mold. But where
he doesn't fit the NFL mold is in his outlook on life outside
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to tell people,'' said Farris. ``It's
frustrating. What am I supposed to do? If I don't drool or eat raw
meat, that makes me less than a football player? I tell people,
`Look at the whole body of my work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What the NFL people are saying about Farris is that he is not
strong enough, not athletic enough. In the combine, he hurt himself
by failing to do the requisite mumber of lifts during a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' said Farris. ``I go in there and do 20 lifts
of 225 pounds and I'm not strong enough. I work out the next week
for a team and do 23 reps, which is way above normal. People just
pigeonhole you.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris has done his best to convince people. He has worked out
for the Eagles, Falcons, and Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team that has worked me out has been impressed with what
I've done,'' said Farris.
</P>
<P>
   Farris does not apologize for his interests outside of football.
He grew up in a family where sports was not a passion. As a kid, he
would take part in plays or recitals with his three sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to California from Minnesota when he was 7, Farris didn't
become passionate about football until he started playing in high
school. Even then, it started out as a slight interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even planning on playing fooball,'' said Farris.
``But the coaches just kind of told me this would be a great thing.
I didn't know what I was doing. They just pointed me in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Farris did what a smart kid with athletic ability
generally does. He got better and better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where he was when he came here and where he is now, is
unbelievable,'' said UCLA offensive line coach Mark Weber. ``You
could just see the improvement each day, each game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the knocks against him, particularly by Mel Kiper,
who is now projecting him from low second to third round, are so
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wild and it might take a while,'' Farris said
about Saturday. ``I've already prepared my parents, telling them
that they could be watching the draft for a few hours before I get
picked. But I know that when I do, I'm going to give the team that
picks me the best offensive tackle in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked where he would like to wind up, Farris gave the stock
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter,'' he said. ``But if the Patriots need
offensive lineman, I'd love to come there and get a chance to prove
that I can play.''

NEW YORK SALES TAX IS CALLED `IRRATIONAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ever wonder why Kool-Aid is taxed and Tang isn't?
What about baby diapers bearing taxes while similar items for
adults are tax-free? And what's the reason that honey-roasted
peanuts are taxed but salted peanuts are not?
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't the slightest idea,'' said Sen. Roy Goodman, a
Manhattan Republican who conducted a 2 1/2-hour hearing in the
state Senate Tuesday on the sales tax. ``It's a purely irrational
section of the law that can be changed by regulation of the tax
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Tax Commissioner Arthur Roth promised that a team from
his department will examine inconsistencies. He told a reporter
that his goal _ should he become tax commissioner _ is to be able
to tell his children that he was the one who ended such mysteries
as why consumers are taxed for ice cream cones but not for pints of
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said progress is being made, and pointed to the marshmallow
mess of last summer when small marshmallows _ previously considered
candy _ joined big marshmallows among the non-taxed groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshmallow tax is symbolic of the ... insanity of the tax law
as it now exists,'' Roth said. Indeed, candies are taxed, as are
prepared foods, even if the same products can be found elsewhere
sans taxes.
</P>
<P>
   New York was among the last states to impose a sales tax, in
1965, and the statute it enacted is perhaps the most complicated in
the nation, Roth suggested. That is largely because of the number
of exemptions _ about 115 _ on such things as textbooks, clothing,
certain food products and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The tax has grown to 4 percent from 2 percent and generates
about $7.3 billion in revenues to the state, 22 percent of the
total state tax receipts. Another $7.5 billion is collected by
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, several governors have studied and considered
reforms, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up different bottles of juice, Michael Rosen, general
counsel for the Food Industry Alliance of New York State, said
someone in state government decided to tax Hawaiian Punch and
cranberry juice because the beverages are not 70 percent natural
juices. But frozen versions of these drinks are not taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the tax policy?'' Rosen asked. ``Oranges and
pineapples are good but cranberries are bad? Frozen is good and
liquid is bad?''
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers are complaining regularly at the service windows of
supermarkets, said Janet Dow, a scan file coordinator at the
Saratoga Springs (N.Y.) Hannaford Supermarket. She said she got one
story from a state official about why Tang is the only powdered
drink not taxed: ``We were told (it was) because it was the first
food that went to the moon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax department spokesman Chris McKenna, however, said the Tang
exemption is a mystery. ``Nobody knows why,'' he said.

   STRANDED-SKATERS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Nearly every Friday after the
rink's 11:30 p.m. closing time, Skateworld general manager Rick
Corson takes on a job he doesn't want _ late-night babysitter.
Corson finds himself stuck with one or two kids, some as young as 8
years old, whose parents have dropped them off and, for whatever
reason, failed to pick them up. Often, well beyond midnight, the
children can't reach their parents by phone. ``I'm in a terrible
spot here,'' Corson said. ``Could someone please direct me what to
do?'' Police used to retrieve the stranded kids and try to contact
their parents, but now they say they will no longer perform
babysitting duties. And Montgomery County Children Services said it
had no legal authority to take the children into custody. Kettering
police have told Corson the children are no longer his legal
responsibility after the rink's posted hours have ended. ``They
told me I should turn out the lights, lock up and go home,'' he
said. ``But what about my moral obligation? It's a different world

   TEXAS-DROPOUT-SCANDAL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Austin school
district, attempting to prevent its high schools from being rated
``low-performing,'' worked hard to purge students' names from
dropout lists sent to the state, documents subpoenaed by a Travis
County grand jury show. School district administrators in 1996 and
1997 calculated exactly how many students _ of each ethnic group at
each school _ could drop out before a school would receive the
state's lowest rating, internal school district memos show. Kay
Psencik, the deputy superintendent who last week was indicted along
with the district in the test-tampering investigation, wrote a 1996
memo to area superintendents directing them to coach principals
``in strategies to improve their dropout rates.'' (Kurtz, Austin

it be music or art or science or athletics,'' said Timothy
McDonough, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, an
organization of 1,800 colleges and universities. ``Institutions are

The son of a carpenter and a maid, he couldn't go to the University
of Georgia, even though it was in his back yard, because UGA in
1958 accepted no black students. But he eventually became a dean at
Texas Tech and then spent 15 years at Michigan State, part of that
time as vice president. Now, at age of 60, Turner has turned his

   NORTHAMPTON-KIDDER (Undated) _ Northampton, a city of 30,000 in
western Massachusetts, has been raising issues of community for
more than 300 years _ charity, self-interest, tolerance and
division. They are issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th
century when Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas
Cole or described with affection by Henry James in his first novel,
``Roderick Hudson.'' They were questions raised when it hanged two
innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and when
it tried a policeman, a native son, for the rape of his own child,
during the four years Tracy Kidder spent reporting his new book,
``Home Town'' (Random House), published this month. Kidder, 53,
lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, Franny, a painter, but
considers Northampton also his home. As he proudly showed it to a
visitor recently, the city gave him a parking ticket. No place is
perfect. By William L. Hamilton.

   SUPERADOBE (Hesperia, Calif.) _ On a recent windy day in a park
in this town, Aborigines, American survivalists and members of a
rain forest action group teamed up to mix a slurry of earth, water,
sand and cement and build a museum. They pumped the mixture into
plastic sandbags that ran hundreds of feet long, then laid the
sandbags in a large coil. Later they sat together inside an
intricate brick dome, as the four aborigines sang ancient songs. A
New Age moment, you think. But what brought four men from
Australia, two avid readers of American Survival Guide (the
Magazine of Self Reliance) and Gabriel Reyes, a builder the Oasis
Preserve International in Costa Rica, to this spot was the chance
to learn how to build cheap, easy, earthquake resistant and quirky
buildings. By Frances Anderton.

   HIGH-BEDS (Undated) _ The place of repose has reached new
heights. ``One woman complained that her dog now has to get a
running start from the hallway to be able to leap on the bed,''
said Lee Sinclair, the director of marketing for Kingsdown, a North
Carolina mattress manufacturer. These days a bed can be a yard
high, with 20 inches for the plushest mattresses, plus the box
spring and an 11 inch-high frame. By Meryl Gordon.

   DESIGN-PRIZE (Undated) _ In February, I spent a few days in the
Netherlands with Peter Noever, the director of the Austrian Museum

oil tanks. But it must have been a little paradise when John

TENNIS-BALL CAR HAS 4 ON THE FLOOR AND 7,000 ON THE BODY 

</HEADLINE>
 CAR-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (with art) 
 
By SHERRY THOMAS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Michael Hewlett received an urgent, almost breathless
telephone call one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids called us from the neighbor's house and said, `There
is this really trashy car in the driveway,''' Hewlett said,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to tell this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `I think the house is being robbed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett and his wife, Paule Hewlett, looked at each other. It
could only mean one thing.
</P>
<P>
   It had arrived. The car their tennis partner had told them
about. The car they had discussed two days earlier over sushi. The
one they would (deep breath) enter in the Art Car Parade on April
17 in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we were committed,'' said Michael Hewlett, joined by his
wife and their co-conspirators: Bill Ludlam and his wife, Lynn
Jeffcoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gauntlet had been passed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was February, about eight weeks before the members of the
Westside Tennis Club set proceeded to hot-glue 7,000 tennis balls
to a 1986 Pontiac Firebird.
</P>
<P>
   They were rebels with a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've always wanted to do,'' said Paule
Hewlett, telling how she instigated the whole thing one day at
lunch. ``We had talked about it a couple of years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Michael Hewlett added. ``But that was tax time and all
the events were during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   But those facts didn't seem to matter this year.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Ludlam's Firebird, ``Brake Point,'' awash in a few
gallons of lime, industrial-strength enamel with tennis balls
covering every inch (except the windshield and headlights), will be
one of about 250 entries in this weekend's 12th annual Art Car
Parade Powered by Pennzoil, slated to kick off at 12:30 p.m. in
downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The four are the epitome of what Jennifer McKay, assistant
director of the Orange Show Foundation, which organizes the parade,
called the ``can too'' faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about this event in terms of three groups: the `have
to's,' the `want to's' and the `can too's,' spelled t-o-o,'' McKay
explained. ``The first group is the fringe, people living on the
edge. ... The `want to's' are the trained artists, who understand
the history of art but want to defy the gallery system and respond
to art. And then there are these folks _ people who glue thousands
of tennis balls to their car _ because they `can too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Art Car Parade was held in Houston 12 years ago,
the ``have to's'' have given way to the ``can too's,'' with more
than 60 percent of parade entries coming from school groups and
people like the Hewletts, Ludlam and Jeffcoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started going to the parade when the kids were really
little,'' said Paule Hewlett, a free-lance writer. ``It was just so
funky, and everybody seemed to be in the best mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jeffcoat, who works as an art teacher at Memorial Middle
School, will be riding in the parade this weekend with no concept
of what she will be in for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you're going to now,'' Paule Hewlett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's made this so easy is we didn't have anyone
ramrodding,'' said Ludlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no preconceived thing,'' his wife added.
</P>
<P>
   Ludlam said their attitude was ``let's just do the car.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say who came up with the tennis ball idea, but it
was a natural. They liked tennis. They played tennis. Getting
tennis balls would be cheap and easy (or so they thought), and
glueing them on would be a breeze (or so they thought).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first executive decision was to paint the car,'' Paule
Hewlett said. ``So Bill took a tennis ball to the paint store and
... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy matched it perfectly,'' Ludlam said as he finished her
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge was how to stick them on,'' Michael Hewlett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can tell you, shoe goo doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The foursome collected what they believed to be more tennis
balls than they'd ever need (including some scavenged from behind
the fence at a local tennis tournament) and set out one Saturday
afternoon to get sticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 45 minutes later we were done,'' Paule Hewlett said.
``It covered the spoiler.''
</P>
<P>
   They quickly put the word out: Need tennis balls. Need tennis
balls fast. Then one day, they got a call from a friend who said,
``The pro down at Lakeside has got a million tennis balls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' they said. ``We'll be right over.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, they took ``Brake Point'' out for a spin,
cruising down the neighborhood cul de sac (dropping a few tennis
balls along the way) and tossing the lime green beauties to
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much fun,'' said Ludlam. ``It felt like Mardi
Gras.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brake Point'' is just one of several new art cars to be
unveiled this weekend. Others include Susan Poole's ``Bruiser
Mower,'' a hot rod riding lawn mower, and Theresa Keefe's
work-in-progress, ``Pray Wheel,'' a Honda painted with large
black-and-white spirals overlaid with text from a wide variety of
creation stories, philosophies and religions.

FESTIVAL OFFERS A TASTE OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN FOOD 

</HEADLINE>
 FOOD-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANN CRISWELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Houston International Festival will offer many
Houstonians their first tastes of biltong (jerkylike air-dried meat
strips), bobotie (South African-style meatloaf), boerewors
(farmer's sausage) and other authentic foods from southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This year's downtown festival, the 28th, takes place April 17-18
and April 24-25, and will honor 12 southern African countries, said
Cynthia Shepard Perry, chairwoman of the Houston Festival
Foundation Inc. and former ambassador to two African nations _
Sierra Leone and Burundi. She lived in Africa 18 years and sampled
foods all over the continent, visiting 35-40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The honor countries are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Foods from Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Continental, Southwestern,
Creole, Cajun and Caribbean menus will be featured, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Africa is a ``continent of cuisines,'' Jessica B. Harris wrote
in ``The Africa Cookbook: Tastes of a Continent'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25). Its many cuisines have been influenced by France
(French Huguenots), England, the Netherlands, India and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, particularly Cape Town, offers some of the most
sophisticated cuisine in Africa, but the ethnic cuisines have
remained separate until recently because of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that people are talking to each other, they're becoming
more aware,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four concurrent culinary trends in South Africa _
Black African, Indian, Cape Malay (in Cape Town) and Dutch _ with
`pockets' of French and British,'' she said. Mozambique is known
for spicy foods, although dishes of many areas are bland. Indian
food has been in South Africa for many years; remember that Mahatma
Gandhi was in South Africa before he went to India.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest impression was how wonderful the food is,'' Harris
said. ``Cape Malay food was becoming more popular when I was in
Cape Town in 1996. Cape Malay food is very complex and to the
American palate, particularly the sophisticated palate, is more
interesting (than many African cuisines).''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Malay is Muslim, so there are Islamic influences. Harris
defines Cape Malay cuisine as ``a harmonious mixture of Dutch food
and slave spicing.'' The Cape Malay are a ``creolized'' mixture of
peoples from Malaysia, Madagascar, and northern and western Africa,
as well as indigenous Khoi and San people, who were the original
inhabitants of South Africa, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts come from varied traditions, and there are many fruit
desserts, depending on the region and time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every area has a ``mealie'' (cornmeal) dish, Perry said.
Africans don't use the word corn; they have mealie, which when
ground is called mealie meal. Dried corn is maize; hominy is called
samp. Mealie pap is a porridge made from cornmeal; it resembles
grits or polenta but is firmer. There are lots of plantains and
lots of nuts, especially cashews, and rice and other grains.
</P>
<P>
   Staples include yams (not sweet potatoes), fufu (dumplings of
pounded yams), cassava (yuca), beans, cabbage, and other fresh
vegetables and fruits.
</P>
<P>
   Meat is popular, too. Combinations of meat (pork, beef and
chicken) are favored over single varieties for stews, Perry said.
Africans eat a lot of exotic meats, such as ostrich. Ostrich eggs
and omelets hardly raise an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing and grilling are common. Braai (barbecue that is
cooked on a grill over coals, but not smoked) is as popular in
South Africa as Texas barbecue is here, said Ettienne Leibman,a
native of South Africa and co-owner of Leibman's Wine &AMP; Fine Foods.
The usual accompaniment to braai is mealie meal with a traditional
tomato-onion sauce, along with a chutney and Worcestershire sauce.
Mealie meal is stirred with a special tool until it is thicker than
mashed potatoes. The tool resembles a primitive whisk or a dowel
rod with looped wires on one end.
</P>
<P>
   Leibman makes her own boerewors sausage and usually stocks
biltong and other South African specialties at her shop. Bobotie is
a popular entree at catered parties and South African wine
tastings. Sausage rolls and meat pies _ chicken, steak, steak and
mushroom, or steak and kidney pie _ are traditional South African
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Africans could no more do without meat pies than
Americans could do without McDonald's,'' Leibman said.
</P>
<P>
   Afrikaaners are members of the ``White Nation,'' which speaks
English and Afrikaans. The first white settlers in what became
South Africa were Dutch and were known as Afrikaaners.
</P>
<P>
   In the home of the Afrikaaner, hospitality means lots of food,
said Clive Berkman of Clive's, a Houston restaurant. Berkman is a
native of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The table would be set with a white cloth and centered with a
huge bowl of fruit, along with cruets of vinegar and Worcestershire
sauce. Silverware and china, probably from England, are used.
Dinner might start with a hearty soup or fish and appetizer of
biltong or rock lobster tails. The entree often is Tomato or Green
Bean Bredie, stew made with a thick rib of mutton or lamb cooked
with tomatoes, potatoes and string beans.
</P>
<P>
   A hostess would probably serve hot sosaties, the South African
version of brochettes, accompanied by crisp biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   When a South African really wants to treat friends, the host
serves his or her special version of chicken pie, made with
chicken, ham or bacon, and hard-cooked eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts would be fruit and cookies, or perhaps a rich pudding
or cake, served with African coffee or English tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be handed a tall glass of cool mechow, a drink made
from cornmeal, prepared as a thin gruel and allowed to ferment with
a little sugar. It stands for two or three days, then is stirred
until smooth,'' Berkman said.
</P>
<P>
   Should you be invited to visit the circular huts in the kraals
(native towns) of any of the Bantu tribes as an honored guest, you
would be accorded the same hospitality as in all of Africa, he
said. Large earthenware pots of food would be spread on mats on the
floor. The menu would probably consist of putu, the thick mealie
porridge topped with a hot spicy stew and served with homemade
beer.

<P>
   __ SHANDY GAFF
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Africa Cookbook'' by Jessica Harris (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25). The popularity of this thirst-quenching drink has
spread throughout English-speaking Africa, Harris writes. ``I had
my first taste of shandy in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1970s. ... It's
a perfect beverage when you want the taste but not the potency of a
cold beer. You can personalize the shandy with a dash of a liqueur
like Grand Marnier.''

   _ 1 quart each: pilsner beer and ginger beer (ginger ale)
</P>

CLINTON'S CONTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slicing through the various interpretations that can be put on
the two court decisions from Little Rock, Ark., on Monday is the
central lesson, which is neither mixed nor murky: Do not lie.
Especially, do not lie under oath and when directed to answer by a
federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton did lie in a deposition in January of last
year, and then he turned right around and lied to the American
people. The second lie was a betrayal of the voters who elected
him. The first was an insult to the law he is sworn to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan Webber Wright was justified in finding him in civil
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the case continue to be troubling, but the
mistake should not be made of apportioning responsibility as if the
whole episode were a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is responsible for a monumental miscalculation
in allowing the Paula Jones civil suit to go forward while Clinton
was in the White House. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, is
responsible for an investigation that has been excessively
prosecutorial, as demonstrated by Monday's acquittal of Susan
McDougal on charges that her refusal to give Starr testimony
amounted to an obstruction of justice. The House is responsible for
voting impeachment when on balance Clinton's misdeeds might have
been handled better in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of this in any way mitigates the obligation of
Clinton, who is 100 percent responsible for telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Too often in his presidency Clinton has given fudged or
legalized or outright false answers. His repeated attempts to
characterize his deposition as legally accurate based on a
contorted definition of sexual relations mock common sense. And, as
Judge Wright found, his sworn assertions that he couldn't remember
being alone with Monica Lewinsky are laughable.
</P>
<P>
   As a lawyer and former state attorney general, Clinton's sworn
lies are especially reprehensible and worthy of disbarment. He
could still be indicted after he leaves office. Clinton has wasted
the sixth year of his presidency and cast a cloud over the last
two. For this he is responsible.

NEWSPAPER EDITORS ARE TOLD THEY ARE DINOSAURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You're dinosaurs. But it's not all your fault.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Intel Chairman Andy Grove delivered to a
crowd of newspapers editors gathered here for the American Society
of Newspaper Editors convention.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, said the co-founder of the sixth most profitable
company in the nation, are waging a nearly unwinnable contest for
readers who can slake their thirst for breaking news in other
media, including the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers may be able to recapture readers by concentrating
on ``interpretative'' reporting that portrays the context in which
a news story occurs, Grove added.
</P>
<P>
   Providing context, he said, is the job of those gathered to hear
him speak. ``That's what editors are supposed to be doing,'' Grove
said. ``I don't think you are doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove was quick to add that newspaper publishers, who are
cutting newsroom costs to save a dwindling bottom line, shoulder
the blame for readership decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't save yourself out of it,'' Grove said, describing
his prescription for the newspaper industry malaise. ``You (have
to) invest out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The current newspaper industry has ``run its course,'' a process
fueled by competition from the World Wide Web, he said, adding that
the demise has been a process of stealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will know (about a business crisis) when it's almost too
late,'' Grove told the editors. He compared the newspaper
industry's continuing readership and advertiser decline to Intel's
near ruination in the '80s when intense competition gutted the
company's memory chip business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Intel's losses in that market equaled the cumulative
profits the company had made in its previous 15 years of operation.
Intel, under Grove's hand, cleaved off that business, redirecting
all its efforts into the computer processing chip business.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe a look into the abyss will encourage newspaper
publishers to beef up newsrooms and give the readers a depth of
coverage needed to compete with electronic media, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sight of gallows sharpens the mind,'' Grove observed.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel chairman had some encouraging words for modern-day
business journalists, saying they are much more knowledgeable about
complex high-tech issues than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be bad in the '80s,'' he said, but today's
high-tech reporter is a ``journalist who knows stuff about your
business that you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was met with praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to hear worse-case scenarios,'' said Sidney
Goldberg, senior vice president and general manager of the New York
newspaper syndication company United Media. ``It's like a shot in
the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality, depth. Those are the things that matter,'' said
Everett Mitchell II, executive editor of the Salem, Ore., Statesman
Journal. ``Mr. Grove is in touch with what readers want.''

MAKING CHINA A PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No single country will be more crucial to US interests in the
coming century than China, so it is folly to pretend that there is
any realistic alternative to a policy of engagement with Beijing.
Indeed, both the government on Taiwan and His Holiness the Dalai
Lama support some form of American engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
   The central question concerning Beijing has nothing to do with
the protectionist fantasy of banning Chinese goods or the Cold War
fantasy of containing a Chinese Communist threat. In the real world
US leaders have little choice but to mold US-Chinese relations in
ways that are best suited to promote Asian security, nuclear
nonproliferation, and the vitality of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   China's Prime Minister Zhu Rongji &UR;  &LR; has made it clear that his
portfolio is largely confined to economic matters, but within that
sphere he represents a type of Chinese leader who would have been
unimaginable during the Maoist era. He eschews the rhetoric of the
commissars in favor of the free-market pragmatism of his favorite
American interlocutors, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the
Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu may not be able to satisfy American calls for democracy and
human rights in China _ the ultimate modernization _ but his
determination to phase out subsidized state-owned enterprises is
consonant with Greenspanian precepts, as is his ardor to clean up
China's debt-laden state banks.
</P>
<P>
   The more successful Zhu is in managing the perilous transition
of the Chinese economy, the brighter prospects will be for the rest
of Asia and the global economy. The Clinton administration and its
Republican critics should transcend partisan politics and support
China's accession to the World Trade Organization, a development
sure to benefit America's own economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   The path to a strategic partnership with China is open. If it is
bungled, Washington could transform an aspiring partner into a
dangerous rival.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM MACEDONIA: FOR ONE KOSOVAR FAMILY, FREEDOM AT A
HORRIBLE PRICE
 &HT;    With Photo; Photo mug of Holmes.
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEPROSTINO, Macedonia _ He sat atop a cot inside a dusky army
tent, clinging to his three small children as though he would never
let go, dragging on a cigarette as though it could have been his
last.
</P>
<P>
   A simple farmer who arrived on foot Tuesday from Kosovo, he was
safe from the Serbs. He was warm, dry and cared for in a refugee
camp run with precision and prosperity by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But Haziz Shaqiri(CQ) could not speak. He could only weep, for
he and his family were forced to make a tragic choice and pay a
horrible price to escape Kosovo's violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Shaqiri, 41, left Kosovo as a husband and father of seven; he
arrived in Macedonia a widower and father of five. Two of his
children are dead; the rest are now motherless.
</P>
<P>
   His 33-year-old wife Sevdije, a son named Ferid, 17, and a tiny
daughter, Vlora, 5, did not perish in a hail of Serb bullets or
burn when their house was pulverized. They had successfully evaded
Serb forces for two weeks when they succumbed to nature. They froze
to death in a snowstorm Saturday night while trying to follow a
mountain pass to safety in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the world has had a monopoly on mass misery and
suffering in the last few weeks, with nearly 1 million ethnic
Albanians of Kosovo on the move because of a grinding campaign of
ethnic cleansing by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   The massive scale of the tragedy is embedded with heartbreaking
personal stories like the one played out by Shaqiri and his family
over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The family ran from ``one risk into another risk, away from
bullets into a natural disaster,'' said refugee Zebibe Imeri, 25,
who days earlier had taken the same mountain path to flee the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Forced from their small village of Bitij in southern Kosovo two
weeks ago, the family managed to avoid Serb patrols by taking
shelter in nearby villages and hiding in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past weekend, they worked their way with about 25 other
villagers to a remote mountain path which crosses the snow-capped
peak of Ljuboten, at 2,499 meters one of the highest summits in the
Shar mountains that form the natural border between Yugoslavia to
the north, and Macedonia to the south.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of weather it is a 24-hour hike across the mountain.
Their timing could not have been worse. Clouds settled in Saturday
night and a snowstorm began to rage. Family members became
separated. The icy winds were so intense, some could not go on.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, Shaqiri's wife and teenaged son were lifeless
in the snow on the Kosovo side of the border. Shaqiri managed to
drag their bodies down the mountain to the nearby village of Brod,
where he buried them Monday in unmarked graves.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Shaqiri set off over the mountain, only to reunite
Tuesday morning with the rest of his family at a refugee camp in
Macedonia. There, he discovered that his 5-year-old girl also was
dead.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the storm, a fellow refugee had offered to carry
the little girl, Vlora, on his shoulders. Only after they had
reached the Macedonian side of the border did the refugees realize
that Vlora had frozen to death atop his shoulders. The girl, and an
unrelated woman who also died in the cold, were buried Monday in
the Macedonian town of Tetovo.
</P>
<P>
   The events above were described by relatives, including
Shaqiri's older brother, Muharem, who made the fatal trek with the
group and wept uncontrollably as he told two reporters what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome with shock and raw grief, Shaqiri could not speak, nor
did we ask him to.
</P>
<P>
   His now-oldest child, 14-year-old Vahid, sat on a separate cot
and sobbed, hiding his face from the crowd inside the tent. A
daughter, 9-year-old Shiqipe was being treated for frostbite by
German doctors in a hospital tent at the camp. The three other
children, including two-year-old Arlinda, were clinging to their
father and watching the adults around them cry.
</P>
<P>
   I asked our ethnic Albanian translator, tears streaming down her
face as she heard the story, to whisper to Shaqiri our condolences
for his losses. I asked her to add that we would tell his story to
Americans so that they could understand his personal tragedy and
the predicament of his people.
</P>
<P>
   He never broke his vacant stare, but slowly nodded in
acknowledgement. He wanted his story known, his brother told us,
but simply could not tell it.

TECHNOLOGY LEADER HAS ADVICE FOR AMERICA'S NEWSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The chairman of one of America's most successful
technology companies told newspaper publishers and editors that
they must invest in their news operations if they are to survive
the crush of information available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are waging a contest for readers who can quench their
thirst for breaking news in other media, Andy Grove, the chairman
of the Intel Corp., told the American Society of Newspaper Editors
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But newspapers may be able to recapture readers by concentrating
on ``interpretative'' reporting that portrays the context in which
a news story occurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what editors are supposed to be doing,'' Grove said.
``I don't think you are doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove, whose company produces the microchips that run computers,
was quick to add that publishers, who have cut newsroom costs to
boost profits, shoulder the blame for readership decline. He
encouraged publishers to invest in their news operations and give
the readers a depth of coverage needed to compete with electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
   While newspaper circulations declined for years, readership has
stabilized and even grown in some markets. But most newspaper
companies also are investing in Internet sites to complement their
print editions and reach out to younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Grove's message drew support from some of the audience of
editors meeting this week in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality, depth. Those are the things that matter,'' said
Everett Mitchell II, executive editor of the Salem (Ore.) Statesman
Journal. ``Mr. Grove is in touch with what readers want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to hear worse-case scenarios,'' said Sidney
Goldberg, senior vice president and general manager of the New York
newspaper syndication company United Media. ``It's like a shot in
the arm.''

NOTARO: FILE TAXES UNDER `S,' FOR SERIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's one thing that I know for sure: There's nothing
funny about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14 of last year, I passed a ``tax assistance center''
on my way to get a Subway sandwich in a strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   Through the huge, clear panes of window glass, I saw the
horrible vision of a world in limbo. Patrons sat in chairs against
the walls, waiting for their turn at assault, their jowls drooping,
their shoulders hunched as they clutched their pithy W-4s as the
clock above them ticked, ticked, ticked.
</P>
<P>
   The ones already being helped weren't in any better condition;
the life had been sucked out of their features, the vibrancy washed
from their skin, and, in return, a thin film of perspiration
covered their entire body. They sat quietly, watching dust float
through the air with dead eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax ``helpers'' weren't a much-improved lot, looking as if
they had been recruited from the bus terminal the night before,
their qualifications confirmed when it was proven they could count
to 10 and, combining left and right hands, had a minimum of five
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   No one made a sound. Somewhere, quietly, I heard the floating
notes from the soundtrack of ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   As I walked into Subway, I realized that my appetite was gone,
although, honestly, it wasn't helped much when I saw the
acne-afflicted Subway teen scratch at his crotch and then manhandle
a wheat roll.
</P>
<P>
   Gloves, I reminded myself, are no substitution for radiation,
and, as I left the scene, I passed by the tax assistance center
once more as paramedics tried to revive a man who had foolishly
chosen 10 percent withholding, as a little girl in a red coat
looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you have to learn the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   My accountant, Lee, has seen me at my ugliest, even more so than
my gynecologist. He's done my taxes for the last decade, and did
them for the first year my husband and I were married.
</P>
<P>
   As a newly responsible married person, I proudly presented my
very organized stack of tax records to him, and he punched away on
his calculator until he suddenly stopped. He explained slowly that
now that I was married and filing jointly, it would be a wise idea
for my husband and me to consult each other about how many
allowances we each took, since combined it appeared as if we were
supporting a small Mormon settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And the government wouldn't believe that, he added.
</P>
<P>
   I laughed about it, mentioned my two dogs and my cat and the
fact that we ``had a lot of hungry friends,'' but Lee didn't laugh
back. Taxes were serious stuff. He went back to punching in numbers
on the calculator and, when he finished, he looked up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``$2,500 is what I come up with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' I said in amazement. ``That's what being married does
for you, huh? I had no idea! I would have gotten married before we
had sex if I knew it would save us that much!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a refund,'' he said, looking at me. ``That's what
you (betgin ital) owe.''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what about my deductions?'' I cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, surprisingly,'' he started, ``a book of stamps and a
pack of paper didn't carry you too far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait!'' I said, flipping through my wallet to find a receipt.
``I bought pens, too!''
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on,'' he advised me, ``don't count your dogs, the
birds that peck at your grass, your cat, any imaginary friends,
split personalities, alter egos or insects that reside inside your
house as dependents. Because they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help it. I cried. Just put my head in my hands and
cried. Then I had to swallow my own throw-up. No doubt Lee had seen
this sort of tax behavior before from a new bride who was just too
shell shocked to be humiliated, but he looked away just the same.
</P>
<P>
   It was that day when I found out how easy it was to get in big
trouble with the IRS. Going to jail for tax evasion is probably the
dumbest thing in the world you could go to jail for, but people do
it all the time. Imagine eating bologna sandwiches and going potty
out in the wide open for years on end just because you were bad at
math.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I got prepared. I watched the ``Today'' show every
day and listened when Matt Lauer told me I was eligible for several
significant tax credits. I wrote them down and saved enough
receipts to fuel Lindbergh's ticker-tape parade. Taxes, I had
learned, were serious stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I had also been practicing with my husband, who, in the role of
Lee and I as myself, would act out the tragedy we named ``Taxes 98:
A Melodrama,'' just to be really ready when the day of reckoning
came:
</P>
<P>
   Laurie (as myself): ``Here you go, Lee.'' (Hands Lee a stack of
imaginary papers.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee (my husband): (Looks through imaginary papers.) ``Oh, boy.
This doesn't look good. You're in very big trouble, like bologna
sandwich and open-potty trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie: ``How much do we owe?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee: (Shakes his head.) ``More than you'll ever make in a
lifetime. You could sell every egg in your ovaries and still not
have enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie: ``What should we do? What are our options?''
</P>
<P>
   Lee: (Opens an imaginary cabinet, displaying a Colt .45, a noose
and a saber.) ``I'll let you use the noose in the office, but
everything else you can take outside. I'm not a janitor, you know.
I've got a thing about body fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie: ``There must be another way! There must be!''
</P>
<P>
   Lee: (Quietly leans over and opens the palm of his hand, which
displays a package of airline peanuts from his last vacation.)
``Are you allergic?''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie: (Gasps.) ``God forgive me!'' (Bites on the knuckle of
her forefinger, turns away and closes her eyes. Lights fade.)
</P>
<P>
   When I finally went to Lee's office and sat in the chair across
from him, my courage in a neat little ball in my lap, he ran down
the list of my potential tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have to be a practicing witch for that one,'' he said as he
sliced across the entry with his pen. ``Have to have ridden a
donkey to the bottom of the Grand Canyon within the last 12 months
for this one. And must have eaten a hot dog at a ballpark and
become violently ill for that one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo!'' I said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you choke on a portion of the hot dog and lose
consciousness at any point?'' he added, looking above his glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said sorrowfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you only qualify for a partial deduction,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much do I owe?'' I asked, wincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you didn't cast any spells in all of 1998?'' he
asked. ``Because if you did, I can get you to break even.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voodoo?'' I asked. ``I made a little doll of a guy at Subway
and sewed his hands to his shirt!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a winner,'' he said as he winked. I winked back.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes. Serious stuff. &QL;

also good for the bottom line. The author, a professor of
physiology and an avid bird-watcher, makes his 17th visit to New

the oil fields. What makes it possible for this big, shy,
ostrichlike bird _ rarely found anywhere near the disturbances
people create _ to survive alongside the country's largest

<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade
structures?
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, I birded every day through the rain forest
that led all the way down to the sea along the pipeline. Hundreds
of feet above the road and the nearby Kikori flowed another river _
of birds in the sky. Near the oil camps and gas flares ventured not
only cassowaries and harpy eagles but every single one of the other
large, threatened bird species of the New Guinea lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fauna throughout the oil lease zone remains pristine because
the partnership keeps a tight rein on employees' activities.
Prohibitions on hunting, exporting animals and plants, collecting
any living thing, making gardens and cutting down trees minimizes
forest disturbance. The partnership also rigorously controls the
number of people who can come here, requiring company authorization
to arrive by plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the partnership so strict _ how were these rules
connected to making money? A bird-watching Chevron executive
offered one answer: ``Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the North Sea oil
rig'' _ notorious industrial disasters that cost Union Carbide,
Exxon and Shell Oil billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has cause to worry about its activities in New
Guinea. Chevron learned its lesson the hard way when it cleared a
small summit on Mount Sisa for a helipad, intending to erect a
radio relay station there. As soon as Huli tribesmen living around
the base of the mountain saw helicopters hovering there, they began
climbing. On reaching the helipad, they introduced themselves and
announced their claim, demanding huge compensation for trespassing,
cutting trees and disturbing birds. Local Samberigi tribesmen later
hijacked chartered helicopters to enforce their demands. Faced with
lawsuits and bills for damages, Chevron abandoned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations reinforced the partnership's desire to
keep environmental disturbances to a minimum. Local landowners also
get royalties on the oil pumped. The fees are a major source of
income for clans in the area. The partnership builds schools,
hospitals, roads and other public works at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   What I have witnessed along the Kikori has changed my mind about
the inevitability of environmental disaster when oil is pumped out
of the ground. But I worry about the other rivers I saw there,
rivers in the sky streaming constantly above me _ of birds, bats,
insects, spiders, seeds and pollen blown in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher, I was especially struck by the importance of
three components of the rivers. Most conspicuous were birds leaving
their roots daily to forage, or moving their roosts to track
seasonally shifting food supplies. Second were birds that hatch as
nestlings at one altitude, fly as juveniles to spend their early
years at some other altitude, then return as adults to build their
own nests and breed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining bird movements were of individuals that disperse
only once in a lifetime, leaving their nest sites in search of new
breeding grounds. These movements are essential for maintaining
populations in habitats so small that they can support only one or
a few breeding pairs. For instance, I found a population of a high
altitude species otherwise missing in the conservation area _ the
superb bird of paradise. The population was just one adult male and
one female.
</P>
<P>
   All these movements of birds mean that a policy of landscape
management preserving only isolated pieces of natural habitat is
doomed to fail. The plant and animal populations in isolated
patches risk gradually going extinct unless a sea of natural
habitat surrounds and supports them. Instead, whole landscapes must
be preserved and managed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a model that may work: The oil partnership lease area
along the Kikori. It is the largest area of land rigidly controlled
and managed as an integrated entity in the country. Although the
reasons have to do with oil, not conservation, the requirements for
managing long subterranean oil pipelines have turned out to
coincide with the requirements for managing long aerial pipelines
of life.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TIME TO STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES AS FAST AS THEY GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the world's forest is being logged at such a
breakneck pace that almost all the remaining tropical rain forests
in the world will be destroyed within 50 years. In some countries,
such as the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, they'll be gone
within a decade. Most logging operations are nonsustainable _ trees
are cut faster than they can regrow.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to halt the juggernaut? One solution is a
benign cutting schedule, called eco-forestry, that attempts to
harvest trees no faster than new ones can grow to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because an increasing fraction of the buying public _ especially
in North America and Europe _ would prefer to buy responsibly
harvested timber products, logging companies increasingly label
their operations as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   To certify such claims, a coalition of environmental groups,
indigenous peoples' groups and other interests have set up the
Forest Stewardship Council. Logging projects have now been
certified in 20 countries, and public response is so favorable that
the demand for certified timber products exceeds the supply.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>

   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>

   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,

CLINTON GETS PUNISHMENT DUE TO HIM  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE APRIL 14 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is the perfect epilogue to a sorry burlesque. Just
as the cheating husband tries to sneak up the stairs to bed, the
long-suffering wife knocks him upside the head with a rolling pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody deserved a figurative clobbering at the hands of justice
more than Bill ``Tom Cat'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Lady Justice _ played by Judge Susan Webber
Wright _ delivered the well-placed blow with her contempt citation
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The injured party in Bad Bill's naughty escapades was never
Hillary. She knew her knave, accepted his flaws and rode his fame
to power.
</P>
<P>
   The real cuckold was our sense of fairness _ not to mention the
office of the presidency and the confidence Americans naively place
in its occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Past presidents who conducted themselves with dignity and
contemporary Americans who demand integrity were deeply wounded by
Clinton's behavior. Only late-night comedians, columnists and
political cartoonists benefited from the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can all laugh with a little less cynicism as the errant
husband gets his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's action was the first formal finding of wrongdoing in
the Monica Lewinsky debacle. It may calm the spinning of long dead
American presidents who saw the office as something more than a
sexual playhouse. It should ease the minds of Americans who
wondered if there were any standards anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Wright called Clinton's lie, a lie. And she said even the
president of the United States is not allowed to do that under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Some hoped that message would come through Kenneth Starr's
extremely long and expensive investigation. Some hoped it would
come in a Senate conviction of an impeached Clinton. But both those
procedures were tainted by charges that they were politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's rolling pin wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wright deftly addressed the motives of both Clinton and
those who brought the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit in
which the president lied. She wrote: ``It simply is not acceptable
to employ deceptions and falsehoods in an attempt to obstruct the
judicial process, understandable as his aggravation with the
plaintiff's lawsuit may have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply not acceptable. That about says it.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about time. &QL;

<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade
structures?
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, I birded every day through the rain forest
that led all the way down to the sea along the pipeline. Hundreds
of feet above the road and the nearby Kikori flowed another river _
of birds in the sky. Near the oil camps and gas flares ventured not
only cassowaries and harpy eagles but every single one of the other
large, threatened bird species of the New Guinea lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fauna throughout the oil lease zone remains pristine because
the partnership keeps a tight rein on employees' activities.
Prohibitions on hunting, exporting animals and plants, collecting
any living thing, making gardens and cutting down trees minimizes
forest disturbance. The partnership also rigorously controls the
number of people who can come here, requiring company authorization
to arrive by plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the partnership so strict _ how were these rules
connected to making money? A bird-watching Chevron executive
offered one answer: ``Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the North Sea oil
rig'' _ notorious industrial disasters that cost Union Carbide,
Exxon and Shell Oil billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has cause to worry about its activities in New
Guinea. Chevron learned its lesson the hard way when it cleared a
small summit on Mount Sisa for a helipad, intending to erect a
radio relay station there. As soon as Huli tribesmen living around
the base of the mountain saw helicopters hovering there, they began
climbing. On reaching the helipad, they introduced themselves and
announced their claim, demanding huge compensation for trespassing,
cutting trees and disturbing birds. Local Samberigi tribesmen later
hijacked chartered helicopters to enforce their demands. Faced with
lawsuits and bills for damages, Chevron abandoned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations reinforced the partnership's desire to
keep environmental disturbances to a minimum. Local landowners also
get royalties on the oil pumped. The fees are a major source of
income for clans in the area. The partnership builds schools,
hospitals, roads and other public works at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   What I have witnessed along the Kikori has changed my mind about
the inevitability of environmental disaster when oil is pumped out
of the ground. But I worry about the other rivers I saw there,
rivers in the sky streaming constantly above me _ of birds, bats,
insects, spiders, seeds and pollen blown in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher, I was especially struck by the importance of
three components of the rivers. Most conspicuous were birds leaving
their roots daily to forage, or moving their roosts to track
seasonally shifting food supplies. Second were birds that hatch as
nestlings at one altitude, fly as juveniles to spend their early
years at some other altitude, then return as adults to build their
own nests and breed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining bird movements were of individuals that disperse
only once in a lifetime, leaving their nest sites in search of new
breeding grounds. These movements are essential for maintaining
populations in habitats so small that they can support only one or
a few breeding pairs. For instance, I found a population of a high
altitude species otherwise missing in the conservation area _ the
superb bird of paradise. The population was just one adult male and
one female.
</P>
<P>
   All these movements of birds mean that a policy of landscape
management preserving only isolated pieces of natural habitat is
doomed to fail. The plant and animal populations in isolated
patches risk gradually going extinct unless a sea of natural
habitat surrounds and supports them. Instead, whole landscapes must
be preserved and managed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a model that may work: The oil partnership lease area
along the Kikori. It is the largest area of land rigidly controlled
and managed as an integrated entity in the country. Although the
reasons have to do with oil, not conservation, the requirements for
managing long subterranean oil pipelines have turned out to
coincide with the requirements for managing long aerial pipelines
of life.
</P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: TIME TO STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES AS FAST AS THEY GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the world's forest is being logged at such a
breakneck pace that almost all the remaining tropical rain forests
in the world will be destroyed within 50 years. In some countries,
such as the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, they'll be gone
within a decade. Most logging operations are nonsustainable _ trees
are cut faster than they can regrow.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to halt the juggernaut? One solution is a
benign cutting schedule, called eco-forestry, that attempts to
harvest trees no faster than new ones can grow to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because an increasing fraction of the buying public _ especially
in North America and Europe _ would prefer to buy responsibly
harvested timber products, logging companies increasingly label
their operations as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   To certify such claims, a coalition of environmental groups,
indigenous peoples' groups and other interests have set up the
Forest Stewardship Council. Logging projects have now been
certified in 20 countries, and public response is so favorable that
the demand for certified timber products exceeds the supply.

<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade

<P>
   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

DO THE DEAD HAVE PCS IN HEAVEN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Some days you just never know what you'll find in the
old e-mail bag.
</P>
<P>
   Take last Friday, for example. There in my e-mail box was a
message from Harold Temmer asking, essentially, whether it was
possible for a dead man to use Temmer's computer to communicate
with the living.
</P>
<P>
   You read that right. I'm not making it up.
</P>
<P>
   Temmer, a long-time Sun City West, Ariz., resident, knows that
sounds crazy, but he's having trouble arriving at another
explanation for the funny thing that happened a couple weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when Temmer sat down at his PC and called up a
letter his wife had written to friends in Flagstaff. The letter was
written in January using an old DOS version of WordPerfect.
</P>
<P>
   Temmer printed the letter out and noticed that the name and
address of a Sun City man appeared at the end, as if this unknown
man had written the letter himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Temmer said. ``At the close of the letter,
instead of my wife's name, there was neatly typed the name and
address of a complete stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Temmer's wife doesn't remember seeing the name and address the
first time she printed the letter out, signed it and mailed it to
Flagstaff. (The Temmers are in the process of contacting the
recipients of the letter to see whether the strange name was at the
bottom.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not unheard of for people to find that their computers
contain personal information about strangers. Stores have been
known to resell used computers without first wiping hard drives
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But that explanation doesn't appear to apply in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Temmer swears that he bought his computer brand new about six
years ago, and that all the software he uses was purchased new.
</P>
<P>
   He also claims that nobody besides his wife uses the machine,
that his online use is limited to about an hour a week and that his
electronic address book contains only a handful of entries _ all
people or companies he communicates with.
</P>
<P>
   As if it wasn't weird enough that a stranger's name and address
appeared at the bottom of his wife's letter, Temmer soon learned
that the stranger has been dead for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up the Sun City address and called,'' Temmer said.
``I reached (the stranger's) wife. I explained why I called and
asked to speak to her husband. She told me that her husband had
died 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Temmer added, ``She said she doesn't own, and has never
owned, a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Anybody besides me starting to hear the Twilight Zone''
theme song?
</P>
<P>
   Temmer, a retired assistant vice chancellor with the University
of California-San Diego, is baffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't accept that a hacker penetrated my DOS program to type
the name and address,'' he said. ``So is my computer haunted, or
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm at a loss to explain this, too. My brain tells me
that there has to be a logical explanation, that, somehow, Temmer
is forgetting a crucial fact that would clear everything up.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, you might be yelling, ``Hey! This guy might
have made the whole thing up!''
</P>
<P>
   I know that's possible. But even though Temmer admits he has no
way to prove all this really happened, I'm willing to take him at
his word _ if for no other reason than it's fun to try and figure
out how this might have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Temmer swears that he's never heard of the Sun City man, whose
identity I'm not publishing because the whole episode has upset his
widow. But, according to ``The Arizona Republic's'' obituaries, a
Sun City man with the same name did pass away in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   All this reminds me of a story I wrote for ``The Republic'' on
Oct. 30, 1995. The story dealt with ``instrumental
transcommunication,'' or ITC, in which people claim to have
communicated with the dead _ and vice versa _ using computers,
televisions, telephones, tape recorders and other gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds strange, I know. But the number of believers has
grown since 1995. As a matter of fact, the group now has its own
Web site at www.worlditc.org.
</P>
<P>
   If you check out that site, one of the things you can read is a
message a believer is said to have received in 1995 from author
Jules Verne.
</P>
<P>
   I told Temmer about all this, and we both had a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you buy into ITC, why would a dead guy pick on Temmer's
computer, and why would he write down his address? Why wouldn't he
write something like, ``Hello. How are you? I am fine. How are the
Yankees doing?''
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would be fun to share this story with everybody. If
anybody out there has any ideas, drop me an e-mail, and I'll pass
it on. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Chat rooms, e-mail, Kosovo &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some great Web sites and related services to check out:
</P>
<P>
   - Wouldn't it be great to have your very own chat room on your
very own Web site? One of the companies offering this deal is
Xoom.com (www.xoom.com). If you register with Xoom, the company
allows you to create your own Web page and host your own chats _
free. The catch is that Xoom reserves the right to display
advertising on your site.
</P>
<P>
   - Looking for a free, Web-based e-mail service? The March issue
of Internet magazine rates Yahoo! Mail (mail.yahoo.com) as the top
service. HotMail (www.hotmail.com) comes in a close second. ``The
range of services from Yahoo!, (its) crisp design and ease of use
make this an excellent choice,'' the reviewer said. sounds good to
me.
</P>
<P>
   - Hey Juno users! Wouldn't it be nice to see a Web page once in
a while? Now Juno users and anybody else with an e-mail-only
account can browse the Web via e-mail. At least that's what Tom
Dolan claims. His Web site (dolan.acu.edu/how &QL; 
to/howtogetwebpagesby &QL; 
email.htm) has the instructions. It sounds pretty easy. I tried it,
but as of this writing, the Web page I requested has not yet shown
up in my e-mail box.
</P>
<P>
   - As the crisis in Kosovo continues, you might want to turn to
the Web for a perspective that's different from the daily newspaper
or what you might find on CNN. For example, the Yugoslavian
government maintains a site about Kosovo at www.gov.yu/kosovo. And
a decidedly different slant can be found at the U.S. Information
Agency's Kosovo page at www.usia.gov/kosovo. &QL;

division. They are issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th
century when Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas
Cole or described with affection by Henry James in his first novel,
``Roderick Hudson.'' They were questions raised when it hanged two
innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and when
it tried a policeman, a native son, for the rape of his own child,
during the four years Tracy Kidder spent reporting his new book,
``Home Town'' (Random House), published this month. Kidder, 53,
lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, Franny, a painter, but
considers Northampton also his home. As he proudly showed it to a

plastic sandbags that ran hundreds of feet long, then laid the
sandbags in a large coil. Later they sat together inside an
intricate brick dome, as the four aborigines sang ancient songs. A
New Age moment, you think. But what brought four men from
Australia, two avid readers of American Survival Guide (the

CALIFORNIA A MAGNET FOR IRS AUDITS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Amid the depressing fact that Thursday is the
deadline for filing taxes comes a tidbit of even more disheartening
news: Northern California has the highest percentage of people
being audited by the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Higher than big-bucks Los Angeles. Higher than the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS had no explanation. About the only good news is that
even in audit-prone areas, the number of people called before IRS
examiners is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   An annual study conducted by researchers at Syracuse University
in New York found that Northern California, including the San
Francisco area, has jumped from third to second, and then to first,
in the past three years as the most popular target for IRS audits.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the university's Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse, a research group that uses the Freedom of
Information Act to pry closely guarded figures from federal
agencies, showed that 1.08 percent of returns filed by taxpayers in
the San Francisco area were audited in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, with 0.98 percent of returns audited, was in
second. Southern California, excluding Los Angeles, was third and
Central California was fourth. The North Central region (Minnesota
and South Dakota) was fifth. And Manhattan was sixth, with 0.61
percent of returns audited.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles for years has been the most or second-most audited
part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants speculated that the relative new wealth of Silicon
Valley may be the reason for Northern California's dubious
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Weinstein, a certified public accountant in San
Francisco, noted that high incomes are being generated from
incentive compensation and stock options at Silicon Valley
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In states where the auditing rate is low, in Ohio, for example,
returns come from taxpayers who often work for big, established
companies, Weinstein said. Their tax returns are much more
straightforward and simple than those from burgeoning start-ups in
the Silicon Valley, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Northern California, there are very independent people who
have generated small businesses, and because of that the IRS may
see an opportunity to make aggressive use of expenses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein and other accountants said their anecdotal experience
tells them there are many self-employed people or independent
contractors whose Schedule C forms are more complicated to file
and, therefore, more subject to mistakes, abuse and, ultimately,
extra scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, auditing dropped dramatically from 1992
through 1998, the Syracuse study showed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the IRS received 118 million individual income tax
returns. On a national average, about 1 in every 100 will be
audited.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33 regions studied by Syracuse University, the percentage
of scrutinized returns during the 1992-1998 period increased in
Northern California. The highest year ever for Northern California
audits was in 1997, when 1.34 percent of returns were held under
the IRS microscope.

SOMETIMES YOU NEED SOME NURTURING, BUT THE OLD FAMILY FAVORITES
WON'T DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MEDA KESSLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a week of 13-hour days and an endless game of
voice-mail tag with an important client. Your home computer has a
nasty virus and your youngest son an even nastier one. One bad-hair
day has stretched into four, and an invitation to your class
reunion just arrived in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, you need a little TLC, something warm, something
creamy. Those old reliable standbys _ the blue box of macaroni and
cheese (cheers for the orange stuff!), chocolate chips eaten
straight from the container, your favorite Tex-Mex combo plate _
just don't seem to do it for you anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Along with grown-up problems, you now have grown-up tastes,
which often run more toward beurre blanc and duck confit than
chicken-fried steak and gravy.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to find comfort in an escarole salad. Thank
goodness for the ongoing New American food movement and the rage
for bistros and brewpubs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 15 years, chefs have been tinkering with our
favorite dishes, rethinking the ingredients, tweaking the tastes.
What they came up with is not your mother's meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get us wrong. These updated classics are still
dive-and-diner worthy. But local chefs such as Grady Spears of
Reata in Fort Worth and Billy Webb of Rooster in Dallas have
discovered that they'll draw the suit-and-tie crowd as well.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipes should bring you out of any work- or
life-related funk, with enough left over for a second dose of
comfort, if that's what the doctor orders.

dates to before our computer database.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June or July of 1986, there was an article about
chicken-fried steak and cream gravy (it covered the whole cover of
the lifestyle page) and there were several different people who had
been canvassed. One of them was a lady that had fixed chicken-fried
steak and gravy for her husband and daughters every day for 35
years for lunch. I cannot find this anywhere, and it was the best
gravy I have ever fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane Bowles of Arlington, Texas, used to make a cookie in the
1970s that had an oatmeal-type base and top, and a fudgy center. I
lost the recipe when a similar mix became available, marketed under
the name Fudge Jumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne McKnight would like the recipe for the marvelous spinach
salad that the now-defunct Highland Park Cafeteria used to serve.
``I know it had hard-boiled eggs cut up in it, and, I'm sure, some
horseradish. I'd love to taste it again, and again, and again.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The floors in homes, whether they be wood or covered with vinyl
or carpeting, take a lot of abuse. Floors exposed to heavy traffic
suffer occasional damage and require spot repairs. The most common
repairs for vinyl flooring include flattening blisters and patching
tears or scratches. Common carpet repairs include removing burns
and stains and regluing loose seams.
</P>
<P>
   Blisters form in vinyl flooring when a small section pulls away
from the adhesive on the subfloor. Use a utility knife to cut a
slit through the blister. Cover the area with aluminum foil and
heat it with a warm iron. This will soften the vinyl and the
adhesive beneath. Use a putty knife to insert new adhesive through
the slit, then press the blister flat. Clean away any excess
adhesive that seeps through the slit with mineral spirits. Place a
weight over the area and allow at least 24 hours for the adhesive
to set.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to repair deep scratches or tears in vinyl
floor covering provided you have a spare piece of the covering to
make a patch. You may have some scraps remaining from the original
installation. If not, you may also be able to buy a small piece of
material from a floor-covering supplier. If neither of these
options are viable, you can remove a small section of the floor
covering from the hidden areas under a large appliance or piece of
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a patch larger than the damaged area. Place it directly over
the damaged section in the floor, and adjust it so the patterns of
the two match. Tape the patch in place. Using a metal straight edge
as a guide, cut through the patch and floor covering underneath
with a utility knife. Remove the patch and lay it aside. Pry out
the damaged section with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   A stubborn piece of vinyl floor can usually be loosened by
softening the adhesive underneath with a warm iron (cover the area
with aluminum foil first). Clean the subfloor by dissolving the
adhesive with mineral spirits then scrape it with a putty knife or
a single-edged razor blade.
</P>
<P>
   Apply adhesive to the patch and press it in place. Use a roller
(you can use a kitchen rolling pin for this, but cover it with
plastic wrap to avoid possible contamination with adhesive.) to
flatten the patch and assure a good bond. Remove any excess glue
that seeps around the edges with mineral spirits. Place a weight
over the patch and allow the adhesive to set.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure for repairing damaged vinyl tiles is the same as
for patching a damaged section of vinyl sheet flooring, only there
is no need to cut a patch because tiles are precut. First, use a
warm iron to soften the adhesive, then pry up the damaged tile with
a putty knife. Coat the back of the replacement tile with adhesive,
then press it into place. Weight it down until the adhesive sets.
</P>
<P>
   When a carpet is stained, obviously the first course of action
is to try and remove the stain with a commercial carpet cleaner.
Follow the directions on the can and test the cleaner in an
inconspicuous spot to see how it affects your carpet.
</P>
<P>
   If the cleaner proves ineffective, you can remove the stained
section of carpet and replace it with a clean piece. For the patch
to be invisible, the cutout section and the patch must be the same
exact size and shape. One inexpensive tool that is useful for
cutting carpet patches is a ''cookie cutter.'' The cookie cutter,
available at most carpeting stores, cuts a round hole about four
inches in diameter. For larger patches, you will have to use a
utility knife.
</P>
<P>
   To use the cutter, press it down on the stained section and
rotate it. The cutter will make a neat circular hole. Use the same
technique to cut a replacement patch from a piece of scrap carpet.
Both the hole in the carpet and the patch will be the same size and
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Carpet is generally held in place with double-faced carpet tape,
not adhesive. Double-faced carpet tape is available at carpeting
stores. Cut a couple of pieces of tape and insert them into the
hole. The tape should extend past the perimeter of the hole to the
underside of the surrounding carpet. Press the patch into place,
making sure that the nap and pattern matches the existing carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Carpet comes loose at the seams when the double-face tape
beneath loses its adhesive grip. Make the repair by first pulling
out the old tape from under the seam, then replacing it with a
piece of heat-activated carpet tape (available at carpeting
stores). Heat the tape with a special seam iron (you can rent one
at carpet stores), then press the carpet down to seal the seams
together.

MARIA SHRIVER BESTSELLER AN EXAMPLE OF CELEBRITY-PENNED CHILDREN'S
BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CELEBRITIES-CHILDRENS BOOKS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, TV commentator Maria Shriver made book-publishing
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Heaven?'' (Golden Books/St. Martin's Press, $15),
Shriver's gentle commentary on death, became the first children's
book since the early 1960s heyday of Dr. Seuss to crack The New
York Times top 10 bestseller list. The author estimates that
300,000 copies have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding success of ``What's Heaven?'' would be notable on
its own. But because its author is a member of the Kennedy extended
clan and the photogenic wife of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger, it
also strongly supports a recent book industry philosophy _ that any
book by a celebrity, even a children's book, can move lots of
copies in star-struck America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that a celebrity's name on the dust cover can
represent a greater than 50 percent boost in sales potential,
easily,'' said Mike Emmerich, a senior editor at Taylor Publishing
Co. ``The ones we do are usually autobiographies from athletes.
Buyers, both parents and children, are drawn to them because
they're written by somebody they've heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   So, from Jimmy Buffett to Jamie Lee Curtis, with Bill Cosby and
Dr. Laura Schlessinger in between, the past three years have seen
more celebrities signing contracts with major publishing houses to
write children's books. Publishing industry analysts trace the
trend to 1991, when Sarah Ferguson, also known as Britain's Duchess
of York, wrote a series of ``Budgie'' children's books that were
published by Simon &AMP; Schuster. The ``Budgie'' titles sold steadily,
though not at bestselling rates. Still, Simon &AMP; Schuster made a
tidy profit, and competing publishing houses took notice.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent flood of celebrity books for kids has mixed
literary value. The ``Budgie'' books were undeniably awful and
roundly panned by critics. Consumers, though, seemed to enjoy
owning a piece of the Duchess, if only in print. (Fort Worth
library spokeswoman Marsha Anderson notes that ``Budgie'' titles
are still checked out frequently.) Titles by Bill Cosby and Jimmy
Buffett, though, were much better.
</P>
<P>
   But these stars got their books published, noncelebrity
children's authors say, at the expense of ``real'' writers with
quality stories to tell kids in print.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said award-winning Fort Worth author
Judy Alter, whose latest children's book, ``Extraordinary Women of
the American West,'' will receive only limited shelf exposure in
major chain stores. ``My last kids' books are published by a place
that sells directly to libraries, and hardly ever places them in
Barnes &AMP; Noble. Yes, children's books written by celebrities sell
better, and I think the reason is because moms and dads buy the
books and kids themselves don't. Do you think kids really care who
the Duchess of York is?''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed _ with some justification, Emmerich said _
that celebrities usually lend their names but not actual writing
talent to books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about all these celebrity books are what you might call
co-authored,'' Emmerich said. ``They'll sit down with another
writer who might help them put down in words what they want to say.
That writer is usually credited, but not always.''
</P>
<P>
   Shriver points out she didn't need any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write my own material for television anyway,'' said the star
of ``Dateline NBC.'' ``Still, `What's Heaven?' was a two- or
three-year process. I got the idea, then it took several drafts to
get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Current bookstore configurations bear out the growing popularity
of children's books. Titles for kids comprise approximately 11
percent of all books published each year, but Borders Books &AMP; Music
in Fort Worth uses about 20 percent of its shelf space for
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Maria Shriver's success is going to inspire
publishers to seek out more well-known personalities to write
children's books,'' said Alice Magnussen, a New York-based
publishing industry analyst. ``Every time she's on TV, in a sense
she's promoting `What's Heaven?' whether she's actually talking
about the book or not. And `What's Heaven?' is, in fact, a very
good book. I bought one for my 9-year-old daughter, who's been
asking about where people go when they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnussen predicted many more celebs will write children's books
in the next few years: ``Hillary Rodham Clinton would be a natural;
so would Venus Williams, the tennis player, and Willie Nelson, the
country singer. He just looks like a nice grandfatherly type.''

ANIMAL EXPERTS CALL CAT COLLECTORS 'SCOURGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By ALEX LANE  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stereotype of the neighborhood ``Cat Lady'' _ sweet albeit
eccentric widows or spinsters who fill their houses with cats,
opting for feline friends over human companionship _ is well known.
</P>
<P>
   But many animal professionals say that these cat lovers do more
harm than good to their pets and themselves. Harmless cat lovers
often turn into compulsive cat hoarders with filthy houses and an
unrestrained population of sick, inbred, feral felines.
</P>
<P>
   Now some shelter directors, psychologists and veterinarians are
mobilizing _ and calling for this behavior to be studied,
understood and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat collectors are one of the largest sources of animal
suffering in the nation,'' said Gini Barrett, director of the
American Humane Association office in Los Angeles. ``It's a huge
human problem, it's a huge animal-suffering problem, it's a
nightmare. It needs to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett is trying to develop a network through which Los
Angeles-area shelters can share information about collectors _
most, but not all, of whom are older single women. She is also
trying to educate judges and prosecutors about the danger presented
by these often sweet, sympathetic defendants.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Barrett and other experts said, only a minority of
cat lovers create problems. Many can handle large numbers of cats
and keep their houses clean and their animals healthy. Only those
who cross the line into compulsion are worrisome. Compulsion, in
this context, refers to collectors who accumulate large numbers of
animals far beyond the collectors' ability to provide proper care
for the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett said she, like most shelter workers, has encountered
several cases of extreme cat hoarding. The worst was that of a
woman who kept 589 cats in a flea-infested, feces-smeared house.
Thirty-nine were so sick they had to be killed immediately. Nine,
stuffed between couch cushions and into shopping bags in a closet,
were already dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman truly believed her cats were fine,'' Barrett said.
``You're not talking logic here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Lee has dealt with several off-the-deep-end collectors in
her job as director of an animal shelter in the small mountain town
of Durango, Colo. ``When I walk into these ladies' houses,
sometimes it scares me to death,'' Lee said. ``These cats can be
violent if they don't get their way.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the problem has gone unstudied. But recently Dr. Gary
Patronek, a veterinarian at Tufts University near Boston,
researched this behavior out of concern for the animals it hurts.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Patronek released the results of his study, in which
he estimated that animal shelters uncover 700 to 2,000 new cases of
animal hoarding every year. Because of the secretive nature of
hoarders, he said, the real total is much higher. Cats are the
collected animal in 65 percent of cases, with the rest spread out
among dogs, farm animals such as cows and chickens, and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Patronek's findings, combined with stories from shelter workers
and mental-health professionals, paint a portrait of a typical
collector: a reclusive, older woman who compulsively collects not
just animals but also household items such as bottlecaps or
newspapers. When confronted, collectors tend to be adept at
attracting sympathy. And if caught and punished, they are very
likely to build a new collection after the authorities stop paying
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said most collectors start out as helpful animal
rescuers, then slowly slip off the edge. ``It's the day you have
more than you can manage,'' Barrett said, ``the day you cannot see
the filth or the illness.'' That could be at five cats or at 50
cats, Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephanie Lafarge, a psychologist for the New York chapter
of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
explained that people who compulsively collect cats are probably
trying to deal with bad family or romantic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Cats are an attractive collectible since they are quieter and
more self-sufficient than dogs, for example, which need to be
walked and groomed. Also, the sometimes-aloof nature of the cat can
make emotional sense to people with low self-esteem, Lafarge said.
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old Manhattan cat lover who calls herself a ``cat
rescuer'' and wishes to be identified only by her first name,
Xiamara, is confident that she will never get to the point of
compulsive, harmful collecting. But she acknowledges that her cats
control her room and her routine.
</P>
<P>
   Xiamara lives in a one-room apartment in a Harlem tenement, with
21 cats. Stacked unlocked woven-wire cages line the faded orange
walls. Dusty clutter, like chairs and lamps, are piled high in
corners, stowed away to make more room for cat paraphernalia. She
has no room for furniture _ at night she rolls out blankets and
sleeps on the floor. She rises at 4:30 in the morning, and cleans
up after her cats for the next three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see 21, do you?'' Xiamara said recently. Indeed,
only six or seven cats were visible. But with a shake of the food
bag, the cats materialized, darting out from makeshift dens in the
depths of cages and hidden corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in my blood, I can't stop,'' Xiamara said. ``I walk down
the street and my heart starts beating, because I'll see a paper
bag and I'll think it's a cat. I ask myself, 'What is this? Why do
I feel this way?' I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the next breath, she tells the story of her childhood.
She was abandoned at birth, and by the time she was 15 she had
lived in eight different institutions and foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask, 'Are you happy?' '' Xiamara said. ``I'm happy for
the animals I've helped. For myself, I dreamed of being married in
a house with a husband and children and a car. I died and cried for
it many nights. Now I'm just accepting, this is it.''

VIRTUAL GREETINGS FLOURISH BUT PAPER CARDS RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By MANUELA BADAWY  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 10th most popular Web site in the world is an
electronic greeting card site where users can send and receive
cards for 104 different occasions in three different languages, all
at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Mountain Arts Inc., which is also the No. 1 Web site in the
greeting card industry, records the most visits, about one million
hits a day. Over the shopping season for Valentine's Day _ from
February 1 to 14 _ the company had ``tens of millions'' of hits,
said Erica Wilhelm, assistant to the vice president of business and
development at Blue Mountain. Christmas is equally busy. Almost as
hectic as those two holidays are the periods leading up to Father's
Day and Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's profit comes from its printed cards, sold
wholesale to retailers. The Web site is used to introduce consumers
to the cards. ``The site is only a complement for the paper
industry,'' Wilhelm said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are more than 150 greeting card Web sites with
original designs and messages, most people still send the
traditional cards, according to the Greeting Card Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still like to hold, touch and display their cards,''
said Mila Albertson, director of publications and promotions at the
trade association.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group estimated that more than 7 billion cards were
sold last year, 900 million of them for Valentine's Day. That adds
up to an estimated $7.5 billion in revenue in just the United
States. Christmas and Valentine's Day are the two busiest holidays
for the greeting card industry.
</P>
<P>
   E-cards, with animation and music, can be sent instantly, with
prices ranging from nothing to $10 each. But some recipients don't
want E-cards and others do not have the software to open such files
or the space to store them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they spam you with junk mail,'' said Jurgen Efeish,
technical solution engineer for a database company called
Prolifics, ``but it's lots of fun to receive these things.'' The
term ``spam'' is generally taken to mean junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 153 million people are online worldwide as of this
past January, according to Nua Internet Surveys, making electronic
greetings not yet a mainstream product.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the people who send Web greeting cards are
women, according to a survey by NPD Group, an international
marketing information company. Eighty percent of the people who buy
paper greeting cards are women, most of them middle-aged, according
to the Greeting Card Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I am an Internet fan,'' said Karin Dauch, a native
of Brazil who is a graduate student in new media in New York City,
``I still think it is nice to see that a person went to the trouble
of licking a stamp.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper greeting card industry is not disappearing. To the
contrary, e-mail cards are helping the traditional business,
Albertson said. There are 1,800 publishing companies, and, she
said, they are not threatened by electronic greeting cards. ``Are
printed books going to disappear because of the Internet?'' she
asked. ``No. Well, it's the same with greeting cards.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many Web sites for different purposes, like C-ya.com,
for relationship closure issues; cyber-cards.com, which includes
images of landmarks and vehicles, and
electronicpostcards.com/pc/insults for clever insults. For
traditional greetings, try: www.hallmark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic cards can help busy people show they are thinking of
someone. ``It follows the rule of the market,'' Efeish said.
``Before, it was telex; now it is e-cards.'' SIDE BAR

DUMBOISM: ARTISTS DEVELOPING THEIR INNER ELEPHANT

 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep in the lush jungles of Thailand, Nam Chong
stands in concentration, staring into the morning mist. Suddenly,
he picks up a paintbrush and with bold dramatic strokes begins his
latest masterpiece on the canvas propped up on the easel in front
of him. An artist, a landscape, an easel _ it all sounds perfectly
normal, except for one thing. The artist, Nam Chong, is an
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   When he paints, Nam Chong holds a specially designed brush on
the ``finger'' at the end of his trunk, and flexes nearly 50,000
muscles in his trunk to create vivid smears of reds, yellows and
greens across the canvas. After much ear flapping, tail swooshing,
and trunk waving, the result is an array of blotches and squiggles
that might be considered the ultimate in abstract art.
</P>
<P>
   Nam Chong is seen on a slide show in the studio of New
York-based artists Alexander Melamid and Vitaly Komar. He is one of
30 or so elephants who have the privilege of being enrolled in one
of the three exclusive Thai Elephant Art Academies. Komar and
Melamid recently returned from Thailand, where they helped start
the art schools, located in the village of Ayuthaya, the southern
resort island of Phuket and the northern city of Lampang.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of grants from the World Wildlife Fund, the
Russian emigre artists started the Thailand Elephant Art Project
after learning about the plight of starving Thai elephants who were
left unemployed after the government banned teak logging. Most of
the 3,800 domesticated elephants in Thailand were formerly employed
as hard laborers, hauling teak logs in the rugged jungles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the Thailand Elephant Art Project, some of these
elephants are happily producing and selling canvases adorned with a
colorful array of blotches and squiggles that have been compared to
the works of the renowned 1950s abstract expressionists, like
Jackson Pollock and Willem De Kooning. Pollock was known for his
eclectic painting style of punching holes in cans of paint and
dragging the dripping colors over a canvas spread out beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abstract expressionists in the '50s were always trying to
discover the beast within and release their emotions and instincts
through the act of painting,'' said Mia Fineman, an art historian
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. ``The elephants
come by this vestal quality by naturally being animals themselves,
so in a way it's kind of an end-of-the-century comment on abstract
expressionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so serious about the elephants' artwork. Komar
and Melamid are known in the New York art community for making
parody statements on the art establishment and the contemporary art
world. They claim to have turned dogs into painters and monkeys
into photographers. Their future plans include turning termites and
beavers into architects. Komar and Melamid like to call their work
with animals and nature ``eco-collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ronald Jones, chairman of Columbia University's
Graduate School of Visual Arts, the Elephant Art Project is just
another practical joke being played on the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Komar and Melamid for a number of years have been known for
doing a social demographics art and commentary of what popular
taste is,'' Jones said. ``It falls almost too neatly under the old
rhetoric about abstract art that we've heard before with regard to
Pollock _ 'My 4-year-old could do this.' With this it's 'My pet
could do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But with a straight face and a serious attitude, Komar insists
that the elephants' art and their behavior while creating the art
can be compared directly to such painters as Pollock. Some
elephants even like to paint with the canvas spread out on the
ground beneath them in true Pollokesque style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are elephants who like to paint only after a bottle of
rice whiskey,'' Komar said. ``Just like Pollock! Pollock also liked
to drink his whiskey before painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a practical joke or not, it is evident that these
elephants don't work for just peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, they raised $50,000 at a glitzy art exhibition
held in the Hilton Hotel in Bangkok. Princess Galyani Vadhana,
sister of the King of Thailand, attended the gala and purchased a
few select pieces of the elephants' art. The money goes to the
elephant art academy, which houses the elephants and their keepers.
Why not? Komar and Melamid are very serious about the creative
talents of the elephants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of them are individuals, stylistically and by
character,'' Komar said, fawning over the fierce blotches of a
yellow and green elephant creation. ``Look! The sense of
composition is really fantastic!''
</P>
<P>
   In between banana treats and swigs of rice whiskey, the
elephants wave their trunks in bold strokes on the canvas in front
of them, apparently getting their inspiration from the beautiful
lush landscape around them. But not all elephant art looks the
same. There are three distinct schools and regional styles that
have emerged in this new art movement, said Fineman, who is also an
art history professor at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The northern style is more lyrical and looser, tending toward
clearer primary colors and broken brush work,'' Fineman said. ``The
central Thai style, centered in Ayuthaya, was more vigorous _ they
tended to use broader brushes and straight strokes that sort of
sweep across the canvas from edge to edge sometimes covering the
entire surface in a kind of color field. And the southern style was
more gentle, curvy, tending to use complex colors like plum and
magenta and mustard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the cognoscenti believe the pachyderms' work is true art
or not, Komar and Melamid hope that the new art movement, which has
been referred to as Dumboism,'' will help sustain some of the
domesticated elephants in Thailand _ not to mention the flourishing
``inner elephant'' of the artists themselves.

<P>
   QUEEN NOOR _ Although there is no constitutional role for Queen
Noor within Jordan's monarchial system, King Hussein decreed before
his death that she would retain her title and live in the royal
palace, Bab Al Salam. She is expected to retain a public role.
``She will continue to be important and to play an important role
in the Jordanian Government,'' said Hassan Abu Nima, Jordan's
Ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   US-IRAN _ After two decades of silence, the delicate dance of
words between Washington and Tehran has yet to whirl into a full
negotiating waltz. Iran is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its
Islamic revolution this year, which led to the takeover of the
American embassy by the revolutionaries, and the taking of 52
American hostages, who were held for 444 days. But the animosity
that once existed between the two nations is being replaced by
respectful relations at the governmental level.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K PROBLEM _ In the 14th century, the Black Death ravaged
Europe and Asia. In the 1800s, a cholera pandemic rampaged from
India to Mississippi. What will be the disease of the new
millennium? Increasingly, prognosticators say the threat is the Y2K
glitch, which they say could sweep through computer systems
worldwide, downing planes and generally causing unprecedented
devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ELEPHANTS _ With the help of grants from the World Wildlife
Fund, two Russian emigre artists started the Thailand Elephant Art
Project after learning about the plight of starving Thai elephants
who were left unemployed after the government banned teak logging.
Most of the 3,800 domesticated elephants in Thailand were formerly
employed as hard laborers, hauling teak logs in the rugged jungles.
Now, thanks to the Thailand Elephant Art Project, some of these
elephants are happily painting works of art.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MANY CATS _ The stereotype of the neighborhood ``Cat Lady''
_ sweet albeit eccentric widows or spinsters who fill their houses
with cats, opting for feline friends over human companionship _ is
well known.
</P>
<P>
   But many animal professionals say that these cat lovers do more
harm than good to their pets and themselves. Harmless cat lovers
often turn into compulsive cat hoarders with filthy houses and an
unrestrained population of sick, inbred, feral felines.
</P>
<P>
   PITBULLS _Pit bulls' social nature, combined with their
strength, make them good pets and helpers for the disabled. But
they have a bad reputation as dangerous dogs.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL CARDS _ E-mail greeting cards are soaring in popularity.
But old-fashioned print cards are not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   WEB ADDICTS _ Some people say they are addicted to the Internet.
There is help available for them, but there is one catch: the
therapy is available online.
</P>
<P>
   TOILET ADS _ One of the last places where a person could truly
be alone _ the toilet stall _ has been invaded by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   WILD FOOD _ A man known as Wildman relishes showing tour groups
how to eat hearty on the plants in Central Park in New York.

WHEN IT COMES TO PIT BULLS, IS MAN BITING DOG UNFAIRLY? 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By AMY L. ANDERSON  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The door has barely swung shut, when the muscular,
reddish dog jumps down from its perch by the window and flings
itself at the intruder. Forty pounds of writhing, panting pit bull
scrabble across a cement floor on Manhattan's Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop it!'' Glen Hettrick, the beast's owner, yells from the
back of the bar, but the dog ignores him.
</P>
<P>
   Hettrick shrugs and returns to his pool game. The pit bull,
named Ginger, tail wagging, jumps up again and again, trying to
lick the stranger's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll go home with you after a few drinks,'' said Hettrick's
wife, Rosemarie.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly the snarling, spike-collared beast with steel-trap jaws
that the name pit bull calls up. To many dog owners, pit bulls are
beloved family pets, guilty, if anything, of an insatiable craving
for affection and an over-eagerness to please.
</P>
<P>
   But many municipalities across the country are acting on the
dogs' reputation, singling out pit bulls and their cousins with
``dangerous dogs'' legislation. A bill before the New York City
Council, for example, would require owners of pit bulls _ defined
as Staffordshire bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers,
American pit bull terriers or similar mixed breeds _ to carry
$100,000 in liability insurance in order to obtain a dog license.
Those who have worked with and lived with pit bulls maintain that
such legislation will serve only to punish responsible owners and
their dogs, while propagating a misleading stereotype of so-called
``bully breeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll lick you to death,'' Paul Daly, a 37-year-old carpenter
who lives in the East Village, said of Eleanor, his pit-bull mix.
Daly scoffed at the idea his dog might be dangerous. ``The myth of
the evil pit bull is just a myth,'' he said. ``They're sweet
critters _ very loyal, happy, very calm. If you get the dog as a
pet, it's the best pet you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Pit bulls' social nature, combined with their strength, make
them good helpers, said Dennis Owens, a 32-year-old Manhattan
resident who trains dogs to assist the disabled. Owens, who was
injured in an elevator accident a little more than 10 years ago,
uses his pit bull, Asha, to retrieve things for him, and the dogs
can also be trained to pull wheelchairs. ``She's the best thing
that ever happened to me,'' he said. The emotional support Asha
provides is as important to him as the physical support. ``They
enjoy life, no matter what else is going on,'' he said, explaining
why he chose a pit bull over other breeds. ``They're a lot of fun _
enjoyable to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many pit bulls do exhibit a nasty streak. According
to the New York Department of Health, which is responsible for
enforcing dog-control laws, pit bulls accounted for 294, or 33
percent, of the 892 dogs held by the department in 1997 for biting
or other menacing behavior. While other breeds, including German
shepherds and Rottweilers, also had significant reports of bites,
pit bulls tend to do more damage when they bite, the health
department commissioner, Neal Cohen, testified before the New York
City Council earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Robin Kovary, a Manhattan dog trainer, said that was no
reason to punish all pit-bull owners with an insurance requirement.
``If raised by good people, they're affectionate, intelligent,
devoted pets,'' said Kovary, a behavior consultant who has worked
extensively with pit bulls. Problems arise when owners encourage
aggressive behavior by roughhousing or egging a dog on when it
barks or growls. ``They're fantastic dogs in the right hands,'' she
said. ``Unfortunately, a lot of them end up in the wrong hands _
people who shouldn't own a hamster.''
</P>
<P>
   And the requirement will not affect the most dangerous slice of
the pit-bull population. A health department spokesman, John Gadd,
said that approximately 90 percent of the dogs seized last year
were unlicensed. Gadd maintains that the law will still help, by
giving the department more authority to fine such owners and, if
necessary, confiscate their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills have been defeated in Toronto, Annapolis, Md., and
Youngstown, Ohio, largely on the strength of protest from dog
lovers who claim that breed-specific legislation fails to address
the real problem. Pit-bull owners in New York are rallying against
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lettis, director of the Responsible Dog Owners Association
of New York, acknowledged that ``there are people who use dogs as
lethal weapons.'' But, she added, ``the criminal element will use
any breed.'' Officials would do better, she said, to enforce
existing rules, like leash laws, that apply to all breeds. ``When
you tell the public this breed is dangerous, you're telling the
public all other breeds are fine, and that's a misrepresentation,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A 56-year-old legal secretary who owns two American
Staffordshire Terriers and two Staffordshire Bull Terriers, her
interest in bully breeds stems from pit bull-specific legislation
proposed in New York in the 1980s. Lettis, who at the time owned
two boxers (dogs unrelated to pit bulls), volunteered to help the
American Kennel Club fight the legislation and, in the process,
began to research the breed. ``Because of the research, I truly
fell in love with them,'' she said. ``I thought, I had to own
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lettis, who regularly takes her dogs to schools to teach
children about responsible dog ownership, was delighted with her
first Stafford, Mikey. ``He was the easiest dog to train I've ever
owned in my life,'' she said. Mikey has also displayed an unusually
sensitive side. ``He has found wounded birds in the yard and come
to the back door to get me to do something about it. He's sort of
like the Albert Schweitzer of the canine world.''

JORDAN'S QUEEN NOOR, RECENTLY WIDOWED, ADAPTS TO A NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By DIANE HANDAL   
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, JORDAN _ Queen Noor glided along the receiving line,
greeting a delegation of Arab-American women who had come from New
York and California to offer condolences on the death of her
popular husband. With the sleeves of her black sweater pushed up
and her blonde hair peeking from beneath a white mourning scarf,
King Hussein's widow was poised and elegant as she introduced the
new king's wife, Princess Rania. She clasped each outstretched hand
and kissed each visitor on both cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all one family and we will carry on his legacy,'' the
queen repeatedly said. ``He spent his life committed to peace and
we will follow in his footsteps.'' True to the persona she has
developed in her 21-year reign, it was the American-born queen who
eased the sadness of those who had come in March to comfort her
after Hussein's death from cancer on Feb. 7 at age 63.
</P>
<P>
   Only later did a glimmer of vulnerability appear beneath the
stoic greeting. Asked how her children were coping, she told the
visitors, ``We go from denial to belief and then shock.'' In the
midst of her ordeal, intimates say, an inner strength has guided
Queen Noor through this crisis even as she keeps her eye on her own
future and that of her first-born son with Hussein, Crown Prince
Hamzeh, next in line for the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the moment when she will reassess her life and see
where she will have the most impact and in what way she can best
serve the royal family,'' said Rami Khouri, former editor of the
Jordan Times.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the world in Queen Noor's U.S. homeland,
her future is the subject of close scrutiny. Keenly interested in
what role the 47-year-old queen will carve out for herself, U.S.
officials see her as a potential ally, particularly in her eventual
role as the next Queen Mother.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor's most visible activity during the past two months
has been mentoring the former Princess Rania, who on March 21 was
officially proclaimed ``Her Majesty, the Great Queen'' by her
husband King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly her priority is her elder son, Crown Prince Hamzeh,
whom his father decreed would one day succeed Hamzeh's older
stepbrother, Abdullah. U.S. officials are cognizant of Queen Noor's
potential ability to be a stabilizing force in Jordan, if only
through the lessons and priorities she teaches Hamzeh. With
Jordan's delicate place in the Middle East geopolitical dance, the
State Department has pledged $525 million in bilateral aid to Amman
along with moral support for Queen Noor, in hopes she does not lose
influence in the post-Hussein palace.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no constitutional role for Queen Noor within
Jordan's monarchial system, Hussein decreed before his death that
she would retain her title and live in the royal palace, Bab Al
Salam. She is expected to retain a public role. With her experience
as an international emissary for her husband, she could also be an
ambassador for Abdullah, with whom she is said to enjoy a good
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will continue to be important and to play an important
role in the Jordanian Government,'' said Hassan Abu Nima, Jordan's
Ambassador to the United States. But her path will be a delicate
one in a land where she has never seemed comfortable in the role of
the subservient woman. Even as the new king takes center stage,
Queen Noor also dominates, with photos of her appearing daily in
the newspapers. However, observers believe she will take a quiet
political role in deference to the new king, whose mother was
Hussein's second wife.
</P>
<P>
   Among her projects, she has assumed Princess Diana's role as
spokeswoman for the Landmine Survivors Network and she will
spotlight her philanthropic efforts through the Noor Al Hussein
Foundation, a charity she runs. Her pet project is the Jubilee
School, the only high school for gifted youths in the Middle East.
She has also spearheaded efforts to help poor, rural women launch
weaving, ceramics and agricultural businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these works and the path she takes now will help
overcome her shaky place as a foreign-born queen remains unknown.
Although she has become more popular among Jordanians since her
husband's death, Queen Noor has never fit the stereotype that
traditionalists demand.
</P>
<P>
   Slim, blonde and chic, the Princeton-educated queen met Hussein,
16 years her senior, when she was a Middle East urban planning
consultant. Despite Hussein's lifelong efforts to convince his
countrymen to accept her, she was often seen as too ambitious and
outspoken. Her wedding-eve conversion in 1978 from Christianity to
Islam and her sketchy command of Arabic did not endear her to the
religious establishment, nor did her vocal support for women's
rights or her campaign to get her dying husband to promote her own
son to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the queen manages to blend the modern with the
traditional. After greeting the American delegation, she jumped
into the driver's seat of her sand-colored Mercedes sport utility
vehicle and drove herself to the cemetery, where thousands of
Jordanians silently waited in line to pay respects to their beloved
king.
</P>
<P>
   The king's death and her adherence to Islamic mourning customs
seem to have softened opinions of her. ``She is seen as a powerful,
caring, tender woman,'' Khouri said. ``She has emotionally
connected with the Jordanian people.''

GOODBYE `GREAT SATAN' AS IRAN AND U.S. MOVE CLOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 BY FARNAZ FASSIHI  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two decades of silence, the delicate dance of
words between Washington and Tehran has yet to whirl into a full
negotiating waltz.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its Islamic
revolution this year, which led to the takeover of the American
embassy by the revolutionaries, and the taking of 52 American
hostages, who were held for 444 days. But the animosity that once
existed between the two nations is being replaced by respectful
relations at the governmental level.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Iran's moderate President Mohammad Khatami took a
step by calling for ``a dialogue between two great civilizations,''
in an interview on CNN. Secretary of State Madeline Albright
replied that the time had come to ``draw a road map to normalizing
relations with Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, Barry Rosen, a former American hostage
in Iran, has met with one of the Iranians who organized the U.S.
embassy takeover in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the improving relationship between Iran and United
States, obstacles remain, including a long history of accumulated
bad feelings, encrusted official pronouncements and, in the case of
America, legislated prohibitions including trade and other economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic relations between the two nations ended after the
Iranian revolution. Since then, the United States has not had a
representative in Iran and its interests have been represented by
the Swiss embassy in Tehran. Similarly, Iran provides services for
its citizens through Pakistan's embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Trade relations between the two nations were abolished when
Congress passed the ``Iran-Libya Act'' in 1996, which threatened
sanctions against foreign companies that invested more than $20
million a year in Iran's oil and gas industry and banned the
importation of any Iranian goods in the United States. The law also
established sanctions against Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Iran has a unique geopolitical and strategic
position in the region. To the south, it has access to the Persian
Gulf. It ranks as the world's fourth-largest producer of crude oil
and second largest of natural gas. Iran shares its northern border
of the Caspian Sea with the newly independent Central Asian states
of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. Iran's existing pipelines can
deliver the fuel more directly from the oilfields of the Caspian
states than would be possible under a proposed U.S. plan. The
American plan is to build a new pipeline through other Central
Asian nations, bypassing Iran, to deliver the oil to Turkey where
it could be loaded onto tankers for export.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Iran has invited foreign investors to develop
its petroleum and gas fields. If the sanctions are not removed,
American oil companies will miss out on the bidding by European
companies to develop the resources.
</P>
<P>
   This past February, Iran awarded French and Italian oil
companies a $500 million deal to develop its offshore gas fields.
And Britain's Premier Oil in partnership with Canada's Bow Valley
Energy will develop its oil fields in a $200 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   These developments have not passed unnoticed in America.
According to a Commerce Department publication in November, the
greatest pressure to lift the Iran-Libya embargo has come from U.S.
oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging a need to re-establish relations, State Department
officials said that the United States had expressed an interest in
resuming official talks with Iran many times but that Iran had not
responded favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The internal debates within the powerful political parties of
moderate President Khatami and conservative religious leader
Ayatollah Khamenei, who succeeded the founder of the revolution,
Ayatollah Khomeini, prevent Iran from renewing ties with the United
States, said State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also said that the United States would not,
as a pre-condition to talks, lift the Iran-Libya sanctions. ``Our
view is that no preconditions should be set for a dialogue to take
place,'' a State Department official said in a recent telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, on the other hand, does not believe the United States is
serious about holding talks, Iran's counsel to the United Nations,
Amir Zamaninia, said in a telephone interview. ``It is like holding
a stick above someone's head and saying, 'Let's talk but you can't
say a word about the stick,' '' he said, referring to the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Zamaninia said the sanctions were aimed at curtailing Iran's
development and sovereignty. Until they are lifted, he said, the
only relationship between Iran and the United States would be what
President Khatami called ``cultural exchange between the great
minds of both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Iran-Libya Act to be repealed, Congress would have to
pass a new law, a long and complicated procedure that requires the
approval of both the House and the Senate, and the signature of the
President.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strong concern in Congress for Israel's security
and peace in the region, the lifting of sanctions will face strong
opposition, said Richard Buillet, chairman of Columbia University's
Middle East Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. may have commercial benefits and human benefits in
resuming relations with Iran,'' Buillet said. ``But none of that
rises to the political weight of concern among supporters of Israel
in the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department still identifies Iran as a sponsor of
terrorism and a major obstacle in the Middle East peace process. It
also has accused Iran of trying to acquire nuclear weapons, charges
that Iran has denied.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear when the two sides will officially lay the
grievances of the past on the negotiating tables, but both sides
said that while the road ahead is long, the first step has been
taken.
</P>
<P>
   In an act of good faith, Rosen, the former American hostage,
said in a recent interview that his Paris meeting with one of the
Iranians who organized the U.S. embassy takeover, Abbass Abdi, had
helped heal old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to set an example for their nations, the two men shook
hands and spent three days talking over the painful events of the
past. ``Differences can be resolved if you can go beyond the
stereotypes that separate our two nations and look at each other as
human beings and forgive,'' Rosen said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the spring of 1986, Steve Brill, also known as
``Wildman,'' was handcuffed and detained for three hours at police
headquarters in New York City. His crime? Eating dandelions in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Brill was giving one of his private tours in the Manhattan park,
his own version of how to survive in the urban jungle. He was
showing his followers which plants were edible. As soon as he
placed the dandelion in his mouth, two undercover cops with
walkie-talkies jumped from behind the bushes and made the arrest _
a real life sting operation. Wildman was caught yellow-handed.
</P>
<P>
   But he beat the rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had eaten all the evidence,'' Brill said. The case got so
much publicity that the charges were dropped and Brill was hired by
the city's Parks and Recreations Department to conduct the same
tours. Although he is no longer affiliated with the department,
Brill is busier now than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of his tours, Brill insisted, is to help New Yorkers
become reacquainted with the natural world. For a small price _ $10
for an adult, $5 for a child _ urban sophisticates can find food
without dialing for delivery or ordering off a menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have very little contact with their environment in the
modern urban and suburban setting,'' said Brill, 49. ``I want them
to have a different perspective of their environment. You don't
have to go out of your way to get in touch with nature. It's right
out there, close by to where you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill conducts five tours a week, four hours at a time. This is
his full-time job. He works with schools and organizations around
the city leading group excursions in all five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   With his thin physique and dark-framed glasses, this tour guide
looks more a math teacher than a wild man. He has no academic
qualifications other than a psychology degree from Georgetown
University. But that has not stopped him from publishing on
nature-related topics. Brill has written a book called
``Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants in Wild
(and Not So Wild) Places,'' and is working on a wildlife cookbook.
He is even planning his own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you eat in Central Park?
</P>
<P>
   Gingko nuts, which are now in season, can be harvested off the
ground and are great for circulation and memory. Gingko nuts also
serve as a low-fat substitute for cheese. Sorel, a lemon herb used
in soups, is free for the picking. Brill also shows how to find
greens of garlic and poor man's pepper, two ingredients that can
spice up a meal. Serviceberries, small berries that are a cross
between apples and blueberries, have an ``indescribable sweet
flavor'' and cannot be bought anywhere, Brill said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vogel, 36, a Wildman follower, cannot get enough of the
nature walks, which Brill sprinkles with mythology, literature and
humor. Vogel has been touring with Brill for the past eight years,
sometimes as many as 16 times a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of exciting to be out there on a beautiful day and
meet some people who are real enthused about nature,'' said Vogel,
who works for the city comptroller's office. ``I'm always learning
new things. He's entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation is not so
enthusiastic. They want Brill to go wild somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is for people to enjoy, not for people to consume,''
said Ed Skyler, spokesman from the department. Skyler is concerned
that Brill's tours are destroying plant life. He also worries about
health hazards; poisonous plants are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Brill insists he knows how to identify lethal greens and how to
teach others to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics question Brill's claim that it is possible to live
for up to eight months eating off the land with the right
combination of herbs, roots, greens, fruits, nuts, berries,
mushrooms and weeds _ not that he has tried it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know what kind of research he has done to make
such a statement,'' said Wahida Karmally, a spokeswoman for the
American Dietetic Association and a nutritionist. ``It can be very
damaging unless you have confirmed data.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin B-12, for example, can only be found in animal products,
she said, and ``unless there are cows in Central Park, I don't see
how the diet could be complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill conceded that he took B-12 supplements himself.
</P>
<P>
   While some nutritionists do not support an all-Central Park
diet, few of Brill's customers are concerned. ``He has no formal
education about this, but it doesn't mean he doesn't know what he's
talking about,'' said David Reich, a chiropractor from Queens.

POOR COUNTRIES FACE Y2K CHAOS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 14th century, the Black Death ravaged Europe
and Asia. In the 1800s, a cholera pandemic rampaged from India to
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the disease of the new millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, prognosticators say the threat is the Y2K glitch,
which they say could sweep through computer systems worldwide,
downing planes and generally causing unprecedented devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts warn that the world is not prepared for the Year
2000 problem, which stems from the inability of computers to
differentiate the year 2000 from the year 1900. A World Bank study
found that 85 percent of countries surveyed at the end of last year
were unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pretty picture,'' said Joyce Amenta, who heads the
World Bank's Y2K task force. ``The issue is fundamental to the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Sloan, the World Bank's Africa technology specialist, said:
``There are 30 billion chips in the world. There is no way to know
what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released in March by the U.S. Senate emphasizes domestic
considerations like the threat to the American health care system,
but warns that the international picture is alarming because Y2K
foul-ups abroad could have serious repercussions at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the interdependent nature of the U.S. and world
economy,'' the report says, ``the U.S. has a responsibility as a
world leader to encourage a politically stable environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the World Bank, the Senate found that many countries are
not gearing up for the expected computer failures. The Senate cited
a study by the Gartner Group showing that 54 of the 81 countries
surveyed will probably be unprepared for potential computer
malfunctions on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Fear has prodded some advanced nations' governments and private
companies into action. But many poor countries, potentially most at
risk of widespread havoc, have done the least to anticipate their
computer clocks going haywire at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank is worried that such countries as Indonesia,
Russia and Brazil are so preoccupied with their economic, political
and social problems that they are all but ignoring the Y2K threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate report said Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, two major
sources of U.S. oil imports, are more than a year behind in
preparing. Even important trade and financial partners like Germany
and Taiwan are lagging in dealing with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   So serious is the worldwide concern that the State Department
has ordered its personnel to refrain from travelling from Dec. 15,
1999, to Jan. 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is rooted in the two digits, instead of four, that
computer programmers traditionally have used to represent a year,
so that many computers will read 00 in 2000 to mean 1900. Resulting
calculations could scramble telephone lines, block credit cards,
confuse air traffic patterns and shut down hospital equipment,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   One big issue is that no one knows whether the problem is
overrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lose power for a week in New York, it's complete
pandemonium,'' said Eugene Chang, an international Y2K consultant
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, power outages in developing
countries may cause only a ripple, because those governments are
used to glitches.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chang's bank clients tried to tell Russian businessmen
about the chaos that could ensue on Jan. 1: power failures,
economic collapse and social unrest. Audience members listened
quietly, Chang said, until one spoke up: ``Yes, that is very
interesting, but those things have already happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many developing countries already struggle with imperfect
computer systems, and have perfected what Chang called ``manual
work-around'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the regional implications are vast. If Uganda's energy
grid goes down, African neighbors that rely on Uganda for energy
could be left without power.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank says that one of the least vigilant countries is
landlocked Zimbabwe. At Harare's embassy in Washington, however,
counselor Lloyd Zithoi said the question is ``not a thing a person
worries about; it's not a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The word computer isn't in most people's vocabulary,'' he
said. But Zimbabwe's government departments are computerized, he
conceded, and are now being adjusted by a U.S. computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, like Argentina and Tunisia, have pounced on the
problem. But the world's largest nation, China, has not bothered to
return the World Bank's Y2K preparedness form, and Beijing has
taken the bold stance of ordering all its airline executives to fly
on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, undeterred, has established a program called
InfoDev that specializes in the Y2K problem, and has lent $159
million to Sri Lanka, Argentina and Malaysia to help them prepare.
Few other countries have even bothered to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Even with widespread warnings, the world is unlikely to be ready
for Y2K, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new century will give the world's computers a
version of the bubonic plague or just a case of the sniffles is
impossible to know.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it may pay to take a few precautions, Amenta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a good idea to buy a few extra groceries right
before New Year's,'' she said.

ADVERTISERS TAKE THEIR MESSAGE TO THE TOILET 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN SIFF  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Corporate America wants you to read the writing on
the bathroom wall. No, not the profanity. Not the messages of love.
But the cheeky advertisements it has designed for the ultimate
captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy every part of the city,'' read one poster recently
displayed above urinals and on toilet stall doors in 300 New York
City bars. ``And don't forget Flushing.''
</P>
<P>
   The framed advertisement for Time Out New York magazine was
distributed by Zoom Media, one of the two major companies engaged
in a nationwide bathroom brawl.
</P>
<P>
   People have always read in bathrooms, and accommodating
bartenders have long affixed sports pages to restroom walls. But
for the last two years, such blue-chip advertisers as Proctor and
Gamble and General Motors have also vied for the relaxed attention
of bar-goers.
</P>
<P>
   There are several good reasons for advertisers to take their
message to the john, say salesmen for the new medium. The ads can
almost unerringly be targeted to men or women; they reach the
coveted 18-to-34 age demographic; people in bars usually have
disposable income; and for one to three minutes, the target
audience has no place else, well, to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unspoken urinal etiquette,'' said Clarence
Robertson, a 27-year-old bar patron on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan. ``You don't look left, you don't look right.'' That
leaves straight ahead, which is where the advertisements are
positioned.
</P>
<P>
   For around $200 per month, Marc Miller, the 23-year-old
co-founder of Insite Media, promises advertisers the undivided
attention of ``trendsetters'' who frequent one of the 9,000 toilets
he has rented in fashionable bars in nine major media markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the overseers of what is hot and what is going on,''
Miller said. ``Let them receive your message and the others will
follow. People who grew up in an ad-infested age thrive on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For bar owners, the advertisements have a simple appeal.
Depending on the number of toilets, a bar can reap $500 to $2,000 a
year by allowing Insite Advertising to install aluminum and glass
advertisement frames in its bathrooms. The posters are
interchangeable; Miller uses his desktop computer to keep track of
which bathrooms are displaying what ads. Representatives check on
the advertisements once per week to make sure they are still in
good condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the logical next step,'' said James Twitchell, author of
``Adcult USA: The Triumph of Advertising in America.'' Companies
already print advertising slogans on beach sand, supermarket
receipts, airport baggage carousels, phone booths, and even the
little stickers on fruit. Several Texas school districts have
approved a plan to sell advertising space on the side of school
buses.
</P>
<P>
   But the more advertisements people see, the less they pay
attention, Twitchell said. As advertisements begin to appear on
nearly every surface, the challenge for advertisers is to break
through the clutter. ``A place where people have to stand still is
advertising Valhalla,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insite's primary competitor, Canadian-based Zoom Media, has
found the bathroom advertisements so popular with the public that
it routinely prints double or triple the number of posters so it
can give them away. For example, the ``And don't forget Flushing''
poster has sold out, presumably to the people of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The poster has also been nominated for an Obie advertising
award, a first for bathroom media, said Sheila Hayes,
communications director at the Outdoor Advertising Association.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom Media opened its first U.S. office in New York City a year
and a half ago, and now has a presence in eight U.S. cities and
throughout Canada. Last year, total revenues hit $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded by Gui Forten and Carl Grenier in 1991,
from a blueprint they developed in a senior-year business class at
the University of Montreal. Grenier, 32, said the idea was an
outgrowth of a public health campaign that used rest room
advertisements to urge students to perform self-examinations for
venereal disease. ``Everybody talked about them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the world was not quite ready for the bathroom advertising
back then. It took two years of sleeping in his car on business
trips and being teased by friends as a ``crazy washroom guy''
before Zoom Media landed major accounts from beer and condom
companies. Those ads brought results, Grenier said, and Zoom Media
now counts Volkswagen and General Motors among its clients. Now
they are spending $20,000 to see if the idea will fly in a Montreal
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Insite Advertising also began as a college fantasy. Miller was
inspired by the Jim Carrey movie, ``Opportunity Knocks,'' during
his college summer vacation in 1996. At one point in the film,
Carrey's character tells a company president that life's big
decisions are made in the bathroom, not the boardroom, Miller
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller returned for his senior year at the University of
Michigan, he developed the idea in a class on small business. ``The
professor thought I was crazy, but the students loved it,'' he
said. A month after graduating, he launched his business in New
York City with a partner, David Dorfman.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are dozens of regional companies that sell
bathroom advertisements locally, some for more than a decade,
Insite advertising narrowly beat out Zoom Media to be the first in
the United States to market itself to national advertisers. Local
advertising ``cheapens the medium'' with shoddy advertisements for
questionable establishments, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Its first year in business, Insite posted revenues of $300,000.
Miller said that he expects 1998 revenues to hit $4 million. The
company now has 20 employees and offers R.J. Reynolds, Rossignol
skis and Fox Searchlight Pictures exposure in stalls on both
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies have no interest in being seen in the john.
Food companies, high-end fashion designers, and the American
Association of Retired Persons are probably never going to be
convinced to advertise in rest rooms, Miller said. But he contended
that many companies already advertise in less pleasant locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some bars, the bathrooms are cleaner than the subway,''
said Miller, a New York City resident. ``I would rather see an ad
there than in the subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, most people don't mind a sales pitch in such an
intimate space. A study by Zoom Media found that 85 percent of bar
patrons in Montreal like the bathroom ads, and 12 percent are
indifferent. According to the study, only 2 percent of patrons
hated the ads.
</P>
<P>
   A spot survey of patrons in New York City bars found no
objections to the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a clean bathroom, I don't mind,'' said Erik Klein, a
25-year-old college psychology student. ``But I would prefer clever
graffiti.''

ADDICTED TO THE INTERNET OR JUST FASCINATED? 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By JEROME LUSSIER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joanna Curtis should have seen it coming. In the six
months after getting her Internet connection, she ran up a phone
bill of about $400 a month, on a $16,000 annual salary. During the
busiest months, Curtis, who lives in Brighton, England, was living
by West Coast time, which is eight hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   She spent all night chatting online with her Los Angeles
friends. But it was only when a close friend decided to open an
e-mail account because he could not reach her any other way, that
she realized she had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis is not alone, according to hundreds of articles published
in recent years. ``Internet addiction'' has received considerable
media attention, exposing a possible downside of the Internet at a
time when enthusiasm for the Web is high. The stories range from
college students dropping out of school to play online games to
mothers neglecting their children to chat, to employees getting
fired for spending too much time on Web sites unrelated to their
work.
</P>
<P>
   As in many psychological disorders, there are no objective
criteria for what constitutes an addiction. Internet use only
becomes a problem when it has severe repercussions, like the loss
of a job or relationship. The novelty effect must also be accounted
for, since real addictions do not just fade with time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most quoted experts on the so-called addiction is Dr.
Kimberley Young, who has a doctorate in psychology. Calling herself
the first ``cyberpsychologist,'' she conducted one of the first
studies of Internet addiction and is president of the Center for
Online Addiction, an online counseling service for so-called
Internet addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Web site proudly states that ``her research has
been featured in more than 510 newsprint publications,'' in which
she often mentions her book, ``Caught in the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Young's online clinic offers clients two forms of
counseling: a $15 e-mail reply, or a 50-minute chat room session
that costs $55. Although many critics have likened her practice to
Alcoholics Anonymous convening a 12-step meeting at a tavern, she
finds no contradiction in treating Internet addicts online.
Instead, she emphasizes the difficulty some people have in finding
competent therapists and the ease with which she can be contacted
through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   James Chriss, a sociology professor at Newman University, said
that ``the whole idea of 'addiction' to such things as gambling,
the Internet, etc., is basically a myth perpetuated by a particular
discipline _ psychology and other 'helping' professions _ which
serves to expand the areas of 'expertise' claimed by proponents of
these disciplines.''
</P>
<P>
   In his forthcoming book, ``Counseling and the Therapeutic
State,'' Chriss discusses ``the ways in which the language of
disease and addiction has infiltrated understandings of everyday
life, and why it is in the best economic interests of psychologists
and others to have us believe that such things are really
'addictions.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other psychologists have adopted a more cautious approach.
``There is healthy skepticism in the field about Internet
addiction,'' said Eric Zehr, a clinical psychologist and vice
president of Addiction and Behavioral Services at Proctor Hospital,
in Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association has not recognized
Internet addiction as an established disorder. Neither has the
American Psychiatric Association. ``But if you go back 50 or 60
years ago, people had the same reaction toward alcoholism,'' Zehr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he believes the addiction is real, Zehr says very
little research has been conducted on Internet addiction, and that
the number of cases remains very low. Proctor Hospital, one of the
country's most comprehensive treatment providers for addiction
disorders, has had fewer than 100 inquiries on the problem, with
fewer than 20 people ending up in treatment as outpatients. Zehr
said most cases turned out to be sexual, gambling or spending
addictions, for which the Internet is simply a new vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As for Curtis, she got over her problem alone, over the course
of the year. ``As my personal life gradually got sorted out, and I
became happier, the addiction gradually left me,'' she wrote in an
e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three years after her first Internet connection, she
works as Web master for the University of Sussex in Brighton. She
said she enjoyed every minute of her work but felt totally free to
leave it whenever she wanted. ``I guess that in a way you could say
my year of addiction taught me a new skill,'' she said, laughing.

   Mark Dahm, 37, a sales director in San Mateo, Calif., depends on
his mobile phone for far more than phone calls. He uses it to tap
into his contact list at work and to send and receive e-mail. He
retrieves stock quotes from the Internet and looks up directions
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   If he needs a printout, it's no problem. While waiting for a
flight at an airport executive lounge, he can send information from
his phone straight to the lounge's fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   Dahm, who works for a Web software company called the Inktomi
Corp., is a hardy, happy pioneer, equipped with a cellular phone
that can retrieve information from the World Wide Web and perform a
variety of other data services.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Dahm is a relatively rare specimen _ he uses a Samsung
Duette phone with Pocket Net from AT&AMP;T Wireless, but Pocket Net and
similar services have yet to build a large following. Last year
only 203,000, or 0.3 percent, of the 64 million cellular users in
the nation used Web-capable phones to pull information off the Web,
according to the International Data Corp., a market research
company in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``everything phone,'' or Web companion, as it is
sometimes called, is catching on. These new all-in-one
communications devices and organizers will be marketed in much
greater numbers and many more forms in coming months. ``In the next
couple of years, almost every phone will be Web-capable,'' said
Phillip Redman, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a technology
consulting firm in Boston, even though it remains an open question
whether people want to use their telephones to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do will not surf with their phones the same way they
can surf with desktops, notebooks, subnotebooks or Web TV. What
phone users will be able to get from the Web, analysts say, will be
bits and pieces of information, like the weather, stock quotes and
movie listings.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be able to conduct simple transactions, like
trading stock or buying movie tickets. For now, at least, no one
will be downloading MP3 music files to a phone or enjoying the new
``Star Wars'' trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with most phones becoming Web ready, the International Data
Corp. estimates that by 2002, the number of people using their
phones to get to the Web will rise to 6 million, or 5.6 percent of
108 million expected to be using cellular phones then.
</P>
<P>
   There are already a few phones on the market that are capable of
retrieving some information from the Internet. Among them are the
Mitsubishi Mobile Access 120 Series phone, the Samsung Duette (the
one Dahm uses), and Nokia's 9000il Communicator. The prices of the
phones vary from $100 to $700 and require a subscription to a
cellular carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, cellular companies offer packages of Internet-based
data, like news, stock quotes and weather, that can be delivered to
these phones. One of those companies is AT&AMP;T Wireless, which has a
Pocket Net service that works with either the Mitsubishi or Samsung
phones.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic offers something similar, its Cellscape service,
which sends information to the Mitsubishi phone. Unwired Planet, a
company based in Silicon Valley that makes software for Internet
delivery over wireless phones, lists other Web-enabled phones on
its www.Unwiredplanet.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   To use a Web phone to get Internet information, however, you
must be in a region that is served by the data network. That
includes most large metropolitan cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry will eventually take off,'' Redman said, ``but
it's waiting for the stars to really align.''
</P>
<P>
   The most critical of those stars, as Redman sees them, are the
ready availability of networks that support high transmission
speeds for data, handheld devices that are easy to use yet offer
many functions and, most important, applications specifically
designed for these devices.
</P>
<P>
   Software that offers specialized network services, like Internet
access and e-mail, is very likely to make the everything phone
attractive to a mass market, much as the cellular phone itself did
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I've got the network and the device, but what the
heck am I going to do with it?'' Redman said. ``And what will I
pay? Those are questions not fully answered. And those are the ones
companies are struggling to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be struggling, but they aren't hesitating. The number
of palm-size products coming on the market is surging. Those who
buy these phones will, however, find themselves participating in a
large and expensive field trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of marketing by experimentation going on out
there,'' said Bob Egan, research director at the Gartner Group, a
research and consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. ``There are lots of
people coming out with devices I call `one off' devices. They throw
them up against the wall and see what sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, based in San Diego, has two phones to throw at the
wall. This summer, Qualcomm will begin selling the PDQ Smart Phone
and the Thin Phone, both of which can retrieve information from the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The PDQ's most appealing characteristic is that when the phone
flips open, it is a dead ringer for the Palm III, the popular
handheld organizer from 3Com's Palm Computing division. In fact,
the PDQ is a hybrid creature that combines a Palm III and a digital
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   It supports Graffiti, a stylized form of handwriting used on
Palm devices, and it can share data with a desktop computer,
synchronizing information between the two machines.
</P>
<P>
   Its screen displays up to 11 lines of text, a vast improvement
over the standard four-line displays of most digital phones. But at
10 ounces, it is nearly twice as heavy as most cellular phones on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to pin down prices for the Web-capable phones
because each buyer will need to subscribe to a cellular carrier's
service, and some carriers are likely to offer the phones at
discounts. There will also be variation in how much the carriers
will charge for providing different kinds of information.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm hopes that people will be willing to pay a hefty price
for the PDQ phone. It has not released a price, but analysts expect
the PDQ to cost $500 to $1,000, depending on carrier subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much benefit to having the wireless Web link,''
said Paul E. Jacobs, president of Qualcomm consumer products. To
prove his point, Jacobs described a recent meeting with industry
analysts when he was able to use his mobile Web access to compare
the PDQ's battery life with that of a Nokia phone. ``I took my PDQ
and went to the Nokia Web site and found the numbers,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The PDQ's daintier sibling, the four-ounce Thin Phone, is more
limited. The screen is much smaller, showing four lines at a time,
and it has no built-in organizer. Analysts expect it to cost $100
to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Limits on Web surfing are common to all these devices. Most
companies offering Internet access from phones are quick to caution
prospective customers that what these devices do is a far cry from
Web surfing as most people understand the concept. Instead, they
retrieve small bits of Web text and simple graphics, reformatted to
fit onto a small screen. Palm Computing has coined a delicate
euphemism for what its products do: Web clipping.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Computing is coming out with its own Web device, called the
Palm VII, which can retrieve information from the Internet and do
two-way wireless messaging. The Palm VII will be available
``sometime in 1999,'' Palm Computing executives say. The Palm VII
does not have a phone and is expected to cost less than $800.
</P>
<P>
   With Palm Computing's Web clipping, you turn on the device and
are presented with a series of icons from sites like Moviefone,
Bank of America, Travelocity, E-Trade and Thestreet.com. If you are
looking for a stock quote, for instance, you click on an icon for
the E-trade Web site, fill in the ticker symbol and press Go.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII then retrieves the quote, or clipping, minus the
graphics-intensive trimmings usually included with a Web site.
Subscribers to the Palm VII Web services will pay $10 per month to
transfer approximately 100 clippings to the device, or $25 for 300
clippings. Using the Palm VII, you will be able to purchase plane
tickets, buy books or trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz is also building around a new company called Handspring.
Founded by the same entrepreneurs who invented the original Palm
Pilot, Handspring has been highly secretive about its plans.
Analysts expect the Handspring product to combine Palm technology,
which it has licensed, with a phone, creating a device aimed at
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other devices expected soon are slimmer than the
Palm VII and more versatile. One, a champagne-hued, palm-size,
six-ounce cellular phone called the Neopoint 1000, is expected to
be available early this summer. The Neopoint phone has Next
Generation written all over it. The elongated screen holds 11 lines
of text, and a speech recognition feature is integrated with the
phone's contact list.
</P>
<P>
   The phone comes with a docking station that lets you synchronize
information with your PC and recharge the phone battery at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Innovative Global Solution, the La Jolla, Calif., startup that
makes the Neopoint phone, says it subscribes to the ``simpler is
better'' notion of industrial design. That has impressed several
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole thing about the screen size, and about being
more versatile but still being simple to use, and they've hit
that,'' said Redman, of the Yankee Group. The phone will operate on
the Sprint PCS network and is expected to cost less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   Like nearly all other phones that are already on the market or
soon to arrive, the Neopoint phone uses wireless Web access
technology developed by Unwired Planet. Unlike the Palm VII, which
presents information in the standard HTML (hypertext markup
language) format used to build Web sites, Unwired Planet's software
gives a user access to the Web with a format called HDML, for
handheld device markup language.
</P>
<P>
   HDML deals only with text, which makes it simpler and therefore
easier to deliver to a relatively primitive cellular phone screen.
What the user sees is a hierarchical menu _ with each choice you
make, you delve deeper into a site.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is also the rollout period for a new crop of phones from
Motorola. The i1000 Plus, which will be available in six cities on
the Nextel digital cellular network by the end of the year. It will
integrate a digital phone, an alphanumeric pager, a two-way radio,
an e-mail device and a microbrowser into a five-ounce cellular
phone. It will cost around $250.
</P>
<P>
   When set in Net mode, the Motorola phone fires up the Unwired
Planet microbrowser and takes the user to a Web portal maintained
by Netscape and Nextel. That portal sends customized information _
snippets of weather or financial news or stock quotes _ to the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   One new company, called Air Flash, is developing a $5-per-month
service that uses speech recognition to send, say, movie schedules,
stock quotes and phone directory information from the Web to
digital cellular phones. Air Flash, a startup in Redwood City,
Calif., introduced its technology at the Demo Mobile Conference in
Coronado, Calif., earlier this week. The service will be available
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Demo Mobile Conference this week, General Magic, a
software company in Sunnyvale, Calif., unveiled a ``voice agent''
application that can, for instance, be used to bid for items at an
online auction site from a cellular phone using voice commands. The
service will be available later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, of Yankee Group, contends that people are willing to get
information services, but they are not willing to buy them. A
Yankee Group survey found that consumers were interested in getting
Web-based weather, directions, traffic conditions and directory
information, but that more than one-third said they would not be
willing to pay an additional monthly fee for such information.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the questions of market acceptance, there are still
technical hurdles to overcome. Standards for sending data from Web
sites to wireless devices are still evolving. Cellular carriers are
busily enhancing their networks to carry data at higher speeds, but
in the meantime most transmission speeds remain relatively
snail-like: about 9,600 bits per second, which is considerably more
sluggish than a bottom-rung modem running at 14.4 kilobits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   And different digital cellular networks operate on different and
incompatible standards; a phone that works on the Sprint PCS
network, for instance, will not necessarily function on others.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies that make wireless devices will continue to
come up with solutions in search of a demand. ``Everyone believes
the market will segment, but no one knows how big those segments
are or what they look like,'' said Jacobs, of Qualcomm. ``Is it
just a phone with a standard screen, or a big screen? Is it even a
laptop with an embedded wireless modem, or something altogether
different we haven't thought of?''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, all the world's a test site.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to technology and a retired baseball coach with an
engineering degree, kids of all ages have a new way to answer one
of life's most pressing questions: how fast can they throw a
baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The coach, Albert E. Dilz, 68, has created a tiny radar device
that attaches to the back of a baseball glove and measures the
velocity of an incoming ball. Dilz, of Cincinnati, calls his
invention Glove Radar and plans to start selling it for $79.95.
</P>
<P>
   Glove Radar is not only small and durable but also inexpensive:
it will sell for less than half the price of radar guns. It uses
standard Doppler radar to measure the speed of the ball through the
mitt and, Dilz said, is as reliable as Roger Clemens in the clutch.
Dilz said the device was accurate to within one mile per hour,
compared with the more industrial strength radar guns.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball scouts started using radar guns around
1980 to gauge the speed of pitches and the arm strength of
prospective major league players. The early high-end versions cost
$2,000, while consumers could buy a lower-end version for $500.
</P>
<P>
   The prices have been dropping as technology has improved and
become less expensive. Today, a professional model from the Jugs
Pitching Machine Co. in Tualatin, Ore., costs $750; another model
costs $295. The main difference between the models is range; the
more expensive model has a range of 200 to 300 feet, compared with
55 feet for the cheaper model.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to measure velocity is the Rawlings
``speed-sensing'' baseball ($39.99 in some stores) with a microchip
to calculate the time the ball travels a set distance.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of standard radar guns say they are unsure about
the Glove Radar. They say it is too soon to know whether the glove
gauge is as accurate as Dilz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how it's going to read through a mitt,'' said
Gordon Close, president of Sport Electronics in Chicago, though he
added that he has not had time to look at the Glove Radar.
Prospective competitors also wonder whether Glove Radar can survive
when a fast ball smacks into the glove's webbing, to which the
gadget is attached. Dilz said he had put padding around his Glove
Radar to protect it against a direct hit.
</P>
<P>
   Dilz cautions players against ruining their arms by trying to
register the highest possible speed on his diminutive radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is sensitive to how fast they throw,'' Dilz said.
``We want to impress on users' coaches to please emphasize the
importance of proper warm-up and conditioning before turning the
ball loose.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea behind the radar was not to encourage baseball
players to throw hard, but to encourage good technique. A longtime
coach of Little Leaguers and young adults, Dilz said that if
baseball players used good technique, their throws would be faster.
Therefore, players will be able to mark improvements in their
technique by watching their velocities improve.

WHAT WRITERS AND PROGRAMMERS HAVE IN COMMON: HYPERTEXT

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Nearly everyone at the conference at Brown
University here looked the same, with drab shirts and pants, shaggy
hair, unfashionably comfortable shoes and the aura of people who
spend altogether too much time in front of computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Only their vocabularies set them apart. One group talked about
marginalization, ``technological impermanence'' and the potential
of ``kinetic literature.'' The others talked about ``users,''
``scalability'' and business plans.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, called Technology Platforms for 21st Century
Literature, was a kind of summit meeting for nerds from two
disciplines: writers devoted to one of the sidestreams of
contemporary literature _ hypertext or hypermedia _ met with the
toolmakers for such writing _ systems architects, software
developers and producers of handheld electronic books.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coover, a creative writing professor at Brown, organized
the three-day conference, which began April 7.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of hypertext, an art form that depends on computers as
completely as writing once depended on pen and ink, is to let
readers choose their own plot lines by clicking on hyperlinks
embedded in text _ the ``Choose Your Own Adventure'' children's
books do much the same thing on paper. Hypermedia takes hypertext a
step further, using images, video, animation and audio recordings
to create fiction or poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Those who write in hypertext or hypermedia are on the fringe, a
location that most unflinchingly accept. Since 1992, when Coover
wrote an essay about hypertext titled ``The End of Books'' that
appeared in The New York Times Book Review, writers of hypertext
have been berated for creating works that it seems no one wants to
read.
</P>
<P>
   Sven Birkerts, in his book ``The Gutenberg Elegies'' (Fawcett
Columbine, 1995), complained that reading hypertext was akin to
testing one's reflexes in a video arcade. Laura Miller, the New
York editorial director for the online magazine Salon, asked in a
New York Times book review last year why anyone would want to read
nonlinearly, with hyperlinks constantly diverting one's attention.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, such critics asked, can people possibly lose
themselves in a book when they are reading on a computer screen?
</P>
<P>
   People who create hypertext believe that mainstream audiences
will eventually appreciate their work. But for now, they consider
such criticism a necessary accompaniment to the cutting edge, to
the creation of art for art's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't worry about being unread,'' said Diane Greco, a
hypertext author who is working toward a doctorate in the history
of science and technology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But they do worry about having the tools to write. So Coover, an
indefatigable champion of hypertext, organized the three-day
conference to bring the writers together with the people who make
the software. It's his latest foray onto the creative edge.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Coover has taken risks with books like
``The Public Burning,'' first published in 1977 (Grove Press,
1997), which included fantastic but nevertheless scandalous
descriptions of public figures who were still living, like Richard
Nixon. ``We're augmenting the dialogue between the people who are
using the tools and those who are creating them,'' Coover said.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of traditional literature, the notion that there is
even a need for such communication sounds strange. Authors of
yesteryear probably had little desire to roll up their
shirtsleeves, sit down with typewriter manufacturers and talk about
their work. Even today, most writers aren't likely to have much
interest in getting together with the programmers of Microsoft Word
to chat about code.
</P>
<P>
   But hypertext writers are a different lot. Take Stuart
Moulthrop, one of the first hyptertext authors, who spoke at the
conference. As he unveiled his latest virtual-reality project _ one
that gave readers the chance to roam through computerized
renderings of coastal and planetary landscapes that accompanied the
story line _ Moulthrop sounded a lot like the sleep-deprived
computer geek who has become an emblem of late-20th-century
culture. ``It takes months of your life to build these little
worlds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although hypertext writers do not worry about a lack of
readers, they do worry, Ms. Greco said, about ``being unreadable''
_ not hard to understand or difficult to read, but literally
unreadable. Hypertext, unlike plain old books, can be inaccessible
for technical as well as literary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The writers wonder whether the software they are using may
someday become extinct. They want better tools, ones that will
enable them to create works filled with text, images and animated
elements that do not require interruptive downloads. They want
applications that will enable them to collaborate at a distance at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   In a hypertext presentation here, the words ``gimme, gimme,
gimme'' floated across the screen. It's a phrase that hypertext
writers use to poke fun at their never-ending appetite for new
tools.
</P>
<P>
   But until now, software developers have not been paying much
attention. A few companies have tried to help, like Eastgate
Systems in Watertown, Mass., which produces software for hypertext
writing and publishes new works. But for the most part,
technologists had little interest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So bringing more than a half-dozen software developers to Brown
to talk about hypertext was seen as something of a coup for Coover,
who gives credit to his friend Jeffrey Ballowe, former president of
the Ziff-Davis Interactive Media and Development Group, for pulling
them together.
</P>
<P>
   The developers included Marc Canter, the founder of Macromedia;
Miko Matsumura, Sun Microsystems' former primary marketer for the
Java programming language; Martin F. Eberhard, the chief executive
officer of Nuvomedia, which produces the electronic Rocketbook, and
the developers of new programs called the Brain, Emphemeris and
Trellix, which help people keep texts, links and images organized
on line. A representative from Microsoft also attended, to stay on
top of trends in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sessions required attendees to endure technical
glitches as they squinted at projections from computer screens.
Meanwhile, the temperature outside reached nearly 70 degrees, and
blue skies beckoned. Some attendees trickled out of the dark
auditorium, but most stayed put.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Wittig, a professor of design at at the Illinois Institute
of Technology in Chicago, said he was staying put because he
finally had a chance to learn about tools that might help him
improve his hypertext presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the feeling that this is a real landmark conference,''
said Wittig, who founded an online literary bulletin board called
IN.S.OMNIA. ``The technology is over some sort of hump this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard, the developer of the Rocketbook, shared the same
optimism. He said that he had never been to a hypertext conference
before but that the time now seemed right. He figured that if the
main criticism of hypertext was the unappealing thought of reading
it on a computer screen, then his electronic book might be the
answer. He spent most of the evening of April 8 in a huddle of
people, passing around his new product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm creating a mechanism for them to put their work where
people can read it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cheerful interchanges, whether the convergence of
technologists and hypertext writers will actually help the field of
hypertext remains an open question. Most of the software
demonstrated on April 8 was designed for use by business people,
with just a few features that might be useful in organizing fiction
or publishing poetry.
</P>
<P>
   By today, it became clear that one of the problems with
producing hypertext wasn't necessarily a lack of communication
between techies and writers but a rift that exists among the
writers themselves _ between those who feel a need to be utterly
technologically savvy and those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans of hypertext, particularly those who started
electronic writing before the dawn of the Web, said they were
reconciled to the fact that they would have to do their own
computer programming if they wanted complete flexibility as
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who make pots grind their own glaze,'' said David
Durand, a doctoral student in computer science at Brown. ``They
know all the temperatures at which you fire clay. Artists want an
extra level of control, and it may come at a price.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edward Falco, editor of a hypertext journal called The New
River, said he couldn't help fantasizing about not having to worry
about which software to use or what code to write. ``Sometimes,''
he said, as heads nodded around him, ``I just want to take the
tools and go away and write.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a few people who said that despite the upbeat nature
of the conference, something was missing: a conversation not about
the technology, not about the burdens of writing, but about the
people who might actually be reading their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so absorbed in creating this stuff ourselves,'' said
Catherine C. Marshall, a researcher at the Fuji Xerox Palo Alto
Laboratory in Silicon Valley, ``that we forget that there is a
tenable thing called a reader.'' &QL;

   Q. Sometimes when I put my iMac to sleep, it won't wake up when
I want it to. How can I fix that?
</P>
<P>
   A. With the Macintosh operating system, putting your computer to
sleep means putting it in a low-power state. The screen will go
dark, but any files and programs that are open will stay that way
until you wake up the machine by hitting any key. You can put the
Mac to sleep manually with the Sleep option under the Special menu
or set your Energy Saver control panel to put the machine to sleep
after a specified period of inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer refuses to wake up without rebooting, there are
a number of things that could be causing a problem. Run a
third-party utility software or the Disk First Aid program (found
on the system software CD-ROM) on your hard drive and repair any
disk corruption the program finds. Screen savers or security
software might also interfere with the Energy Saver control panel.
If you have these installed, try turning them off and see if the
computer wakes up normally after sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech Info Library on Apple's Web site lists a number of
other troubleshooting steps at the
til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n30894 page. While on the
Apple site, you may want to go to the Software Updates
(www.info.apple.com/swupdates), click on Fast Search for iMac
updates and download the iMac Firmware Update. That patch is
supposed to help prevent iMac start-up problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a random sampling of recently published ``celebrity''
books for children, ranked in approximate order of literary quality
and entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Dr. White,'' by Jane Goodall (North-South Books, $15.95):
The woman associated with studying chimpanzee behavior proves she
knows a lot about children's psyches. Dr. White, a furry little
dog, helps critically ill kids until a misguided health inspector
tries to chase the pooch/physician out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The Meanest Thing to Say,'' by Bill Cosby (Scholastic Inc.,
$13.95): Cosby, who holds a doctorate in education from the
University of Massachusetts, has crafted a wonderful series of
stories about the ways kids can solve problems. ``Meanest Thing''
may be the best, when lead character ``Little Bill'' has to decide
whether to be nasty back to a new kid at school.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``What's Heaven?'' by Maria Shriver (Golden Books, $15):
Shriver's writing skills are impressive. If her personal religious
beliefs sometimes seem overstressed, at least there is no doubt
about her sincerity in helping children understand how deceased
loved ones can live on in their family members' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Count Me In,'' by Cal Ripken Jr. with Greg Brown (Taylor
Publishing, $14.95): Baseball's Iron Man reminds kids to work hard
for their dreams. Some baseball terms won't mean much to youngsters
who don't follow the sport, but then they probably wouldn't be
reading a Cal Ripken book anyway.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``The Jolly Mon,'' by Jimmy Buffett and Savannah Jane Buffett
(Harcourt Brace, $16): The story is pretty good, but the
illustrations by Lambert Davis are much, much better. Apparently
this is a tale told often over the Buffett family dinner table
(Savannah Jane is Jimmy's daughter). At least he's not sending kids
to ``Margaritaville.''
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Halley Came to Jackson,'' by Mary Chapin Carpenter
(HarperCollins, $15.95): The ``Halley'' in question is the comet.
The story is ``very'' basic, but the book comes with a cassette of
Chapin Carpenter singing a similar tale.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Dr. Laura Schlessinger's Why Do You Love Me?'' by Laura
Schlessinger with Martha Lambert (HarperCollins, $15.95): The
Schlessinger ego is evident throughout, including putting the
author's name first in the title. Why would that mean anything to
children? Obviously, the talk-show host thinks Mommy and Daddy will
be doing the book-buying _ and it's hard to believe many kids would
enjoy this awkwardly written tale of a child wondering why Mom
loves him, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Today I Feel Silly &AMP; Other Moods That Make My Day,'' by
Jamie Lee Curtis (HarperCollins, $15.95): Run from this, just like
Jamie Lee ran from the killer in ``Halloween.'' The rhymes are
stilted, the humor is forced and the make-a-face cutout at book's
end rips way too easily.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``The Teddy Bears' Picnic,'' arranged and performed by Jerry
Garcia and David Grisman (HarperCollins, $14.95): This is another
singer's book with an accompanying song tape. It's nothing more
than the words to the venerable old ``Teddy Bear's Picnic'' tune
with some matching illustrations. It was bad enough that Garcia
spent some of his last days helping peddle ties. Unless your 3- or
4-year-old is a Deadhead, this one's a must to avoid, as another
old song suggests.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Budgie Goes to Sea,'' by Her Royal Highness the Duchess of
York (Aladdin, $5.99): ``Budgie'' is a helicopter who saves people
from certain disaster. But he can't save this book. Simplistic,
pedantic, boring _ you come up with a negative adjective, any
negative adjective, and it will apply.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At Stuyvesant High School on a Friday not long ago,
students in Nautica jackets and flared jeans lounged in the
hallways and played with a football on their way to class. In the
library, seniors finished last-minute revisions of their college
essays.
</P>
<P>
   Under a poster bearing the school's computer-use policy,
Beatrice Jason, a 14-year-old freshman, logged into her school
e-mail account. ``I never had e-mail before I got to Stuyvesant,''
she said. Now she corresponds with friends, sends homework to
teachers, and asks college professors for help with social studies
projects.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of schools now include Internet access in their
services to students, and the New York City Board of Education
hopes to provide a citywide e-mail system for its students by
September. But in a city of overcrowded classrooms and outdated
textbooks, schools' use of e-mail shows both the possibilities of
innovation and the persistence of old problems in a new era _ lack
of money, the schools' responsibility for sheltering children while
also teaching them, and basic questions about how children learn.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two percent of New York City public school students live
in areas of concentrated poverty, and according to the most recent
state survey, the city school system has only 7.7 computers per 100
students, compared to an average of 12.2 per 100 students
statewide. Many students' only exposure to modern information
technology is through school-based computer access.
</P>
<P>
   Technology advocates can be so enthusiastic about the Internet's
ability to give students access to new sources of knowledge that
they make textbooks sound superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had the choice I wouldn't have the Internet or e-mail in
my school, I'd have a Concorde jet,'' said James Bosco, Chairman of
the Board of the Consortium for School Networking, a national
educational technology group. ``Well, I don't think that's in the
cards. The next best bet is for kids to encounter the world via
contact with other kids, and that's one of the best things that
e-mail can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But as anyone with an e-mail account and an over-enthusiastic
friend knows, e-mail has many uses. Students may spend less time
sending e-mail to far-off professors than reading the latest Monica
jokes. The possibility of such jokes also touches on problems like
child protection and online censorship that concern parents,
educators, and civil-liberties experts.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages and limitations of the Internet are clear at
Stuyvesant, an elite public school on the Hudson River. For
instance, a math teacher, Danny Jaye, uses a class Web page to post
homework problems, reviews, and even test grades using student
identification numbers.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is also a one of his teaching tools. ``If students have a
problem with the homework, they're not hesitant to e-mail me and
ask for help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The correspondence goes both ways: ``Whenever they're absent or
if I want to get in touch with a student, I have their e-mail
address. It's less intrusive than calling them at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those e-mails do go home, however. Jaye estimated that
80 percent of his students ask him to send e-mail to accounts
outside Stuyvesant. Students are quick to disparage their school
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a free e-mail address from Hotmail or Yahoo,''
said senior Adam Ostoasewski, 16, ``so what's the point?'' Tatiana
Schnurr, a 17-year-old senior in Jaye's calculus class, prefers her
home e-mail account, but she appreciates the class Web page. ``It's
useful and easy to use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalton School, a high-tech, high-cost private school on the
Upper East Side, aspires to integrate e-mail directly into
students' education. But the school's motive is not
intercontinental correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access to the outside world wasn't really the initial purpose
of our electronic mail, and it still isn't,'' said Wolfgang
Heidmann, Dalton's technology director.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the school used its e-mail program to set up an
internal conference system, with subjects ranging from sports to
ethical problems. All sixth-grade students receive e-mail accounts
to use throughout their high school years, and most of the
conferences have no limits on who can participate.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Sheridan, who teaches a senior course on Shakespeare and
monitors the class' e-mail conference, said that ``the conferences
are seen as an extension of the classroom,'' allowing shy students
to share their thoughts and inviting all students to continue
discussions. One 24-hour ``thread'' on the Shakespeare conference
comprised 15 postings from five students and Ms. Sheridan.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Fruchter, of New York University's Institute for Education
and Social Policy, agrees that computers can be helpful. but he
cautioned that ``the primary difference is still the quality of
teachers in the classroom, including what they do with
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers must also play a crucial role in insuring that online
behavior follows the rules of classroom behavior. ``The approach to
behavior that is not tolerated online should be the same as it is
for behavior that is not tolerated off-line,'' said Alex Fowler of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet policy group.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dalton School, Ms. Sheridan said that part of her e-mail
duties is peace-keeping. ``Every conference is monitored by an
adult, so if there's an unfortunate remark the adult can remove
that remark and warn the student to pay attention to the protocols
of the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most school e-mail systems have policies detailing ``acceptable
use'' of their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Obscenity is a standard, if ill-defined, prohibition. Other
areas are more fuzzy. The Board of Education's current Internet
usage policy prohibits the use of e-mail accounts to send or
receive personal messages, while Stuyvesant's policy has no such
prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Elspeth Taylor, who oversees the board of education's technology
program, says that as e-mail becomes more widespread, her policy
will have to change: ``I don't think anyone really believes that no
e-mail messages are going to be on the system for personal
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Practices such as the removal of offensive material from
postings raises civil liberties issues. Bill Stamatis, who studies
the Internet for the United Federation of Teachers, said there will
be conflicts over management, free speech, and privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is e-mail the property of the Board of Ed?'' he asked. ``Who
has a right to it?'' School administrators may want to screen
messages teachers send to students or read e-mail newsletters
produced by children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The board of education's experience with e-mail provides another
cautionary note. The Strategic Technology Plan of 1997 called for
$2.1 billion in improvements, including full networking of schools
and 130,000 new computers, or at least one computer for every eight
students, about the statewide average.
</P>
<P>
   The board of education says it will wire at least five
classrooms in every school building to the Internet by September,
with the help of $55 million in federal grants. But the board has
not yet found the money for many other parts of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   And school-based e-mail? At the beginning of this semester, Ms.
Taylor of the board of education said she planned to put into place
a citywide system by September, providing every student from the
4th through 12th grades with an account. Now, realizing the
difficulties of designing such an extensive system and the lack of
money for staff support, she is not as optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interest in going to e-mail,'' she said, ``but
we're not sure how we're going to do it.''
</P>

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a water stain on the ceiling of my upstairs bedroom
which is apparently due to a roof leak. I cannot seem to locate the
source even though I inspected all roof flashing and shingles over
the area where the leak appears and patched every place that looked
even the least bit doubtful. The leak still shows up after every
heavy rain. My attic is unfinished, but it is insulated and I
cannot see any places where daylight shines through or where there
is any kind of crack or open seam. What can you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   A: Roof leaks are often very difficult to locate because water
does not necessary fall straight down through a hole or open seam.
In many cases water that seeps in can travel horizontally along
roof sheathing or even the underside of a rafter as shown here
until it runs down a stud or other structural member. Then it may
travel further along that joist or beam until it finally drips down
onto the ceiling below. Finding the source of the leak may require
crawling into the attic during a heavy rain storm (or while someone
is running a hose over that part of the roof) and shining a bright
light under the roof. Pull off insulation to expose the roof
sheathing and rafters if necessary, then start near the eaves and
move your light upwards to see where the water, or a damp spot,
first appears. Then follow the path of the water back up to see
where it originates.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My home is heated with radiant heat and the heating pipes are
embedded in the ceiling plaster. There is also a circulating fan
that moves the heated air throughout the rooms. My problem is that
cracks have formed in the ceiling due to the heating pipes and
although I cleaned these cracks out and resurfaced them with
conventional plaster the cracks have reappeared. Is there some
special kind of plaster or a porous tape I can place over the
cracks before I repaint again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Plaster, or patching plaster, is not the best material to use
for filling cracks. Normally a vinyl base spackling compound is
used for maximum bonding power, and for best insurance against
further cracking. However, if there is a continual problem with
cracking, due to expansion and contraction of the heating pipes,
then you would probably be better off applying a fiberglass tape
that is sold for this purpose in most hardware stores and home
centers. This bridges the cracks and is then covered with a special
type of patching compound that dries semi-flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are dark stains in the corners of several rooms in my
house as well as in the middle of one wall. There is also a similar
dark stain in one corner of the basement near the back of the
house. What could be causing these stains?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds as though you have a mildew problem due to moisture
inside the walls. This could be caused by one or more leaks in your
outside walls, or in the caulking around the outside. You should go
over the outside carefully to look for cracks or open joints, as
well as possible missing or cracked caulking around window and door
frames.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The people that owned this house before we bought it added on
an extra room. This room had plain brick around the outside,
although the rest of the house was covered with yellow brick. They
painted the new brick yellow to match the original and now this
paint is all peeling and looks awful. One contractor suggested
using a gel remover and pressure washing to get the old paint off,
but this would be messy. Another suggested sandblasting and then
tuck pointing. This would cost $1,500. Is this reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you are asking if the cost is reasonable, then there is no
way I can answer since it would depend on the size of the areas and
many other variables that I know nothing about. If you are asking
does this seem a reasonable way to get the paint off, then I can
say it would work, but you must be sure the contractor knows what
he is doing. If sandblasting is not done carefully and by an
experienced professional who has done this work before, it can do
considerable damage to the brick and to the mortar joints.

BALANCING DANGERS AND DISCOVERIES AS KIDS GO ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CIR-SCHOOLS-WEB) 
(mk) 
 By SIMON RODBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The image of a cherubic fourth-grader sending e-mail
to a cherubic fourth-grader in another school is a heartwarming
reminder of the promise of the Internet. The image of a cherubic
fourth-grader unwittingly sending e-mail to a pedophile, or finding
pornography or hate speech on the World Wide Web, is a chilling
reminder of the technological dangers that many parents and
teachers fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every good and bad thing about the human condition is in some
way on the Internet,'' said James Bosco, chairman of the board of
the Consortium for School Networking, a nonprofit group based in
Washington that promotes the use of educational technology. The
challenge for schools that provide e-mail and Internet access is to
set policies that allow the first scenario to happen and prevent
the second.
</P>
<P>
   The two main tools available, filter technology and policies
that define ``acceptable use'' of the Internet, are not infallible.
But many educators view the challenge of acceptable use as an
educational opportunity, not a danger _ as long as the education
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a system we do filtering of e-mail, and we always will do
some filtering,'' said Elspeth Taylor, chief information officer of
the New York City Board of Education, ``but we do recognize the
limitations of filtering.'' Filtering programs, which block e-mail
and access to Web sites containing certain key words or phrases,
are often criticized because they can't keep up with the
fast-changing Internet and because they accidentally block valuable
sites and e-mail along with offensive material.
</P>
<P>
   The computer administrators at Stuyvesant High School view their
filtering program as secondary to their acceptable-use policy,
which prohibits obscene and offensive material. All students must
sign the policy, and Steve Kramer, the school's assistant principal
for technology services, says ``there has been extraordinarily
little infraction of the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Stamatis, an Internet expert for the United Federation
of Teachers, says that teachers will not always know what their
students are doing. ``Kids are very smart, and most kids know more
about the Web than most teachers,'' he said. ``They'll find ways to
be heard, and who's going to control it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bosco said, ``the welfare of the child is the
prerogative and responsibility of the parent.'' Parents may not
know as much as their children about the Internet, but they need to
have a sense of their children's online whereabouts and companions;
in that sense, virtual reality is not so different from regular
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent,'' he adds, ``I have to struggle to see to it that
my kids have the kind of values that make them more inclined to go
to the good stuff than to the bad stuff.''

THE CEILING IS THE LIMIT ON BEDS

<P>
   The place of repose has reached new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman complained that her dog now has to get a running
start from the hallway to be able to leap on the bed,'' said Lee
Sinclair, the director of marketing for Kingsdown, a North Carolina
mattress manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The decorator Mario Buatta expects lap dogs to have trouble
getting up on beds. But he is appalled to note that his clients are
requesting step stools so they can reach them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These beds are so high they look ridiculous,'' said Buatta,
who believes the extra size throws a room out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   These days a bed can be a yard high, with 20 inches for the
plushest mattress, plus the box spring and an 11-inch-high frame.
Put that bed in a room with an eight-foot ceiling and, he said,
``The bedrooms look like this vast sea of bed and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a problem that is facing shoppers like the actress Swoosie
Kurtz who, after years of sleeping on a fold-out couch, splurged on
a fantasy bed last year. She ordered a custom-made king-size
mattress and box spring, and hired a woodworker to build an
elaborate headboard and frame, along with matching side tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `How thick will the mattress be?' '' she
recalled. ``And I said, `I don't know, standard size.'''
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Kurtz did not realize is that deluxe mattresses have
been expanding from 10 inches to as much as 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bed arrived, the whole thing was waist high,'' she
said. ``I felt like I was climbing into a bunk bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, she said, but the new mattress covered up half of
her new headboard.
</P>
<P>
   How did Ms. Kurtz, now starring on Broadway in ``The Mineola
Twins,'' solve the problem? ``We chopped the legs off the frame,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As today's mattress manufacturers compete to outdo one another
in comfort, adding more and more layers of padding, the ceiling has
become the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Two phenomena are pushing beds higher than they've ever been
lifted before. First, mass-market furniture makers have been
compelled to build taller headboards to accommodate the bigger
mattresses. ``We've had to raise the height of headboards by five
to seven inches, so the pillows won't fall off,'' explained Korie
Trevino, the product development director for the Fashion Bed
Group, a Chicago-based manufacturer. Similarly, Crate and Barrel
has added 10 inches to its Mission headboards.
</P>
<P>
   Further exacerbating this situation, furniture designers are
taking historical inspiration from the romantic look of antique
metal beds, which were as much as 11 inches off the floor, for
pragmatic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanted the bed high off the ground because of rodents and
vermin crawling around, or because there were floods and homes
didn't have drainage,'' said Linda Allen, an owner of the Charles
P. Rogers Co. in New York City, founded in 1855, which makes
reproduction antique brass and metal beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was the chamber pot issue,'' she added. ``You could
shove it under the bed.'' Before central heating or
air-conditioning, higher beds also offered better air circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Crate and Barrel and the Pottery Barn have gotten into this
pyramid scheme. ``It's old-fashioned and romantic,'' said Celia
Tejada, the vice president for design of Pottery Barn, describing
the company's new four-poster pine-bed rails that are 10{ inches
off the floor. Add a new mattress and a box spring, and the
showroom model is a Jack-and-the-beanstalk 30 inches off the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   So, how are people actually supposed to get into bed? ``We're
going to be selling rustic looking stools made in Indonesia,'' Ms.
Tejada said.
</P>
<P>
   What many new bed owners find particularly annoying is that
their old sheets no longer fit. ``My sheets only go half-way down
the mattress,'' said Nancy Porter, a documentary filmmaker based in
Boston. ``The bed looks undressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattress makers hear complaints all the time. Robert Malin,
Serta's vice president of marketing, said: ``One of our biggest
reasons for returns is that the bed's too high. People call and
say, `I'm really disappointed, this is much higher than I want it
to be.'''
</P>
<P>
   If a customer belatedly discovers that the mattress is too high,
the odds are good that he or she paid top dollar for it. Serta's
lowest-priced line, mattresses that sell for $799 or less, are from
9 inches to 13 inches thick. Up-market models, costing as much as
$4,300, are as thick as 18 inches _ thanks to additional foam
padding and upholstery.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Sealy, the nation's largest maker of mattresses,
has its own downsizing program to offset the thickness of its
top-of-the-line mattresses. This fall, it will introduce a new box
spring that is only four inches high, instead of the standard
seven. ``The feedback we were getting is that people like to sit on
the bed and talk on the phone,'' said David McIlquham, Sealy's vice
president of sales and marketing. ``This will drop the height.''
</P>
<P>
   The Better Sleep Council, an industry trade group, recently
conducted exhaustive interviews with women who had purchased new,
thicker mattresses. ``They loved them,'' said Andrea Herman, the
council's director. ``They said the beds made them feel like
princesses. There was a feeling of nostalgia _ they felt like a
child, safe and secure in a big bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although men were not surveyed by the Better Sleep Council,
random queries produced a less enthusiastic response about this
race to the top. Perhaps the gender difference arises because men
tend to like to dominate their surroundings, which is hard to do
with one of these titanic beds.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Horowitz, an editor at New York magazine, said: ``What's
ironic is that the baby boom generation started with our beds and
mattresses on the floor. My wife bought this new bed, and now we're
so high we can't see the TV. What's next, mounting the TV on the
ceiling, just like a hospital room, preparing us for old age?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, old age may well be the cure for the desire for
towering bedsteads. Richard Ralston is the senior vice president
for sales of the steel products division of Leggett &AMP; Platt in
Carthage, Mo., which makes bed frames and rails ranging from 5.5
inches to 18 inches high. ``We're now selling lower frames to
elderly people, who can't get into these high beds,'' he said. ``So
as the baby boomers age, I think we're going to see a swing back to
lower beds.''
</P>
<P>
   One consolation is the age-old wisdom: what goes up must come
down.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   COVERING UP
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren's fitted sheets will accommodate
mattresses up to 14 inches tall. Anything above that eliminates
most brands and limits the choice of colors and patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Bed Bath and Beyond sells one sheet, Elite Sateen by Wamsutta
(queen fitted, $54.99), that will fit an 18-inch mattress. ABC
Carpet and Home also has one sheet that will fit that size _ Palais
Royal's Sateen (queen fitted, $180) in white or ivory. However, ABC
can outfit a 17-inch mattress with a white or ivory pattern called
Celeste by Sferra Brothers (queen fitted, $120).
</P>
<P>
   ``Guaranteed to fit all mattresses'' or ``extra-deep fitted'' do
not necessarily mean what they say. Some Wamsutta and Fieldcrest
patterns fit a 13- to 15-inch mattress, but check the package
insert carefully for exact size.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart has a solution: using a flat sheet, not a fitted
one, and going up a size. (If you have a king size, you're out of
luck.)
</P>
<P>
   The next step is custom-made sheets. Frette, at 799 Madison
Ave., custom fits all bottom sheets (starting at $290 for queen
size). Fine Linens by Oswald, at 1193 Lexington Ave., custom makes
bed linens (queen sizes start at $95) in a wide choice of colors
and patterns.
</P>
<P>
   If finding a sheet is difficult, try finding a blanket ample
enough to tuck in all around.

GOVERNMENT ENLISTS MASS MEDIA TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ More than ever before, the government wants
to change the way people think. Public officials are spending
billions of dollars on advertising campaigns, even buying expensive
commercials on prime-time television.
</P>
<P>
   It's called social marketing _ part behavioral science, part
propaganda, part Madison Avenue _ and it has become the most
popular political antidote to society's many shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Don't drink. Don't smoke. Breast-feed your child. Car pool.
Buckle your seat belt. Don't use methamphetamines. Be a good daddy.
Be a good mommy. Don't beat your wife. Listen to your children.
Talk to your children. Eat your vegetables. Don't fight on the
playground. Mentor someone. Don't have sex. If you have sex, use a
condom. Recycle.
</P>
<P>
   These are just some of the recent California campaigns, funded
by state taxpayers and a cigarette surcharge, at a cost of about
$220 million since 1997. California has spent $634 million alone in
the past decade to combat tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an unprecedented amount of money is about to be unleashed
in the largest behavior-changing campaigns in American history.
</P>
<P>
   It's all thanks to the recent settlement with tobacco companies
and a Clinton administration push to discourage drug use among
children.
</P>
<P>
   Some $2.45 billion is budgeted for the anti-drug and
anti-tobacco advertising campaigns over the next five years.
Several Madison Avenue ad companies have created social marketing
divisions to win the government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of budgets we're looking at today are unheard of. In
the past, it was nothing like this,'' said Ed Maibach, social
marketing director for Porter Novelli, a pioneer in the field and
partner with the White House to help produce the federal, $195
million-a-year anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the government is actually purchasing
prime-time TV space, when for decades it simply counted on the
benevolence of networks to run public service ads when they could.
Predictably, most ads have been buried in late night slots.
</P>
<P>
   Few people question the underlying motives for these campaigns.
Society benefits when people drive sober, avoid cigarettes, have
safe sex, get a prostate cancer test and use seat belts. (In New
York City, the disembodied voices of celebrities like Joan Rivers
greet taxi passengers, reminding them to buckle up.)
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of tiny campaigns that are so low-budget or so
obscure that most people never hear about them. They seem to come
and go almost on a whim, like a recent U.S. State Department ad
reminding people they need to get a passport before traveling
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the major campaigns, hundreds of millions of
dollars are targeting one audience: Those under 18. They're the
hardest group to manipulate because they have a sophisticated
knowledge of the media and are more willing to submit to peer
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to get people to buy a product, we're trying
to change attitudes,'' said Alan Levitt, director of the White
House's $1 billion anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the effort includes working with Hollywood producers and
writers, particularly those at the Warner Bros. TV network, to get
messages inserted into such teen-popular shows as ``Dawson's
Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since July, at least 32 programs have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   It's total mind war for every 12- and 13-year-old, an age group
currently setting records for drug use. The emphasis is on telling
them there are no social consequences to avoiding drugs _ giving
them an easy way to just say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the forces in a kid's life when it comes to
perceptions of drugs, it's not just ads,'' Levitt said. ``It's
programming on television, it's the Internet, it's music, it's pop
culture, it's the legalization-of-marijuana movement, it's school
programs that are mediocre at best, it's sports figures and rock
stars.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Research on the effectiveness of social marketing is slim. A few
studies have shown that people's health habits are the hardest to
change because they are being asked to give up gratification for
possible long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If the social marketing ads are poorly produced, they run the
risk of encouraging the behavior they are trying to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta found that anti-smoking advertising created
by Philip Morris Co. are backfiring. A 17-state coalition may soon
ask the company to hand over $75 million it set aside for the ads
so an independent agency can take a stab.
</P>
<P>
   For many social marketing specialists, changing behavior means
getting the entire community focused on the problem, not just
producing TV commercials. It also means changing public policy,
say, getting condoms distributed or outlawing cigarette vending
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we can mobilize community opinion leaders and
gatekeepers, we're not going to get the enduring change that we
want,'' said Larry Bye, founder of San Francisco-based
Communication Sciences Group, which evaluates social marketing
campaigns.

HISTORIC BARTRAM'S GARDEN: IN BLOOM, PRECARIOUSLY, FOR CENTURIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (bl) 
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to get lost trying to find America's oldest living
botanical garden. A few miles off Route I-95, just south of Center
City, Philadelphia, anonymous boulevards crisscross miles of
industrial parks, vast stretches of treeless tarmac and boxy
buildings. Plant hunters looking here would just find grass.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a sharp eye to follow the little signs for the Historic
Bartram's Garden, now a public park, cinched between the railroad
track and a river lined by oil tanks. But it must have been a
little paradise when John Bartram, a Quaker farmer with a lust in
his heart for wild plants, bought 102 acres along the Schuylkill
and proceeded to grow a lot more than corn.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Bartram put down his plow, he collected plants, from
the headwaters of the Schuylkill to the shores of Lake Ontario and
all through the South. (Fine, John _ let your wife and the nine
kids stay home and weed the dang garden.)
</P>
<P>
   Soon Bartram was sending boxes of seeds and plants wrapped in
moss to Europeans hungry for exotic species from America: sweet
gum, oak-leafed hydrangea, swamp azalea, mountain laurel and the
now-legendary Franklinia tree.
</P>
<P>
   By 1783, the Bartrams' first nursery broadsheet catalog, in
English and French, offered 220 species, from tulip poplars and a
wide variety of oaks to poison ivy, which was considered a
beautiful plant with medicinal possibilities. By the 1830's, the
Bartram clan was growing 4,000 different species of trees, shrubs
and herbaceous plants, supplying the great estates of Europe, as
well as Monticello and Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linnaeus called John Bartram the greatest natural botanist in
the world,'' said Martha Wolf, the director of the John Bartram
Association, which oversees the garden and which, in mid-May, will
celebrate the 300th anniversary of Bartram's birth with a series of
lectures, demonstrations, plant sales and musical events.
</P>
<P>
   Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist, had just created a
system of naming plants _ a sexual classification based on the
number of stamens and pistils in the flowers. Bartram taught
himself enough Latin to use the system, and even researched plants
for Linnaeus, but he saw the limitations of such a classification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving things official names made it easier to do botany,''
said Joel T. Fry, the garden's curator of historic collections.
``But it ignored the family relationships between plants, which
naturalists like Bartram had observed for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartram's son William was a great explorer in his own right, and
his ``Travels Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and
West Florida,'' first published in 1791 filled with his exquisite
illustrations, appealed to the romantic sentiments of the day,
which saw God's spirit in all of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1765, John and William were heading down to
Florida when they came upon a grove of graceful trees with striped
bark on the banks of the Altamaha River, in Georgia. They named the
species Franklinia altamaha, after their friend Benjamin Franklin.
They were too late to have seen the trees bloom in August, when
they cover themselves with flowers shaped like white camellias with
plush golden stamens, but William returned to collect seeds and
specimens, planting some in the nursery in 1777.
</P>
<P>
   John Bartram died that same year, so he was not to see the
Franklinia bloom in his garden four years later. Nor would he have
known that, after 1803, the tree would disappear from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those seeds the Bartrams first collected have helped save the
tree from extinction,'' said Ms. Wolf, who, with Fry, recounted the
rocky history of when the last Bartram gardeners got too old to
carry on.
</P>
<P>
   When John Bartram died, his sons William and John Jr., as well
as a granddaughter, Ann, expanded the nursery, which in its heyday
had enough greenhouses to grow 10,000 potted plants. But by 1850,
there were no more Bartrams interested in the business, and the
land was set to be sold at a sheriff's sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``And nobody was interested any longer in American plants,'' Fry
said. ``The fad was bedding schemes with begonias and geraniums.''
A railroad baron, Andrew Eastwick, bought the place, vowing, ``Not
a bush of this beloved old garden shall be disturbed,'' and built a
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bartram house, built of local Wissahickon schist and
lovingly expanded by the Bartrams over three generations, has a
wide porch and many doors opening to the gardens. The trees, both
exotic and native, were lined up in straight allees that marched
down to the river. Shrubs and herbaceous plants were tucked in
among the trees if they needed partial shade, or near the river if
they wanted wet feet: as plant explorers, the Bartrams respected
natural habitats. And John, who had longed to be a doctor, grew
medicinal herbs and treated his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartram planted everything,'' Fry said. ``He wanted gorse and
firs from Scotland. Ben Franklin sent him soybeans from China and a
recipe for tofu.'' The Bartrams loved Native American foods, too,
like papaw, persimmon and hickory nuts. ``They would bring back
selected varieties from the Indians,'' Fry said, ``but no one
thought to save them when the land was sold.''
</P>
<P>
   After Eastwick died, in the 1870's, this vast repository of
cultural and genetic material fell into oblivion, and many of the
finer specimens were spirited off by those who knew their value. In
1891, the City of Philadelphia bought the property as a park. In
the 1950's, the John Bartram Association, founded in 1893 by the
descendants, found a whimsical drawing of the eight-acre botanic
garden, dated 1758 and sketched by either John or William, showing
the rough layout of trees and beds.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few of the trees planted by the Bartrams survive _
like the gingko, planted in 1785, and the Kentucky yellowwood,
planted in 1803. They stand among a hodgepodge of trees planted by
the city as a rough sort of arboretum. It took the Bicentennial to
inspire Philadelphia to see the historic importance of the Bartram
garden, and in 1980, the University of Pennsylvania started an
archeological dig that turned up everything from the placement of
paths and garden beds to evidence of prehistoric man.

 UNDATED: prehistoric man.

<P>
   Today, the garden operates on a shoestring, with not even a
full-time gardener to tend the 45-acre site. But the old barn is
being turned into an education center, and there are plans to
restore the gardens as a living laboratory for the native plants
the Bartrams collected and propagated.
</P>
<P>
   The association also managed to buy the polluted site of an old
cement factory and turn it into a wildflower meadow, and when Sun
Oil Co. was cited by the Environmental Protection Agency for
violations on the south side of the garden, the company agreed to
mitigate its penalties by planting native plants in the marshland.
And as part of Bartram's 300th anniversary, the association has
sponsored a worldwide census of the Franklinia altamaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more than 2,000 responses, a handful of them from
other countries,'' Ms. Wolf said. ``What touches me is how
emotionally involved people are with this tree. They'll tell how it
was mowed down or the pig ate it, and it came back. They remember
the year they got it, and when it first bloomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because it's a story _ a beautiful living thing snatched
from extinction. Just like the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Bartram's Garden is at 54th Street and Lindbergh
Boulevard, in Philadelphia. Information on the 300th anniversary
events is available from (215) 729-5281).

DESIGN NOTEBOOK: SHELTER MADE OF THE EARTH'S OWN DUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HESPERIA, Calif. _ On a windy March day in a park here,
Australian Aborigines, American survivalists and members of a rain
forest action group teamed up to mix a slurry of earth, water, sand
and cement to help build a museum. They pumped the mixture into
plastic sandbags hundreds of feet long, laying the sandbags in a
large coil. Later they sat inside an intricate brick dome as the
four Aborigines sang ancient songs. It was, said Samuel Parish, one
of the group, ``incredible to hear their voices echoing in the
dome.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Age moment, you think. But what brought four men from
Australia, two avid readers of American Survival Guide/The Magazine
of Self Reliance and Gabriel Reyes, a builder sent by the rain
forest group, Oasis Preserve International in Costa Rica, and their
co-believers to this spot was the chance to learn how to build
cheap, easy, earthquake-resistant and quirkily beautiful buildings.
They were learning by participating in the construction of earthen
structures, including a 9,000-square-foot museum made of sandbags
filled with earth and cement. The occasion was a $2,000-a-week
workshop put on by the California Institute of Earth Architecture
and taught by Nader Khalili, an Iranian-born architect turned
sustainable-architecture guru.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Khalili's organization, known as the Cal-Earth
Institute, has taught people the art of building from raw elements.
In 1974, Khalili quit designing high-rises to spend five years
traversing Iran and studying indigenous structures. He subsequently
wrote ``Racing Alone: Fire and Earth, a Visionary Architect's
Passionate Quest'' (Cal-Earth Press, 1983), a treatise on the
spiritual power of baked-clay, or ceramic, architecture and of
Rumi, the 13th-century Persian poet who he said taught ``the unity
of the elements and the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalili became convinced that any effort to change global
attitudes about building had to start in the United States, the
place that third world builders currently emulate. He decided to
start in California, whose earthquakes would present his buildings
with their severest test.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired some cheap land in this dreary high-desert city
northeast of Los Angeles. With its extreme climate and sandy earth,
Hesperia would be, he felt, a good laboratory. Cal-Earth's center
here consists of a simple cottage with a 7.5-acre yard out back and
a garage. Assisted by students, Khalili and his partner and
administrator, a British-born architect named Iliona Outram, used
the yard to erect arches, domes and vaults of handmade adobe
bricks, factory-produced bricks and earth-filled sandbags. Their
experiments with a building system that they named Superadobe
eventually produced a spacious, three-vaulted, three-room house on
the lot _ an Earth One house, they call it.
</P>
<P>
   Superadobe buildings are made of self-supporting sandbags wound
in a coil or laid like very big bricks. The sandbags are mildly
reinforced with barbed wire and finished in stucco. Some
incorporate chimneylike ``wind catchers'' for cooling and solar
panels for heating.
</P>
<P>
   Superadobe construction is strong, cheap, even fast. And because
it requires relatively little skill, Khalili maintains that it can
used in the third world and as emergency housing, as well as by
Americans trying to avoid a high-consumption life style.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Hesperia might be the embodiment of consumption,
filled as it is with sport-utility vehicles and tract homes, each
with a well-watered lawn and year-round air-conditioning and
heating to fend off 100-plus highs in summer and winter chills.
Hesperia is the seeming antithesis of Khalili's aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this latter-day frontier town has commissioned a public
building of Superadobe: the Hesperia Museum and Nature Center, now
being erected in a park beside the town lake at a projected cost of
$1.2 million. The Hesperia Recreation and Park District is putting
up $250,000 of the total; Cal Camara, the general manager of the
district, said he hopes that the rest will come from grants and
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The brick Rumi Dome where the Aborigines sang is the museum
entryway; the sandbag coils the team laid down are the bases of 11
20-foot-wide domes that will encircle a 50-foot main exhibit dome
and courtyard. In addition, the city has said it will allow Earth
One houses with three or four bedrooms to be built here. (Plans for
the four-bedroom model, at 2,000 square feet, are $550. Khalili
estimated that the house would cost $75,000 to build, including
labor, materials and utilities; plans are available from (760)
244-0614.)
</P>
<P>
   To make all this possible, Khalili had to demonstrate that
Superadobe could pass stringent seismic tests and other rigorous
building code standards, a process that lasted years. As Tom Harp,
Hesperia's planning director, noted in an article he wrote for
Building Standards, the organ of the International Conference of
Building Officials, ``If we hadn't been trained to be courteous, we
would have laughed out loud'' when Khalili first proposed making
buildings out of sandbags.
</P>
<P>
   But the city enlisted outside experts, and finally approved the
building of Superadobe structures _ ``a very significant step in
legitimizing earth architecture,'' Khalili said. Now he and Ms.
Outram are trying to get the Superadobe technique included in the
International Building Code.
</P>
<P>
   With the museum (which was started in 1996 and will be completed
in 2000, if the rest of the money can be raised), Khalili is hoping
to show that brick domes and Superadobe not only are cheap and
practical but also can be poetic and beautiful. Already local
residents are entranced by the delightful, if alien, Rumi Dome. A
group of American Indians plan a powwow there in May. (The Rumi
Dome and the rest of the museum construction site are open to the
public free on the first Saturday of each month. Information is
available at Cal-Earth's Web site, www.calearth.org.)
</P>
<P>
   But Cal-Earth has its critics, particularly among architects who
object to what they see as regressive building techniques. Peter
Berman, an architect working in Montana, said that earth
architecture cannot possibly attain the economies of scale of
conventional buildings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These homeopathic construction systems send technology
backward,'' he said, adding that technology lets designers make
buildings lighter, stronger and more transparent. ``People do not
want to live in thick, echoing domes.'' Moreover, homeowners might
run into trouble when they try to install standard doors and
windows in their idiosyncratic Superadobe homes. Home-building, he
said, is ``best left to the professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Outram conceded that so far no one actually lives in any of
the school's domes; in fact, none are equipped with the utilities
that even a self-respecting environmentalist would require, though
visitors regularly stay overnight in them. It has taken several
years to build just a few structures, and the Superadobe system is
still, Ms. Outram said, ``more piecemeal and low-tech than one
would like.''
</P>
<P>
   But enough people are convinced by the concept and the
philosophy to take a leap of faith. The Aborigines flew thousands
of miles to learn a technique they hope to apply on a piece of land
inherited by one of their number, Michael Woodley.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Oasis Preserve International _ Reyes and three
Americans _ were introduced to Cal-Earth by their founder, Woody
Harrelson. ``We were interested in the technology because it's
tree-free,'' said Brian Machovina, assistant director of Oasis, a
rain forest preservation group.
</P>
<P>
   Parish, a Florida high school teacher, was attracted to
Superadobe as a low-cost way to build his own home. He said that he
and his wife want to be ``completely self-sufficient, to grow our
own food and have a strong family based on the home.'' He plans to
start building his home in Florida if local building officials give
their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Khalili has acted as a consultant to NASA, which
considered his ceramic architecture as a possible habitat on the
moon. And at the Cal-Earth center, Khalili has welcomed a party of
Iranian scholars of Rumi, who saw the poet's essence in the Rumi
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the Cal-Earth enthusiasts, the survivalists _ known
for their apocalyptic view of world events _ are perhaps the most
unexpected. After an article on Cal-Earth appeared in March in the
American Survival Guide, promoting Cal-Earth's architecture as not
only low-cost but resistant to gunfire and explosives, Cal-Earth
received more than 300 inquiries, including one from Parish.
Khalili and Ms. Outram said one woman drove from Arizona and bought
$850 worth of sandbags and a set of plans, determined to build a
house in four months, before her baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Khalili said that this mode of building touches a chord in many
types of people because ``the timeless forms and timeless
principles satisfy a vast horizon of human needs.'' Earth
architecture exists at the point, he said, ``where poetry has
crystallized into structures.''

PEEKABOO! ANONYMITY IS NOT ALWAYS SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Wash., N.J.)  (af) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week in this column, I described the promise of anonymity
on the Net, and some services and products that provide it. But
skepticism and the impetus to challenge any product or program
reign in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   So when Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software of
Cambridge, Mass., read the column and saw the claims of the service
providers, he could not resist seeing just how good the anonymity
provided was. Smith reports that he attacked and easily defeated
several of the services.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws he reports finding could enable a Web site operator to
disable the privacy protections used by the services offering
anonymity or trick the operator into passing along information that
could be used to identify visitors to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the programmer and amateur sleuth who last month came
across a previously obscure identifying code in Microsoft Office
documents that investigators used to help link the Melissa computer
virus to a computer in New Jersey. His company makes software tools
that help programmers build Windows applications.
</P>
<P>
   The operators of the compromised anonymity services _
Anonymizer.com (www.anonymizer.com), the Naval Research
Laboratory's Onion Router (www.onion-router.net), the Lucent
Personalized Web Assistant service (www.bell-labs.com/project/lpwa)
and a fourth service not mentioned in the article, Aixs.Net
(aixs.net) _ were scrambling this week to patch the security holes.
</P>
<P>
   While many of their customers use the anonymity services as a
shield against being pestered by marketers and bombarded with
unsolicited e-mail, others, like political dissidents, could face
much graver consequences if their identities were divulged.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of the anonymity services' bugs is the latest
blow in what has already been a dismal year for Internet privacy, a
year in which it was learned that Intel had embedded a trackable
serial number in its Pentium III chips and Microsoft had put a
sneaky ``globally unique identifier,'' or GUID, in the registration
software for Windows 98 and in every document created with
Microsoft Office. Both companies say they have backed off, but
doubts linger.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report last week in The Seattle Weekly, Microsoft
has also embedded the GUID into its Windows Media Player, which in
theory would allow Web site operators to track everyone who
downloads a streaming audio or video file.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also disclosed that Real Networks, whose Real
Player software is the main rival to Windows' Media Player, also
packs a GUID (Real Networks did not respond to repeated requests
for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   A Bulgarian bug sleuth, Georgi Guninski, reported on his Web
site (www.nat.bg/tildero/browsers.html) that Microsoft's new
Internet Explorer 5.0 had some unpatched holes that might allow an
unscrupulous hacker to rig Web pages so they could snatch files
from a visitor's hard disk through the Internet Explorer 5.0 Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   A computer security consultant in Spain, Juan Carlos Garcia
Cuartango, found an array of similar holes in Internet Explorer
4.0, holes that Microsoft says have been patched.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attacks on the services promising anonymity were
conducted using Netscape Communicator 4.5, which also has a long
history of security bugs and patches. In general, the attacks
exploited some relatively obscure features of Java and Javascript,
which, along with Microsoft's ActiveX, are increasingly popular
software tools that Web site operators employ to create features
like updated stock quotes or sports scores that crawl across the
browser screen.
</P>
<P>
   If Java, Javascript or ActiveX are allowed to run inside a
user's Web-browsing software, the Web site can actually load small
programs into the visitor's computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the privacy services, a booby-trapped Web page
could stealthily invoke Javascript to redirect the browser
automatically to an unsecured Web page, bypassing a service's
protections and allowing the site to grab the visiting computer's
Internet, or IP, address and its ``cookies,'' _ programs that keep
detailed records of a computer's visits to a particular site. Or
the booby-trapped site could exploit another bug in the Netscape
browser, also through Javascript, to cough up the anonymous
visitor's supposedly hidden Internet address.
</P>
<P>
   ``That these systems were so easy to break is a little
surprising to me,'' Smith said. He said it had taken him less than
an hour to find and exploit the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a user of any these services,'' Smith said,
referring to the anonymity services, ``I highly recommend that you
turn off Javascript, Java and ActiveX controls in your browser
before surfing the Web. This simple precaution will prevent any
leaks of your IP address or cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lance Cottrell, president of Anonymizer.com, said the success of
his popular service depended in part on its ability to disable Java
and Javascript. But today's software is so complex, he said, and so
impregnated with automated macro programs, scripts and programming
languages, that it is extremely difficult to find every
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing, he said, is to hope that the person who
discovers a bug reports it responsibly and that the software makers
move swiftly to patch the holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of computer security is that there is no such
thing as a perfectly secure system, unless it is welded shut in a
box and not connected to a network,'' Cottrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The security holes exploited by Smith were first described in a
technical paper last year by Aviel D. Rubin, the principal member
of the technical staff at AT&AMP;T Labs-Research in New Jersey, and his
colleague Mike Reiter. Rubin and Reiter developed the Crowds
anonymity service.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had not tried to find potential vulnerabilities in
Crowds. Rubin, a co-author of ``The Web Security Sourcebook''
(Wiley Computer Publishing, 1997), said he believed that Crowds was
not vulnerable to the same attacks that had been successful against
the other anonymity services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, sounds like a challenge,'' Smith said when informed of
Rubin's comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Faith Cranor, a privacy expert at AT&AMP;T Labs-Research,
said the discovery of security holes in the privacy services did
not mean that they had been exploited or that anyone's privacy had
been compromised. ``I would say someone should feel reasonably
secure using these services anyway, especially if the developers
are prompt in patching holes when they emerge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft promises that the notorious GUID is not included in
the Office 2000 upgrade that it began shipping last week to its
largest corporate customers. Hackers will have eight weeks to
verify the claim before retail versions of the popular application
suite go on sale on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 will come in four versions. The Standard version
(the upgrade price will be $209 after a rebate for registered
Office users) consists of Word, Excel, Outlook and Powerpoint. The
Small Business version (also $209) has those four applications plus
the Publisher desktop publishing program and some small business
tools.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional version (a $309 upgrade) has all those and the
Access database program. The Premium version (a $399 upgrade)
tosses in Frontpage for Web page design and Photodraw for photo
editing and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Woe unto those who are not upgrading from Office 97 or a
competing suite because the price of Office 2000 for new users
ranges from a low of $499 for the Standard version to (choke!) $799
for the full version.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing around with the final code of Office 2000 for
the past week, and it has lots of nice new features for both
corporate users and individuals. Microsoft's main goal in this
upgrade appears to have been to make it easier to create and share
documents on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all of the toolbar and command menus have been simplified
and made smarter. Beginning users who need just a few commands can
hide all the extra junk, which is nice.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite new feature, however _ besides the absence of the
spooky GUID _ is the ``Die, Clippy, Die'' command (what is ought to
be called), which lets the user permanently get rid of the rude and
obnoxious little animated paper clip character from Office 97 who
butts his way onto the screen in what is usually a misguided effort
to offer help or advice.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is worth a few bucks. Whether the entire package
is worth $209 to $399 for an upgrade depends on how important Web
publishing is to you or how unhappy you are with Office 97. I'm
tempted to wait and just get Office 2000 installed when I buy my
next computer.

PLAYING BIG BROTHER AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Product notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, you've built 19th-century railroad monopolies on your
computer screen. You've been a 20th-century Sim City mayor. You've
run your competitors into the ground. You've come out miles ahead
in the polls. What are you going to do now?
</P>
<P>
   You can't go to Disneyland. But you can build something that
looks a lot like it in Roller Coaster Tycoon, a strategy simulation
that puts you at the helm of a virtual amusement park. You're still
laying track and regulating traffic. But this time you're an
entertainer, and you have to give hundreds of Lilliputian visitors
all the rides, theme scenery, junk food, soft drinks and souvenirs
they can enjoy and afford.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of locomotives or light manufacturing, your economy is
based on entertainment architecture, instant gratification and
throwaway consumption. Novelty attracts new visitors. New visitors
pay for the next round of construction. It costs money to fill an
amusement park with people-moving machines. But the amusement park
you build is itself a kind of machine _ a refinery that separates a
slurry of human beings from their disposable incomes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a game about engineering, starting with the rides.
Amusement parks have a long lineage, and Roller Coaster Tycoon
allows you to build old-fashioned wooden roller coasters and
turn-of the-century carousels. But the game also embraces modern
materials and engineering, in the form of steel coasters that turn
corkscrews or hang upside down or drop for hundreds of feet. You
can spend countless hours just designing new and bizarre rides with
the custom roller coaster construction kit.
</P>
<P>
   But as with a toy train set, the soul of the experience is the
world you build around it. ``A roller coaster isn't just fun
because it goes upside down or moves very fast or because it's got
a tall drop,'' said Chris Sawyer, who produced the game from his
one-man studio in Scotland. ``It's the whole balance of many things
that makes the ride fun and makes you want to go back and go on it
again. What you go past when you're on it. What it looks like when
you're approaching it. Things like theme and scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Landscape design is more significant than it first appears.
Well-placed footpaths can make the difference between a profitable
park and one that operates in the red. And public transportation,
in the guise of themed choo-choo trains, becomes an important way
of ferrying customers between clustered spending opportunities,
which substitute for neighborhoods in the urban scheme of an
amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of urban planning in Roller Coaster Tycoon. But
it's the kind of urban planning you find in a shopping mall or any
other large, enclosed retail environment. Thoroughfares are
arranged to maximize spending opportunities. Showcase attractions
are placed toward the back of the property to draw visitors through
the park and past all the food kiosks and souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   These are the principles you learn through trial, error and
deduction as you play the game. But they will be familiar to anyone
who's ever navigated the labyrinth of Ikea, spent an afternoon
cocooned in the comfy chairs of Barnes &AMP; Noble or gasped at a cash
register receipt at Bed, Bath and Beyond. In these self-contained
spaces, architecture revolves around the pleasures of consumption.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A theme park takes this architecture to its logical extreme. A
virtual theme park playfully vaults over the logical extreme, past
a waterfall, through a tunnel and into the realm of the absurd.
Because in a computer game, you can do market research that would
otherwise qualify as a violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Guest Info icon in Roller Coaster Tycoon, and you
get a roster of every visitor in the park and his or her current
thought and action. (Guest (NU)571. Getting off the Arachnophobia
ride. ``I'm thirsty.'') Another chart summarizes the actions and
thoughts of every guest and presents them in descending order of
frequency (if 15 percent of the people in your park are disgusted
by the litter, it's time to plant some more trash bins and hire
another maintenance worker).
</P>
<P>
   From the Guest Info roster, you can also view guests
individually. You can pinpoint their whereabouts (there are cameras
in every nook and cranny of the park). A pop-up window indicates
how long they've been in the park, how much they've spent (and on
what), what they're carrying, how they're feeling. A bar graph
measures happiness, energy, hunger, thirst, nausea and need to use
a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Most theme parks, shopping malls and megastores maintain a
system of surreptitious panoptic surveillance. This one just takes
the concept to Orwellian extremes _ or rather, Huxleyan extremes,
since you're only collecting information to make the park more fun.
Your visitors have no privacy. That's only so they can have a more
enjoyable and satisfying experience. So you can provide better
customer service. So they will stay longer and buy more.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to look down at those tiny people from high above,
tracking their every move, their comments, experiences and spending
habits. It gives you a sense of omniscience and control, the
hallmark of any god game. But unlike the denizens of Sim City, the
human goldfish in Roller Coaster Tycoon have individual identities
(they're listed by number, but you can name them if you like). Each

different degree of nausea tolerance.

   So you identify with them. And perhaps, after a while, you
wonder what it would be like to experience your own park as a
visitor and to know that you were under constant surveillance and
that every merry-go-round ticket and ice-cream cone you bought was
duly noted and compiled into a database for the benefit of park
management. Would that influence your opinion of the park or your
level of amusement while you were there? Would it improve your
customer satisfaction to be tagged and tracked in the name of
customer satisfaction? Or would it bother you?
</P>
<P>
   On the World Wide Web, if the information architects have done
their job, we take the pathways that maximize our exposure to
advertisements and e-commerce opportunities. Online merchants have
an increasingly good idea where we have been, how much time we
spent there and what we bought along the way. As a virtual
customer, you have predictable preferences. You have observable
spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   What's your nausea tolerance?

players in Ryuji Imada and Michael Morrison, but most of the team's

   FBC-USC-HOLTZ _ After two seasons away from coaching, Lou Holtz
has returned to the sidelines hoping to revive a South Carolina
football program that struggled under former coach Brad Scott.
Holtz is one of only 11 coaches with 200 career victories and his
hiring in December gave the South Carolina program instant
credibility. Holtz, who added son Skip to his USC staff, speaks out
on his return to coaching and the USC program as the Gamecocks
prepare for their annual spring game. (Arey, Atlanta

<P>
   FBC-GATECH-QB _ Georgia Tech has one of the nation's top
quarterbacks in rising senior Joe Hamilton and Hamilton is the key
for a team that hopes to contend for a national championship in
1999. An injury to Hamilton, however, would be a severe blow for
the Jackets as his backups have limited experience. One of the keys
for the Jackets during spring practice is gaining experience for
the reserve QBs with redshirt freshman Jermaine Crenshaw and
sophomore George Godsey under the microscope. The key to the team's
success could be found in a reserve QB. (Clemons, Atlanta

   HOMETOWN-HEROES _ BELLE, W.Va. _ Across the Kanawha River, the
road signs along Cabin Creek hollow proudly proclaim: ``Home of
Jerry West, NBA great.'' But on this side of the Chelyan Bridge,
where the DuPont chemical plant lights the valley sky even at
midnight, there is nothing to let you know that Belle (population
1,421) and the neighboring community of Rand can claim two big-time
hometown heroes _ Randy Moss and Jason Williams. Not since Bill
Russell and Frank Robinson more than 40 years ago have two
first-year players from the same high school made as big a
major-league splash as Moss and Williams. That Moss and Williams
come from the same small school in Appalachia and have traveled
winding paths more treacherous than a narrow mountain road make
their stories even more intriquing. (Curtright, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 44.

nation, is one of the favorites to win the SEC championship this
weekend in Lexington, Ky. The Bulldogs have two of the SEC's top
players in Ryuji Imada and Michael Morrison, but most of the team's
success can be attributed to coach Chris Haack. Since arriving at
Georgia in 1996, Haack has been a tireless promoter of the program
and has helped to rebuild a program that had slipped before his

   FBC-USC-HOLTZ _ After two seasons away from coaching, Lou Holtz
has returned to the sidelines hoping to revive a South Carolina

Holtz is one of only 11 coaches with 200 career victories and his
hiring in December gave the South Carolina program instant
credibility. Holtz, who added son Skip to his USC staff, speaks out

prepare for their annual spring game. (Arey, Atlanta

the Jackets as his backups have limited experience. One of the keys
for the Jackets during spring practice is gaining experience for
the reserve QBs with redshirt freshman Jermaine Crenshaw and
sophomore George Godsey under the microscope. The key to the team's
success could be found in a reserve QB. (Clemons, Atlanta

   HOMETOWN-HEROES _ BELLE, W.Va. _ Across the Kanawha River, the
road signs along Cabin Creek hollow proudly proclaim: ``Home of

where the DuPont chemical plant lights the valley sky even at
midnight, there is nothing to let you know that Belle (population
1,421) and the neighboring community of Rand can claim two big-time
hometown heroes _ Randy Moss and Jason Williams. Not since Bill
Russell and Frank Robinson more than 40 years ago have two
first-year players from the same high school made as big a
major-league splash as Moss and Williams. That Moss and Williams
come from the same small school in Appalachia and have traveled
winding paths more treacherous than a narrow mountain road make
their stories even more intriquing. (Curtright, Atlanta

 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``This place is like a tree,'' a woman recently told me about
her Episcopal parish, ``We're growing deep roots and branching out
into the world at the same time. This church is a good place. The
Spirit is here.''
 &HT;    In recent years, few religious groups have taken as much media
battering as historic mainline Protestant denominations -- the
Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans, Methodists, and
Congregationalists included.
 &HT;    Depicted as declining institutions mired in moldy liberalism and
embattled by culture wars, critics have long awaited the final
extinction of these religious dinosaurs.
 &HT;    Mainline Protestants, imbued with a spiritual inferiority
complex, appeared to be quietly accepting their imminent demise.
Unlike evangelicals who kick up a fuss when criticized in the
media, mainliners took their punches with grace.
 &HT;    With the exception of a few stories on gay ordination, the media
lost interest in them and turned its gaze toward evangelicals,
Eastern faiths, new religious groups and Catholicism. After all,
what could possibly be interesting about the local Episcopal
Church?
 &HT;    As it turns out, plenty.
 &HT;    Over the last year, the Episcopal Church has embarked on a
self-study called the Zacchaeus Project. Named after a biblical
character who climbed a tree to see Jesus, the Zacchaeus Project
hoped to get a clear view of their church. The project has revealed
a denomination of surprising growth and spiritual vitality.
 &HT;    Like other mainline churches, the Episcopal Church suffered
membership hemorrhage in the 1970s and 1980s. That, however, has
stopped. In the last decade membership has remained steady while
attendance climbed -- and is still climbing. Although unwilling to
sign-up as full-fledged members, thousands of new people are coming
to Episcopal churches. Decline is no longer the story.
 &HT;    An increasing birth rate, lower death rate, and baby-boomers
returning to church contributed to the turnaround. However, the
Zacchaeus Project reveals that people are going to Episcopal
churches for distinctly theological and spiritual reasons -- not
just as a result of demographic quirks.
 &HT;    Episcopalians praise their church as ``diverse,'' ``inclusive,''
``comprehensive,'' ``tolerant'' and ``pluralistic.'' Even at the
most conservative Episcopal parishes, these words appear as
positives. ``I was about to leave the church altogether,'' said one
man at a growing urban church, ``because the church I grew up in
was so exclusionary. Then I found this place.''
 &HT;    In the 1970s and 1980s, churches with ``tight boundaries'' grew.
Thus, conservative groups with strict morality and doctrine
exploded numerically. The principle held for new religious
movements and traditionalist Roman Catholicism: the more
restrictive, the more successful. Millions of people embraced
exclusive religions -- ``we are saved and you are not.''
 &HT;    Strict religion appears to have created a spiritual backlash.
Those constricted by dogmatism -- who migrated to such groups as
teen-agers or at a moment of personal crisis -- began to question
the limits placed upon them. Indeed, that most new Episcopalians
are ex-evangelicals and former Roman Catholics points to the
inadequacy of tightly boundaried faith.
 &HT;    Rather than certainty, the Episcopal Church -- in line with
other mainline denominations -- emphasizes ambiguity and mystery as
paths to God. Its theology, sometimes decried as ``mushy
liberalism,'' is actually a pluralistic theology that affirms
questions and intellectual exploration.
 &HT;    Thus, the old mainline churches were perfectly poised to welcome
those questioning fundamentalism. As newer statistics show, a
significant minority of Americans are migrating toward more open
faiths than in previous decades.
 &HT;    American religion is often divided politically between
``conservative'' and ``liberal.'' It is better understood in terms
of its spirituality -- a continuum between styles of certainty and
mystery, between clarity and ambiguity. Some people like answers;
other prefer the quest.
 &HT;    Contemporary mainline religion leans toward quest-spirituality
and resists all polarization -- even between itself and other
spiritual styles.
 &HT;    Thus, the new Episcopalians believe that the answer is the
journey; that certainty arises in mystery. They value inclusivity
so much that they extol such paradoxes as signs of spiritual
wisdom. They see their hearts and minds engaged in a holistic
journey toward God. They envision spirituality as a circle (or
spiral) rather than a line. They seek to enfold all persons --
indeed all faiths -- into a community striving to touch the divine.
 &HT;    The Zacchaeus Project points to good news for the Episcopal
Church and other mainline churches. The cultural ethos seems to be
shifting their direction: culture-wars weary Americans are more in
a mood for questions than answers, consensus rather than exclusion.
And the up-coming Generation-Xers resonate more with mystery than
with dogmatism.
 &HT;    In short, the old mainline has reinvented itself into a
postmodern church and the message is seems to be reaching many
Americans.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Roy Ramsey Jr., convicted of killing a
retired Grandview, Mo., couple in 1988, was executed early
Wednesday at the Potosi Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fourth person to die by lethal injection in Missouri
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his execution, Ramsey came as close as he ever
would to an apology for his brutal slaying of Garnett and Betty
Ledford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't mad at nobody,'' Ramsey said from his holding cell
next to the death chamber. ``Matter of fact, tell the Ledford
family for me that I feel bad about their tragedy. And if I cross
over to the other world, I'll tell (the Ledfords) that their family
back here loves them and misses them. I do feel bad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he waited Tuesday night with his attorney, J.R. Hobbs,
and two preachers, the Rev. Larry Rice of St. Louis and the Rev.
Paul Jones of Kansas City, he maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say I didn't kill them,'' Ramsey said. ``I
guess I'm going to pay for it though, and that's all right. I ain't
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Others had little doubt of his guilt in the murder of the
retired south Kansas City couple.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey's fate was sealed at 9:15 p.m. Tuesday when Gov. Mel
Carnahan denied a request for clemency. The U.S. Supreme Court also
had rejected a final plea for a stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon said Tuesday that he had no
doubt about Ramsey's guilt or whether he deserved to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a brutal double murderer who has attempted to slow down
and manipulate the system for years,'' said Nixon. ``The killing of
senior citizens in their own homes _ execution style in their own
bedrooms _ is an example of the cruel and cold-blooded murders for
which the death penalty should clearly be an option.''

CONSERVATIVES DEBATE THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is political involvement the way to change society?
Or has politics failed because of ``cultural decay,'' as one
conservative activist says?
</P>
<P>
   Those have been central questions within the
religious-conservative movement since President Clinton escaped
expulsion from office this winter. They were debated Tuesday before
a panel gathered by Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas and Rep. Joseph
Pitts of Pennsylvania, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawmakers said American culture needed healing, but in a
way that transcended the bitter political divisions that have
characterized the battles so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must aim to change hearts and minds as much as we seek to
change laws,'' Brownback said. ``We each have a role to play in
making our society more civil, more compassionate and more
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   But the divisions remain.
</P>
<P>
   They surfaced in February after the Senate's decision not to
remove Clinton from office after he had been impeached. Paul
Weyrich, head of the Free Congress Foundation and a veteran
conservative activist, wrote a letter that he posted on the group's
Web site in which he said, ``Politics has failed because of the
collapse of the culture. The culture we are living in becomes an
ever-wider sewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on Brownback's panel, Weyrich said he never meant to
suggest that religious conservatives abandon politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remain in politics for defensive purposes,'' he
said. ``What I'm saying is don't depend on the political process to
advance the cultural agenda. We have to take back the culture by
ourselves. The question is how we do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyrich's ideas focus on conservative activities outside the
mainstream of society, such as home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   But Don Eberly, president of the Civil Society Project and an
aide in Reagan administration, called that an ``oasis strategy''
and a ``quarantine'' of conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Eberly said conservatives need to reach out more to the
``gatekeepers'' of culture, in the museums and media and other
institutions. He said conservative communities spend ``billions''
on radio and television but simply ``to talk to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum, which Brownback hopes to use to help in his writing
of a book, was called ``Next Steps Toward Cultural Renewal.'' No
clear path emerged, however, after two hours of polite discussion
that wandered over terrain ranging from Jesus and the Apostles to
the Victorians to Martin Luther King Jr. to Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have a familiar list of cultural touchstones that
they argue define the degradation of society, from the sex and
violence portrayed by Hollywood to the behavior of President
Clinton. But they are divided on the way to solve some of the more
general concerns, such as the rise in teen-age pregnancies, the
number of young black men in prison and the quality of schools.
Some demand adherence to a conservative agenda; others say they
must go beyond partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Some panel participants such as Adam Myerson of the Heritage
Foundation, which sponsored the forum, said this was
``conservatism's cultural moment'' to ``repair the fabric of
American life.'' Others said the cultural war was being won, albeit
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The debate boiled down to two points of view:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in great danger of politicizing Jesus,'' said
the Rev. Ed Dobson, a Grand Rapids, Mich., pastor and former
official with the Moral Majority. ``Where I sit, I feel tremendous
pressure from national political organizations to be more
politically active in order to bring about cultural
transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said churches need to divorce themselves from politics
because the religious conservative movement appeared to be simply
``white, middle-class and Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist and former executive
director of the Christian Coalition, said that while his own
political activism was not due to a ``desire to lead anyone to
Christ,'' Christians have a basic responsibility to be politically
aware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still go to evangelical churches all over America today
and ask people, `Who knows the names of their congressman?' and
two-thirds of them... (don't),'' Reed said. ``That means you're not
even knowledgeable enough to be an effective citizen. It's not
about whether you're white, middle-class and a Republican.''

IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE FOR FILING INCOME TAX RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Tax-preparation offices really started humming this
week, but the pros still have one bit of advice for the
foot-draggers:
</P>
<P>
   Get moving.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for filing federal and state income taxes in time
to avoid needless hassles, penalties and interest charges is less
than 48 hours away.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you finish in time to file before the midnight
Thursday deadline, you'll have more time to snag free bagels, ice
cream, candy bars and other goodies that marketers of all sorts
provide at impromptu street parties around post offices each April
15.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers using the Internet might find even more exotic fare; a
group identifying itself as the Busty Bookkeepers offers live nude
tax advice at a Web site set up by a Los Angeles entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that nationally
perhaps more than 30 million taxpayers haven't filed yet, an
unusually high number.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that the lines aren't likely to get shorter if you
delay, tax preparers said. Nationally, about 45 percent of an
expected 126 million taxpayers still hadn't filed by April 2, when
the IRS last counted.
</P>
<P>
   Business ``has been building steadily all this week,'' said Mike
James, an executive in charge of several Kansas City H&AMP;R Block
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Tax officials said that by April 2 a record 1.8 million
taxpayers had filed returns from home computers and that more than
18 million had filed electronically through tax-preparation
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Don't wait until the last minute to try to file that way,
either, because telephone lines are likely to be very busy,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aren't going to have your taxes done until 11:59, the
best place to be then will be in your car heading for a post
office, not at home in front of your computer,'' said Neil Allen of
CCH Inc., a suburban Chicago tax information and software
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers who want to file electronically late Thursday still
should be able to get their returns in on time, however, said Don
Roberts, a spokesman at IRS headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a surge of refund seekers filed in early February,
so the agency's computers already have absorbed one electronic
avalanche larger than what is expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS also has built a safety valve of sorts into the system,
Roberts said. Taxpayers who try to file electronically late
Thursday and are rejected will have five more days to try again
after the problem is corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still need to be able to tell that you first tried to
file before the deadline,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Tax professionals said they had a pretty good idea of which tax
changes were the most likely to cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits for college
students has been among the biggest challenges for families coming
to H&AMP;R Block, said Todd Ransom, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Either credit can produce four-figure tax savings. But each goes
by different rules, and families can't use both for the same
student in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Families with younger children generally wrestle hardest with
the $400-per-child credit that's also new this tax year, Ransom
said. First, the credit isn't automatic; income and other credits
claimed affect the savings. Also, families with three or more
children generally need to calculate the credit differently than
families with just one or two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then you have the Roth,'' Ransom noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Roth IRA is new this tax season. It essentially allows
taxpayers to trade a potential $2,000 deduction on a traditional
individual retirement account now for tax-free income in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   It would take some pencil pushing to determine which might be
better deal for each taxpayer, of course, because key rules aren't
the same for both types of retirement accounts. Many who choose
Roths encounter extra tax work, too, especially if they've switched
money from either type of IRA to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS estimates that a record 7.8 million taxpayers this year
will request automatic four-month extensions to buy time for
finishing their paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Those requests also must be filed, on Form 4868, either
electronically or on paper before midnight Thursday. And if you
expect to owe more money, you need to send that payment along with
your extension request. All tax liabilities are due April 15
whether you get an extension or not.
</P>
<P>
   Send the full amount, if you can, to avoid interest and
penalties, tax specialists advise. Otherwise, send at least as much
you paid last year to avoid potentially escalating late-payment
penalties. You still would pay interest, currently about 8 percent,
on any money not paid by April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-strapped taxpayers can reduce, but not eliminate, potential
penalties and interest by requesting to make installment payments
when they file and paying a $43 fee. The IRS can say no but often
doesn't if the debt is less than $25,000 and you offer to pay
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, for the first time, taxpayers also can pay by
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts disagree about how good an idea that is. Credit card
rates generally are higher than what the IRS charges, but taxpayers
suffer less financial damage if they miss a payment to the credit
card company. Taxpayers also must pay an additional fee, usually
around 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent of the balance, to use plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and how are federal refunds running this year? At last
check, they were averaging $1,575.

BUT WHAT ABOUT TAX CUTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the tax-filing season winds down, it's hard to resist the
notion that the tax-and-spend crowd has finally prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the lack of grousing about taxes? There may
be scattered pockets of protest, but the quest to reduce Big
Government's oxygen supply has lost its sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   It's not an election year, of course, but this doesn't
adequately explain the demise of tax reduction and tax reform as
burning issues. One theory making the rounds is that good times are
making it harder for relief and reform advocates to connect with
taxpayers. People might say they're for tax relief when asked, but
translating that into political oomph is easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the affluent's share of the tax load has
risen substantially in the '90s, which shrinks the potential for
grass-roots revolt. Another problem is public misperceptions of
federal finance and what's best for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by a Republican organization, for instance,
showed two-thirds of the respondents favoring a 10 percent
across-the-board cut in marginal tax rates. When those polled were
asked how budget surpluses should be used, though, 31 percent
wanted excess revenue devoted to helping Social Security and 26
percent wanted to pay down the debt. Only 18 percent opted for tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Social Security is overfunded to the extent that
it is the budget surplus. Never mind, too, that paying down the
debt won't improve individual economic fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   It's as simple as Big Government advocates having done a great
job of selling the idea that there's no economic downside to
government pre-empting an inordinate share of the resource pie.
Federal revenue is consuming more than one-fifth of economic
output, but few see this as a threat to sustaining what's already
the longest peacetime expansion ever.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope things turn out better this time than they did the
last two times prosperity cycled into decline. While government
benefits immensely from booms, it often realizes too late the
wisdom of practicing revenue restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring '20s, thanks to declining tax rates, was one of the
most prosperous eras in U.S. history. Then came the '30s. Tax
relief in the mid-1960s also helped make that decade one of the
best ever. Then the '70s saw inflation-induced bracket creep savage
after-tax income.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts are needed. So is reform to simplify the system.
Nothing, however, gets done without public clamor. What would
create enough public concern about the tax situation to ignite
public clamor?
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating withholding would do the job. Before the advent of
withholding in World War II, government didn't dare impose taxes
beyond the comfort zone of taxpayers accustomed to settling their
tax obligation to Uncle Sam once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Failing a government solution, companies could start paying full
wages in actual currency. Employees then would go down a line of
tables at which they would stop at each one and peel off enough
cash to settle federal, state, local and FICA obligations. Several
trips down such a line would no doubt create an appreciation for
what government demands from us.

 WARY CONSUMERS TRY `FREE' PCs  
(Eds: A list of companies offering `free' computers is at end of
article.) 
(af) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Barbara D. Fontenot, last Friday was the big day. She
practically hugged the United Parcel Service man who lugged the big
box up the stairs to her sparsely appointed second-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fontenot, 58, a sixth-grade teacher in Alexandria, La.,
plopped down on her hardwood living room floor and carefully
unpacked her first computer. It was something she could not have
afforded until a man named Joseph Calimari came along: rather than
paying for her computer outright, she pays $29.99 a month in a
rent-to-own plan offered by Calimari's startup company,
Intersquid.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one happy child when the UPS man showed up,'' Ms.
Fontenot said. She is participating in a new way of buying and
selling computers that has computer industry analysts intrigued and
wary. They say the new means of distributing PCs is poised to gain
wide appeal, but its eventual success is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   The computers are being offered to consumers much the way
cellular phones are provided by the companies that provide phone
service. Computer companies offer to give a ``free PC'' to
consumers, then charge them for monthly Internet access fees.
</P>
<P>
   The fees start at $20 a month _ depending on how powerful the
computer is _ a price that is not much higher than you might expect
to pay for Internet access alone.
</P>
<P>
   There's a catch, of course. In some cases, users must sign up
for a two- to three-year contract, locking them into a long-term
deal in a world full of unknowns and committing them to companies
that may be as new to the computer business as many of their
customers are to computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty good deal for consumers and pretty compelling
for first-time buyers,'' said David J. Stremba, principal analyst
for Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research company. ``But
they just need to be aware of what they are making a commitment
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions Stremba recommends that consumers ask: Who
is operating the company? Will it survive to live up to its
commitments, like long-term technical support and Internet access?
Are the computers reliable? What, if any, upgrades can a buyer
expect?
</P>
<P>
   Stremba said that some consumers might sign up for three years
of Internet access, for example, provided over phone lines _
so-called dial-up access. But, he said, cable access, which is must
faster than dial-up access, may be widely available, before long.
``Three years is a long time to get locked into something,'' he
said. ``In three years, standard dial-up access is going to look as
appealing as a moldy sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Stremba also said these companies simply could not afford to
sell computers and Internet access for $20 a month. He recently
completed a study of the industry and concluded that 95 percent to
99 percent of the businesses offering that kind of deal ``won't
survive past six months to a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Calimari, 30, who founded his company four months ago and
started shipping computers two weeks ago, disagreed. ``We don't
lose money now,'' he said. ``We're offering this at a point where
we're just making a profit.'' But he conceded that the profit
margins were slim and that he was not sure how his competitors
could make money if they offered better deals. ``I don't know how
they're doing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the driving force behind the business
model _ and the reason the companies are getting involved _ is the
precipitously falling price of computers. It now is possible to buy
name-brand computers for less than $700, including a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a fine point on the story of falling prices, a San
Francisco company called Emachines suddenly propelled itself to
become the fourth-largest PC maker in the United States in the
month of February, according to PC Data, a market research company
in Reston, Va. The key to the company's success: it sells computers
for less than $600.
</P>
<P>
   As the trend toward cheaper computers became clear last year, a
light bulb went on in Calimari's head. ``I was at American Express
doing accounting,'' said Calimari, 30. ``I suddenly realized this
industry was going the way of the cellular phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he wanted to name his company PC-for-Free but decided
it was similar to too many other companies' names. So he chose
something a little more offbeat _ Intersquid.com, based on his last
name, which means squid in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   For a $30 registration fee and $29.99 a month for 30 months,
plus shipping and handling, subscribers to Intersquid.com get
Internet access and a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   The computer includes a 333-megahertz Intel Celeron I processor
_ a stripped down Pentium _ 32 megabytes of memory, a 40x CD-ROM
drive, a 56-kilobits-per-second modem and a 15-inch monitor. It
also comes with 24-hour technical support and a limited warranty,
which Calimari said would cover problems with the computer not
caused by the user. After 30 months, users own the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling competitors are offering similar deals. In New York,
Ganesh Ramakrishnan, 26, a former anthropology and economics
student turned investment banker turned computer entrepreneur,
recently started Gobi Inc. For $25.99 a month for 36 months, plus a
one-time fee of $29.99 and shipping and handling, Gobi sells a
machine with a 300-megahertz Celeron processor, monitor and modem.
</P>
<P>
   Ramakrishnan said that the company plans to upgrade the computer
as technology changes but that he is still ironing out the details
of how the upgrades would take place and what technological
advances would qualify for upgrades. He said subscribers would be
able to purchase the computer at the end of their
three-year-contracts for about $50 each.
</P>
<P>
   In Mount Laurel, N.J., Dennis M. Cline and his colleagues have
begun Direct Web. The company plans to offer national service but
for now is taking orders only for the Philadelphia area for a
computer and Internet access ranging from $19.95 to $49.95
depending on the model of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Direct Web, the contract is month to month, not
long term. But there is still a catch: when subscribers log onto a
Direct Web computer, they will go immediately to a home portal page
sponsored by Direct Web. The page will feature advertisers who will
be allowed to store information like audio and video commercial
clips on the computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cline said he had become convinced after spending months
conducting focus groups that consumers would buy into the
rent-to-own concept. He said consumers were looking for simplified
solutions when buying computers _ like bundling computers with
Internet access and tech support _ and that they hate the fact that
when they ought a computer, it would not be on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, he said, users said they felt stupid when
trying to buy a computer. ``Once I buy it and install it, I find
out it's obsolete,'' Cline said, parroting a focus group member.
``I went through all the gyrations to buy this, then my
brother-in-law shows up and says, `Why'd you get the old one?'''
</P>
<P>
   The early interest in his company and in his competitors seems
to bear Cline out. Since his company opened the phone lines for
orders two weeks ago, he said, it has received 1,000 orders or more
each day. Similarly, the owners of Gobi and Intersquid said the
phones have been ringing constantly at their companies.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ms. Fontenot illustrates some of the appeal and
potential pitfalls of the experience. A public school teacher since
1962, Ms. Fontenot said her $30,000 salary did not permit luxuries
like computers. So several months ago, she started surfing the Net
in the school library looking for ``free PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she found a company called Free PC, which attracted a
lot of attention with its offer to give away 10,000 computers. In
exchange for the computers, users agreed to put up with a constant
stream of advertising and provide personal information to be used
by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fontenot said she had filled out ``20 or 30'' applications
on the Web for a computer and had never received any responses.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found Intersquid.com. She said she had been skeptical
at first but finally decided to call the company, where she had
conversations on four days with a man named Joe, who she later
found out happened to be the company president. He told her about
the computer and the Internet access. She started to feel
reassured.
</P>
<P>
   She had to overcome her fear about giving her credit card number
to someone she had never met, ``finally, I just jumped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her concern resurfaced several days later when the computer
failed to show up. She called Intersquid and found out that
shipping had been delayed by the Easter holiday. Several days
later, Calimari called again: he had sent the package but had
forgotten to include the CD-ROM necessary to hook the computer to
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Ms. Fontenot realized that there was a question
she had not yet asked. ``I said, `I've never asked you this, but
how old is your company?''' she recalled. ``He told me four
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Intersquid is not alone in experiencing growing pains. Gobi
Inc., for example, began getting national press coverage last week,
causing dozens of prospective clients to try to get in contact with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the company had not yet set up an ordering line
and had had even had an internal debate about whether it should set
one up at all. Franklin Raff, a spokesman for Gobi, said the
company was worried about whether it could afford an 800 number
because ``its margins are so tight.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Fontenot maintains her faith through it all.
She said she has set up her new computer and was waiting for her
CD-ROM. And she said she admired the Calimaris of the world, whose
entrepreneurial spirit has enabled her to own a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old schoolteacher taking a risk _ a big one,'' Ms.
Fontenot said. ``I'm trusting a lot of people here. I don't know
much about computers. You could sell me anything _ except the
Brooklyn Bridge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Free' Computers, and What They Cost &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several companies are offering deals for so-called free
computers, in which the user pays a fee for Internet service. The
computers and the terms of payment vary. Here are three of the
deals currently offered. &QL;
</P>

HOW TO FIND HELP

 (Attn: Texas)  (With CIR-ORGANIZE)

<P>
   If you are planning to hire someone to help you organize your
electronic tools, be sure to specify what you want to accomplish
(i.e. clean up computer files, organize e-mail, switch from paper
to an electronic calendar).
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth _ from co-workers or friends you trust _ is often
the best way to find help. Another way is to contact the National
Association of Professional Organizers, in Austin, Texas, which has
more than 1,000 members nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   NAPO (www.napo.net) has a referral service (512-206-0151) that
will give you names of organizers in your region. You may find
professional organizers listed in your Yellow Pages under
``organizing consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to pay fees ranging from $50 to as much $200 an hour,
depending on experience, region of the country and other factors.
Some have one rate for corporations and a lower rate for
individuals or nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have a candidate, ask for references and check them.
Professional organizing is unregulated, although NAPO is developing
a certification program. Ask how long the candidate has been in
business, what types of clients he or she has worked with
(corporate? small business? solo practitioners?) and whether he or
she is familiar with a range of electronic tools and software
programs.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a particular product, such as Microsoft's Outlook,
and do not want to change, make sure the consultant is familiar
with this product.
</P>
<P>
   Look out for those who can't give you references. Beware if you
get a gut feeling the candidate is not listening to you, and
remember that a good coach is a good listener. Finally, be willing
to do your part. Being coached, says Ken Diebold, a professional
organizer, ``is not getting into the back seat and watching someone
else drive.'' You must be willing to accept advice, share
information and test new things.

   The surfing heroes of ``The Endless Summer,'' a 1966 documentary
directed by Bruce Brown, circled the globe, long boards in hand, in
search of the perfect wave. But in location after location, they
were plagued by the dispiriting greeting of ``you should have been
here yesterday'' as they grimaced at the flat waves that faced
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Brown and his surfers would be able to take a
more educated guess at which beach would be hopping with
well-shaped tubes (waves) by using a computer and a modem. Surfers,
from professionals to groms, or novices, can use the Web to find
tidal charts, weather reports, tropical storm maps, local surf
reports, pollution watches and buoy readings before they make the
trek to search for the perfect wave.
</P>
<P>
   A global community of surfers from places like England, Israel,
Italy, Australia, Southern California and even Brooklyn has tamed
not only the surfers' local breaks but the Web, too. The surfers
are making their information and experiences accessible to all who
have an interest in the surfing life.
</P>
<P>
   Mikke Pierson, the owner of Z J Boarding House, a sporting gear
store in Santa Monica, Calif., said he looked at the Internet every
morning to find out about storm activity that might affect
California surf conditions as well as swell information for his
area. ``You can really tell where you should go surf,'' he said.
Pierson shares the information he finds with his patrons through a
telephone surf report his store provides. Apart from predicting
great waves, the Internet helps link surfers worldwide, Pierson
said. ``Totally _ that's what it's all about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of the Web's surf sites are bogged down with
superficial information and advertisements, or consist solely of
action photos of surfers looking for a little glory, a number of
sites offer quick-loading practical information, like the
conditions at local beaches and the nearest surf shop for having a
fin replaced. For the many armchair surfers, other sites act as
cultural tutorials through the often romanticized subculture of
surfing that, more than just being a sport, has become synonymous
with a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   An endless summer, like the one Brown chronicled more than 30
years ago, may be elusive today to the average surfer (especially
the average surfer with a job), but through the Web, the waves of
famous spots like the south shore of Australia or Hawaii's Pipeline
become a little more tangible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITY SURFER: NYC
</P>
<P>
   www.users.interport.net/barney
</P>
<P>
   Created and maintained by Rob Cummings, a surfer living in
Brooklyn who is nicknamed Barney, City Surfer: NYC is a jumping-off
point for any New York City dweller with aspirations of trading in
concrete for a day on the swells of the nearby Atlantic Ocean or
Long Island Sound. Cummings plans to expand this site within the
next few months. He also intends to introduce advertisements and a
stronger emphasis on travel.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes things like the complete 1999 tide tables for
the Fire Island Inlet and journal entries that chronicle the
creator's surfing adventures (including advice on how to carry a
surfboard on a crowded subway car without making enemies). The
site's main attraction is a network of links that gives the visitor
quick access to specific surfing information for the tristate area.
Links to local weather reports, Atlantic wave models and nearby
surf video cameras are organized in groupings that are easy to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   If a trip to Montauk, N.Y., or to the Jersey Shore is out of the
question, a subway token can get anyone in New York City to
Rockaway Beach in Queens and, with luck, a nice set of waves. Nor
is summer the only season for New York surfing. Monster waves
created by autumn hurricanes and winter storms are favorites of
many hard-core Manhattan surfers, as was evident during last year's
Hurricane Bonnie. Dozens of surfers, exhilarated by the brawny
waves, ignored the closing of Rockaway Beach and took to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings' site also features a travel section that offers
information and advice through excerpts from e-mail messages. The
firsthand accounts are colorful _ sometimes even profane _ and
laden with facts about surf conditions and hot spots around the
globe, along with grass-roots nuggets that may be otherwise hard to
find in travel guides. How many travel books, for instance, could
identify surfing beaches in County Mayo in Ireland that not only
have pubs within walking distance but have, the source says, pubs
that ``pull an excellent pint?''
</P>
<P>
   Another message warns of a 14-foot reptile that has laid claim
to a river mouth in Costa Rica. Despite the report of a man-eater,
this surfing spot is not to be missed, the writer says.
</P>
<P>
   The Enviro, Weather, Buoys and Surf Culture pages have numerous
links on each page. Succinct descriptions of the focus and
usefulness of each link (the Surfbook site is described as
``containing all you need to know from hanging 10 to shaping
blanks'') allow the site visitor to decide quickly about which way
to click. Also included is a Tips page, which appears to be a
seemingly endless block of text. The page has e-mail, most of it
didactic, from various people. Use the page index to avoid getting
stuck in this mire of information.
</P>
<P>
   As with a lot of writing about surfing, the Travel, Tips and
Journal pages are dominated by the surfers' lingua franca: ``kook
flails for the shoulder, pearls right in front of me, loses his
board, which cuts a four-inch gash in my rail.'' You can do your
own rough translation (an unskilled surfer falls off his board,
which then becomes a menace to other surfers) by using the
surfer-speak dictionary of the Surf Culture Orange County Web site
(reviewed below).

   SURFLINE
</P>
<P>
   www.surfline.com
</P>
<P>
   For surfers who don't live close to the ocean, every free day
poses a problem: where to surf? An uninformed decision may lead to
a day spent among Lilliputian waves, while a nearby beach has
lovely tubes just waiting to be tamed.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to check Surfline before setting out. Scouts
employed by this site report conditions at their local beaches at
sunrise each day. An easy-to-read map of the United States lists
reports from more than 40 coastal locations, from the cold waters
of Hampton Beach, N.H., down the East Coast and across the southern
coast of Texas, then up the West Coast to Ocean Beach in Northern
California, with a detour to Hawaii. Popular Costa Rican and
Australian beaches are surveyed daily as well.
</P>
<P>
   The local surf reports include water temperatures, wind
conditions, high and low tides, and descriptions of the wave
quality. ``Poor shape and ridability'' or a ``fading south ground
swell with fair shape'' can make the difference between staying
home or pulling out the wet suit.
</P>
<P>
   Once a visitor chooses a specific surf report location, links
appear for local satellite images, buoy readings, marine forecasts,
tropical storm tracking, tide and current reports, and in some
locations, swell models. Though the surf report should provide
enough to help you decide whether to tie your surfboard to the top
of a car and sit in beach traffic, the additional information can
aid serious surfers in setting up a schedule for several days.
Local surf shop information is also accessible for each location in
case you forget your wax or, worse yet, waterproof sunblock.
</P>
<P>
   If calculating the buoy readings' relationship to an upcoming
swell seems too academic, this site also offers what a budding
Kelly Slater or Lisa Andersen (two recent world champions) could no
doubt use: surf alerts via e-mail. The Web site's surf forecasting
team offers free notification by e-mail whenever the surfing
conditions in the member's area become noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Surfline also has cameras set up at a handful of locations,
mainly on the California coast and at famous breaks like Hawaii's
Pipeline, to offer live streaming video feeds. Though the quality
of the video is crude, the load time is quick and provides a rough
look at what you are (or aren't) missing.
</P>
<P>
   Though this site is efficient for getting information about
conditions quickly, the surf reports are subject to the whims of
the surf scouts. Texans take note: there hasn't been a update from
Galveston since May 22, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   SURF CULTURE ORANGE COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   www.inorangecounty.com/orangemedia/sites/surfculture
</P>
<P>
   For armchair and devout surfers alike, this site is full of
information about the culture of surfing, showing how the legendary
surfers of the 20th century turned surfing into a professionally
competitive sport that draws crowds worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The material for the site is from the International Surfing
Museum in Huntington Beach, Calif., one of the nation's most
popular surfing towns. The rich atmosphere of nostalgia is created
through the use of archival photos and the ``Beach Blanket Bingo''
style of kitsch in the design.
</P>
<P>
   A Kings of the Wave page links the listed honorees with quick
biographies and photos of their glory days. The list includes Tom
Curren, Linda Benson, Rell Sunn and Duke Kahanamoku, the Hawaiian
Olympian whom many credit with the rise of modern surfing. But do
not expect vast insight into your favorite surfing legend: the
biographies really just provide lists of career highlights.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a landmarks and culture section that offers an
overview of the relationship between surfing and cars, a
relationship that has apparently weakened since the days of the
Volkswagen bus and the woodie station wagon, as well as a page on
surfing tunes that is helpful to those of us who need reminding
that Dick Dale and the Del-Tones were around before Pulp Fiction.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some odd pieces of surf lore, like the story of
the 15-foot-long, 100-pound redwood surfboard that Tom Blake built
for himself in California as a ``lightweight'' board after being
inspired by a trip to Hawaii in 1922. But while this site delivers
a clear historical perspective and an entertaining, easily
navigated layout, it leaves a visitor wanting more background
information, especially on the sport's pop-cultural role in
history. The Magic Surf Bus
(www.surfbus.freeserve.co.uk/index.htm), an elaborate surfing
museum full of offbeat information, is a nice detour for visitors
looking to pick up where the Orange County site leaves off.
</P>
<P>
   To help readers understand surfing culture better, the site
offers a surf language dictionary. Comical as well as practical,
the dictionary supplies definitions for terms like kook (an
unskilled surfer), green room (the space inside the curve of the
wave) and bone crusher (a big wave that breaks with extreme force).
</P>
<P>
   SURFERMAG.COM
</P>
<P>
   www.surfermag.com
</P>
<P>
   In the translation from page to screen, the online version of
Surfer magazine, one of the sport's best-read publications, gains
in inventiveness what it loses in photo quality. The site's images
pale with their lack of clarity and often grainy appearance. But
the Vintage Surfer section earns those lost points back with a
22-page unedited interview with the legendary surfer Duke
Kahanamoku from the mid-1960s (in its original type), as well as
excerpts from the first edition of Surfer, published in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   News of the latest professional competitions, like the Rip Curl
Pro, and the Surf Rider Foundation's link (www.surfrider.com) along
with breaking environmental news give this site more currency than
you would find in its stale paper-based version. The features
available, however, are a chop-shop version of the magazine. An
interview with the current world champion, Kelly Slater, and an
article on the Men Who Ride Mountains competition at Mavericks, in
Northern California, are among the most recent features posted.
Older issues of the magazine are also on line, but only a handful
of articles from each issue are available to the visitor at no
charge. Full back issues can be purchased.
</P>
<P>
   An informal bulletin board page is a spiraling source of
interactive advice _ the topics posted vary from surfing in France
to coping with crushes on the professional surfer Shane Dorian. A
search engine allows participants to save time by typing in a
keyword to pull up the relevant postings.
</P>
<P>
   On the site's interactive Ask the Surf Doc section, a doctor
handles questions regarding surfing-related medical hazards, like
one visitor's worrisome ``weird tan thing'' and another's ``funky
numb toes.'' A pragmatic brevity marks the surfing doctor's bedside
manner. When asked, ``Is there such a thing as shark repellent?''
he replied, ``If you're afraid of sharks, then don't surf.''
</P>
<P>
   MINING COMPANY SURFING HOME PAGE
</P>
<P>
   surfing.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   The Mining Company provides a virtual library on surfing and
surfing-related sites, catalogued by Thomas James Rezeski. The
sheer volume of sites, however, is both a help and a hindrance. The
site is best visited with a specific topic in mind _ or if you have
enough spare time to browse the labyrinth of information.
</P>
<P>
   Rezeski sorts the sites he has chosen into more than 30
categories, like tandem surfing, surfing camps and schools, surfing
museums, windsurfing and surfing events. Once a specific category
is clicked, a list of all pertinent links appears. Each link is
accompanied by a brief description of its contents, which often
contain ``fabulous'' or ``must visit'' directives from the
enthusiastic Rezeski that tend to blur the line between the average
and the exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   A number of essays and stories are accessible without having to
go to other Web sites. Tips on how to prolong the life of your
surfboard and a quick history of the evolution of the surfboard are
among the essays Reznick provides.
</P>
<P>
   Boxed in by advertisements and links to the rest of the Mining
Company site that have nothing to do with the surfing page, the
page has a claustrophobic look. Once you are within the catalogued
links, however, an easy-to-read layout is available for a
well-mapped ride through the multitude of sites the surfing world
offers.

   Dusty Springfield. Rhino. 25 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Though Dusty Springfield was honored with long-overdue awards
weeks before her March 2 death, none is as fitting an epitaph as
this seminal 1969 album. Made the old-fashioned way (live in the
studio) with Aretha Franklin's producers and the rhythm section
behind Elvis Presley and Wilson Pickett, the session gave her
R&AMP;B-based pop the soulful grounding it needed. Her husky voice
never sounded better, from the sweet strains of ``Just a Little
Lovin' '' and ``Breakfast in Bed'' to the darker notes of ``No Easy
Way Down'' and ``I Can't Make It Alone.'' Though the sweetly
lustful ``Son of a Preacher Man'' was the album's only Top 10 chart
hit, this Memphis collection (including 14 bonus tracks) is the
very best of the former Mary O'Brien, who would have been 60
Friday.

   Bone Thugs-N-Harmony has distinguished itself as the closest

Krayzie Bone's solo debut that we learned who clearly fashions the
Cleveland group's unique sing-song sound. Barely distinguishable
from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony's million-selling collective efforts _
and thankfully more cohesive than its other solo ventures _
Krayzie's offering makes street level topics such as selling drugs
(``Dummy Man'') and exacting bloody revenge (``Payback Iz a
Bitch'') soar where pop stars such as Mariah Carey (who appears on
this record) shimmer. And he does it by simply applying what works
in divadom: polished production, memorable choruses and even better
storytelling. Put those elements together and before you know it,
Krayzie's made melodies out of mayhem.

<P>
   Listening to the new CD by Athens' (Ga.) Olivia Tremor Control
is much like an hourlong tour through the experimental outer limits
of rock. There are bits of the Beatles, the Beach Boys (in Brian
Wilson's late-'60s, sandbox-in-the-living room phase), German
boundary-pushers Can and Neu! and the tuneful art damage of Wire,
to name a few. ``The Sylvan Screen'' is a shining example of OTC's
method: two minutes of tape manipulation, then a beautiful and
startlingly Beatlesque tune, more tape weirdness and a wordless a
cappella outre that wouldn't sound out of place on a late-'60s
Beach Boys track. It's an imaginative concoction.

 &HT;    `Echo' sounds like Petty at his best
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Echo'' is vintage Heartbreakers _ Tom Petty's swamp cat yowl
backed by the pit crew precision of Benmont Tench's growling organ,
Howie Epstein's relentless bass line and Mike Campbell's lead
guitar. The 15 tunes here take us through all the tempos and
tactics we expect from this band, from driving rock anthems, to the
electric folk of Dylan and (of course) Byrds-influenced country
rock.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike contemporary offerings from other aging rockers, this
is no exercise in nostalgia. Petty and the gang sound as fresh as
when they shouted out ``Breakdown'' nearly 20 years ago, and one
wonders how they do it. It may be because the new songs sound
genuinely inspired, from the world-weary lyrics to the band's
seasoned playing style. Tench and Campbell know how to weave their
instruments around Petty like vines up an old oak tree, whether
it's pulling back with a simple acoustic piano or blowing it out
with an Eldorado roar on Hammond organ and soaring guitar.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps this out of ``Behind the Music'' territory, however,
are the experienced lyrics. Petty has always loved to sing about
women (``American Girl,'' ``Free Fallin'''), but his subject in
``Free Fallin''' is no longer a teenager living with her mama in
Reseda; she's a ``Free Girl Now,'' driving and smoking her way
across the landscape of middle age. On ``Lonesome Sundown,'' Petty
cries ``This is gonna be hard/Redemption comes to those who
wait/forgive-
</P>
<P>
   ness is the key,'' but it's about leaving a daughter, not a
lover.
</P>
<P>
   Petty and the Heartbreakers have not only become well-oiled in
their playing, but in their perspectives as well, learning through
their personal mistakes, misplaced choices and the inevitable
regrets that follow. In a sweet acoustic moment on a tune called
``This One's for Me,'' Petty reflects, ``You don't even know what
you got 'til you see it walking away.'' It's an experience his now
40-something fans will connect with immediately, which, after all,
is the secret to making music that remains vital and alive.

 &HT;    Opening the door to WWII-era evil
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Director Bryan Singer's follow-up to ``The Usual Suspects'' is
the morally creepy tale of a fresh-faced teenage boy (Brad Renfro)
who wants to grow up to be a Nazi. His dreams come true when he
figures out a man in his neighborhood (Ian McKellen) is really an
infamous war criminal, a German escapee masquerading as a seemingly
benign old chap. Though smoothly adapted from a Stephen King
novella, and commandingly acted by McKellen, the film sticks a foot
in the door of its subject, but can only seem trivial in comparison
to the true evil it tries to evoke. Grade: B-

   Blueberries in Shade
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to know if I can plant blueberries in a raised
bed in my garden on Long Island. The spot I have in mind is in the
shade of a mature oak tree, about 12 feet from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three common kinds of blueberry: the ``wild'' ones,
Vaccinium angustifolia, low-growing spreaders that are pretty, but
not suitable for home fruit production; rabbiteye blueberries, V.
ashei, which do best in the South, and highbush blueberries, V.
corymbosum. These last would be an excellent choice for a Long
Island garden, particularly one with the acidic soil for which the
area is famous. But it would be best if you could think up a
brighter spot for them. Though blueberries are often described as
able to tolerate some shade, there's likely to be more than
``some'' only 12 feet from a mature oak.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine problems aside, the location you have in mind won't be
ideal unless that raised bed is really king-size. Most of the
reliable, readily available highbush cultivars, including Blueray,
Patriot and Bluecrop, can eventually become shrubs 6 feet tall and
almost as wide, and you'll need at least two of them _ even
varieties advertised as ``self-fertile'' do much better with a
pollinator nearby. While there are some handsome dwarf types that
would fit nicely in a raised bed (Northblue, for instance, is about
two feet tall), they are not what you'd call fruit factories.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that won't matter if you're growing blueberries as
ornamentals. Their pretty spring flowers and bright yellow, orange
or red autumn foliage are reason enough to grow them even without
fruit _ which is what be unless you protect your crop from the
birds. It's a good idea to build an arbor around the bushes when
you first plant. This structure will add visual interest while the
shrubs are still small. Then, when it's time to foil the flying
freeloaders, you'll have a ready-made frame to hang the
bird-netting from.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs offer a good selection of early, midseason and
late-ripening fruits, so you can have blueberries for almost two
months. You can also end up with bloom times too widespread for
cross-pollination, so if the catalog doesn't say when they flower,
don't forget to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot, Blue Ray, and V. angustifolium are among the choices
available from Bear Creek Nursery, P.O. Box 411, Northport, Wash.
99157; (509) 732-6219. Patriot, Bluecrop and Northblue are sold by
Henry Fields Seed and Nursery Company, 415 North Burnett,
Shenandoah, Iowa 51602; (605) 665-9391. Catalogs from both are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Building Up a Bed
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to build up a perennial bed with an extra two to three
inches of soil and compost. Is it necessary to dig up and replant
the flowers and bulbs that are already there, or will they adapt to
being buried deeper?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a few perennials that are fussy about being buried.
Peonies, for instance, will fail to bloom if the buds that will
form shoots are more than about two inches underground. And the
lumpy rhizomes of bearded iris are prone to rot if their tops don't
get light and air. Most bulbs, on the other hand, won't care a bit.
In fact, experts often suggest burying bulbs, especially tulips,
more deeply than normal to encourage them to come back in future
years.
</P>
<P>
   Special exceptions aside, the rest will depend on how much of
your mixture is compost and how much is soil. Compost is lighter
and fluffier than soil, and much less likely to smother plants.
Over the course of the season, compost will continue to break down,
blending into the old soil, adding nutrients, improving structure
and encouraging beneficial organisms. A three-inch layer of compost
is definitely good, but by fall the bed won't be any taller than it
was before.
</P>
<P>
   There are different kinds of soil, all of them heavier than
compost. If your plants are already up, it would probably be wise
to lift them _ or wait till next year to build up the bed _ rather
than heaping three inches of dirt on their tender little heads. But
if your established perennials have not yet shown above ground,
they should have no trouble pushing new growth up two or three
inches farther to reach the light.
</P>
<P>
   Skunks in the Suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Q: I live in a lovely suburb 15 minutes outside Boston, and we
have a large skunk community. How can I keep them out of my yard?
Is there some kind of plant or shrub or other organic matter they
will avoid? It wouldn't be a problem except that my dog cannot stay
away from them. Is there a way to get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Getting rid of them is not to be. Skunks have adapted very
well to the suburbs, where there are lots of good things to eat _
lawn grubs, earthworms, mice and rats _ and plenty of sheltered
places to build dens. When you remove a skunk from such habitat,
all you do is open territory for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep them out of your yard is with a low, tight
wire mesh fence. Skunks don't do much climbing, so two feet tall
should be adequate. They do dig, though, which means you'll want to
bury the fencing six to eight inches deep. Nothing repels them, but
they are easily attracted, especially by grub-infested lawns and
anything fishy, meaty or sweet. (They love moldy cake and stale
cookies almost as much as raccoons do.)
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities suggest drenching the lawn with pesticides to
get rid of the grubs, but even doing that is unlikely to solve the
skunk problem completely. It's important to keep the garbage
covered, and to be aware that such organic fertilizers as blood
meal and bone meal are powerful lures. Keep unused supplies in
tightly lidded containers, and be sure to work the fertilizers well
into the soil as soon as you use them.
</P>
<P>
   Since as you note, the problem is not so much with the skunks as
with your dog, the easiest solution is probably to control the
pooch rather than the polecats.

<P>
   &QR;  ``A Fish Called Wanda'' (R) _ A larcenous lark meant to be
swallowed hook, line and sinker, it's a head-spinning farce in
which John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin
prove there's no honor among thieves by double- and triple-crossing
each other after a jewel heist (Kline won a supporting actor Oscar
for his efforts). The DVD edition is skimpy on special features,
but there is a booklet of production notes that reveals some
intriguing behind-the-scenes tidbits, some fishier than others. For
instance, Cleese recalls they had several fish they were
considering for more prominent roles. ``One morning we walked to
the tank and realized this particular fish had eaten 32 extras. She
must have wanted the part very badly to have disposed of the
competition in that way.'' Grade: A-

   &QR;  ``Antz'' (PG) _ Animation freaks will be especially pleased.
When it was released in theaters last fall, more attention was paid
to the all-star cast of voices (led by Woody Allen and Sharon
Stone) than to the nitty-gritty of the animation process. Not so
here. Among the special features is an audio commentary by
directors Tim Johnson and Eric Darnell, a short feature on the
production and looks at everything from the basics of computer
animation to the character design for the movie. Plus, there's the
always-tempting ``never before seen footage.'' Grade: B-

ponderous, three-hour update of ``Death Takes a Holiday'' wastes a

 &HT;    Humans outdo high-tech schemes in screen intrigue
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies such as ``The Matrix'' or David Cronenberg's upcoming
paranoid gamesmanship ``eXistenZ'' remind us how relative reality
really is. But both these pictures' manipulations are byproducts of
technology _ in the former, alien machinations mask the real world
from its inhabitants, while in the latter, an ultra-sophisticated
virtual reality game asks its players to willingly enter an
alternate world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once upon a time, we didn't need high-tech intrusions on our
lives. Perceptions could be skewed by mere human beings with a good
scheme. Or, even better, a good scam.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some intriguing titles with a few tricks up their
sleeves. And the only gadget they need is the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sleuth'' (1972)
</P>
<P>
   Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film adaptation of Anthony Shaffer's hit
play pairs Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in some very canny
cat-and-mouse games on the grounds of one of England's statelier
mansions. Olivier is a hugely successful mystery writer who's
hugely upset that his wife is having an affair with _ ouch _ her
lower-class hairdresser (Caine). Olivier invites Caine over to sort
things out. Or set things up?
</P>
<P>
   Impress your film buff friends: When it came to his work, the
great Olivier was as human as the rest of us. Caine recalls that he
came on set one day in a desperate state and holding a small
mustache. He told Mankiewicz that last night, he'd suddenly
realized what he was doing wrong. Producing the sliver of hair, he
almost cried, ``I can't act with my own face! I always need some
sort of disguise.'' The mustache apparently solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``House of Games'' (1987)
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet made his debut as a bona fide double threat (writer
and director) with this devilishly clever comedy-melodrama. His
then-wife, Lindsay Crouse, plays a chilly, repressed analyst who
wouldn't know real life if it hit her in the face. Which is more or
less what happens when she falls in with some con men and falls for
their leader (Joe Mantegna) hook, line and sucker. Done as a sort
of Pinter-esque noir, the movie has a highly stylized look and a
seductive theatrical flair.
</P>
<P>
   Impress your film buff friends: Crouse later told an interviewer
she was so successful in the part that, for a while, ``I kept
getting cast as Nazi surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Sting'' (1973)
</P>
<P>
   Having guided Paul Newman and Robert Redford through ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' director George Roy Hill decided to
see if the magic still worked if he switched their cowboy gear for
'30s gangster garb. Thus, ``The Sting,'' in which the erstwhile
outlaws are transformed into raffish con men who orchestrate a very
complicated betting scam to fleece a big-time racketeer (Robert
Shaw.)
</P>
<P>
   Impress your film buff friends: Talk about a sting. . . . Hill's
lightweight entertainment made off with seven Oscars, including
best picture. Among the heavyweight also-rans: fellow nominees
``Cries and Whispers'' and ``The Exorcist'' and non-nominees ``Mean
Streets,'' ``Serpico,'' ``The Last Detail,'' ``Paper Moon,'' ``The
Long Goodbye,'' ``The Way We Were'' and ``Last Tango in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' (1988)
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin and Michael Caine are rival con artists trying to
work the same Riviera turf. Caine is the resort's resident prince
of thieves who bilks rich women by posing as deposed royalty;
Martin is a two-bit hustler who's cramping his style. To settle who
rules, a bet is proposed: The first to extract a certain sum from
an innocent abroad (Glenne Headly), rumored to be a soap heiress,
wins; the loser leaves town.
</P>
<P>
   Impress your film buff friends: The movie is a loose remake of a
1964 flop called ``Bedtime Story,'' which starred Marlon Brando and
David Niven. And if your buff already knows that, stump him/
</P>
<P>
   her with this bit of trivia: Caine had been asked to read the
script a few years earlier, only then it was called ``The King of
the Mountain'' and his co-star would've been an up-and-comer named
Tom Cruise.

THE SUBVERSIVE ZIPPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February, I spent a few days in the Netherlands with Peter
Noever, the director of the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts in
Vienna, and Sarah Lerfel, the owner of Colette, a shop in Paris
that mixes design, fashion and art, when we were all judging the
entries for the Rotterdam Design Prize. Our mission was to select
one winner from 47 examples of Dutch graphic, industrial and
architectural design.
</P>
<P>
   After much debate, we awarded nearly $20,000 in prize money to
Heat Transfer Station 8, a mysterious black building with soft
polyurethane-coated walls that sits in a farmer's field outside
Utrecht. Someday it will supply hot water to the future city of
Leidsche Rijn. For now, it is an enigma, like the black monolith in
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' except friendlier: It has a basketball
hoop on the front, a climbing wall on one side, and swallows nests
along the roof line.
</P>
<P>
   We nearly gave the prize to a highway underpass connecting the
old city of Leidschendam with a new city, now under construction,
called Leidschenveen. Designed by Zwarts &AMP; Jansma, an architecture
firm from the town of Abcoude (outside Amsterdam), and Hans Muller,
an Amsterdam artist, the tunnel is supposed to provide an inviting
link between old and new towns, a place where pedestrians and
bicyclists can feel safe and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   One wall of the tunnel is dotted with green light-emitting
diodes that display constantly changing abstract patterns. The
tunnel's centerpiece is what New Yorkers would call a zipper, an
electronic message board like the one that wraps around 1 Times
Square. The designers call it a ``light journal'' or
``lichtkrant.'' Instead of displaying news or advertising, it shows
messages that anybody can type in from a special Web page. The
tunnel's Web address (www.Leidschenveen.nl/tunnel) appears on an
otherwise conventional Dutch street sign by the tunnel entrance.
</P>
<P>
   While I was delighted by the twinkling green diodes, I was
unmoved by the lichtkrant. After all, the Joe Boxer billboard in
Times Square has been running e-mailed messages _ ``Brandi Adams
loves Ross Peters!'' _ since 1995. And zippers, in general, are too
commonplace to be exciting.
</P>
<P>
   By my count, there are at least eight working zippers in the
Times Square area, ranging from the magnificent triple-decker
display of financial data racing around the Morgan Stanley
headquarters to more modest devices that run texts promoting the
cable company RCN or the play ``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Times Square, Fox News Channel's building at Avenue of
the Americas and 48th Street sports what is supposedly the world's
third-longest zipper. It's also the only one in the city with a
serif typeface: Times New Roman.
</P>
<P>
   Or it was. There's now a miniature version of the Fox zipper in
a newsstand in Grand Central Terminal. ``We took over the Hudson
News stand as a marketing thing,'' Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox
News, said. The zipper runs in a circle, like an electronic crown
molding, above the heads of the cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   As a jaded New Yorker, I just couldn't get worked up about yet
another zipper. After all, most zippers, despite a look that
screams ``Information Age,'' dispense nothing but blather.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd failed to realize during the Rotterdam judging is that
the lichtkrant is, in fact, unique: It's a free-speech zipper.
While the e-mail messages displayed on the Joe Boxer billboard have
been carefully screened and selected, in Leidschendam, messages
flow unimpeded from Web site to tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said Rein Jansma, a partner in the firm that designed
the underpass, was to circumvent the problem of graffiti by
offering an electronic substitute. ``Even if people write abusive
language,'' Jansma said, ``it will disappear all by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Leidschendam's city fathers, Jansma said, are not happy about
the uninhibited stream of text, which, inevitably, includes
obscenities and dirty jokes. When the city officials proposed
hiring a censor, Jansma countered with a ``dynamic filter.'' If
people are really hurt by the text on the wall, Jansma suggested,
they can put offensive words on a blacklist for a week.
</P>
<P>
   City officials would prefer a fixed list of forbidden words. But
Muller, the artist who is under contract to maintain the Web site
and tunnel link, refuses to cooperate. ``They want to sue me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the messages continue to flow, uncensored.
</P>
<P>
   Had I fully grasped the subversive nature of the Leidschendam
zipper, I might have voted differently when I sat on the Rotterdam
Design Prize jury. On the other hand, a heat transfer station with
a basketball hoop is hard to resist.

   To explore the origins of the food we eat is never to look at a
salad bar quite the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing the history of everyday foods _ those we may take for
granted _ can lead to something as lofty as the unfolding of
civilization. Follow the food and learn of geography, history,
anthropology, science, culture, art and even religions of the
world. You'll learn of the people who first developed the food, how
it was dispersed to other areas and the monumental changes that
came about with the development of certain foods.
</P>
<P>
   Take the lowly carrot at that salad bar. When first cultivated
in Afghanistan around the seventh century, they were purple, and
they stayed that way until Dutch botanists got hold of them and
turned them orange during the Middle Ages. Sometime in the 1500s,
Spanish explorers brought the now orange cousin of parsley westward
and planted it on an island off Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   And what of celery? It was considered so powerful as a medicine,
an aphrodisiac, even an aid to help witches fly, that it became a
common design on the crowns and crests of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Beets, too, have an interesting history. Lucius Junius Moderatus
Columella, the first century version of a food writer, waxed poetic
about the glories of beets, which were called beta because of their
shape, which is similar to that of the second letter of the Greek
alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   These are just snippets. While there are advanced university
college courses on food history, the Internet has some wonderful
and fun sites.

   Asparagus is an exotic vegetable of the lily family, enjoyed for
its delicacy of flavor and nutritional values since ancient times.
As early as 200 B.C. the Romans were growing asparagus, enjoying it
in season and preserving it by freezing. Roman emperors maintained
special asparagus fleets to gather and carry the choicest spears to
the empire.
</P>
<P>
   Asparagus was probably a medicine long before it was a food; the
second-century Greek physician Galen described asparagus as
``cleansing and healing.'' It's an excellent source of vitamins A
and C and is a good source of minerals, potassium and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   Growing asparagus takes patience, as the seeds are planted in
the spring, then the plants are set out into permanent fields when
they're a year old or older.

 &HT;    Special corn bread plea turns up two possibilities
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Susan Vaughn of Conyers (Ga.) requested a hot water
corn bread recipe after reading about it in a book that didn't
include a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   We're giving her a choice of two, both making patties _ the
first fried, the other baked.
</P>
<P>
   The first recipe was sent by Joanna McQuillan Weeks, food editor
at The Standard-Times in New Bedford, Mass., who read the request
when this column went out on the wire to other newspapers. She
remembered reading about this recipe from Earl's Southern Catering
in Milwaukee in another wire story.
</P>
<P>
   The second comes from Texas and was published here two years
ago.

 &HT;    Miller Lite's masquerade a pale imitation of pilsner
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A generation ago, people would breezily call any red
wine from California a burgundy. One of Ernest &AMP; Julio Gallo's
biggest sellers was a $2.99 wine it called Hearty Burgundy. A
parallel charade took place on the white side. Any sweetish wine
could call itself a chablis and no one thought twice. Not even the
straw jug raised a suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   In none of these cases was the appellation close to the truth,
and it's no closer with Miller Brewing Co.'s new ad campaign for
Miller Lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enjoy the Great Taste of a True Pilsner Beer,'' the billboards
and full-page magazine ads say.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well call Velveeta an aged cheddar.
</P>
<P>
   P.T. Barnum pegged us right: You can sell some people anything.
That's why the federal government enacted truth-in-advertising
laws. We're suckers for advertising, and mass-market brewers know
it as well as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine a point on it, but Miller Lite would be
deported without appeal if caught in the Czech Republic or in
Germany. The only thing it has in common with a real pilsner is its
pale gold color.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of beers, both lagers and ales, are gold without being
in the pilsner style.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based Institute of Brewing Studies, in a style guide
it publishes for beer sellers, is quite specific. Whether in the
German or the Czech style, a pilsner is characterized by high hop
bitterness and a medium hop flavor and aroma (medium to low, in the
German).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a pilsner is an assertive beer, slightly maltier
in the Czech style, slightly drier in the German. Except for the
color, there is nothing light, or Lite, about it.
</P>
<P>
   The classic example is Pilsner Urquell, first brewed in the
Bohemian city of Pilsen in 1842. (In German, ``Urquell'' means
``original source of.'') Its pre-eminence is justified, as is its
reputation for traveling poorly. In my experience, the chances of
getting a bottle of Pilsner Urquell that's even tolerably fresh are
50-50 at best.
</P>
<P>
   But in both the German and the Czech styles, there are other
first-rate pilsners, this one a touch hoppier, that one a touch
maltier.
</P>
<P>
   Staropramen, from Prague, isn't as complex as Pilsner Urquell,
but it has a nice hoppiness and it certainly travels better. Easily
the best pilsner I drank in Germany was made by Jever, in the far
north. Unfortunately, it's not available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Veltins and Bitburger, both from the Rhineland, each
distinguishable from the other, are available and worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Among domestic interpretations of the style, none that I've
sampled matches Tuppers' Hop Pocket Pils. Indeed, few German or
Czech pilsners are as ``big'' as this beer.
</P>
<P>
   But what all of these have in common is a distinctive hop
presence _ always the flowery Saaz hop in the case of a Czech pils,
the Saaz in combination with other hops in the case of most German
pilsners.
</P>
<P>
   If the palate finds one different from another, it usually is a
difference of degrees. All are recognizably pilsners _ and none of
them tastes even remotely like Miller Lite.
</P>
<P>
   But here are these billboards and ads, selling a fake. The sad
truth is the ``pilsner'' is a term that Americans have bastardized,
just as they once bastardized ``burgundy'' and ``chablis.'' Most
American mass-market lagers are distant derivates of the pilsner
style _ but so distant that the lineage is no longer discernible.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Dr. David Ryder, vice president for brewing and
research at Miller, in what sense Miller Lite was a pilsner, he
said (in a British accent), ``You're going to have to speak with
the public relations department.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man from the PR department confidently said, ``There are
certain characteristics common to all pilsners, and Miller Lite
falls into that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   A true pilsner is lagered for up to 60 days, the time during
which the malt and hops slowly develop their complexity. It's
customary for mass-market American brewers to lager their beers for
only 21 days, and sometimes less. Production takes priority, and
then it's all marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A true pilsner will be made of entirely barley malt, with no
corn or rice. American mass-market beers make ample use of both.
</P>
<P>
   A true pilsner is hopped at a rate of 25 to 40 International
Bitterness Units. American mass-market beers, brewed with the
lowest common denominator in mind, have IBUs barely in double
digits _ 10 to 12 is typical. A ``pilsner'' with no more hop
character than that is masquerading as something it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just call it Miller Lite and be honest about it.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The Ralph Steadman art on the label catches the eye, dogs with
wings, dogs like you see only in dreams. But unless you're into
buying labels, sooner or later you ask what's inside. The Flying
Dog line of beers from Colorado has moved briskly since being
introduced to Atlanta last year. Not all of them are something
special, but the Classic Pale Ale and the Snake Dog India Pale are
exceptionally well-made beers that grow on you _ or have grown on
me, at any rate.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic Pale Ale is dry-hopped with Cascades but isn't as
hoppy as many Pacific Northwest pale ales. It has a firm malt
backbone, characteristic of the Colorado style, and complements
just about any food except the very light and the very spicy. I had
it recently with something as simple as a spinach salad dressed
with olive oil and accompanied by smoked Gouda and crackers. It was
wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   I could drink it easily with, say, the kids' pizza or with chili
that didn't reach a flash point of pepperiness. If you like your
chili hot, try the Snake Dog, hopped with domestic strains of the
classic East Kent Goldings of England, and with a maltier character
than many West Coast IPAs. ``We really tried to model it after a
British IPA in body and color,'' says brewer Eric Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Warner enjoys it merely as an aperitif, something to get the
digestive juices working. That, in fact, is how I enjoy it myself.

 &HT;    Men Who Shop: By necessity or by choice, more and more males are
becoming `primary' buyers
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 10:12 p.m. at the Kroger in Tucker, and Lane
Teilhaber is on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kris, has been working late, and Teilhaber is cruising
the aisles like a man possessed, picking up ``the essentials'':
soap, shampoo, mouthwash . . . Entenmann's chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she has to work a 12-hour day, it's only fair if I do the
shopping,'' says Teilhaber, 39, a Atlanta shoe salesman. ``There
are things I'd much rather be doing, but we split up the grocery
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Teilhaber has joined a generation of American
males who, by necessity or by choice, are shrugging off traditional
gender roles and undertaking a chore once considered the exclusive
domain of women. They are Men Who Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say that more men are pushing buggies down
grocery store checkout lines, elbowing their way toward discount
racks and shopping malls, and buying big-ticket status items that
are markers of modern masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   But these shoppers fit no neat stereotypes. They can be
fashion-conscious up-and-comers trying to impress with a Hugo Boss
suit, empty-nesters wanting to buy a Jet Ski or work-at-home dads
who don't mind clipping coupons.
</P>
<P>
   The bread-and-butter shopper
</P>
<P>
   Among the most studied of male shoppers are those forced into
the marketplace by the demographic and lifestyle changes of the
past two decades. Higher divorce rates, more men remaining single
for longer and more fathers winning joint-custody cases mean that
they're learning to shop both for themselves and their children,
for everything from disposable diapers to the latest styles in
jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the trend is being driven by the growth of
two-income households, such as the Teilhabers' of Decatur, where a
more egalitarian attitude toward domestic duties has taken root. In
a 1978 survey of shopping patterns by Progressive Grocer, a New
York-based trade publication, men accounted for about 10 percent of
the primary shoppers in U.S. households. In 1998, a similar survey
by the magazine found that the number of male primary shoppers had
risen to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a tidal wave, but some experts say the number is
steadily increasing _ and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among men, grocery shopping is still a minority activity,''
says Ruby Roy Dholakia, a professor of marketing at the University
of Rhode Island, who has studied the trend. ``But in homes with two
wage earners where the labor is divided, men seem to have taken on
two chores: playing with the children and grocery shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Dholakia believes that men generally find shopping ``more
gratifying'' than other domestic grunt work, because the activity
may help them bond with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kirton, director of strategic planning for Turner Sports,
says he generally does the family grocery shopping instead of his
wife, Wonya Lucas, vice president of marketing for TNT. Kirton, 38,
says he enjoys it and insists he's better at it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan it out. She just goes to the store and gets what she
thinks we need, so sometimes we wind up with three jars of peanut
butter,'' says Kirton, of Marietta, who has two young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, says Lucas. ``I don't know about better, but he is
more particular,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The power shopper
</P>
<P>
   Of course, men are shopping for more than just bread-and-butter
items at the grocery store. Although shopping typically ranks low
as a male recreational activity, retailers recognize that there's a
core group of men who are enthusiastic buyers of electronics,
stereo equipment, sporting gear, power tools and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most powerful consumers in America are older, baby boomer
men,'' says J. Walker Smith, a managing partner of Yankelovich
Partners, a marketing research group with offices in Atlanta.
``They're between 45 to 55 and are in their peak earning years.
They have more disposable income because their kids are grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith describes these shoppers as thrill-seekers who are buying
``big toys'' such as personal watercraft and snowmobiles. And savvy
retailers are taking note, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stores are incorporating adventure and excitement into
the retail setting,'' Smith says. ``Range Rover is a perfect
example. When you go to one of their car lots, they make it feel
like you're going on a safari.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion-conscious shopper
</P>
<P>
   The men's magazine POV recently identified another group of male
shoppers: the fashion-conscious ``emerging affluents.'' Typically
men between ages 21 and 34, 70 percent of these upscale shoppers
said they shop for clothes at least once a month, with about 16
percent saying they do it once a week. More than 90 percent shop
for themselves, with 5 percent relying on the help of a girlfriend
or wife.
</P>
<P>
   This group may be fueling the increase in menswear sales, which
totaled $35 billion between January and September 1998, up from
$32.5 billion during the same period of 1997 _ a faster growth than
that of any other market segment, including women's and children's
apparel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a quiet revolution,'' says Ted Kruckel, a New
York-based fashion consultant who has written about male shoppers
for GQ magazine. ``I'm not talking about the stereotype of the
fussy homosexual who can tell the difference between Prada and Hugo
Boss. I'm talking about straight guys who don't mind wrestling over
a cashmere sweater at a grubby discount outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruckel says the willingness of men to shop for their clothes is
an outgrowth of the 1980s fitness craze: ``Men are taking better
care of themselves and don't mind going shopping if it will help
them show it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett of Norcross is a musician and moving company owner
who says he's probably more picky about his wardrobe than most
guys, and he's not ashamed of it. On a recent day off, he was a
solitary but determined figure as he went through racks of casual
shirts at the Value City discount store on Buford Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go clothes shopping about every other month,'' says Bennett,
37. ``I don't spend a lot at one time, but I like to keep up with
the style. I hate the crowds, so I come when I know the stores are
quiet and empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although studies have shown that most men spend little time
browsing for clothes and will pay higher prices rather than
bargain-hunt, shoppers such as Bennett are the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind searching for deals, and I know quality when I
see it,'' he says. ``I shop off-season and look for stuff on sale.
Only suckers pay full price.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Robertson, a 35-year-old independent filmmaker, is also a
value-minded clothes shopper. He checks regularly at favorite
outlets such as Apparel Mart, K&AMP;G and Men's Wearhouse and goes into
department stores only if they're having a big sale.
</P>
<P>
   A self-avowed Man Who Shops, Robertson says he's just as
comfortable picking out bath oil for his girlfriend at Victoria's
Secret as buying fresh flowers for his grandmother or complimenting
another man on his outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who I am,'' declares Robertson. ``I don't mind giving
someone their props if they're wearing a nice tie or something. I'm
secure enough in my masculinity, and I don't think being a man has
anything to do with whether you shop or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he considers shopping more than just an idle pastime.
It's a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a city like Atlanta, a man has to stay ahead of the curve
because it's so socially competitive. If you look a certain way,
you can parlay into any environment and people think you belong.
You don't want people to look at what you're wearing at a social
function and say, `Who invited that guy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The three `P's' of male shopperdom
</P>
<P>
   Male shoppers _ whether in the market for milk, riding mowers or
Mossimo _ fall into three distinct categories, according to
Frequency Marketing. The Ohio-based marketing consultant has
separated them into the following groups:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patricians tend to be more affluent, as well as single and
childless. They are more likely to shop in specialty stores, for
clothing, electronics and sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Practicals also tend to be single but have lower incomes than
Patricians and are usually less free-spending. They prefer discount
stores and are more likely to pay with cash. Although not
particularly fashion-conscious, they plan purchases rather than
buying on impulse.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patriarchs are older and less educated. They have lower
incomes and are likely to be retired or unemployed. They usually
shop out of necessity, but their purchases tend to be top-of-the
line items.

TAKING THE GARBLES OUT OF INTERNET PHONE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the telecommunications industry, making a phone call over the
Internet using a PC and a modem is considered something for
``hobbyists,'' a nice way of saying it is frustrating and produces
dubious results. Anyone who has tried making a call over the
Internet will know what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the idea of talking over the Net holds great
appeal, at least from a financial standpoint. For that reason,
traditional telephone equipment companies like Nortel and Lucent
and Internet equipment makers like Cisco are working to make
Internet calling more than just a curiosity. Currently, the
International Telecommunications Union is developing design
standards for broad-band Internet-based telephone calling. The
standards are being tested at six sites; the only one in North
America is Nortel's subjective testing laboratory in the suburbs of
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are about to do now is not just deliver quality equal
to today's traditional telephone network,'' said David Cuddy,
director of Network Edge Technology for Nortel. ``We will deliver
better quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Current telephone networks are not as efficient as they are
reliable. The single line the existing system holds open between
two callers is rarely used to capacity during conversation, let
alone during pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Internet calls, by contrast, convert conversation (but not
silences) into computer data which then is broken apart into small
pieces known as packets. Those packets are grouped with other bits
of information flowing through the Net until they arrive at their
destination, where they are, hopefully at least, reassembled into
sounds resembling human speech. It is complex but it lets networks
run at high-capacity levels. A study released last week by Analysys
Ltd., telecommunications consultants in Cambridge, England,
estimates that Internet calling could cut costs by half.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some considerable technical hurdles in the way
before Internet calling can be widely used. According to Cuddy and
his staff, current Internet calls suffer from three major problems:
excessive delay, mostly induced by converting the voice to data and
back again; echo, which comes from poor-quality audio equipment on
computers, and some network problems and garbles created when data
packets vanish or are excessively delayed in transit.
</P>
<P>
   Since perfection is not likely to be economically feasible, the
job of the Nortel testing lab is to figure out how much distortion
phone users will tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is carried out in a soundproof chamber which is
itself surrounded by a second soundproof chamber. With its light
beige perforated metal walls, the chamber resembles a sparsely
furnished meat locker. When the two steel doors are pulled shut,
the silence is slightly unnerving. ``Most people in here think they
have pressure in their ears,'' said Leigh Thorpe, an experimental
psychologist who regularly rounds up other Nortel employees and
puts them in the room. ``But what they really have is a brain
that's saying: `I'm in a room but there's so sound coming back off
the walls so my ears must be plugged.''
</P>
<P>
   Once locked inside, the employees spend about three hours
creating digital recordings of a word list carefully crafted to
reflect how phonetic sounds are used in English speech. The
deliberately spoken, recorded sentences sound like the ravings of a
troubled mind or some particularly bad beat poetry:
</P>
<P>
   What time of the year are parsnips planted?
</P>
<P>
   A tusk is used to make costly gifts.
</P>
<P>
   A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
</P>
<P>
   That fellow is just a dope of long standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman was gone when the sun rose.
</P>
<P>
   Once a batch of technically perfect recordings is finished, the
lab begins begins distorting it to reflect actual Internet calls,
either using computer manipulation or by running them through the
Nortel lab's own intranet.
</P>
<P>
   Then 60 people, mainly college students, will come to another
sound chamber in the lab. After donning studio-quality headphones,
they listen to the mangled recordings and rate them on a scale of
one to five with push buttons. Phonetic considerations aside, the
sentences are made deliberately unfamiliar and unrelated _ the
readers' voices intermixed _ in an attempt to force listeners to
concentrate on every word.
</P>
<P>
   Echo and delay are problems that have been overcome in
conventional telephone systems and are not likely to pose
unbeatable technical challenges with Internet calling. That aside,
Dr. Thorpe has found that delay often doesn't trouble listeners.
``They don't attribute it to the connection. They think, `It's that
guy at the other end, what's wrong with him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing missing data, however, is another story. ``With packet
loss, the information is gone,'' said Andrew Patrick, manager of
the subjective assessment group. The only solution so far is to
blend the remaining sounds together; although this process doesn't
replace the missing sound, it can reduce the jarring staccato
quality. ``We just fill it in with some putty so it doesn't sound
so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Because closed corporate Intranets (some of which already use
Internet calling) can minimize packet loss and delay, Nortel is
concentrating most of its Internet calling efforts in that segment.
Across a hall from the sound chambers is a prototype of what the
lab's research has so far helped produce. It is a speaker phone
stuffed with computer memory and a powerful microprocessor that
plugs in directly to the Internet using the Ethernet outlets found
in many offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a regular phone, it offers two levels of calling. During
a demonstration using Nortel internal network, its low quality
setting sounded much like a conventional phone line. But when put
on its high quality, or high bandwidth setting, the unit's speaker
was able to reproduce music _ piped from a CD into a second unit in
another room _ with the fidelity of a reasonably good clock radio.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the unit must have a relatively high-speed
link to the Net. Cuddy said the as-yet unnamed phone will be
introduced ``shortly'' and he expects some kind of consumer
variation will follow before the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for an Internet telephone is that the PC itself is
responsible for many of the current problems with Internet
telephony. Sound cards, which were created mainly for games, induce
delay. Inadequate microphones create echoes and distortions. PC
software severely compresses data so that it can squeeze through
slow connections.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, PCs just aren't as reliable as telephones yet.
``I still want to be able to make calls when my PC has crashed or
my hard drive died or during the three minutes it takes Windows to
boot,'' said Cuddy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately solving the technical problems may prove to be
only half the battle for Internet voice calling. If the quality
issues are successfully conquered, its potentially cheap rates
could force a major shift towards Internet telephony, creating
regulatory chaos for both telephone companies and Internet service
providers. ``The dilemma is going to be finding the policy and
billing structure that will make this work,'' said Cuddy.

   &UR;  &LR; June Krauser, a 72-year-old swimmer who holds 15 Masters Swimming
world records and has been named to the International Swimming Hall
of Fame, helped start U.S. Masters Swimming, the first national
program for competitive swimming for adults, in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Krauser is helping the organization take a new step,
offering her advice and expertise on how best to streamline the
group's emerging presence on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will do a world of wonders once we get it all organized,''
said Ms. Krauser, who swims six times a week with the Gold Coast
Masters Team in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. Masters Swimming, a nationwide organization of more
than 36,000 swimmers from age 19 to more than 100, the Web is
proving to be a useful tool for communication among geographically
dispersed groups of swimming enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The main U.S. Masters Web site (www.usms.org) has an average of
1,300 user sessions per day. Visitors can check things like
discussion forums, current record times and databases with
information about swimming pools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's master swimmers presumably agree with Ms.
Krauser, who said of her swimming, ``It's more interesting than
playing golf with the old ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   The site has streamlined communication within the organization,
which includes swimmers who practice with teams, race others of
their age group and travel around the world for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made a big impact on our communication with our
members,'' said Nancy Ridout, president of U.S. Masters Swimming.
``They can log on and find events we're hosting all over the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers turn to the Web site for everything from shoulder
problems to travel questions, she said, adding, ``If they're going
to Toledo, Ohio, and they don't see a facility listed, they can go
on a discussion and say, `Where can I swim?' and get answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Garrity said the Northern California team she coaches,
the Mountain View Masters, began posting its workout regimens about
four years ago. ``It came about mostly because it was the Silicon
Valley thing to do,'' she said. The workouts, which are posted
daily (www.mvm.org), typically receive 70 hits by the end of the
day and more than 200 by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the hits are people from our team who missed
the workout and want to go at lunch or in the evening,'' Ms.
Garrity said. ``It's a great resource _ if you don't have time to
go when the coached workout is given, you can still stay focused
and feel like somebody is watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Publications, a company that puts out three magazines
devoted to swimmers and has a site at www.swiminfo.com, offers a
Find a Workout page that is one of the most interactive online
swimming resources.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmers and coaches can post workout regimens at the site that
other swimmers can use for their own workouts. Visitors to the site
plug in an ability level (like lap swimmer, Masters or U.S.
Swimming Sr./Jr. National level), the type of workout desired
(sprint freestyle, open water, backstroke, etc.) and the amount of
time they want to spend swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very good site for someone who wants to find a
workout,'' said Chris Phalen, a 34-year-old Masters swimmer in
Providence, R.I., who posted a couple of his lunch-length workouts.
``The people who responded to me were basically newcomers. I gave
them a place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is interested in exchanging workout regimens.
Tanako Hagiwara, who swims in the 60- to 64-year-old age group with
the University of San Francisco Masters Swim Team, said that she
would not use the service ``because I have a great coach.'' If she
were hesitant about the coach, she added, ``I would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve West, president of Metafuse, an e-commerce and Web
programming company, developed the software that allows swimmers to
search for and post customized workouts.
</P>
<P>
   A breast stroke swimmer who made it as far as the Olympic trials
in 1992 and 1996, and plans to compete again in 2000, West said:
``We wanted people to be able to participate and build a Web
community. People post their workouts and then other people can see
them _ they get shared.''
</P>
<P>
   West's company recently added another element to the site that
allows swimmers to post their meet results. West said some of the
first swimmers to take advantage of this feature had been from a
group in Zimbabwe. ``The idea is to get a centralized place where
people can post their results from anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the workout exchange page appears to attract mostly
Masters swimmers, it also appeals to other swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Liebmann, a 16-year-old swimmer in Stoughton, Wis., has
posted her team's workout regimens as well as regimens she invented
at the site. She received responses from fellow swimmers, one of
whom wrote, ``Hey, it's cool to see someone else from Wisconsin on
the Net.''

SAM SPADE, MBA: CHANGED DETECTIVES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A sun half-cut by the thick cloud blushed its glimmer
through trees sparkling with recent raindrops. It was about noon,
mid-April. I was wearing my blue pin-stripe suit, a bit shiny from
too many cleanings, with a dark blue shirt and tie and black Gucci
loafers, which had seen better days, but were highly polished. A
red pocket handkerchief splashed color on the jacket. It used to be
the way a private investigator dressed before he lay down for the
big sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's changed now. Spade and Marlowe are gone. Sure,
there are a few tough pros left, like maybe Spenser sometimes, or
Easy Rawlins, a black guy, some hard cops in the 87th Precinct. But
now there are antique dealers and cooks and priests and teachers
and even a handyman has checked in, doing what private dicks used
to do, and they're all amateurs. As for the women, forget it. Quilt
makers, except for a medical examiner or two. And I used to think
Nero Wolfe was a bit freakish with his orchids.
</P>
<P>
   I went through the double glass doors to meet the new breed. I
would have been better off in an apron and a toque.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the antiques dealers and pathologists, the ranks of the
new-breed fictional detective include gay teachers, a lesbian
restaurant owner, a document examiner, psychologists, a forensic
anthropologist, a quadriplegic police criminologist, a sports
agent, an Egyptologist _ all he needs is a fistful of bones to
solve the mystery _ and a young woman who plays the saxophone on
the streets of New York. In short, all have professions. They don't
have to depend on a sexy woman slipping them a pair of greasy Ben
Franklins.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been an explosion in the ethnicity of the
detectives and the geography of the story. The detectives used to
be white. Now there are black, Hispanic, American Indian and even a
few Asian detectives. In this country the detectives roamed the
mean streets of Los Angeles or New York. Today they're all over the
place: New Orleans, the Florida Keys, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-guy stuff, with its touch of masochism, started in
what was considered by book publishers to be the first golden age
of the private eye and the puzzle mysteries, a period lasting from
about the mid-1920s to the late 40s. Of course back then there were
female sleuths who used their brains not guns or fists to solve
murders, but they generally didn't have professions. Agatha
Christie's Miss Marple was typical of the popular English little
old lady school of sleuthing. She ran a household and solved crimes
by asking questions, and the books were grandly written. Ellery
Queen was one of the few exceptions to the hard-boiled school of
male detective.
</P>
<P>
   Marlowe and Spade, of course, were the models. Tough and
cynical, a bit down at the heels, almost always about to yield
their honor. But in the end, no matter how painful, they did what
was right and just.
</P>
<P>
   So why the change? Barbara D'Amato, author and president of
Mystery Writers of America, said: ``Part of the answer is the
influence of television. The writer can't be as general as before,
but must be more specific. When you see a show on television, you
see all the elements of a character's life. The author has to match
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Atmosphere and the vaguest generalities made up the architecture
of the old private-eye and puzzle-mystery stories. Mostly, even the
central character was little more than skeletal, no more deeply
sketched than a description of Marlowe's clothing. After
television, people expected their light reading to have more depth,
Ms. D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   To answer this growing expectation and sophistication on the
part of readers, writers gave their sleuths professions. This
started, in the mid-80s, what Ms. D'Amato calls the second golden
age of this genre. Now the reader not only gets a good detective
yarn but at the same time learns the elements of antiques
collecting or quilt making, picks up some recipes from the cook
detective, is instructed about the technology and science of crime
solving: DNA, listening devices, Internet information gathering.
</P>
<P>
   David Rosenthal, publisher of the Simon &AMP; Schuster adult trade
division, said that ``guns are ultimately boring, but the reader
(who probably has a job) can get a vicarious thrill with the
thought that if he had the time and experience he could solve any
crime,'' just as they do in the books. Certainly the new breed is
popular, with many of its authors regularly appearing on the
fiction best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the obviously smart thing to do, giving the sleuth a
profession. One of them is even a flaming red-haired public
relations flack. To me, they're hobbyists. They give me an itch.
How about collecting stamps between murders? Get your hooks into
that one. I don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't get me wrong. I don't like the beatings that come
along with the retainer, usually in the middle of the case, any
more than you would. But the scribbler needs them because every one
of these books, then or now, have a big soggy and saggy middle that
has to be got over. The easiest way to do that is to have the
detective worked over by some tough boys or to have the best
suspect turn up dead just when I think I've got him nailed.
</P>
<P>
   Me, I'm part of the bunch that still wants my sleuths, male or
female, professionals. Marlowe and Spade had a purity about them,
simple morality tales with no recipes or other stale yak coming
between the good and the bad. I've got no scruples about that. If I
want to learn to cook, I'll go to school. Or I'll hire some
Frenchman to teach me.

`THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON': A MODERN FAIRY TALE OF THE DARK
NORTH WOODS
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes at end of review)  
 (EDS: This replaces the budgeted APHRODITE-BOOK-REVIEW)  
(bl) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you stay on the Appalachian Trail, things can get plenty
scary, as Bill Bryson makes clear in his recent best seller, ``A
Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian
Trail.'' But wander just a little way off of it, and the world can
all but come to an end. Or so it would seem from Trisha McFarland's
experience in Stephen King's frightening new novella, ``The Girl
Who Loved Tom Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   Trisha is a 9-year-old who has to relieve herself one June
morning while setting off on a six-mile hike along the trail from
an unincorporated township in western Maine to North Conway, N.H.
She can't get the attention of her mother and older brother up
ahead, who are so involved in bickering with each other that it's
``like some sick kind of making out.''
</P>
<P>
   So at a fork in the trail she seeks privacy by going a little
way along the path they're not traveling and stepping into the
woods. Then, when she's finished, she figures she can catch up by
simply walking across the gap in the Y and rejoining the main
trail. ``Piece of cake,'' she thinks. ``There was no chance of
getting lost, because she could hear the voices of the other hikers
so clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what you might expect King to do at this point is to summon
up at the very least a homicidal pedophile on the loose or a rabid
werewolf running amok to terrorize poor Trisha, who while a gritty
young thing and tall for her age is even afraid of the dark.
</P>
<P>
   All she's got going for her is her minimal knowledge of the
woods, a backpack with her lunch in it and her Walkman radio, on
which she can listen to her beloved Boston Red Sox, in particular
her special hero, the relief pitcher Tom Gordon, whom she admires
for having ``icewater in his veins'' and whom she considers one of
the handsomest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly in this story that seems almost to have written
itself, King leaves his heavy-breathing monsters mostly out of it
and relies on the simple things about being lost in the deep woods
that would upset most of us, like insects, snakes, hunger, thirst,
cliffs, swamps, thick foliage with thorns, disease, extreme
weather, noises in the dark and our own overheated imaginations.
Oh, and something that seems to be stalking Trisha. Something very
large. Something that grunts. Something capable of ripping the head
of a deer from its body. Something that we know Trisha is going to
have to deal with directly before she gets out of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, will Trisha get out? Along with a
threatening natural world, what oppresses the reader is the
knowledge that as the god of his fictional universe, King is
perfectly capable of destroying a child; in his past fiction
children have often not been guaranteed survival. To make matters
worse, the world that Trisha is struggling to return to is not that
much better than the one she is lost in. Her parents have divorced
and are fighting over her and her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Her father drinks too much. Her brother is unhappy in school; as
she steps off the trail, the last words she hears from him are, ``I
don't know why we have to pay for what you guys did wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   Trisha's religious faith is limited to a glimmer she apprehends
of what her father calls ``the Subaudible,'' or ``something that
keeps most of us from dying in our sleep.'' Just as she lacks a
vocabulary to describe what she is experiencing in the woods, she
is missing the words to pray.
</P>
<P>
   The only certain thing in her life is Tom Gordon, whose pitching
exploits she listens to while huddled frightened in the dark, and
who walks by her side and reassures her when she gets sick enough
to hallucinate.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of flaws taint ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.'' It's
hard to believe that even a Red Sox announcer would refer to the
1998 version of the team's archrivals as ``those pesky New York
Yankees,'' which seems a little like calling the Mark McGwire of
that season a singles hitter. And I've never heard of any trout
that had ``fish-scales.''
</P>
<P>
   More damagingly, King insists on several times stepping beyond
Trisha's point of view to report how the search for her is going,
what her parents are up to and how her brother is feeling. While
all of this information could easily have been conveyed in the
context of Trisha's experience _ for instance, by reporting it on
her radio (as in fact her being lost is announced) or by having her
extrapolate it from past experience (as in fact she imagines her
family's reaction to her crisis) _ working it in as King has done
only dissipates the narrative tension he has built.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reading the novel produces several satisfying moments of
feverish terror where you can picture Trisha's bones bleaching in a
sunlit landscape utterly indifferent to her being.
</P>
<P>
   As the narrator puts it: ``The world had teeth and it could bite
you with them anytime it wanted. She knew that now. She was only 9,
but she knew it, and she thought she could accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to King's gruesome imagination, you as a reader feel the
sharpness of those teeth.

` MYSTERY ' : SCOTLAND YARD'S DALGLIESH SWIMS AMONG THE LAWYERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That word ``certain,'' as cleverly deployed by P.D. James in the
title of her most recent book and its adaptation for television
(``A Certain Justice''), allows for contrary meanings. Most
commonly, of course, it is a synonym for ``sure,'' as in a sure or
certain conviction. But it can also mean ``sort of,'' as in a
doubtful victory for the law, less satisfactory than fans have
learned to expect of Cmdr. Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
   The three-part offering from ``Mystery'' that begins Thursday
night brings the thoughtful, observant, courteous, poetically
inclined detective (Roy Marsden) to the Inns of Court in London,
which in addition to providing office space, or chambers, to the
city's lawyers, or barristers, turns out to be a hotbed of
inns-fighting. That is useful to Ms. James and to inattentive
viewers, since it quickly provides half a dozen characters who
would not mind if that star advocate, the tough Venetia Aldridge,
was done away with.
</P>
<P>
   Among these candidates for villainy, you may recognize faces
from other British television imports, always a comfort. Anyway,
believe it or not, by the conclusion of Part I, Venetia, having
made enemies of practically everybody who uses the office
refrigerator, meets her bloodily bewigged end. (She is played by
Penny Downie, whom you may recognize as Kate Miskin, the
commander's right-hand woman, in her first incarnation; the latest
Miskin is Sarah Winman.)
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the mostly detestable suspects is fun, but once Venetia
is done away with and the team of Dalgliesh and Miskin begins its
desultory detecting, the tale shifts to a variety of Gothic
spooker. Soon there is another murder to worry about, and perhaps
another murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers acquainted with Ms. James' plots know that she is not
about to pin guilt on any obvious contender, her specialty being
the unearthing of long-buried family secrets. But as the prime
suspects are eliminated, her story loses steam in a melodramatic
denouement that is not worthy of her reputation. The characters we
really want to know more about are those awful lawyers.

SOUTH AFRICAN JAZZ PIANIST'S DREAMS STILL LEAD HIM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once, decades ago, on an ordinary afternoon outing
with friends, a teen-age boy in Cape Town stumbled upon a strange
looking house on a hill. It was an old house, with a corrugated tin
roof and a sprawling yard out front, and just the sight of it
filled him with an unfamiliar feeling of peace.
</P>
<P>
   When he grew into a man, becoming Abdullah Ibrahim, South
Africa's most celebrated jazz pianist, he would find that house
invading his dreams. During the years he lived in exile in New
York, he was haunted by the vision of that house, the afternoon sun
washing its yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into exile, I thought regularly about this house,
the feeling it gave me,'' recalled Ibrahim, 64, a soft-spoken man
talking just below the din at a noisy sushi house in Manhattan.
``This was the wellspring of feeling I composed out of. When I went
back, my first project was to find that house.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went back home for the first time in 14 years in 1990,
Ibrahim, who will play many of his compositions this weekend at
Joe's Pub (at the Papp Public Theater), found that house and heard
the story that local residents told about it: that it had been
built as slave quarters centuries ago, and underneath it lay a maze
of underground tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   This was the local lore, anyway. Ibrahim tells the story by way
of explaining the strange dream life of the exile and also what it
was like for him to begin to discover his own country, freed from
its official policy of racial separation.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to South Africa, Ibrahim, who is black, has had
many such discoveries. There was the ancient cave of Sudwola, a
kind of natural amphitheater near the Swaziland border, where he
played a concert two years ago. There was the museum in the heart
of Cape Town that had been off-limits to blacks; not long ago, he
played a concert there, too, and had its doors opened an hour
before the show, so the racially mixed audience could have a look
around. And there was Cape Town City Hall, once also beyond the
reach of most blacks, where Ibrahim has opened a music school.
</P>
<P>
   Born Adolphe Brand in 1934, he was dubbed Dollar Brand for his
practice of buying records from American seamen who docked at Cape
Town. He listened to Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk, as well as
the gospel of his grandmother's African Methodist Episcopal Church.
He read Chinua Achebe and Leo Tolstoy. He changed his name to
Abdullah Ibrahim when he converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a generation of South African musicians _ he and
Hugh Masekela, the trumpeter, played in a trio _ were beginning to
invent a jazz tradition, restrictions tightened. It became
impossible, he said, to be truly creative. ``That takes time and
serenity,'' he said. ``This was one of the reasons we had to
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, jazz vocalist Sathima Bea Benjamin, he left South
Africa shortly after the massacre at Sharpeville in 1962. They
stayed in Switzerland a while, played with Duke Ellington's band
and shuttled between the United States, Africa and Europe for the
next 15 years. Then, in 1976, after the uprising in Soweto, the
couple and their two children packed up and moved to New York City,
finally settling into the eclectic artists' fraternity at the
Chelsea Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But Cape Town never left him. In 1990, Jon Pareles, the chief
pop critic at The New York Times, wrote, ``In Ibrahim's music, the
rolling rhythms of Cape Town's township jazz meet gospel chorales
and shouts, Ellingtonian harmonies and spiky modernist passages,
bound together by an overarching warmth and dignity.'' The group he
built was called Ekaya, which means home.
</P>
<P>
   After Nelson Mandela was released from prison in 1990, Ibrahim
returned to South Africa. Three years ago, the couple bought a
house in Cape Town and his first grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain what exile can do,'' he said,
quietly considering his words. ``You dream you are at home. You're
meeting old friends and the joy, and you wake up to reality. There
is this blurred line between the known and the unknown, the seen
and unseen. For us, we cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, ``we are in a frontier mode, because there is a
possibility to change things, not just superficially, but
radically,'' he said. ``Because of the situation we find ourselves
in, what we take for granted in other societies _ for example, a
music school _ it is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   He is unabashedly optimistic about the future of his country. A
certain kind of liberation, he said, has been won, but the task of
building remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the process from getting from point A to point B is
the most important, not arriving,'' he said, in one of his
typically oblique parables. At Town Hall in Manhattan, where he
played in late March, Ibrahim, who once composed exuberant songs
like ``Mannenburg,'' the anthem of the anti-apartheid movement,
played a quiet, meditative suite. Where once Ibrahim's tunes
conjured pictures of a rally in the streets, these songs were often
wistful, sometimes bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his old compositions, many accompanied by a string
orchestra, are collected on a new album, ``African Suite,'' to be
released in the United States in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary to shout, but you can reach,'' he said of
his music now. ``It's much more direct and contemplative.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he and Ms. Benjamin shuttle from Cape Town to the
Chelsea Hotel every year.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he returns home to Cape Town, he feels drawn to that
old house. Almost every day, he confesses, he takes a drive by. He
doesn't know why, but he suspects it is simply because he can,
because he doesn't have to dream about it anymore. ``It's an
unfinished portion of my life,'' he said, ``a project that needs to
be done. But what?''

THREE GAY GUYS ON BRITISH TV: WHAT'S THE FUSS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It burst onto British television in February, an
explosion of graphic language, male nudity and explicit sex
guaranteed to offend as many people as it enthralled. It was called
``Queer as Folk,'' and it set out to venture where British
television had not gone before, chronicling the lives and loves of
a trio of gay men from Manchester who were not role models, victims
or martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not radical enough, the series seemed determined to
shock. Its first episode, which daringly included a 15-year-old boy
having sex with a 29-year-old man, generated outrage from all
sides, not least from gay-rights groups who said it played to
antigay stereotypes. Meanwhile conservatives said they were
horrified, both by the act and by the audacity of depicting it on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Queer as Folk'' continued its eight-week run, a strange
thing happened. It began to mellow into a compelling drama that
many viewers began to find as absorbing as any late-night soap
opera. Never mind the homosexuality: after a few weeks, it seemed,
the three million or so people who tuned in each week _ more than
half of them women _ were drawn simply by the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite apart from anything else, the pace of the script is so
fast, funny and brave,'' wrote Barbara Ellen in The Observer of
London. And writing in The Independent, Allison Pearson called the
series ``smart, funny, beautifully acted and squelchingly
explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the discussion did not go away. And this week, as ``Queer as
Folk'' finishes its first run with the promise of a second season,
most likely next year, viewers, critics and programmers are still
debating what if anything the series says about the state of
homosexuality and the state of television in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The series' co-creator and writer, Russell T. Davies, said he
knew he was making history of sorts when Channel Four hired him to
write a series about gay men whose sexuality was accepted as a
matter of course rather than as a novelty or an anomaly. The title
derives from an old Yorkshire saying, ``There's nowt so queer as
folk,'' meaning there's nothing so odd as people.
</P>
<P>
   Channel Four, a commercial competitor of the BBC whose mandate
in part is to appeal to nonmainstream constituencies, had been
looking for a way to make a series in which ``heterosexuals barely
get a look-in,'' as Gub Neal, the station's head of drama, put it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that homosexuals haven't appeared on British
television. But to the extent that gay characters have been
featured in popular shows like the soap opera ``Brookside,'' they
have usually been AIDS sufferers, victims of social and employment
discrimination or vehicles onto which others can project their
fears and prejudices. And other shows, like Armistead Maupin's
``Tales of the City,'' have tended to focus on the political
aspects of being homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the gay drama we've had on British television has
dealt with big statements: victimization, the political agenda,
AIDS,'' Neal said. ``But this group of characters doesn't think
they're victims at all. They're not even aware that they're a
minority. They simply exist and say, `Hey, we don't have to make
any apologies, and we're not going away.' The series has given us a
chance to simply reveal gay life, to some extent, in its
ordinariness.''
</P>
<P>
   But how ordinary are the characters in ``Queer as Folk''? The
setting is a small but thriving urban gay community in Britain's
heartland, and the plot concerns a group of nightclub-loving young
men who are affluent, unattached and generally revel in their
promiscuity. Among other things, the series shows them bare-chested
and dancing, kissing and having sex with strangers and making bawdy
jokes about their sexuality and romantic conquests.
</P>
<P>
   It was this kind of behavior that upset many critics, even those
who said they supported homosexual rights. ``No one in `Queer as
Folk' is remotely admirable,'' wrote John Macleod in The Herald of
Glasgow, listing all the things he found distasteful about the
series: ``promiscuity, age-exploitation, unlawful drug use,
deception, filthy language, drunkenness, infidelity, betrayal and
callousness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And that summarized the left's initial objection to the series.
While conservative-minded people said it was terrible to air
graphic depictions of gay sex _ some scenes were ``little short of
pornographic,'' wrote Tim Lusher in the right-leaning Daily Mail _
advocates of gay rights worried that ``Queer as Folk'' could only
endanger their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't challenge any stereotypes,'' said Angela Mason,
director of Stonewall, a gay-rights lobbying group. ``It was
ridiculous. I thought the explicit sex scenes with a youthful
15-year-old did smack of sensationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the criticisms focused on the behavior of Stuart, one of
the main characters, a charming, good-looking Lothario with a
ravenous sexual appetite and a studied indifference to the feelings
of others. He doesn't care that Nathan, the drop-dead handsome
15-year-old he sleeps with in the first episode, wants a real
relationship. Nor does Stuart care that Vince, his best friend, has
been in love with him for years. All Stuart wants, he says, is to
have a good time with as many men as he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every libel hurled at the gay community over the years,''
Macleod wrote, ``seems vindicated by `Queer as Folk.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in Davies' view, the characters should not have to be
representative or admirable. ``What straight drama sets out by
saying, `We must depict the whole of straight life'?'' he asked.
``This is a very, very narrow slice of gay life. To criticize it
for not depicting everyone is like watching a current-affairs
documentary and saying, `Why isn't there more cookery?'''
</P>
<P>
   Davies, who is homosexual, said he found it liberating to write
about characters who live hedonistically at times without excuse
and without apology. Nathan is ``out, and he's proud, and he's
happy,'' Davies said. ``That seems to be what some people found so
shocking. I think they would have been happier if I'd done a story
about a 15-year-old who is gay and who goes out and hangs
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Neal said, Davies' characters are much more
interesting to watch than, say, a monogamous middle-aged gay couple
would be. ``It wouldn't have been that exciting to show them doing
things like cooking for each other and going out for Sunday
lunch,'' Neal said. ``The series doesn't have to make big comments
about life. It does what British drama has done for years, to say
that we can follow the small details of people's lives and find
that very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the series this week (in the final episode, on
Tuesday, Stuart discovers rejection for the first time), many of
the original critics had begun to accept, and even embrace, ``Queer
as Folk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been good that we've had it because it's pushed
back a lot of boundaries and opened up a lot of issues,'' said Mark
Watson, a spokesman for Stonewall. ``And it's genuinely good for
the gay community in that it doesn't have us all agonizing over our
sexuality or dying of AIDS. I hope it will make producers think
they can get away with making more dramas about lesbians and gay
people and can develop them more freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal, too, said he hoped ``Queer as Folk'' would prove a turning
point. ``There's never been anything that was this explicit or
graphic or sustained in its depiction of gay characters,'' Neal
said. ``We've come a long way when every gay character on
television doesn't have to be a positive stereotype.''

   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ Northampton, a city of 30,000 in western
Massachusetts, has been raising issues of community for more than
300 years _ charity, self-interest, tolerance and division. They
are issues as fresh today as they were in the 19th century, when
Northampton was painted as a heavenly view by Thomas Cole and
described with affection by Henry James in his first novel,
``Roderick Hudson.'' They were questions raised when it hanged two
innocent immigrant Irishmen in 1806 for suspected murder and when
it tried a police officer, a native son, for the rape of his own
child, during the four years that Tracy Kidder spent reporting his
new book, ``Home Town'' (Random House), published next month.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder, 53, lives in nearby Williamsburg with his wife, Frances,
a painter, but considers Northampton also his home. As he proudly
showed it to a visitor recently, the city gave him a parking
ticket. No place is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Soul of a New Machine,'' his Pulitzer Prize-winning
account of the development of a new computer and, with it, the
advent of the computer age, ``Home Town'' is the portrait of a
cultural phenomenon, seen through the lives of the people creating
it. It is also the story of a particular town, and how it has made
itself a home. The citizens whose experiences are observed in
literary detail, from a local judge to a cocaine addict, could be
members of a family, sheltered by a civic roof.
</P>
<P>
   In this decade, in a successful reverse of the demographic
direction of the century, more Americans are now moving from big
cities to small towns than from small towns to big cities. A
30-year migration by young professionals, baby boomers and retirees
from cities and suburbs to rural, exurban areas has produced a new
generation of what are being called ``boomtowns.'' Two hours by car
from Boston and three hours from New York, Northampton, an
ex-industrial mill town, pretty and preserved, is now the product
of settlement like this.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an annual decrease in the city's birth rate, the
population has remained steady, which city planners attribute to
``incoming migration,'' said Wayne Feiden, the director of planning
and development. ``Who's coming? A lot of well-educated
professionals, attracted by a town that's amenity-rich and very
comfortable to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidder, who moved to the area in 1976, is part of the trend.
Now, he has filed his report: a firsthand look at life in the type
of peaceful place that many find themselves sorely tempted to try.
Not everyone stays _ native or new arrival. In portraying
Northampton, Kidder has attempted to assemble a set of natural
laws, and sides of human nature, that explain what makes any town
work, or how it can fail those who love it the most.
</P>
<P>
   To those making the move, cities like Northampton are dots on a
map chosen on a Sunday visit for their size, their safety, their
qualities of life and their nostalgia. They are the garden cities
of childhood _ the kind of home town they don't build anymore, the
kind they may never have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island,''
Kidder said, ``in a place, Oyster Bay, that kind of vanished as I
was growing up. Whole towns disappeared, it would seem, under
clover leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   He was walking down the gentle slope of Northampton's Main
Street, away from the tiny, turreted city hall, past the Academy of
Music, a Moorish 106-year-old municipally operated theater, now
showing ``Shakespeare in Love.'' A woman in a floral skirt that
brushed the tops of her cowboy boots was offering strollers copies
of her book on tape. A squat signboard for the Fire and Water
Vegetarian Cafe and Performance Space sat like a toad by the curb.
There was a branch office of Dean Witter Reynolds across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Northampton is blessed by confluence and circumstance. Bounded
by the Mount Tom and Holyoke hills and threaded by the Connecticut
and Mill rivers, it is also circled by institution: Amherst
College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, the University
of Massachusetts and, sitting at the head of Main Street, the Smith
College campus, designed in 1875 by Frederick Law Olmsted. The
19th-century state mental hospital is now abandoned. The poet
Sylvia Plath, an undergraduate at Smith in the 1950s, wrote to her
mother of walking in the evening to a professor's house for a
cocktail party, ``listening to the people screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Main Street bends slowly through the town, side streets flowing
into it, like a third river. ``There are some magical things about
this that couldn't have been planned,'' Kidder said, speaking of
the setting's majestic gait. ``This broad sweep that Main Street
makes, it makes simply because of the topography, before you had
earth-moving equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Northampton's recent history has a familiar plot _ a downtown
rescued in the 1970s by creative real estate developers and
resident pioneers who discovered and reinvented its historic
infrastructure. It is an architectural routine: with restoration
and new, entertainment-oriented businesses, the low brick
buildings, Victorian clapboard houses, Art Deco theater and a
Gothic chess set of city hall and courthouse become an animated
Main Street. In Northampton, there are apartments above the shops,
stimulating street life at night. The crosswalks at the
intersection of Main and King streets, where the town converges,
are wired with speakers that signal sonically for the blind and
stop traffic in four directions, letting strollers spill
momentarily into the square.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual eye, it can look more like a marketing concept
than a place to live _ a factory town re-tooled by the wish list of
the latte generation. A bookshop's magazine display performed an
informal census on Northampton's new citizens and visitors: there
were Raygun, Natural History, Birdwatcher's Digest, American Craft,
Bike, Fine Homebuilding, Interview, The Writer, Outside, Macworld
and Out. The town has been the subject of an episode of ``20/20''
because of a large gay and lesbian population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting to parody, but it's too easy,'' Kidder said,
crossing the intersection of Main and King as the crosswalks
beep-beeped like Saturday cartoon characters. To the citizenry, it
appeared to produce genuine wonderment to pass through a crowd _
rainbow-haired teen-agers, mothers in Polartec, men in linen
sweaters and loafers without socks _ in an open intersection, as
cars on four sides sat muzzled like dogs, waiting for the lights.
``What you see is pretty motley, but there is a solid mainstream,
an almost invisible background to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any town, Northampton is many towns, including a town with
a native population. As Kidder writes, the ``Gentrification Is
War'' graffito, written prominently on a building downtown, is now
softly faded. But two particular towns live together like a couple
in a brokered marriage that may or may never grow into love.
``Hamp,'' or native Northampton, shops on the strip of King Street
as it leaves town at Main Street, not in ``NoHo,'' or the
revitalized downtown, for which Main Street provides the artery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all of downtown, I don't think you can buy a socket
wrench,'' Kidder said. ``When you look at old pictures, there were
nothing but hardware stores.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of its newcomers, Northampton is a big, little place,
pressured by the demands of the present on the past. ``Without
argument, a place begins to go dead,'' Kidder said, walking on
Pleasant Street, where many single-room occupancy houses remain _ a
short block from Main Street's consumer circus. Local government
has kept them there to enforce the town's economic heterogeneity.
``You've got to have this tension. You've got to find a way to let
lots of different kinds of people in, and keep them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidder is not ambivalent about Northampton, but he is not
foolish, either. ``It's got problems, of course,'' he said,
reciting the national roster of gang crime and homelessness and a
drug problem in the local schools that is conspicuous for the
state. He was at the bar of the Bay State Hotel, a favorite spot
opposite the restored train station, now Spaghetti Freddy's,
drinking a Diet Coke. Sitting in the lowly lighted,
yellow-wood-paneled tavern, with its etched Budweiser mirror,
painting of Emmett Kelly and silent blinking jukebox was like being
inside a Christmas tree at night. ``And what limits the size of the
town is jobs,'' said Kidder, who is self-employed. ``The largest
employer, which was the state mental hospital, closed its doors
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Feiden, the planning director, concurred. ``Whenever you
see polls in Money magazine and the rest, about the best towns, we
never make it,'' he said. ``The jobs aren't there.'' Feiden added
that the danger of being a boomtown was that well-paid
professionals like doctors and lawyers, of whom there are many in
Northampton, moving there for its charms, would move on, frustrated
from feeling underpaid. ``It's why they don't stay.''
</P>
<P>
   If Northampton does not, despite restored facades, present an
unblemished picture, Kidder makes a strong case that the beauty of
a place is not in its skin _ it is in its people. They are the
simple and dramatic acts and the descriptive faces of his book.
They are, he contends, the genius of a place.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder's ``Home Town'' hero is a native, who, as the book
concludes, leaves Northampton for the wider world, freed of his
``nicknames,'' as Kidder characterized the linked chain of time
spent growing up in the same small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to make too much wholesome sense, from a distance,''
Kidder said, speaking of Northampton. ``And then I ran into this
cop,'' he said. ``Tommy O'Connor, at the gym that I go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidder was back at his house, not the home built for a
professional couple in Amherst and chronicled in his 1985 book,
``House,'' but a converted creamery on a mill river that runs
beneath the dining room windows. He greeted his daughter, Alice,
20, who walked into the kitchen with a bag of groceries from Bread
and Circus, a natural foods supermarket. She pulled mixing bowls
from the cupboards to make dessert for dinner _ profiteroles, for
guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's a very gregarious guy,'' Kidder recalled. ``He said,
`You don't remember me, do you?' I said no. He said, `Well, I
arrested you for speeding five years ago.''' An electric mixer
began clattering in a bowl. ``This guy with a shiny dome had been a
curly-haired cop then,'' Kidder said. ``I remember that after he
gave me the ticket, he said, `Have a nice day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kidder smiled at the recollection; O'Connor, who now lives in
Washington and works for the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
remains a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, he said, `Why don't you come out and ride with me some
night?' He said he'd show me a town I never imagined existed.'' It
was, of course, Northampton.
</P>
<P>
   Kidder said, ``And he was right.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators were moved to tears Wednesday as three
ethnic Albanian refugees told them of being forced to leave their
homeland at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a Senate panel on immigration, Vjosa Dobruna,
a pediatrician and human rights activist, said she was forced out
of town late last month by Serbian security units who ``demanded
money and beat us, both my sister and I. They beat my
brother-in-law very badly, threatening his wife (that) they would
kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobruna, who ran a community clinic in Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, said she was forced to drive to the Macedonian border where
she waited in line for 56 hours. Eight others were packed inside
the car with no food and little water. Finally, after being allowed
to cross the border into Macedonia, they found conditions no
better, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deportees slept in (an) open, enormous muddy pit with
little or no water or food for the first two days,'' Dobruna said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally kept from providing immediate aid to a
17-day-old baby suffering from severe dehydration. The baby died in
my hands _ a citizen of my town,'' she said, fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   But Dobruna said she considers herself lucky. Many of her
friends were among the ethnic Albanians killed by Serbian security
forces, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Izet Hima was a surgeon at the Gjakova hospital,'' she said.
``Serbian paramilitary police executed him in front of his wife and
two daughters and burned his house down.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Dobruna's testimony, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
blinking back tears, said it was difficult to keep his composure.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawmakers said that even though they had read about
the Kosovo refugees, hearing live testimony made their plight real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned and we will do everything we can,'' said
Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who also appeared to
be near tears.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, which held the hearing on
the refugees, said, ``One of the goals of this hearing is to see to
it that we do not lose sight of the human face of this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aferdita Kelmendi, who runs a Pristina radio station, said she
was forced to leave the city on March 29 by two armed men who told
her and her family to follow their green Mercedes toward the
Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way other armed men wearing masks and dark uniforms
stopped them and demanded money ``or they would burn our cars with
us inside,'' she said. After she paid them, they let her and her
family continue their drive. Like Dobruna, she said she waited in
the car at the border for three days with no food and little water
before being allowed to enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starving and I was afraid for my life and the life of my
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi and Drobuna said the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty
Organization bombing campaign that started March 24 accelerated the
killing of ethnic Albanians and their removal from Kosovo, the
southern part of Serbia, which is the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. But they said the killings and other atrocities had
gone on for years and had been increasing since January.
</P>
<P>
   Kelmendi begged the lawmakers to help the estimated 500,000
refugees who are currently living in camps in Macedonia, Albania
and Montenegro and the 700,000 ethnic Albanians who are still
living in Kosovo but have been forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they have no food,'' she said. ``We know they are
constantly afraid, saying to themselves, `maybe today they will
come and kill my brother, maybe today they will put my old mother
on a train and force her to live in a field, maybe they will take
my son and they will never see him again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mentor Nimani, a Pristina activist who helped track human rights
abuses in Yugoslavia, said his Serbian boss helped him leave the
country after Serbian authorities searched their office in early
March. Nimani was able to go to Belgrade nine days after the
bombing started. Then he went to Montenegro and finally to Albania
</P>
<P>
   There, he interviewed other refugees. Some told him that Serbian
guards forced groups traveling from Kosovo to Albania to stay
overnight on the Kosovo side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they were trying to sleep in the open, loud speakers
played,'' Nimani said. ``They heard the voice of children screaming
as if they were being killed. They also heard the continuous
threats of the atrocities that would be committed against them,
including descriptions of how they would be killed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three refugees who testified Wednesday also said they
eventually want to return to Kosovo to live in peace and have no
desire to be relocated to other countries. They asked that NATO
troops eventually be placed inside Kosovo to allow the ethnic
Albanians to return without fear of attack by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Taft, assistant secretary of state for population,
refugees and migration, told the Senate panel the Clinton
administration now has no plans to house 20,000 refugees at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as it had once offered to do. It gave up the
plan after refugees made it clear they did not want to go so far
from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration is instead working with the Albanian
government to build more temporary camps to house the refugees
until it is safe for them to return to Kosovo.

J.P. MORGAN'S EARNINGS JUMP 64%  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., regularly cited as vulnerable to a
takeover after successive quarters of weak profits, posted stellar
first-quarter earnings Wednesday, kicking off a year in which
management says the bank will finally prove its mettle.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the nation's fifth-largest bank and heir to a blue-chip
investment banking legacy now threatened by larger rivals, said
earnings in the quarter jumped 64 percent, to $600 million, or
$3.01 a diluted share, compared with $366 million, or $1.80 a
share, in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting
earnings of $1.73 a share, according to the First Call Corp., which
tracks company earnings. Revenue rose 25 percent, to $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Morgan leaped $3.5625, to $132.875, Wednesday in heavy
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's profits were buoyed by strong gains in its
bond-trading business, in which Morgan has long been an
international powerhouse, and by astute moves to hedge its exposure
to risky markets like Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also profited handsomely from stock underwriting and
trading, as well as a strong showing from its derivatives business.
Morgan noted that overseas markets had calmed substantially since a
wave of currency devaluations and other financial woes began
washing across the globe almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in over five years the bank has
generated more than a 20 percent return on equity, so it's been a
long time in coming,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman
Brothers. ``But it's still a stretch to say that strong revenue
growth is a permanent condition at Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts remain hesitant to commit to the notion that
Morgan can count on continued growth and independence because they
still see the firm as overly reliant on bond trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give them their fair due, but the trading numbers in
the quarter were so far above norms that you have to question the
sustainability of the results,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch. ``But while there are still some questions about
their revenue and earnings mix because of their dependence on
fixed-income trading, they've made admirable gains in advisory
business like mergers and acquisitions and in asset management.''
</P>
<P>
   Another positive trend, analysts said, was Morgan's increasing
ability to get its once-expanding budget under control. The bank
said operating expenses, excluding a one-time charge in the quarter
a year earlier, rose about 11 percent, to $1.57 billion. But that
represented a smaller percentage of revenue than Morgan has
typically achieved _ a welcome sign, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Another large bank, Fleet Financial Group, also reported
first-quarter earnings yesterday. Fleet posted robust profits of
$438 million, or 72 cents a diluted share, up 36 percent from $323
million, or 53 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been expecting Fleet to report earnings of 69 cents
a share. In trading on the Big Board, Fleet's shares rose 37.5
cents, to $43.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $2 billion from $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet attributed its performance to strong results for most of
its businesses, especially credit cards, brokerage and investment
services, and commercial and mortgage banking.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fleet, the ninth-largest bank in the country, agreed
to acquire the BankBoston Corp. in a transaction that is expected
to be completed later this year pending regulatory and other
approval. The merged bank would be the eighth largest in the
country.

   Aerial Images Inc. commissioned Sovinformsputnik, a branch of
the Russian Space Agency, to collect images covering 5 million
square kilometers of Earth in February 1998. The pictures are now
being loaded onto Terraserver, where Web surfers can order digital

``Political parties can use it to assess the neighborhoods they

   Hackers Reveal Identities of Online Police Tipsters
</P>
<P>
   After last month's riot at Michigan State University, the city
of East Lansing posted pictures on its Web site of suspects it said
had been involved in the violence and asked for tips to help track
them down. Police started to receive tips but soon learned that
their promise of anonymity to tipsters had a hole in it.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, hackers had uncovered a hidden list of informers
who had filled out forms on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Taylor, information systems manager for the city, disabled
the Web-based form last week, as soon as he heard about the breach.
But the damage had been done. Someone had already sent e-mail
messages to Michigan State students describing how to break into
the Web site and view the list for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, not much hacking was required. To view data about
the informers, which was not protected by passwords, students had
to view only the source code behind the form of the Web page,
something most Web browser software can do. The code disclosed
exactly where the data was stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously have learned from what we've done wrong,'' Taylor
said. The Web site, titled the Hall of Shame, is still up _ but now
tipsters are asked to call the police department.

   Problems With Home Pages Are Being Addressed, AOL Says
</P>
<P>
   A glitch in American Online's Personal Publisher 3 editing tool
has prevented many users from creating or editing AOL home pages in
the past few weeks. Instead of getting an error message when the
program isn't running correctly, users are simply left hanging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects people in different ways,'' said Ann Brackbill, an
AOL spokeswoman. ``Usually, one of two things happens when those
people try to edit a home page. Either the system hangs _ they see
that little hourglass on screen _ or else they sit there and
nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Some frustrated users have been venting on the AOL message
boards. The subject lines say it all: ``Patience is gone ... now
what do I do?'' ``What's Wrong?!?!?'' ``Take note, Case'' and ``I'm
going crazy'' were some of the postings this week as the company's
technical staff scrambled to fix the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   AOL users who encounter those problems should click on the
cancel button to escape. Then, Ms. Brackbill said, they should type
keyword: personal publisher, to see a list of technical solutions
to specific problems. ``There are work-arounds that you can use,
depending on whether you are unable to make changes or you can't
delete or you can't upload,'' she said. AOL members can also go to
the keyword Publishing Tools and follow instructions to download
another Web-editing tool, AOL Press.
</P>
<P>
   AOL expects to replace Personal Publisher, which dates from
October 1998, with 1-2-3 Publish within weeks. ``People will still
be able to use Personal Publisher if they want to, but 1-2-3
Publish will become the tool we promote,'' Ms. Brackbill said.

   From Virtual Petz to Babyz; 15 Months' Worth, Anyway
</P>
<P>
   Who says geeks can't bond? Mindscape Entertainment, the creators
of the Dogz and Catz virtual pets software, is introducing a
virtual baby for parents and older siblings to feed, cuddle, teach
and never, ever spank. Babyz can recognize your voice, grow hair
and teeth and learn good behavior, and _ here's where the virtual
comes in _ they stop growing at 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Calling into question whether any of the software developers
have ever dealt with a 1-year-old, the infants are given free rein
in their home, which includes a playroom, living room, kitchen and
mice-filled attic. They can play with squirt toys (so close to a
keyboard?) and bang on a piano and drums. If they get too
fractious, they can be sent to grandmother's house, permanently.
You can then go back to the virtual adoption agency and get more
children, but you can never have more than three at a time.
</P>
<P>
   With a little deft cursor work, the caretaker can create two
on-screen hands to rock and cuddle the bunchkins. But if you ignore
them, they will cry and fuss. In the course of a month or so of
use, Babyz will age from 9 to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The software, initially for PCs only, is scheduled to be
available in November for $29.99, which will include a microphone
for voice recognition. Mindscape also tentatively plans to release
Baby 2.0 _ yes, 2-year-olds. Every time you open a new application,
it says ``mine.''

   Quicken Legal-Help Software Banned by Judge
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, it is now illegal to seek legal advice from a computer
program. A court ruling filed Monday put into effect a judgment
that the Quicken Family Lawyer Version 8.0 and Quicken Family
Lawyer '99 home legal-advice software can't be sold in Texas
because using them constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, senior judge Barefoot Sanders of the U.S.
District Court in Dallas wrote, ``The United States Supreme Court
has acknowledged that the state has an interest in regulating the
practice of law.'' He added, ``This interest will be substantially
harmed if it is not allowed to protect unwary individuals from
overly simplistic legal advice provided by a cyberlawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   The $30 program by Parsons Technology was prepared and reviewed
by lawyers and contains around 100 letters, worksheets and basic
legal documents, like wills and estate-planning papers, that users
can complete themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Parsons said the program ``is not intended to
replace professional legal services'' and that users were
specifically advised to talk to a lawyer if they had questions.
</P>
<P>
   The company is appealing and pursuing a legislative remedy. ``We
also would hope and expect that the injunction will be stayed by
the Court of Appeals because there has been no evidence that
indicates _ or even suggests _ that our product has done any harm
to anyone,'' said Eric Stone, vice president for the reference unit
of Parsons' parent company, The Learning Co. The Texas Unauthorized
Practice of Law Committee, financed by the state bar, filed the
suit in 1997 against Parsons and may consider action against other
companies with similar products.

   New Backup Power Supply Can Fit Inside a PC
</P>
<P>
   Uninterruptible power supplies, once considered necessary _ and
affordable only for mainframe computers and mainframe budgets _
have shrunk to a point where some can now be stuck inside a desktop
computer, powering it for about 20 minutes in case the electricity
fails.
</P>
<P>
   Most power backup units for desktops are about the size of a
shoebox. But the new Power Card from Guardian On Board fits inside
most PCs. The card comes in an ISA version, with a PCI version
coming to market shortly, and costs about $200.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Card's battery provides about three minutes of juice
for a user to close programs and safely shut down the computer.
</P>
<P>
   David Solomon, chief executive of Guardian On Board, said that
sticking the power backup inside a computer would lower maintenance
costs and conserve desk space. ``The single largest cause of data
loss, computer hardware damages and downtime are power problems,''
Solomon said.

RIOTS FLARE IN MALAYSIAN CAPITAL AFTER EX-PREMIER'S CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Anti-government riots erupted in the
heart of this orderly city Wednesday after Anwar Ibrahim, the
ousted deputy prime minister, was found guilty of corruption and
given an unexpectedly harsh sentence of six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that his conduct ``strikes at the very core of the
administrative system,'' Judge Augustine Paul found Anwar guilty of
all four charges that he abused his power as Malaysia's No. 2
official. He refused to give Anwar credit for the time he has
served in jail since his arrest last September.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Anwar appealed the verdict. But for now the
51-year-old Anwar, who was once groomed to be the leader of this
country, looks instead like the victim of a political feud that has
rocked Malaysia and generated sharp criticism of its strong-willed
leader, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   As news of the verdict spread through Kuala Lumpur _ ending a
trial that has been a riveting daily spectacle for seven months _
several thousand people took to the streets in a show of outrage,
chanting anti-Mahathir slogans and waving placards proclaiming,
``The people are the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was repulsed by water cannons and hundreds of riot
police wielding batons. But it quickly regrouped, and much of the
city was paralyzed as the police pursued the protesters in a
cat-and-mouse battle through the historic old town.
</P>
<P>
   As hulking red trucks sprayed the crowd, the protesters hurled
rocks and bottles at police, lighted bonfires on major streets and
chanted ``Reformasi!'' _ a rallying cry that originated in
Indonesia and now symbolizes the reform movement here as well.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall the mayhem seemed to have died down. But the
clashes were the worst here in months, with police firing multiple
rounds of tear gas at small pockets of Anwar supporters and beating
a human-rights advocate who tried to block the path of a
water-cannon truck. Police officials said 18 people had been
arrested, most at a mosque near the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very angry and upset,'' said Shidi Amin, a 38-year-old
businessman, as he watched protesters flee from riot police near
the main post office. ``They've tried to kill Anwar as a political
leader. But the people will not forget about him, even if he is in
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgment against Anwar provoked anger overseas as well,
where the trial has become a referendum on political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International condemned the verdict as a ``pretext'' to
remove Anwar from public life, while some foreign leaders, notably
Philippine President Joseph Estrada, expressed concern about the
Malaysian judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration also criticized the
conviction. ``There were serious flaws in the way they proceeded
with this prosecution and we have communicated our concern with the
prosecution and with the entire process that led to this verdict,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar himself reacted calmly to the verdict, gesturing to his
lawyers and tearful family members not to lose their cool. But in a
fiery statement in court, he repeated his assertion that he was the
target of a political conspiracy engineered by Mahathir, his mentor
turned rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sentenced with a judgment that stinks to high
heaven,'' Anwar said from the dock in the spare courtroom here.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles began in 1997 when anonymous allegations about his
illicit sexual activities began circulating in the press. At first
Mahathir dismissed the reports and told Anwar to ignore them. But
later the police began to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar also began clashing with Mahathir about how to respond to
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who was also finance minister, favored keeping the
financial markets open and hewing to the International Monetary
Fund's remedy for curing Malaysia's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, notorious for blaming George Soros and other foreign
currency traders for Asia's economic slide, wanted to shield
Malaysia by erecting barriers to foreign investment and currency
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1 Mahathir imposed sweeping controls on Malaysia's
markets; the next day, he dismissed Anwar. Three weeks later, after
Anwar led a rally of 40,000 against the government, he was arrested
on charges of having illicit homosexual affairs and of trying to
quash a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 29 the government drew widespread international
criticism after the defendant appeared at his arraignment with a
black eye and bruised face. In a speech here last November, Vice
President Al Gore publicly rebuked Malaysia for suppressing
political freedom. A former police chief has admitted that he beat
Anwar in a police lock-up after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The trial itself was marked by lurid evidence and bewildering
judicial reversals. Early in the proceedings, prosecutors paraded
through the court with a mattress said to contain semen stains from
Anwar. But later, after several of the men who had accused Anwar of
sodomizing them recanted, Paul amended the charges so the
government had to prove only that Anwar had hindered a police
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar acknowledged that when he was deputy prime minister, he
called police officers to his residence to express concern about
the charges made against him. But he denied that he had forced
anyone to recant.
</P>
<P>
   The political movement that Anwar was building before his arrest
lost much of its momentum during the trial. And with its popular
leader now barred from politics until 2008 by the terms of the
conviction, it is unclear whether the movement will ever regain
traction.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, recently formed a new political
party to challenge Mahathir's coalition. Speaking after the
verdict, she said, ``We still maintain Anwar is innocent and is the
victim of a political conspiracy.'' Her voice cracking briefly, she
pledged to carry on her husband's crusade while he is imprisoned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Opponents of the government said the harsh verdict would
galvanize Malaysians, who had followed the trial with mounting if
silent disapproval. The anti-government groups are focusing on
unseating Mahathir's party in parliamentary elections, which must
be held by June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous erosion of support in the political
community, and this decision will further erode that support,''
said Chandra Muzaffar, the vice president of Wan Azizah's National
Justice Party.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts said it was Malaysia's faltering economy that
had fanned the unhappiness toward the government. And with signs
that Malaysia is recovering from its recession, it is doubtful that
a large number of people will continue to call for Mahathir's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, who is 73 and is recovering from a lung infection, has
not commented on the verdict. But his new deputy, Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi, called on people to accept the judgment, and some analysts
said that after a day or two, most Malaysians will do that.

WNBA, PLAYERS STRIKE DEAL, KEEP SEASON ON TRACK

<P>
   The WNBA and its players reached a collective-bargaining
agreement today, ensuring that the league's third season will begin
as scheduled June 10.
</P>
<P>
   A union representative said that a deal was complete and that a
conference call with Pam Wheeler, Women's National Basketball
Players Association director of operations, and Coquese Washington
of the New York Liberty and WNBPA executive council would be held
at 3:30 p.m. today Arizona time.
</P>
<P>
   Details of what is expected to be a four-year agreement were not
immediately available. But according to agent Bruce Levy, who
represents more than 30 WNBA and former American Basketball League
players, the deal likely will call for:
</P>
<P>
   A $30,000 minimum salary for veterans and $25,000 for rookies.
</P>
<P>
   A limit of three former ABL players per team and a fourth to be
allocated to each of the two expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   Player contracts being guaranteed as of no later than the middle
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round player health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Players to receive a small percentage of the league's
basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   A player advisory panel to have input into league operations.
</P>
<P>
   A 401(k) retirement plan with some league contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In-season housing and local transportation for players to
continue to be paid by the league.
</P>
<P>
   The league also is expected to announce plans to expand by four
more teams in 2000, to 16 total.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 80 players out of colleges and the ABL, which went
bankrupt in December less than halfway through its third season,
are expected at the WNBA pre-draft camp, which begins Thursday at
Moody Bible College in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The league draft is April 27. Training camps open May 14. &QL;

   Sally Silberman says a prayer to St. Anthony, the patron saint
of lost things, whenever she goes hunting for a file on a floppy
disk. It usually takes 15 minutes and repeated requests for divine
intervention to find what she is after.
</P>
<P>
   But now Ms. Silberman, a sales executive for the Kimball Office
Group who works out of her home office in Hackensack, N.J., says
there is light at the end of her e-mail list. She has turned to a
professional organizer, determined to clean up the electronic
clutter that clogs her desktop and laptop computers, voice mail and
multiple e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silberman, who travels 100,000 miles a year for her job
selling office furniture, has boundless energy. In her spare time,
she teaches college classes, writes for trade magazines and coaches
executives. But being disorganized, she said, is holding her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had so many things I was doing, I was in so many places at
once, that I had to find a way to manage all this information,''
Ms. Silberman said. ``It was standing between me and living up to
my potential. She regularly fills up her two office e-mail accounts
and often saves so many voice-mail messages that callers hear the
dreaded phrase ``This mailbox is full.'' She recently hired Ken M.
Diebold, a professional organizer for Priority Management Systems,
based in Bellevue, Wash., to help her become more productive.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of workers depend on electronic tools _ computers,
e-mail, voice mail, pagers, personal digital assistants and
cellular phones. But very few, it seems, escape the overflowing
e-mail In boxes and rapidly multiplying, poorly labeled computer
files of the electronic age. What many people have discovered is
that the virtual detritus of a typical working life can be just as
damaging to productivity as a desk covered with dogeared papers and
the remains of last week's takeout lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Many professional office organizers now offer not only to
straighten out paper files but also to show clients how to use the
electronic gadgets that are supposed to make lives easier. ``Why
don't people know this? Because they've never been taught,'' said
Barbara Hemphill, a professional organizer in Raleigh, N.C., and
author of ``Taming the Paper Tiger at Work'' (Kiplinger Books,
1998). ``Many of my clients are executives of very large
corporations who are really struggling with this issue. But
everybody thinks they're the only one with a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Denton, director of the National Association of
Professional Organizers, said: ``People have to develop systems to
manage the fact that information comes in so many different
formats, from so many different places. It no longer happens that
the mail lands on your desk at 10 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 national study of more than 1,000 workers conducted by
the Institute for the Future, in Menlo Park, Calif., for Pitney
Bowes, a provider of mail and message services, found that the
average worker sent or received 190 messages per day through
various methods, including mail, telephones, e-mail, faxes, pagers
and cellular phones. Seventy-two percent of those surveyed said
that more than half of their messages were electronic, while 28
percent said more than half of their messages were delivered on
paper. The study also identified something it called message
escalation _ the tendency people have to not only send an e-mail
message, but also to fax a copy and leave a voice-mail message, all
on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that an increasing number of workers conduct business
on the go makes it harder to keep information overload at bay.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Mason, president and chief executive of Beech Acres, a
nonprofit agency for children and families in Cincinnati, called
Ms. Denton last year. On any given day, he can be working at home,
at the office, in a hotel room or in his car. ``I was overwhelmed
with the sheer volume of data in front of me,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denton found that Mason was keeping files on five hard
drives _ on an office desktop, on a drive he shared with assistants
and on an agencywide networked drive, as well as his home desktop
and laptop drives. He often could not remember which computer he
had used when he created a file. He also kept files on floppy
disks, which tended to disappear. He had no system for organizing
computer files, and his e-mail list had grown to 500 messages,
including 100 he had never read. He used a paper calendar, a
Franklin Planner, for appointments, but he was constantly
overbooked because his secretary did not always have access to the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denton persuaded Mason to switch to an electronic calendar,
a Windows CE version of Microsoft's Outlook, which he installed on
a Cassiopeia palm-size personal computer he carries everywhere. The
calendar is synchronized with computers at work and at home so
Mason's secretary can check and update it. Mason can also read and
respond to his e-mail messages with his palm-size PC, which
eliminates facing a backlog of e-mail messages when he returns from
a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denton also taught him to categorize his computer files into
action, reference and archive files and to put computer files and
e-mail messages into categories and folders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once you are committed to the concept of electronic
organization, one of the first things to decide is whether to use
paper or not for appointments, addresses, numbers and to-do lists.
Just as in the paper realm, there are several calendar software
products to choose from, like Outlook, ACT and Goldmine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silberman chose Outlook and spent several hours one day
recently in Diebold's office learning how to transfer the
information in her four-inch-thick calendar, including notes
scribbled on stick-on notes and scraps of paper, into her laptop.
Tired of lugging around her paper calendar, she decided to go
electronic after getting a Palm Pilot III. ``I'm going through
withdrawal because I'm used to writing everything down and seeing
it all laid out in front of me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive who got help from a professional organizer,
Bill Finlay, chose to keep his calendar on paper. Finlay, president
and chief executive of Helvoet Pharma, a pharmaceutical supply
company in Pennsauken, N.J., sought the assistance of Ira Chaleff
of the Institute for Business Technology, a white-collar
productivity consulting firm based in Boca Raton, Fla. Finlay
switched to ACT for scheduling and tasks in 1997, yet he still
carries a Franklin Planner when he is out of the office because he
considers his laptop too bulky and distracting to flip open at
meetings. ACT is designed to work with the Franklin Planner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hybrid,'' Finlay said. ``I would love to meet the geek
who is completely electronic.''
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is another issue. According to a 1997 survey of more than
1,500 white-collar workers worldwide sponsored by Priority
Management Systems, 72 percent of workers used e-mail in 1997, up
from just 41 percent in 1990. The number of e-mail messages tripled
between 1994 and 1997 in the United States alone, the study
reported, and is expected to almost triple again, to 6.6 trillion
messages, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Gleeson, president of the Institute for Business
Technology, said most people who use e-mail did not know how to
organize it because they rarely got any formal training. Some
people need to check e-mail frequently, while others can get by
with checking no more than three or four times a day. Messages
should be dealt with as soon as they are checked _ acted on and
deleted, or transferred to category folders, or deleted
immediately. Some professional organizers suggest setting up
filters to screen out messages you know you do not want _ like
jokes from a certain person.
</P>
<P>
   People seem to give as little thought to organizing their
computer files as they do to organizing their e-mail or their
bookmarks of favorite Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Klung, a sales education and professional development
manager for Blue Shield of California in San Francisco, sought help
last year when she was having trouble finding files. A professional
organizer, Eve Abbott, taught her to categorize files according to
all the different responsibilities she has at work, to name them so
she would be able to find them later and to combine different types
of files _ like a word document, a spreadsheet and a graphic file
that she might have used for a project _ into one file listed under
the project's name. That way, Ms. Klung no longer has to hunt for
three different files in three different places.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saves me at least an hour a day,'' Ms. Klung said. ``It
seems so simple, but I hadn't been doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another person who needed help was Marilynn Mobley, who called
in Ms. Hemphill last year. After 15 years at International Business
Machines, Ms. Mobley left three years ago to start her own business
communications consulting firm, which she runs out of her home in
Marietta, Ga. She soon became overwhelmed, filling her
eight-gigabyte desktop computer to capacity and wasting up to two
hours a day looking for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the harsh realization there was no such thing as a
filing fairy, nobody coming into the office at night to take care
of things,'' Ms. Mobley said. She had only two ways to categorize
her files: ``stuff I sent'' and ``stuff I need to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hemphill helped her set up a system that included 32
folders, broken down by client, with subcategories for speeches,
consulting and research. She was able to cut the number of computer
files she had in half, to a little more than 2,000. She cleaned out
her e-mail in box and organized the 600 messages she wanted to
save.
</P>
<P>
   Now clients call Ms. Mobley when they cannot find a document. It
takes her just a few minutes to find a file and fax it. ``I walk
into my office with a different attitude,'' she said. ``I don't
have the sense of dread I once had. I cannot tell you how this has
saved my life.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite his success as a Hollywood director, Phil
Joanou was visibly relieved when he left a screening of his new
movie, ``Entropy,'' in a nearly empty theater and was met by a
group of producers who offered lavish praise for his humorous,
autobiographical tale of a director's misadventures in filmmaking
and love.
</P>
<P>
   They promised to do lunch real soon. And when he was sure they
were out of sight, Joanou lugged four battered blue canisters,
weighing around 150 pounds _ his movie _ to the curb and stowed
them in the trunk of his car. He was hauling them to an editing
room for more sound mixing and a screening the next day in a
theater he had rented out of his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty glamorous, huh?'' said Joanou, 37, a slight,
high-strung man with a self-deprecating wit as he sweated in the
afternoon sun. ``I never dreamed when I was doing big studio movies
that someday my biggest worry would be someone ripping off my film
from the sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entropy'' is the opening movie at the Los Angeles Independent
Film Festival, which begins Thursday night, and it is Joanou's
introduction to what many critics regard as the hottest realm in
the world of movies _ independent films. These are movies made
outside the studio system on budgets as low as a few thousand
dollars on maxed-out credit cards, but usually a few million
dollars or less, compared with $50 million or so for a typical
studio picture.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, independents have produced a disproportionate share of
Oscar-winning pictures, from ``Shakespeare in Love'' to ``Gods and
Monsters'' and ``The English Patient,'' as well as the films that
critics often describe as the most thoughtful and artistic.
</P>
<P>
   But Joanou's experience makes clear that even with the backing
of a powerhouse company like Robert De Niro's Tribeca Productions,
there is a gritty reality behind these movies, no matter how
fashionable they are. Joanou had a $3 million budget, about a
fifteenth of the average studio project, and he still had to shoot
the movie in 31 days, about half the normal time, with one-third
the normal crew. And the filming was done in six cities on three
continents.
</P>
<P>
   Joanou has been dragging the film around, having written,
produced, edited and directed it himself, but he has still not
found a distributor, a common problem for indie films. And this is
despite the fact that ``Entropy'' has seasoned veterans and stars,
not first-timers. And Joanou, a protege of Steven Spielberg, has
directed several big, successful movies, including ``U2: Rattle and
Hum,'' ``State of Grace'' and ``Final Analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entropy'' was produced by Tribeca Productions, De Niro's New
York company, which also produced ``Wag the Dog'' and ``Analyze
This.'' The rock group U2 provided songs, and the score was by
George Fenton, who wrote the music for ``You've Got Mail'' and for
Joanou's 1996 film ``Heaven's Prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The stars of Joanou's latest film include Stephen Dorff, who was
in ``Blade''; Judith Godreche, who was in ``The Man in the Iron
Mask''; Lauren Holly, who was in ``Dumb and Dumber'' and
``Sabrina,'' and Kelly MacDonald of ``Trainspotting.'' Nearly all
worked for scale wages, Joanou said, to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always kind of a fan of Phil's, and I thought it was
incredibly courageous of him to do this,'' Ms. Holly said. ``This
was like going to film camp. It was definitely the indie experience
in its purest form.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Godreche said the script hardly mattered. ``I did it because
Phil was so passionate and so full of dreams and so convincing,''
she said. ``When you're not doing these things for the money, it
changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorff said he had wanted to do a comedy and to work under these
sort of guerrilla conditions. ``I had other offers, and there was a
lot of money involved,'' Dorff said. ``But I liked the idea of
doing a movie with a real director like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joanou said, it was more of an ordeal than he had
expected. But it was important because he said he felt he needed to
re-energize a career that had stalled after a brilliant start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the soup du jour for a while,'' said Tribeca president
Jane Rosenthal. ``He was really hot. But then Phil had been through
ups and downs in his career, and he really came to us hat in hand,
saying: `I've got to sort of start over. I've got to do something
small to get started again.' We loved the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The barriers were high. The financing was not set up until days
before shooting. A hail storm on the set in New York wrecked some
film and equipment. All-night sessions were the norm, and Ms. Holly
said she had never eaten so much chili. Without trailers, many of
the stars changed outfits in restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel like making a movie,'' Dorff said. ``It felt
insane.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason Robert Faust, the founder and director of the
Los Angeles film festival, one of the better known stops on the
indie film circuit, said he chose the film to open the event, where
it will play to a sold-out house. It embodies, Faust said, the best
of the indie spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fact that Phil, who's a studio director, has taken
this route and has told such a personal story,'' Faust said.
</P>
<P>
   But the major film distribution companies, meaning the major
studios, have yet to take on the movie, not because it is not good,
said to several executives who have seen it, but because it does
not fit neatly into any existing marketing category. It has lots of
rock-and-roll and tells a story of youthful abandon, but it is a
little too serious to make it as a teen-ager film, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very slickly shot and well done,'' said a senior
executive at one big studio. ``Then it gets down to who's the
audience and how do we sell it? We have to judge these movies by
their commercial potential, not their art.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the contradictions of the indie world. The aim is
frequently to make movies that defy conventional labels. But with
major studios cutting back on production budgets and the number of
films they make, they are often less willing to distribute films
that do not appeal to a broad, readily identifiable market niche,
like teen-agers or women.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people involved in ``Entropy'' are taking the
hurdles in stride, believing that they have a strong movie and that
waiting is the norm in the independent world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was easy on this movie, so why should it start now?''
asked Brad Epstein, one of the producers and an executive at
Tribeca.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Joanou said, the movie came to life as his own life
began to fall apart in the early 1990s. The journey began when he
went to work for Spielberg after graduating from the University of
Southern California Film School in the early '80s. He directed two
episodes of Spielberg's television show, ``Amazing Stories,'' and
went on to direct everything from rock videos to documentaries,
something he still does from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough studio movie was ``State of Grace'' for Orion
Pictures in 1990, about an Irish-American street gang based on the
Westies, who terrorized Hell's Kitchen in New York in the '70s. It
starred Ed Harris, Gary Oldman and Sean Penn and was made before
Joanou was 30.
</P>
<P>
   But within a few years, Joanou had married a woman he met at a
party and had known for just hours, and then divorced her. His
relationship with a well-known model, Josie Borain, flourished and
then collapsed. And he feuded bitterly with the producers of
``Heaven's Prisoners,'' tainting his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid '90s, Joanou said, he was reading dozens of scripts,
sitting through endless meetings at studios and making some
documentaries, but he was not directing feature movies. That is
when he decided he had to take a new path. He sat down to write his
own script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to show I could do this without all the toys you get
from a studio and the money, that I could tell a story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But conditions were tough. When he was shooting a drunken
wedding sequence in a Las Vegas wedding chapel, the video camera
batteries went dead, and he had to use Epstein's personal
camcorder. He had a crew of no more than 30 people, all paid below
scale, compared with a typical crew on a big budget movie of 80 or
so. Normally there are two or three cameras. Joanou had one. He had
only about half the usual amount of film stock to shoot, meaning he
could do only a couple of takes of each scene, rather than the five
or more directors often demand.
</P>
<P>
   Joanou directed a dream sequence for the television show ``Third
Rock From the Sun'' a couple years ago in which he had a budget of
$1.5 million for a 16-minute sequence. It had 26 sets on 3 sound
stages. In ``Entropy,'' a two-hour movie, Joanou could not build a
single set.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hope is that the film festival screening will help it
find a distributor and a broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   Joanou remains a bundle of energy and said he was about to begin
writing his second independent movie, maybe just a touch wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to whine, but it is a game I am just starting to
understand,'' he said.

ON PATH TO DISCOVERY,   `HIDEOUS KINKY'   LOSES ITS WAY   AT TIMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Apparently wishing to distance herself as far from
``Titanic'' as possible, a thoroughly dowdied-down Kate Winslet
wanders aimlessly around arid Morocco in ``Hideous Kinky.''
</P>
<P>
   She plays a hippie truth-seeker, circa 1972, whose quest for
spiritual enlightenment is stymied constantly by the more immediate
needs of her two young daughters, who are always insisting on being
fed, sheltered, sent to school or some such other mundane
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Esther Freud's semi-autobiographical novel about her
own exotic childhood, the film casts a sympathetic eye on a
particular kind of New Age solipsist. Winslet's Julia can't unravel
her selfish need for adventure and escape from a genuine desire to
give her girls a unique, enriching upbringing. Deeper psychological
forces are at work, of course, but for the most part the film is
happy to portray Julia as a decent if misguided soul.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating thing about the picture is that the clearly
intelligent Julia fails to learn anything serious about herself _
even after a tearful encounter with a sympathetic Algerian holy
man, who gently guides her straight to the core of at least one of
her problems. But she is forever responding to circumstances,
usually dire and of an economic nature, and depending on unreliable
men. You never hate her for it, but you often wish that she'd get a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   The film is much more successful at capturing the bewildered but
vivid lives of the two bright girls, skeptical 8-year-old Bea
(Bella Riza) and enthusiastic 6-year-old Lucy (Carrie Mullan). Bea
longs for some kind of normalcy, Lucy still thinks Mummy's a
goddess, and they both adapt remarkably to the sensory blast of
color, music and textures that marks the bustling desert trade
center of Marrakech. Director Gilles MacKinnon (``Small Faces,''
``Regeneration''), and his detail-attuned cinematographer John de
Borman (``The Full Monty''), bring this world to vibrant life in
all its striking diversity.
</P>
<P>
   MacKinnon is also deft at conveying social complexities in a
matter-of-fact manner. This comes out best through the expatriates'
relationships with Bilal (Said Taghmaoui, best-known for the French
urban drama ``La Haine''). He's a sweet-natured street acrobat from
a remote mountain village, whom Julia takes as a lover and the kids
turn into a surrogate dad (their real father, a neglectful English
poet, is rarely heard from). Another well-meaning screw-up, Bilal
is shocked to discover Julia is as broke as he is _ Moroccans
presume all Europeans have money _ and he can't take the extremes
of welcoming delight and ostracism when he introduces his new
``family'' to the folks back home.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty more astute depictions of the ways in which
Eurotrash, stoners and genuine pilgrims clashed and meshed with the
ancient North African society at that peculiar point in history.
And Winslet is, I daresay, better suited to play the kind of
headstrong earth mother that era produced than she was as
``Titanic's'' poor little posh girl.
</P>
<P>
   Better suited but, in the end, no deeper. ``Hideous Kinky'' is a
journey of discovery that is ultimately more travelogue than inner
exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The title, by the way, comes from a nonsense chant the two girls
recite for no apparent reason, not from anything too awful to
contemplate that happens to them. Although it's likely that, for
Freud and her sister, a lot of their childhood felt pretty h&AMP;k at
the time.

PENITENTIARY `LIFE' IS SOFT, SASSY FOR COMIC DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 1/2 STARS 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Life'' goes on. And on.
</P>
<P>
   Though it boasts slightly more than the minimum sentence of
entertainment value, this Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrence prison
comedy, much like its heroes, never really goes anywhere and takes
its sweet time in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Superficial throughout and, at some points, ludicrously
idealized, the movie fails to convincingly put across its basic
idea, that sassy, vulgar humor enables innocent men to survive 60
years at Mississippi's notorious Parchman Farm. The kind of
palpable misery we've heard about in all those blues songs is
jokily acknowledged but not very vivid. Both the laughs and the
point of this inevitably episodic movie would have been stronger if
the filmmakers had had the guts to paint a tougher, more realistic
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The film's pleasures rest almost exclusively in the
performances, which is saying something since there isn't much in
the way of character development to latch onto. Our heroes start
out as cranky goofballs and just get more so as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and Lawrence play Harlem odd couple Ray and Claude, who
in the early 1930s got on the wrong side of an underworld nightclub
operator (funk freak Rick James, quite effective). In order to
retain all their limbs, conman Ray and aspiring bank clerk Claude
agree to retrieve a truckload of moonshine from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unmindful of how African-Americans are expected to
behave in the pre-civil rights South (one early, very funny scene
involves a diner full of white folks who take their pies very
seriously), Ray and Claude soon find themselves framed for a
gambler's murder. Before they know it, they're in segregated,
indentured servitude for, well, forever, alongside a gaggle of
homicidal (but essentially lovable, once you get to know them)
fellow lifers.
</P>
<P>
   What little plotting there is from this point on involves,
first, Ray and Claude's efforts to not get raped, then, for the
next six decades, to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The latter shouldn't be all that hard; despite the white
warden's (Nick Cassavetes) tough talk, the gardenlike work camp has
no walls, and its chain gangs are rarely chained. Security is so
lax that one of the inmates even manages to impregnate the
superintendent's beautiful blond daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the prisoners enjoy conjugal visits, baseball
competitions and even barbecues stocked with white lightning and
local floozies _ Bukka White wouldn't recognize the place (but
then, authenticity was so low on the agenda here that ``Life's''
score was composed by Wyclef Jean).
</P>
<P>
   Despite these amenities, Ray and Claude manage to find a lot to
complain about. More often than not, it's one another, and since
Murphy and Lawrence can cook up a head of raunchy ragging like
nobody's business, the movie's meandering pulse always quickens
when the bickering nonfriends go off.
</P>
<P>
   Another good thing about the main performances _ as well as
those of such flavorful supporting players as Obba Babatunde, Brent
Jennings and the gargantuan Michael ``Bear'' Taliferro _ is how
persuasively they age. Though still sticking close to the surface,
Murphy and Lawrence admirably incorporate the effects of decades of
hard labor and increasing hopelessness into their portrayals. Rick
Baker's top-notch makeup effects add a lot, too, much as his work
did to Murphy's ``Nutty Professor.''
</P>
<P>
   If director Ted Demme (``Beautiful Girls,'' ``The Ref'') and
screenwriters Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone had put as much care
into ``Life's'' psychological and social elements as Baker did the
aging makeup, the movie might have achieved something approximating
its title.

`CALIFORNIA MYTH' HAS RIGHT TEMPO FOR ROMANTIC COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When commercial directors turn to filmmaking, the
results are often loud-and-fast, MTV-style eye candy. ``California
Myth,'' the first English language film from Venezuelan
ex-commercial director Michel Katz, is a refreshing change of pace
_ its languid tempo is underscored by the seductive rhythms of
Latin music. Though far from perfect, this romantic comedy is sexy
and funny in a way too few American movies are today.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Power Jr. plays Roberto Klein, a Peruvian attorney who's
moved to Los Angeles. Klein has married an American (Sherry Hursey
as Jill) and has taken a lesser job in an L.A. law firm while he
works on passing the California bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto is under further stress because Jill is pregnant with
their first child, and because her stuffy Presbyterian parents
still aren't thrilled with her having married a Latin Jew. Jill's
mother, Harriet (Bibi Besch), is trying to make peace with the
situation by spouting New Age nonsense, leading Roberto to compare
her to Shirley MacLaine. References such as this, along with ones
to Phil Donahue and ``male chauvinist pigs,'' occasionally make the
script seem as if it were written a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though they're very much in love, Roberto and Jill have been
drifting apart because of these strains. Also, due to the
pregnancy, they haven't had sex in several months. When the couple
introduce two friends who proceed to have a lustful, love-hate
affair, Roberto is secretly a bit jealous.
</P>
<P>
   So he's ripe for the picking when Angie (Laura Johnson), a wacky
and impetuous struggling actress, tries to seduce him. Though he
quickly realizes she's trouble, Roberto allows himself to be talked
into joining her acting class and appearing in their updated
production of the classic Greek play ``Lysistra.'' This
play-within-a-play, about women staging a ``sex strike,'' is
amusingly ribald in its few minutes of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Roberto remains faithful, though he nearly loses
Jill anyway when she finds out about his flirtation. The ending is
pleasing without being sappy.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems to be trying to make a broader statement on the
California ``myth,'' or dream. It fails to do that. Power is
handsome and likable, but a bit stiff _ one wishes for a slightly
more nuanced performance. Still, amid a sea of overly violent and
teen-oriented movies, ``California Myth'' is a welcome date movie
for adults.

COMPOSERS MINING THE MUSIC OF THEIR YOUTH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mich., N.Y., Texas, Mass.)   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Going to a contemporary-music concert in the 1970s to hear new
works by young Americans could often be a discombobulating
experience. The composers were baby-boomers who had grown up with
Motown, rhythm-and-blues and 60s rock. Yet from some of the music
they composed, you would have thought that they had been living in
gas-lit garrets in Vienna during the 1920s, completely in thrall to
the radical 12-tone works of Schoenberg, Webern and Berg.
</P>
<P>
   The source of this music was their teachers, not their
childhoods. Inevitably, some of it sounded stiff and derivative.
But even when the works by emerging Americans were technically
assured and elegant, there was an odd sense of disconnect about the
music. Why were there no traces of the rock and pop these young
people had grown up with?
</P>
<P>
   One would think that the music composers were surrounded by as
youths would fix itself in their ears and seep out later in their
works. Take Haydn. His most sophisticated symphonies were infused
with elements of the folk tunes and country music he heard and
loved as a child in rural Austria, before he was shipped off to a
choir school in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   This changed after World War II, when an international style
emerged: ``sleek, glossy and anonymous,'' in the words of the
composer Stephen Hartke, another baby-boomer, now on the faculty of
the University of Southern California. ``The international style
had parallels in modern architecture,'' Hartke commented recently.
It won the cultural war, he added, and prevailed in university
music departments. Until, that is, the composers of Hartke's
generation finally rebelled. ``We decided that it was all right, at
last, to reflect in our works the musical background we grew up
with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the influence of rock, pop and, in earlier decades,
jazz, has long been noted in the music of contemporary American
composers. In the late 60s, you were more likely to encounter
Philip Glass, Steve Reich and their Minimalist cohorts in rock
clubs than in concert halls. That's where their music, with its
repetitive rhythmic patterns spinning atop dronelike pedal tones
and slow-changing harmonies, seemed most at home, though Glass
emphasized the influence of non-Western sources, especially Indian
music on his work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, a generation has come to maturity whose members
seem connected to the music of their youth in as natural a way as
Haydn was to his. Some of these composers come proudly from rock,
like Steven Mackey, who was once a rock guitarist with a
compositional bent and now composes incisive, complex works charged
with rockish energy.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Daugherty, who teaches at the University of Michigan,
has consciously fashioned a brash, eclectic and electrified style
inspired not only by pop music but also by pop culture in works
like ``Dead Elvis'' and ``Motown Metal.'' And there is the
inventive, Michigan-born Eve Beglarian, who loved pop music in her
youth, then put it aside to attend Princeton and Columbia. Getting
her education at these most formidably academic music departments
was like sustaining a one-two punch, Ms. Beglarian said recently.
``It knocked me flat for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   While trying to master strict compositional techniques, Ms.
Beglarian, who is now 40, was engaged in a bit of countercultural
sabotage. ``It was fun, and really useful, to get enough chops to
be able to manipulate incredibly numerical systems of Serialism
into something that partied,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her work as a composer, performer and audio producer
happily takes her to clubs and lofts as well as mainstream concert
halls. Twisted Tutu, her keyboard duo with the pianist Kathleen
Supove, blends high technology with theater, and impish pop with
structured composition.
</P>
<P>
   There are other composers from the generation born in the 1950s
in whose music the traits of rock and pop are less obvious but no
less significant: Tod Machover, for one, whose opera
``Resurrection'' will receive its premiere on Friday, at the
Houston Grand Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Machover, who is 45, comes from a highly educated, musical
family, and once played electric bass and electric cello in a rock
quartet called Hot Toddy Went West. Having completed a master's
degree at the Juilliard School, he went to Paris in the late 70s to
work with Pierre Boulez at Ircam, then mission control for the
brainiest contemporary music, where Machover put rock out of his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet the longer I was abroad, the more I kind of remembered all
I loved about American pop culture,'' he said recently. The result
was his opera ``Valis,'' which received its premiere in 1987. Based
on a fable by the novelist Philip K. Dick, ``Valis'' combines
sound, theater, high-tech electronic instruments and imagery. The
ecstatic score is run through with highly charged energy and spasms
of sound that could only have come from a composer who grew up with
rock.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Hartke, whose ``Gradus'' will receive its
premiere Monday evening by the new-music ensemble Parnassus at
Merkin Concert Hall, the rock element has crept into his music
despite his best efforts to keep it out. In his youth the New
York-born Hartke, who is 46, was a professional boy soprano who
didn't even like rock. Jazz interested him more, and he was wild
over a record of Balinese music he came across as a teen-ager.
Still, rock obviously slipped into his consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a passive receptor for the stuff,'' he said recently. He
refers to the ``melos'' that all composers grow up with, meaning
the whole background of music and noise. Today, however, that melos
has become ``so loud and overpowering,'' he said, that composers
really have to ``concentrate hard to find out where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   What specifically are the elements of rock and pop that have
influenced American composers, even, as in Hartke's case, against
their will?
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm is the obvious though not the only one, and the
particular impact of rock rhythms on contemporary composers has
been overstated. How do pulsating rock rhythms differ from the
blues and jazz rhythms that influenced earlier generations of
American composers?
</P>
<P>
   ``One could argue that the rhythmic content of today's composers
is actually simpler, in general, than the driving, jittery,
syncopated rhythms of Leonard Bernstein's generation, or even
William Schuman's,'' suggested the composer Scott Wheeler, the
musical director of Dinosaur Annex, a Boston-based new-music
ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. The spiky rhythms of the rigorously Serial
compositions by Milton Babbitt, who earned money as a young man
playing show tunes on the piano in nightclubs, are jazzier than,
say, the neo-Romantic music of Aaron Jay Kernis, who is only 38.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet motoric, repetitive rhythm is a defining characteristic of
rock and the contemporary compositions influenced by it. Ms.
Beglarian especially emphasizes the role of meter, the grouping of
beats in regular (or sometimes irregular) units (or measures).
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of an academic Serialist thing,'' she said, ``what
I was most dissatisfied with was not being able to play with meter.
That sort of Serialist music, as practiced in the late 1970s, was
basically orienting toward obscuring any metrical sense, all that
cool stuff that comes from pop. But you can get away with using any
notes you want, even the most complex, if you have metrical
patterns happening that people can hang on to.'' A lot of rock, pop
and punk functions just that way.
</P>
<P>
   The aspect of rock that has had a pervasive, even when
subliminal, effect on most younger American composers has to do
with the particular way it is recorded and, therefore, conceived:
in multitracks, or layered elements. For American composers born in
the 50s, this layering, Wheeler suggests, has become almost the
equivalent of imitative counterpoint (the practice of writing music
in multiple, intermingling individual lines).
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few American orchestral pieces these days are put
together with a sense of traditional counterpoint,'' Wheeler said.
``More likely they are layered in the manner of a pop recording,
track upon track.'' How does this work? You get a basic rhythm
section going, add a tune, then a couple of little midlevel riffs,
plus a high string line floating atop everything else. ``It's too
much to say this is four layers of counterpoint,'' Wheeler said.
``It's four tracks. Composers like Messiaen did similar things. But
younger Americans probably got the technique from the Supremes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartke agrees. ``No one is terribly interested in imitative
counterpoint anymore,'' he said. Most composers today use a
harmonic language that Hartke describes as ``dissonated
diatonicism,'' meaning a language spiked with dissonance yet hewing
close to major and minor keys. If you start writing fugues with
such a language, he added, the music begins to sound like Hindemith
in his ponderous Neo-Classical mode. ``And the last thing anybody
wants to sound like today is Hindemith,'' Hartke said. For
Americans, apparently, that German composer and pedagogue has
become, to quote the Beatles, ``a real nowhere man.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of today's recording technology, including
multitracking, was specifically developed for rock and pop. ``The
very sound of that studio-recorded music has had a huge effect on
composers today,'' Ms. Beglarian said. She is particularly
interested in the ``artificially fabulous and precise effects'' you
can get in rhythm-and-blues, Motown and, now, techno rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's to me where the most interesting sonic ideas are coming
from,'' she added. ``It's way different from the guitar-hero stuff
that people like Steven Mackey are into. Jimi Hendrix was great,
but I'm more interested in stealing from Wu Tan Clan,'' she said,
referring to a hiphop group.
</P>
<P>
   Machover admits to similar thefts. ``It's hard to get that
rocklike punch in instrumental music today without somehow
enhancing the bass line with a percussion keyboard or adding extra
electronic elements,'' he said. And as a faculty member at MIT,
Machover has unrivaled access to cutting-edge equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in Machover's music, it's not just boosted bass lines
that come from rock but also the wholesale amassing of sound. Rock
has always been unabashedly loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric guitar exists in country-western music,'' Wheeler
explained. ``But to use an electric guitar with feedback to get
noise, that really wasn't done until Hendrix.'' Composers today
routinely turn to electronic instruments and amplified vocalists to
create raucous, brash dins.
</P>
<P>
   There is a whole new audience of listeners who were raised on
rock, are accustomed to sonic blasts and are not put off when the
Bang on a Can concerts assemble a stageful of digital keyboards,
hovering microphones and people-size speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the big sound of rock came the big statement, which
actually connected rock composers to 19th-century giants like
Beethoven and Wagner, who never shied from tackling grand themes in
oversize symphonies and operas. At a time when academically trained
composers were producing elitist, formalist chamber works, rockers
were preaching peace and love as an antidote to alienation and
powerlessness (``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''), and
advocating enlightenment through hallucinogenic substances
(``Surrealistic Pillow'').
</P>
<P>
   Works like Daugherty's raucous ``Metropolis Symphony,'' an ode
to the crass vitality of popular culture, and Machover's ``Valis,''
which, in his own words, concerns the ``obsessive search for
unifying principles of human experience,'' are close cousins to
concept albums like the Police's ``Synchronicity'' and the Talking
Heads' ``Speaking in Tongues.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that American composers who emerged in the 1970s have
re-embraced (or stopped censoring) the melos they grew up in, the
presence of rock and pop in their music should come through
naturally, much as Haydn's use of folk tunes and dances permeated
his masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Machover wonders whether he and his
colleagues may finally have got rock ``out of their systems.''
Moreover, he is keenly disappointed with the rock and pop of the
last decade. ``It's lost its edge, and is seldom risky,'' he said.
``Everything is simplified and saccharine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Machover sounds suspiciously like his own teachers, who
disdained the rock and pop of his youth. He freely admits to having
missed ``the whole punk thing and whatever'' when he was abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His students didn't, he knows. Just as Machover was once
inspired by the Beatles, today's student composers are charged up
by white hiphop groups like the Beastie Boys. Ready or not, here
they come.

the first children's book since the early 1960s heyday of Dr. Seuss
to crack The New York Times top 10 bestseller list. The astounding

because its author is a member of the Kennedy extended clan and the

   WASHINGTON _ He gets up before dawn every day and runs five
miles, then heads for his government job without eating breakfast.
He does not need the work _ after all, he's sitting on a $40
million fortune he made running his own business _ but this may be
his biggest challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O. Rossotti, the first IRS commissioner who is not a tax
lawyer, is pursuing a technological and cultural revolution with
the improbable goal of both making the service more efficient at
collecting taxes and making Americans happier about paying them.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving 18 months ago, Rossotti has instituted a 24-hour
hot line for taxpayers, with an emphasis on reliable, courteous
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those now fielding calls are longtime auditors whose old
jobs were hunting for errors and finding cheating on tax returns
filed years earlier. To improve the accuracy of their responses,
the commissioner has undertaken a seemingly obvious step that
somehow eluded his predecessors: giving IRS employees ready access
to the Internal Revenue Code.
</P>
<P>
   He is also having those unfathomable audit notices rewritten in
plain English, with help from focus groups of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The task before him is enormous. Not only must the IRS collect
$1.7 trillion this year, more than the gross domestic product of
Britain, it must also transfer billions of taxpayer records from
computer systems that date back to the Eisenhower administration to
modern disk storage and database systems that have yet to be
designed.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti has little room to stumble. Before he arrived, the
agency wasted $4 billion on computer systems that proved to be
unworkable. And Congress, unlikely to tolerate a repeat of that
fiasco, is keeping a closer eye on the IRS than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after two years of inquiries that stirred widespread
outrage over mismanagement and abuse of taxpayers, lawmakers
approved a major overhaul of the agency. A board was created with
authority to oversee IRS management and policies, set a five-year
term for the commissioner and expand protections against abusive
tax agents.
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, Rossotti must win over many senior
executives and middle managers _ or replace them _ if his plans are
not to get lost in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   His admirers describe Rossotti, 58, as an organizational wizard
with the uncanny ability to see both the forest and the trees and
then decide which leaves need trimming and which need more
sunlight. Among his priorities is upgrading IRS laptop computers so
old that they still run on the outmoded MS-DOS operating system.
</P>
<P>
   And he has recruited his own team of senior executives from
business and state government, teaming them with career IRS
executives whom he chose for their track record in getting things
done.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest problem, Rossotti said in a recent interview, is
putting his vision of a customer service agency into focus for
98,000 IRS employees, many of whom have become jaded at the
spectacle of commissioners coming and going without leaving a
noticeable mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much change going on that it appears bewildering
to our people, and they don't understand why we are doing what we
are doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Rossotti did something almost unheard of in the top ranks of
government. Instead of assigning subordinates and consultants to
churn up a new organizational table and write a report, he did the
job himself.
</P>
<P>
   On vacation with his wife in Naples, Fla., over the Christmas
holiday, Rossotti wrote down his vision for the IRS on his laptop
computer _ an exercise that led to a 68-page booklet, ``Modernizing
America's Tax Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a new mission statement that takes a
revolutionary attitude toward taxpayers. The statement makes no
mention of the IRS's enforcement powers that have been the terror
of generations of Americans or of the pressing need to raise
revenue for the federal government. Rather, it emphasizes the
importance of putting on a friendly face for the agency's
``customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The old mission statement _ ``to collect the proper amount of
tax'' _ was replaced by this: to ``provide America's taxpayers
top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and
fairness to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti also crammed the statement with practical details on
running the IRS, such as the need to install ergonomic work
stations for employees. ``I wanted to explain how all the different
parts fit together and not just move boxes around on the
organization table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to former commissioners, who often received more
money from Congress with promises that a dollar spent on
enforcement would generate several dollars in extra taxes, Rossotti
wrote that ``enforcement revenue is not a good measure of success
in achieving the strategic goal of service to all taxpayers.''

 WASHINGTON: all taxpayers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audits, collections and criminal investigations currently
consume 40 percent of the IRS budget. And while Rossotti
acknowledged that such enforcement actions are needed, he suggested
that the carrot would be more effective than the stick in
persuading people to pay what they owed. (Even before he came
aboard, the IRS was shifting its emphasis to voluntary compliance,
reducing the audits of high-income returns to 1 in 60 last year
from 1 in 9 a decade earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 98 percent of the revenue comes in without enforcement
action,'' he wrote, ``a 1 percent increase in voluntary compliance
would be roughly equivalent to a 50 percent increase in enforcement
revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Goldberg, the Bush administration tax commissioner, was one
of a handful of IRS critics sent a copy of the booklet with a
hand-signed note by Rossotti. He said he was impressed by its
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this ultimately is in the execution, but the vision
hangs together as a coherent theory of management,'' Goldberg said.
He said Rossotti was attacking a culture in place since the
enactment of federal legislation in 1952 that replaced politically
appointed _ and often corrupt _ tax collectors with civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   While reform ended most abuses, it also fostered a climate of
secrecy and suspicion that is at the root of much of the IRS'
recent malaise. Now, Goldberg said, Rossotti has laid out ``a
system designed to respond to taxpayers' expectations with an
explicit discussion that the notion is not to squeeze the last
dollar from the stone, that service to taxpayers is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Even longtime critics of the agency are impressed. ``At this
point, Rossotti is right on the mark,'' said Jeff Trinca, former
chief of staff of the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS,
a congressional commission. ``He is doing all the right things; he
understands the management, technology and training issues better
than anyone who has sat in that seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Given Rossotti's background, that is perhaps not surprising. He
earned a master's degree in business administration from the
Harvard Business School in 1964 and went on to become one of the
Pentagon whiz kids under former Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara, spending five years as assistant secretary of defense for
Systems Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   He left the government in 1970 to co-found American Management
Systems in Fairfax, Va., a computer consulting company that
specializes in showing businesses how to integrate technology into
their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti has also banned dollar quotas as a measurement of tax
collectors' performance. Many of his predecessors tried and failed
to put that change into effect, but unlike them, he has created an
alternative monitoring system that relies, in part, on taxpayers'
assessments. Moreover, he plans to base senior IRS executives' pay
partly on such issues as their success in resolving taxpayer
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti says his efforts to overhaul the IRS could take up to
nine years _ or could flop quickly. ``I'm no fool,'' he said.
``There's no guarantee that this will be successful. We could crash
and burn in any number of ways, but I think it's worth it, and I
think I can do it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He took on the task almost by accident. Two years ago, he got an
unsolicited call from an executive recruiter asking if he could
recommend someone with strong organizational skills and an
understanding of technology to head the agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rossotti was chairman of American Management
Systems. ``I thought, now that would be an interesting job,''
Rossotti said, a smile lighting up his face. He said that his wife,
Barbara Margulies Rossotti, a corporate lawyer, told him he was
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy or not, he sure is busy. He has become so absorbed in his
new responsibilities, he says, that he rarely allows himself to
indulge in two of his favorite pastimes, playing his baby grand
piano or hitting the tennis courts. In his year and a half on the
job, he says, he has found time to have lunch with his wife during
the workweek exactly twice.
</P>
<P>
   He has even become a little careless in his usually impeccable
attire. The other day, he sported one of his custom-made British
suits, which matched his gray hair perfectly, a rich yellow necktie
and a natty pocket handkerchief. But his wing-tip shoes were dull
and scratched.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not polished?'' Rossotti asked in surprise before
gazing down at the offending footwear. Well, he added in his
defense, ``I just haven't had time.''

TRADITIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOLS MORE OPEN FOR GAYS, STUDENTS SAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ When Evan Bachner attended Columbia Business
School 15 years ago, he could always tell who the gay students
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the ones who looked at their shoes when you looked
at them,'' Bachner said. He knew, because he was ``horribly not
out'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bachner, 42, found himself in an auditorium at Harvard
Business School describing his job as a Merrill Lynch vice
president at a recent conference for gay and lesbian MBA
candidates, his first thought, he said, was, ``This is so weird.''
</P>
<P>
   His audience of students attending their first gay and lesbian
business school conference did not find it so strange. In just the
last few years, the students say, their traditionally buttoned-down
business schools have become more open environments for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   New clubs for gay MBAs are popping up on campuses, while
established groups are strengthening their memberships. At
Columbia, the reorganized gay and lesbian business student
organization, called Cluster Q, went from no members last year to
45 this year. Paul Trout came out to his classmates at Indiana
University's Kelley School of Business a year ago, and immediately
founded a support group called the Inclusion Network. A group of
students at Boston University's School of Management are forming an
organization there.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's conference here, entitled ``From the Closet to the
Boardroom,'' was organized by two MBA candidates from Ivy League
business schools: James Robertson, from Yale, and Jason Stone, from
Harvard. About 150 students from 20 different schools, including
those at Dartmouth, MIT and Stanford, attended.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their growing visibility, gay students say the
transition to business school can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Yale would be receptive,'' said Robertson, 33, who
worked most recently for the Names Project in San Francisco, making
an AIDS memorial quilt. ``But when I got there, I hesitated. I
said: `God, this is not the Names Project. This is not a place
where being gay is presumed.' And there was a little bit of culture
shock. It took me a while to get back my direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Being open about their sexuality is only the first of many
decisions they need to make, students say. Should you put your
lesbian club membership on your resume? How much of your personal
life should you share with a prospective employer and, once hired,
with co-workers?
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Guzdik, a business student at Columbia, there is still
a need for caution in discussing his sexual orientation _ though
not because of the forced secrecy that tormented Bachner years ago.
Guzdik considers discretion a good preparation for a career in
international media development, where he will have to fit into
different cultures and situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to learn how to temper my gay identity,'' Guzdik
said. ``In the business world, we have our private lives and our
public lives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the recent conference, some speakers encouraged students to
bring up their sexual orientation right at the job interview, to
find out how they would be treated by the employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's absolutely a seller's market, and you guys are for
sale,'' said Tom Rielly, chairman of Planet Out, the gay and
lesbian online service. ``You don't need to go work at a place
that's homophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone had such upbeat advice. Joseph Daniel is suing his
former employer, Dresdner Bank, which fired him a week after he
suggested that it offer health benefits to gay domestic partners.
(The company says his dismissal had nothing to do with that
suggestion or with his being gay.) He kept his sexual orientation a
secret for many years. ``I can still do a pretty good impersonation
of a straight fellow from Greenwich, Conn.,'' Daniel said.
</P>
<P>
   Others warned that having a master's degree from a prestigious
school is not necessarily a protection from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a cold, cruel world out there,'' said Carl
Rosendorf, senior vice president at barnesandnoble.com. ``Whether
it's the factory floor or the corporate board room, the issues are
the same.'' Still, he says his being openly gay sets an example for
his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of charts and graphs, it was a business conference of
stories, sometimes very personal ones. Walter Schubert Jr., the
first openly gay man on the 1,365-member New York Stock Exchange,
described the stock floor as ``a football locker room'' that was
``all about intimidation'' when he decided to come out. But he
managed to hang onto his staff and his clients, and went on to
found the Gay Financial Network, a financial services Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers urged gay students to try for careers in Internet
businesses. David Blumberg, a venture capitalist, said he had just
raised $50 million for two start-up Internet companies, both run by
gay men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really don't care what you do in your personal life,''
Blumberg said, describing fast-growing Internet companies as
libertarian meritocracies. ``People really get rid of the
extraneous and focus on what's important.''

KOSOVO DEMONSTRATES MILITARY'S LACK OF READINESS  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARS IN THE APRIL 15 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - So far, if anything positive can be extracted from the
war in Kosovo, it may be a resurgence in examination of America's
military history.
</P>
<P>
   Will the introduction of American ground forces into Yugoslavia
provoke this nation's next Vietnam? We've heard a lot of that talk
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it be the next Korean conflict, where a more muscular
nearby player-state - in Korea, the Chinese; in Kosovo, the
Russians? - arrives to escalate the conflict into something truly
perilous?
</P>
<P>
   Even the geopolitics of the American Civil War have been debated
regarding Kosovo - should manipulative outside powers interfere at
all in a sovereign nation's internecine disputes?
</P>
<P>
   But at this stage in the Kosovo conflict, the most talked about
historical parallel has been between the American armed forces of
today and the nation's Army just prior to the two World Wars. Then,
the U.S. Army essentially did not exist. The dread today is that,
in terms of readiness to go to war, history is repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sorties against Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia early in the
conflict were limited as much by a shortage of planes, bombs and
missiles as by any strategic resistence to hitting the enemy overly
hard. The Air Force says it is down to about 100 cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster the NATO forces attacking Yugoslavia, America's
military strength has been drained from some of the world's most
incendiary hot spots: air patrols over northern Iraq have dwindled
as planes are shipped to Italy; naval vessels critical to the
defense of South Korea now ply Adriatic waters.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, though, is the discouraging state of readiness
demonstrated by the assignment of 24 Apache attack helicopters to
the conflict, along with 4,800 support troops - up from the initial
2,000. This ``ready response`` team that was supposed to be on the
job within two weeks now won't be ready for a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pentagon officials say they plan to approve sending 300
additional aircraft into the fray, a 60-percent increase in the
American flying force there. To support this buildup, the military
also said it expects to begin calling up reservists.
</P>
<P>
   In its most significant statement on America's military
readiness, the Clinton administration declared less than two years
ago that the nation was prepared to fight two major conflicts
simultaneously. The campaign against Milosevic is proving that
declaration a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that the stated strategic goals of the Kosovo
incursion - bringing Milosevic quickly to his knees and protecting
the Kosovars - have proved foolishly optimistic. NATO's utter lack
of a relief plan for the half million Kosovo Albanians routed from
their homes belies claims that the Allies were prepared for
anything like that social catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   But if the intention was to wage war, logic would dictate that
they at least would have prepared for that.

QUAYLE BEGINS HIS UNDERDOG PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (with trim) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, Ind. _ With a few swipes at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, former Vice President Dan Quayle began his underdog
presidential campaign Wednesday by portraying himself as a
toughened veteran of American ``culture wars'' and foreign policy
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy Brown is gone and I'm still here, fighting for the
American family,'' Quayle said at a campaign kick-off rally in the
town where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, his last year as vice president under President Bush,
Quayle said the ``Murphy Brown'' television show wrongly glorified
single motherhood. His remarks triggered a backlash by feminist
leaders and liberal critics. The show, starring Candice Bergen,
went off the air in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Murphy Brown'' uproar was just one of a series of
controversies that may dog Quayle in the Republican presidential
contest for 2000. His spelling error on the word ``potato,'' for
instance, contributed to his image as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, 52, poked fun at his most famous gaffe. In a criticism
of ``fuzzy'' educational techniques, he said: ``No more creative
spelling, either. I tried that. It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a former U.S. senator from Indiana, vowed to press the
issue of moral values, against the advice of ``the Washington
establishment'' and some Republican strategists who consider the
subject divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your hearts you know that prosperity without values is no
prosperity at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight with the entertainment industry, Quayle said,
``I want to work with pop culture to get them to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   He connected his list of values _ faith, respect,
responsibility, integrity, courage and patriotism _ to President
Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal, saying the nation is ``coming to
the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle singled out Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, for
calling Clinton a great president immediately after his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO bombing of Serbian forces in Yugoslavia continued,
Quayle said the foreign policy experience he gained in the Bush
administration, including diplomatic trips to 47 countries, makes
him uniquely prepared to take over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need another president who needs on-the-job
training,'' Quayle said. ``You can only get so much from the
briefing books and crash courses. You need experience on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of the president who picked Quayle as his running
mate, has virtually no foreign policy experience and has hosted
marathon meetings with foreign policy experts as he prepares to
battle Quayle and others for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In another reference to Bush that could also encompass Gore,
Quayle told a packed crowd in his old high school gymnasium that
``the presidency is not something that is inherited. It will not be
bought. It must be earned, and I intend to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father was a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads the early presidential polls among Republican voters
and is expected to announce Thursday that he has raised more than
$7 million. Quayle trailed with a little more than $2 million,
which is more than several other GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment about Quayle's speech, a spokeswoman for
Bush's exploratory campaign committee said that the governor
congratulates Quayle on the launching of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``will treat other candidates with respect and run a
positive, forward-looking, issue-oriented campaign,'' spokeswoman
Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   On Quayle's remark about inheriting the presidency, Tucker said
Bush ``recognizes that he has a lot of work to do'' and looks
forward to explaining his ideas to voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most early voter surveys show Quayle in the second tier of
Republican candidates, each with less than 10 percent of the vote
in party primaries while Bush and former American Red Cross
President Elizabeth Hanford Dole soar above.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's strategists said the former vice president will
strengthen his standing with a methodical campaign that capitalizes
on the support of social conservatives impassioned about issues
such as abortion. In that pursuit, Quayle faces competition from
commentator Pat Buchanan, activist Gary Bauer and publisher Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Quayle vowed to force Congress to grant an
across-the-board 30 percent federal income tax cut. Federal budget
surpluses should be returned to the taxpayers rather than used to
shore up government programs for the future, he said. Inheritance
taxes should be eliminated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who opposes the use of ground troops in Kosovo and has
criticized the current U.S. role in the bombing attacks on Serbia,
said America should not get involved in ``every civil war around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As the newly minted vice presidential nominee, Quayle conducted
a 1988 press conference in Huntington that still echoes in the
history of media relations. Huntington residents and other Quayle
supporters booed and jeered reporters as they asked Quayle whether
he had taken advantage of special connections to join the National
Guard rather than serve in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Quayle asked his boisterous but polite
audience to erase reporters' bad memories of Huntington. His
supporters responded by turning around toward a line of TV cameras
and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, born in Indianapolis, moved in 1996 to a suburb of
Phoenix. Taking over from 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob
Dole, he has been running Campaign for America, a political action
committee that supports Republican candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as
chief of staff of the Bush White House, co-chairs Quayle's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Hill of the Houston area, who worked for Quayle when
Quayle was considering a presidential run in 1996, said the former
vice president's biggest problem is still the jokes and doubts
about Quayle's IQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics it is very difficult to disprove a negative,''
Hill said. ``Dan Quayle could walk to Houston and San Antonio and
chew gum and rub his tummy all the way, and that would not
necessarily dispel what troubles some people about the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political activists ``believe that Dan Quayle is damaged
merchandise,'' Hill said. ``He has been so thoroughly spoofed that
it is hard for many Americans to take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hill said he expects Quayle to be one of the last
candidates to drop out of the GOP race because he has the backing
of a committed core of conservative voters who think he was
crucified by the news media. ``There is an intensity of support
among his hard-core (supporters) that few other candidates can
imitate,'' he said.

`SLC PUNK' BRINGS TRUTH, MEANING TO YOUNG REBELLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Editors: Note use of italics in graf 4 around ``no needles'')  
By GLENN WHIPP

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Calling ``SLC Punk'' the best youth movie to hit
theaters this year isn't much of a stretch. In a crowded category
of empty-headed, cliched fare, this fresh film is the one entrant
that bothered to get the details right. Writer-director James
Merendino not only understands what it means to be punk, but also
recognizes the meaning behind the Mohawk. And that's a pretty neat
trick.
</P>
<P>
   The SLC in the film's title stands for Salt Lake City, the
unlikely home of a band of hard-core punkers searching for their
own identities as they move beyond high school and college. It
would seem to be a tall order to be an anarchist in Utah,
particularly during the film's 1985, Reagan-era setting.
</P>
<P>
   But as the movie's main character, Stevo (Matthew Lillard), puts
it: ``In a religiously oppressive city where half the people don't
belong to the main religion, rebellion comes like fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevo lives with Bob (Michael Goorjian), an angry young man who
sports a Mohawk, smashes mirrors and abhors needles with a passion.
One of the movie's best visual jokes comes early after Bob punches
out a mirror, treats his wound by wrapping it in an old, dirty
T-shirt START ITALICS(no needles!)END ITALICS and goes about his
business. The resulting infection (and it's a beauty) means Bob
needs a shot, which means the doctor on call is one unlucky human
being.
</P>
<P>
   Merendino, who was born and raised in Salt Lake City and logged
his share of hours listening to the Ramones, spends the first half
of the movie affectionately establishing his characters with a
rather meandering narrative that jumps around in time and place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, Bob and Stevo and their friends alternate
between partying and fighting, with episodes like a beer pilgrimage
to Wyoming thrown in for some variety. (The weak beer sold in Utah
has but half of the standard alcohol content and is therefore
unacceptable.)
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``SLC Punk'' more than a humorous diversion is the
way the film's knowing script exposes the fragile spirits beneath
the characters' shocking clothes and anti-social posing. Both Bob
and Stevo come from broken homes, a situation both characters
accept without self-pity. But their upbringing has certainly
handicapped them in a way they are now only beginning to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   It ultimately dawns on them that a life without money, without
jobs and without hope can seem attractive to an intelligent person
for just so long. And despite some anti-social behavior, both Bob
and Stevo are smart kids who understand the necessity of change.
</P>
<P>
   Lillard has played this type of hyperkinetic character before in
movies like ``Scream'' and ``Senseless.'' Here, given the
opportunity to stretch, he proves up to the challenge, revealing a
young man daring enough to confront his own value system and turn
it into something that can work for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The performance and the premise _ that youthful rebellion can
push a society forward _ make ``SLC Punk'' an authentic, enjoyable
experience worth savoring in a year full of artificial
adolescents. &UR;  &QL;

NASA LEADER DEFENDS STUDY OF ALL-FEMALE SHUTTLE CREW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NASA Administrator Dan Goldin on Wednesday defended
the space agency's study of a possible all-female shuttle mission,
saying such a flight could inspire more young women to enter
science and engineering professions.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with reporters on a range of topics, Goldin
said he has been baffled by the ``negative connotations''
associated with the idea since it surfaced a few weeks ago. Some
critics have suggested that such a mission would amount to a public
relations stunt, a charge that also was made regarding Sen. John
Glenn's historic second space flight last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why everyone's bowels are in an uproar when
we even consider'' an all-female shuttle crew, Goldin said. ``How
many times does an all-male crew go up? Many. Who asks a question
about it? Does anyone say: `Why do you have an all-male crew?' I
don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the idea of an all-female crew was first raised by
Dr. Arnauld Nicogossian, NASA's associate administrator of life and
microgravity sciences and applications, who wondered out loud
whether women might be subject to different medical stresses in
space than men. Goldin said he instructed Nicogossian to review the
question.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Goldin said, he wants the agency to examine whether
NASA is launching women into space in proportion to their level of
representation in the astronaut corps. Of the agency's 144
astronauts, 33 are women. NASA has flown 28 female astronauts in
its history.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the possible scientific benefits and personnel issues
have been reviewed, Goldin said, will the agency consider the
potential ``inspirational'' benefits of an all-female shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of a particular mission on the public mood, Goldin
said, is a legitimate consideration for the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that flying John Glenn was a stunt,'' he said.
``And the fact that most Americans had a tear in their eye and felt
good about their country and felt good about themselves because
John Glenn flew, I don't call that a stunt. I call that a part of
Americana, part of who we are and what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Burke, executive director of the Society of Women
Engineers, said a shuttle crew made up entirely of women would
``catch the attention of young girls'' and perhaps attract them to
careers in science, engineering and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been enough awareness-raising for girls to
understand that these professions are open to them, that it's not
just little boys who grow up to be astronauts,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said he has established no timetable for a decision about
an all-female flight.
</P>
<P>
   On another topic, Goldin said he still expects the Russian Space
Agency to launch the much-delayed service module, a crucial
component of the international space station, before the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of financial problems in Russia, the service module is
19 months behind schedule. The module is to furnish the living
quarters and life support for the new station's first crew of
astronauts and cosmonauts.

`APT PUPIL'   TRANSCENDS HORROR STORY LABEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 16 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Sir Ian McKellen hadn't gotten an Oscar
nomination for ``Gods and Monsters,'' he certainly would have for
``Apt Pupil,'' which is out on video.
</P>
<P>
   McKellen plays Kurt Dussander, a Nazi war criminal who has been
hiding in America for years when a teen-ager discovers the old
man's real identity and blackmails him into telling stories about
his wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Renfro plays the teen, Todd Bowden, a top high school
student who becomes fascinated with the Holocaust after studying it
and notices a resemblance between an infamous Nazi and the old man
he sees riding on a bus. His fascination turns to obsession as he
uses Internet databases and dusts Dussander's mailbox for
fingerprints in order to discover his true identity.
</P>
<P>
   After confirming who Dussander is, Todd confronts him and
demands: ``I want to hear all about it. The stories. Everything
they were afraid to tell us in school. No one can tell it better
than you.''
</P>
<P>
   At first the old man is reluctant, but realizing he is trapped,
he begins to relate the gruesome details: ``Although the gas came
from the nozzles at the top, still they tried to climb. And
climbing, they died in a mountain of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden then brings the old man a Nazi uniform, makes him put it
on and orders him to march around the kitchen: ``Attention! March!
Face right!'' Dussander protests, but Bowden reminds him, ``What
you've suffered with me is nothing compared to what the Israelis
would do to you. Now move!''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Dussander comes to life. It is a terrifying moment to
watch as McKellen transforms Dussander's body language. Suddenly
the tired old man throws 40 years off his shoulders and becomes a
frightening force.
</P>
<P>
   What develops is a bizarre relationship between Bowden and
Dussander, as the old man, curiously revitalized by recalling his
glory days, turns the tables on the teen, who has become trapped
because he hasn't turned Dussander in.
</P>
<P>
   While the cat-and-mouse game that ensues is fascinating, ``Apt
Pupil'' is more than the Stephen King horror story on which it was
based. In fact, it seems that a number of critics assumed it was a
horror story because of the source material. But ``Apt Pupil'' is
more a meditation on the insidious nature of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Bryan Singer (``The Usual Suspects''), the horror in
``Apt Pupil'' is, like ethic cleansing, man made. Does Bowden
become evil because he already was, or because he was open to it?
By placing the story some 40 years after the Holocaust, in the safe
suburbs of America, the film creates an emotional distance in which
to examine the question. Were all Germans evil? Were all Nazis?
Where do you cross the line and become evil? The film, in essence,
is asking all of these questions.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Apt Pupil'' is not totally successful (there is a bit
too much King plotting or plodding King), it remains a provocative
film with spectacular acting from McKellen. Meanwhile, Renfro shows
he is an actor to be watched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If last weekend's Masters Tournament proved too exciting (or
boring), you might want to relieve the tension (or tedium) of
watching the pros agonize for five minutes before tapping in a
5-foot putt by checking out ``Caddyshack.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the funniest _ though not the best _ film about golf
(can there be a best film about golf?), ``Caddyshack'' was
rereleased on video recently by Warner Bros. in a special
19th-anniversary edition. That makes about as much sense as golf,
or the plot to this film directed by Harold Ramis (``Analyze
This'').
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? With Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Bill
Murray, Ted Knight and a crazy gopher, there are enough laughs to
ignore the inane subplot. Mark Twain once described golf as a good
walk spoiled. ``Caddyshack'' is a good comedy spoiled, but some of
us keep watching (or playing) just the same. &QL;

 &HT;    REFUGEE TIDE FLOWS AGAIN FROM KOSOVO, INCLUDING EARLIER GROUP

   KUKES, Albania _ The Yugoslav government's inexplicable policy
on refugees took another mysterious twist Wednesday when thousands
of Kosovar Albanians, including some missing since prevented from
leaving the country last week, began straggling across the reopened
border.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3,000 refugees had also entered Macedonia by train, foot
and car at two border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   It was still uncertain late Wednesday whether this would be the
flood tide of families that humanitarian aid workers have anxiously
awaited since the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government suddenly
shut the border last week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 had crossed into Albania by midnight, and there
were some indications that a major sweep of ethnic cleansing might
be underway.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 260,000 Kosovar Albanians are displaced within
Kosovo, according to the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR). They, as well as ethnic Albanians not yet driven
out of their homes, are candidates for a mass exodus.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR officials expected Macedonia to receive 50,000 refugees in
coming days. The estimate was based on accounts from people in
Kosovo who said many people from the city of Urosevac, 20 miles
from the Macedonian border, were on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Albania has taken in 300,000 Kosovo refugees in the last three
weeks; Macedonia has had 120,000. The influx has strained the two
poor Balkan countries. Macedonia has said its new camps are almost
at capacity.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, many arrived on foot and many were making their
second, exhausting run at the border. Their stories finally
explained what happened to them, but still did not clarify the
Serbs' aim in earlier turning them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us can understand it,'' said Jaferr Deliaj, 50,
moments after his family of eight walked into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week Serb police stopped them before the border and
told them to go back home because the fighting was over, Deliaj
said. But when they got back to their village of Dveric, about 60
miles to the north, Serb militia were occupying the burned-out
remains.
</P>
<P>
   They told the refugees to go and stay in a school at a nearby
town. About 600 of Deliaj's townspeople remained in the school,
until Serb militia came to them on Monday and demanded once again
that they depart their native territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us the road is now open, so you must go to
Albania,'' said Deliaj, a farmer. Before they left, Serb forces
confiscated six of the group's tractors, including Deliaj's. His
family rode with a neighbor -- 40 people cramped for two days in a
tractor-hauled wagon -- until they got
</P>
<P>
   about three miles from the border. The gasoline ran out, so they
walked the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   None of the refugees interviewed indicated they had been used as
human shields, b

 &HT;    STARR OFFERS DEFENSE OF CLINTON PROBE
 &HT;    840&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr, who had kept
his silence through hailstorms of criticism, answered back
Wednesday with an impassioned defense of his four-and-a-half-year
investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old-fashioned _ I believe that 'the truth shall set you
free,' `` he told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ``And
for better or for worse _ I think it's always for better _ the
country knows the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending both the time and the expense consumed in the effort,
Starr said his office had followed federal rules for investigations
and dismissed many of the criticisms as theatrics, ``calumnies''
and ``outright falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in his familiar soft voice for nearly three hours,
the man who went from being a widely praised jurist to one of the
most disliked public figures in the nation agreed with his critics
on one key issue: that Congress should not reauthorize the
Independent Counsel Act, which expires at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime opponent of the law, Starr called it ``structurally
unsound,'' ``constitutionally dubious,'' and even ``disingenuous,''
since it promises more independence than it can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said it was a mistake to require an independent
counsel to deliver a final report to Congress, and he expressed
regret at the public release of so many of his sexually explicit
findings. He said he was sorry he hadn't impressed on Congress his
request to ``treat the material cautiously.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Starr blamed the Clinton administration and their
defense lawyers for turning his impeachment investigation into
abuse of power and perjury charges into a ``political game'' that
has damaged the public's confidence in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that the Clinton team had ``declared war'' on him,
Starr said, ``There is a very formidable process of hurling
invective at duly constituted law officers. And I think that's bad
for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said White House supporters and the press made a
``carnival atmosphere'' outside the courtroom, obscuring the fact
that his team won nearly all its cases inside the courthouse. He
took obvious satisfaction from last week's announcement by U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright that she had found Clinton in
civil contempt of court for giving false and misleading testimony
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., if the independent counsel's
office could bring criminal charges against Clinton after he leaves
office, Starr answered, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say whether he would recommend such action, which
could become moot if the independent counsel law expires.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former U.S. appeals court judge, said his probe and an
earlier investigation of President Reagan both proved how White
House attacks can damage the public standing of an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr came under renewed assault by some Democrats on the Senate
panel, which is currently considering whether to renew the
Independent Counsel Act or allow it to die, as is widely expected
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that you were under merciless attack,'' Sen. Robert
G. Torricelli, D-N.J., told Starr. ``But it was not necessary to
pin a target to your chest on all occasions, either. And to be
fair, you were a contributor to some of your own public demise in
the eyes of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli ticked off a list of accusations against the Starr
probe, and Starr dismissed them as having no basis in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the issues that have been bruited about the American
public and have come to be accepted as fact are calumnies and
false, absolutely falsehoods,'' he said. He added that some people
had testified before his grand jury and then ``lied to the American
people about what transpired.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that he was never to blame for the keeping Susan
McDougal, a former Clinton partner in the Arkansas Whitewater real
estate venture, in shackles and in solitary confinement during her
imprisonment for her refusing to testify. That was the
responsibility of the U.S. Marshal Service and Attorney General
Janet Reno, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed as untrue charges that former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky had her legal rights violated by
prosecutors, and added that his position has already been upheld by
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Among Starr's other rebuttals:
</P>
<P>
   _ The $46 million cost was so high in part because an
independent counsel office must ``start from scratch'' and cannot
rely on the Justice Department's resources.
</P>
<P>
   _ The probe has been drawn out in large part because of White
House delays. Starr said that the administration has delayed the
process with numerous legal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Despite charges that he has strayed beyond his jurisdiction,
Starr said that he had gone no farther than the attorney general
permitted. He pointed out that Reno had agreed to expanding his
probe to the Lewinsky matter, after she heard tapes indicating a
possible trade of a job for Lewinsky's silence on her sexual
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also at the hearing, the senators queried the special
three-judge panel that has the job of appointing independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Under grilling from Democratic senators, U.S. Appeals Court
Judge David B. Sentelle denied that he had conferred with
Republican senators before selecting Starr, an active Republican,
for the post. Sentelle rejected the notion that independent
counsels should have no partisanship and cited Archibald Cox, a
Democrat who was the special Watergate investigator, as a model.
</P>
<P>
   As to complaints that the three-judge panel members remain on
the special panel for too long, Judge Peter J. Fay of the Fifth
Circuit told the senators, ``I had no desire to be reappointed,''
but accepted a new two-year term on the special panel at the
request of the circuit chief judge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican presidents had given him two judicial
appointments, he said, ``I'm about as apolitical as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the special panel of judges is Richard D.
Cudahy, a senior circuit judge in the seventh circuit in Chicago.

DOLE APPOINTS NEW HAMPSHIRE CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As she slowly gears up for a presidential bid, Elizabeth H. Dole
tapped a wealthy software entrepreneur Wednesday to serve as her
New Hampshire chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Devitte, who heads the Software Association of New
Hampshire, will serve as campaign coordinator, chief strategist,
and state planner, according to a senior Dole aide. Dole is
expected to announce the rest of her New Hampshire team next week.
</P>
<P>
   Devitte, a Hopkinton, N.H. resident, is a longtime friend of the
Doles, though he is not an experienced player in presidential
politics. He was the founder of Softdesk, a start-up company that
grew from five to 250 employees with revenues of $700 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, noting that Texas Governor George W. Bush had
solicited Devitte's support for his own presidential effort, said,
``This is a feather in Elizabeth Dole's cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been making hundreds of phone calls to New Hampshire
Republicans since launching his exploratory committee. ``We have
made an effort to contact as many Republican activists as possible
in New Hampshire to ask for their support,'' said Mindy Tucker, a
spokesman for Bush's committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dole has taken her time in capitalizing on the interest
in her candidacy, Steve Duprey, the state's Republican Party chair,
said it is not too late for Devitte to put together a strong
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time she comes to this state, she draws a crowd of
people who are new to politics,'' Duprey said. ``That's the promise
and potential of her candidacy. She is attracting people who we
have not seen involved in Republican politics before. If she can
turn those fresh faces into willing campaign volunteers, she can do
very well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has not visited New Hampshire since announcing his
exploratory committee, he has begun organizing in the state. The
day after Barbara Russell, the party's vice chairwoman, resigned to
help Bush last week, she began recruiting people to serve as town
coordinators and to hold coffees and lend their names on his
behalf.

QUAYLE BEGINS HIS UNDERDOG PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (with trim) 
 
By ALAN BERNSTEIN &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, Ind. _ With a few swipes at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, former Vice President Dan Quayle began his underdog
presidential campaign Wednesday by portraying himself as a
toughened veteran of American ``culture wars'' and foreign policy
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy Brown is gone and I'm still here, fighting for the
American family,'' Quayle said at a campaign kick-off rally in the
town where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, his last year as vice president under President Bush,
Quayle said the ``Murphy Brown'' television show wrongly glorified
single motherhood. His remarks triggered a backlash by feminist
leaders and liberal critics. The show, starring Candice Bergen,
went off the air in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``Murphy Brown'' uproar was just one of a series of
controversies that may dog Quayle in the Republican presidential
contest for 2000. His spelling error on the word ``potato,'' for
instance, contributed to his image as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, 52, poked fun at his most famous gaffe. In a criticism
of ``fuzzy'' educational techniques, he said: ``No more creative
spelling, either. I tried that. It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a former U.S. senator from Indiana, vowed to press the
issue of moral values, against the advice of ``the Washington
establishment'' and some Republican strategists who consider the
subject divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your hearts you know that prosperity without values is no
prosperity at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight with the entertainment industry, Quayle said,
``I want to work with pop culture to get them to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   He connected his list of values _ faith, respect,
responsibility, integrity, courage and patriotism _ to President
Clinton's sex-and-lies scandal, saying the nation is ``coming to
the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle singled out Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, for
calling Clinton a great president immediately after his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO bombing of Serbian forces in Yugoslavia continued,
Quayle said the foreign policy experience he gained in the Bush
administration, including diplomatic trips to 47 countries, makes
him uniquely prepared to take over the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need another president who needs on-the-job
training,'' Quayle said. ``You can only get so much from the
briefing books and crash courses. You need experience on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, son of the president who picked Quayle as his running
mate, has virtually no foreign policy experience and has hosted
marathon meetings with foreign policy experts as he prepares to
battle Quayle and others for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In another reference to Bush that could also encompass Gore,
Quayle told a packed crowd in his old high school gymnasium that
``the presidency is not something that is inherited. It will not be
bought. It must be earned, and I intend to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father was a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads the early presidential polls among Republican voters
and is expected to announce Thursday that he has raised more than
$7 million. Quayle trailed with a little more than $2 million,
which is more than several other GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for comment about Quayle's speech, a spokeswoman for
Bush's exploratory campaign committee said that the governor
congratulates Quayle on the launching of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``will treat other candidates with respect and run a
positive, forward-looking, issue-oriented campaign,'' spokeswoman
Mindy Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   On Quayle's remark about inheriting the presidency, Tucker said
Bush ``recognizes that he has a lot of work to do'' and looks
forward to explaining his ideas to voters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most early voter surveys show Quayle in the second tier of
Republican candidates, each with less than 10 percent of the vote
in party primaries while Bush and former American Red Cross
President Elizabeth Hanford Dole soar above.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's strategists said the former vice president will
strengthen his standing with a methodical campaign that capitalizes
on the support of social conservatives impassioned about issues
such as abortion. In that pursuit, Quayle faces competition from
commentator Pat Buchanan, activist Gary Bauer and publisher Steve
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Quayle vowed to force Congress to grant an
across-the-board 30 percent federal income tax cut. Federal budget
surpluses should be returned to the taxpayers rather than used to
shore up government programs for the future, he said. Inheritance
taxes should be eliminated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who opposes the use of ground troops in Kosovo and has
criticized the current U.S. role in the bombing attacks on Serbia,
said America should not get involved in ``every civil war around
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As the newly minted vice presidential nominee, Quayle conducted
a 1988 press conference in Huntington that still echoes in the
history of media relations. Huntington residents and other Quayle
supporters booed and jeered reporters as they asked Quayle whether
he had taken advantage of special connections to join the National
Guard rather than serve in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Wednesday, Quayle asked his boisterous but polite
audience to erase reporters' bad memories of Huntington. His
supporters responded by turning around toward a line of TV cameras
and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, born in Indianapolis, moved in 1996 to a suburb of
Phoenix. Taking over from 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob
Dole, he has been running Campaign for America, a political action
committee that supports Republican candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who served as
chief of staff of the Bush White House, co-chairs Quayle's
campaign.
</P>
<P>

(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Hill of the Houston area, who worked for Quayle when
Quayle was considering a presidential run in 1996, said the former
vice president's biggest problem is still the jokes and doubts
about Quayle's IQ.
</P>
<P>
   ``In politics it is very difficult to disprove a negative,''
Hill said. ``Dan Quayle could walk to Houston and San Antonio and
chew gum and rub his tummy all the way, and that would not
necessarily dispel what troubles some people about the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political activists ``believe that Dan Quayle is damaged
merchandise,'' Hill said. ``He has been so thoroughly spoofed that
it is hard for many Americans to take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hill said he expects Quayle to be one of the last
candidates to drop out of the GOP race because he has the backing
of a committed core of conservative voters who think he was
crucified by the news media. ``There is an intensity of support
among his hard-core (supporters) that few other candidates can
imitate,'' he said.

PANEL ALLOWS LIMITED SCALLOP FISHING ON GEORGES BANK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Almost five years after they banned most
fishing in large swaths of Georges Bank, regulators agreed
Wednesday to allow hundreds of boats to return this summer to
harvest scallops that have grown fat and abundant since the
closing.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the New England Fishery Management Council
marked the first time it has allowed an increase in fishing in
5,000 square miles of closed areas since they were created in 1994
in a desperate bid to stop the depletion of cod and other fish
populations on and near Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators, fearful that the scallop boats could harm the
flounder and other fish that are still recovering from years of
overfishing, attached so many limits to the re-opening that some
scallopers were angry. At most, scallopers will be allowed to
harvest only one quarter as many scallops as they had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if you're inviting us not to go into the closed
area,'' said Debra Shrader, a scallopers' wife active in the
fishing advocacy group Shore Support. ``You're not giving us
anything in trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were unhappy at the reopening of so-called
``closed area 2,'' also, arguing that the council was buckling to
political pressure from the scallop industry rather than finishing
the job of rebuilding the historic Georges Bank fishing ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``There remain a great deal of important unanswered questions .
. . I believe that we are moving too quickly,'' said Doug Hopkins
of the Environmental Defense Fund, the only professional
environmentalist on the Fishery Management Council, and the lone
vote against major provisions of the fishing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote had been closely watched after US Commerce
Secretary William Daley _ who has veto power over the management
council _ urged the 17-member panel to consider allowing scalloping
in parts of the closed areas by June 15. As a result, the council
agreed to consider the idea rather than waiting until at least
March of 2000 as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's letter to the council, written at the urging of US
Senator Edward Kennedy and US Representative Barney Frank,
politicized what had been an emerging success story on Georges
Bank: the recovery of scallops after just a few years relief from
fishing. Research last fall showed that the shellfish were eight to
20 times more abundant in closed areas than in open scalloping
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing research also conluded that scallop boats might
catch almost as many yellowtail flounders as scallops in their
heavy chainlink dredges. Unlike the scallops, the yellowtails are
still at least five years away from reaching a population that
biologists believe can sustain normal fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this going to do to me?'' asked Rodney Avila of New
Bedford, Mass., who fishes for yellowtail flounders, at Wednesday's
meeting. He said he was worried that, after years of sacrifice,
flounder fishermen could face more fishing limits because the
scallop boats accidentally caught so many flounder.
</P>
<P>
   Scallopers promised that they could greatly reduce the
unintentional catch of flounder, monkfish and other species _
called ``bycatch'' _ by increasing the size of holes in nets or
towing their equipment more slowly so that fish can escape.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fishery Management Council was taking few chances,
allowing each scalloper only three visits to closed area 2 for
30,000 pounds of scallop meat rather than the 12 trips for 120,000
pounds that the lead industry group, the Fisheries Survival Fund,
had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the scallopers will only get to harvest their
scallops if they make good on pledges to reduce bycatch. The
National Marine Fisheries Service will close the area once
scallopers catch a relatively small amount of flounder.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the council created a 3,000 square-mile buffer zone
around the portion of area 2 that will be re-opened to prevent
scallopers from cheating. Members had feared that dishonest boat
captains might offload their catch to boats waiting just outside
the restricted zone so that they could exceed the fishing limits.
</P>
<P>
   As a further deterrent to cheating, council members called for
paid observers to be posted on at least one in four scallop boats
going to the closed area this summer. Given the limited federal
funding for observers, some fishermen feared that this provision
alone could sink the entire reopening plan.
</P>
<P>
   Encumbered by all these conditions, scallop fishermen Wednesday
grumbled that the re-opened scallop grounds would not be the
economic shot in the arm they had hoped for. However, other
industry advocates said even a limited opening of the so-called
``closed area 2'' could pave the way for wider re-openings in
closed fishing grounds off the New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a step forward, but we could do a lot better,''
said Fisheries Survival Fund consultant Ronald Smolowitz.

 &HT;    THE 'BIG BANG': COSMOLOGY OR JUST 'SPECULATION?'
 &HT;    With BEGINNING-MOVIE.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Physicists and religious scholars brought their
different views of reality to a symposium on the origin of the
universe Wednesday, then went home unable to agree on enough to
even disagree on much.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest thing to a debate in a daylong exchange of views on
whether the universe is a place designed by a creator or the result
of a randomly occurring ``Big Bang'' was between two physicists.
</P>
<P>
   The models described by Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Neil Turok of Cambridge University in England
differed in fundamental concepts of time and space.
</P>
<P>
   Turok, an associate of English cosmologist Stephen Hawking,
spoke of Hawking's hypothesized ``imaginary time'' and said six
extra dimensions of space-time may be necessary to explain the
development of the expanding universe from a minute
``instanton(cq).''
</P>
<P>
   Guth, the originator of the concept of ``inflation'' of matter
and space, described a different process, originating with the
instantaneous explosion of the infinitely small ``singularity'' at
which the Big Bang is thought to have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions took up the first of three days of exchanges
between cosmologists, who have been increasingly excited by
accumulating discoveries of the past several years, and
theologians. The symposium is being sponsored by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Hindu philosopher Anindita Baslev of Aarhus University in
Denmark dismissed the discussions of Big Bang mechanics as
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not is reaped which has not been sown,'' she declared, quoting
from the ancient texts of her religion, which holds the universe is
eternal, without beginning or end. ``The origin of an event is
inconceivable without depending on a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the Big Bang theories ``cosmological speculations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Guth said that with new observations from space-based
scientific instruments and improved understanding of the mysterious
quantum behavior of subatomic particles, it appears that the
``concept of cause and effect is not as strong as it used.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the term ``Big Bang'' does not accurately describe
the theories of cosmological inflation that most astrophysicists
accept today. In fact, ``Big Bang'' was originally coined by an
opponent of the theory in an effort to ridicule it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not attempt to describe what banged or why it banged
or what happened before it banged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Faber, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, said she drew no data from
religious thought in her pursuit of physical explanations of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here in a service role,'' she said. ``Cosmologies are
facts. I'm here to help communicate what science has to say about
what really happened and to describe the limits of what it can say
about what really happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert John Russell, a physicist who founded the Center for
Theology and the Natural Sciences at Berkeley University's Graduate
Theological Union, said it is not possible to separate physics from
philosophy or morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pick up a physics textbook and not find it filled
with philosophy and morality,'' he said.

AFTER THE WAR, KOSOVO WILL NEED A MARSHALL PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 18) , (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEESBURG, Va. _ It is a long way from the relative tranquility
of this historic town at the foot of the Blue Ridge mountains to
the devastation and tragedy on the plains and in the valleys of
Kosovo and its neighboring lands.
</P>
<P>
   But it is easy to imagine that Leesburg's most illustrious
resident of the past, Gen. George C. Marshall, would recognize the
hunger, disruption of lives, destruction of homes and businesses
and the illness and death of helpless refugees as a familiar sight.
</P>
<P>
   In microcosm, they replicate the tragic plight of war-battered
Europe that lay before Marshall's eyes in 1947 and that spurred him
to create the most benevolent program ever devised by one country
to aid other countries, including those it had defeated on the
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Today's situation differs in many ways. When Marshall proposed
the plan that was to bear his name, he had just attended a lengthy,
often acrimonious meeting in Moscow at which Soviet leader Josef
Stalin repeatedly demonstrated his belligerence toward America and
the democracies of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the tyrants who
had ignited World War II and its horrors in Europe, were dead, and
there was no one to interfere with the rescue of their stricken
countries, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Although isolationism is not yet dead in the United States, it
is less a power than in the 1940s when many Americans, including
congressional leaders, were in the grip of xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are parallels between today and yesterday. Yugoslav
President Slobadan Milosovec's cruel policy of driving Albanians
from their homes is not far removed from Hitler's treacherous
treatment of the Jews. The catastrophe now engulfing the Kosovars
is similar to the one that destroyed lives and livelihood in Europe
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the beleaguered Kosovo, we may foresee a period in which its
people will require the kind of assistance that the Marshall Plan
extended to Western Europe a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   That concept was discussed last week at the NATO foreign
ministers' conference in Brussels, where attention also focused on
the hope of making Russia, a longime Yugoslavia ally, part of the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the Cold War was on everyone's mind when Marshall, the
former World War II Army chief of staff who had become Harry
Truman's secretary of state, first proposed his plan for the
recovery of Europe. But still, he suggested that the Soviet Union
be included in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is not directed against any country or doctrine but
against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos,'' Marshall declared
at Harvard University on June 5 of that year. ``Its purpose shall
be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit
the emergence of political and social conditions in which free
institutions can exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Stalin agreed to accept American assistance in rebuilding
the Soviet economy, the world would have been a far different place
and wars in Korea and Vietnam might have been averted. But the
stubborn Soviet despot rejected participation in the Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing his initiative, Marshall called on a remarkable
group of so-called ``wise men, including Dean Acheson, Robert
Lovett, George Kennan, Charles Bohlen and Will Clayton. Henry
Stimson, the grand old man of the Republican Party, who had served
in the Cabinets of several presidents, headed the national
committee to sell the Marshall Plan to the American people. Leading
the group's executive committee was former Secretary of War Robert
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Truman decreed that the plan should bear Marshall's name rather
than his own. In his memoirs, Truman described Marshall, who later
won the Nobel Peace Prize, as the ``greatest living American'' and
declared: ``The Marshall Plan will go down in history as one of
America's greatest contributions to the peace of the world.'' He
was right.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole magnificent project might have failed in the
GOP-dominated 80th Congress had it not been for Michigan Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg, a pre-war isolationist who as chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee who was able to persuade his fellow
Republicans to approve the $13.4 billion, four-year European
recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall wisely urged that the initiative come from the European
countries themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the role of the United States should consist
of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later
support of such a program as far as it may be practical for us to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, with a lot of hard work and bold leadership, the job was
accomplished. Until Milosovec began acting like the brutal
dictators of the past, Europe had lived in peace for an
unprecedented half century.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Leesburg, a visitor is shocked by the disrepair of
Dodona Manor, the once-stately house that was Marshall's home from
1941 until his death in 1959. Yet restoration has begun, and one
day it will gleam with renewed elegance.
</P>
<P>
   But even in its run-down condition, the house possesses some
furnishings and artifacts that stir the imagination. They recall
the greatness of the man who lived here and the fact that his
vision of 52 years ago remains pertinent and vital to the
well-being of Europe and the United States.

CHINESE LEADER ENDS US TOUR ON A JOCULAR NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ As President Clinton's administration revived
efforts to bring China into the World Trade Organization, Chinese
premier Zhu Rongji concluded his nine-day US sojourn Wednesday with
a quip-filled visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and a Boston business lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu told Americans not to ``make such a big deal'' about their
roughly $50 billion annual trade deficit with China, calling it
relatively small and beneficial to both countries' prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds of people picketed Zhu at both events and burned
flags to denounce China's repression of Tibetans and dissidents and
policy toward Taiwan, Zhu continued to work on projecting the image
of a younger, optimistic, more open Chinese leadership that even
has a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not an adversary, let alone enemy, of the United
States, China is your trustworthy friend,'' said Zhu, 68, an
electrical engineer and former Shanghai mayor who is the nation's
third-ranking leader. ``China will never be a threat to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through translators to more than 1,200 people at MIT,
Zhu used one-liners in an attempt to deflect tensions over issues
such as alleged illegal Chinese contributions to President
Clinton's re-election campaign, military espionage and piracy of
copyrighted music and movies. He called them ``passing clouds'' in
otherwise increasingly sunny US-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu noted that when he attended graduate school in China in the
late 1940s, many of his textbooks were photocopies of MIT books,
but he added, ``Whether they were pirated or not, I do not know.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu recalled a conversation with MIT president Charles M. Vest
about astronomers ``probing the secrets of the universe,'' and
said, ``I was so afraid of the word `secrets' because that reminded
me of espionage'' and allegations that Chinese spies have stolen
sensitive US nuclear and military data.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of a half-dozen times he broke into English, Zhu
urged US business school graduates to apply for deanships opening
up at three new Chinese accounting academies being organized with
help from US Big Five accounting firms. ``I promise: I will pay
what you are paid here,'' Zhu said in lightly accented English.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's visit to the US appeared to fail in its major aim when
Clinton made a last-minute decision last week to abort a deal to
bring China into the World Trade Organization. That would have
given China more influence over global trade in exchange for what
Zhu called ``major concessions'' on opening its 1.2 billion-member
market to foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
   However, facing criticism from business and congressional
leaders, Clinton late on Tuesday announced he wanted to resume
negotiations and get China into the trade group this year.
Clinton's move was widely perceived as an effort to bolster Zhu's
standing with Chinese leaders because he is seen as a pragmatic
reformer among the Communist leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu expressed regret that his trip has led only to agreements so
far on US agricultural exports to China. ``Can the Chinese people
live only on citrus and wheat? Yes, we can, but we want to live
better,'' Zhu said, urging the United States to lift bans on
exporting weather satellites and computers.
</P>
<P>
   But at stops that included two speeches to farmers and visits to
the Denver Broncos football training camp and a Chicago commodity
training floor, Zhu's affability has by most accounts scored points
for China. He told Boston business leaders he saw a marked drop in
hostility to China during his trip.
</P>
<P>
   At MIT, Zhu took three questions, one from Edward Wang, a
27-year-old MIT computer science graduate student who asked when
China would release Xu Wenli, a Beijing democracy activist already
jailed for 12 years who has been sentenced to another 13 years for
trying to organize a democratic political party.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu said he had talked so much about human rights on his US trip
``that I practically have blisters in my mouth. Human rights in
China have been improving from one day to the next. . . . We accept
that we still have shortcomings, and these shortcomings are ones we
are still working hard to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Xu, whose daughter attends Boston University, Zhu
said Wednesday's speech was ``not the time or place for me to go
into details.'' Wang said later he ``sort of expected'' an indirect
answer but was pleased to have a chance to keep pressure on to free
Xu.

KING COUNTY EMPLOYEE WORKS FROM HOME, IN FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NEIL MODIE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lots of people, including a lot of bureaucrats,
telecommute these days. But few local government workers do it from
as far away as Patricia Terrell does.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, a King County employee since 1994, has an office and a
desk at the county's Boeing Field, where she is the lease manager.
But she does most of her work from home.
</P>
<P>
   For Terrell, home is 3,000 miles away, in the Florida seaside
community of Port Orange, a suburb of Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   That's where she and her husband, John Terrell, bought a house
last November and registered to vote in December, after selling
their condominium in Bellevue, Wash, a suburb of Seattle. But at
the behest of her superiors, she's still a King County employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize it's peculiar,'' Cynthia Stewart, the airport
manager, admitted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart said county managers have tried unsuccessfully to
find someone with Terrell's background in commercial property
management to replace her. At the same time, the airport is in the
middle of some complicated lease negotiations and an arbitration
proceeding that Terrell has been handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to move to Florida for personal reasons and we were
just over a barrel, so we asked her if she would help us out this
way,'' Stewart said. ``Believe me, we were desperate, and she is a
very conscientious, hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the Terrells moved to Florida to care for John
Terrell's ailing, elderly mother after he retired from his real
estate job.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Terrell flies to Seattle _ at her own expense _ to work
here about a week to 10 days each month, Stewart said. The
bicoastal employee worked full time at her $42,636-a-year job until
Jan. 1, and has worked about half time since then.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell would be hard pressed to find a more receptive local
government to telecommuting than King County's. County Executive
Ron Sims is a passionate advocate of telecommuting, e-mail, the
Internet and techno-everything.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said Tuesday that he does probably one-third of his job by
computer, much of it from home during off hours, and sees nothing
wrong with Terrell's arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Letting county employees telecommute ``is difficult for
supervisors because they know you're working, but they don't see
you,'' Sims said. ``But you have to ask: Does a person work any
better because they're in front of you?... If a body of work is
being done and you can look at the body of work'' to confirm it,
then it's OK, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said King County is looking for opportunities to let select
employees telecommute ``because it's a commuter reduction, a
congestion reduction strategy, and it appears to be the wave of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said she wouldn't have approved Terrell's telecommuting
arrangement ``unless I could see evidence of her work, and in her
case I can see the evidence of her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell, reached by telephone at her Florida home Tuesday,
referred most questions to Stewart. But she noted that King County
``allows people to telecommute for maternity leaves and other
unusual situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Clancy, the county's leasing supervisor and Terrell's
immediate superior, said the county hasn't found an equally
qualified person to replace her because the salary for the position
can't compete with the private market. And Terrell's job is of
limited duration, to be merged with another lease-managing position
a few months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy admitted that the distance of Terrell's telecommute is
unusual. But having her across the country, he said, isn't much
different electronically than from having her across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I e-mail her from here, when it's 5 o'clock here
and 8 o'clock there, I get an immediate response,'' he said.

<P>
   With its lively action, wicked characters and twisted humor,
professional wrestling ranks as one of the hottest spectator sports
among boys. But a new study suggests it contains more obscene
gestures and sexual messages than actual wrestling moves, reports
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   One of the sport's heroes, Stone Cold Steve Austin, rose to the
top by glamorizing foul language and flipping his middle finger.
His official WWF site on the Internet reveals it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically just a redneck from Texas who worked his way up
from the loading docks,'' Austin told CLASS ACTS.
</P>
<P>
   Young wrestling fans admit the sport is sometimes gross, even
fake _ but still amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't watch it because we think it's real, we watch because
it's fun and entertaining,'' student Jay Key told CLASS ACTS. ``We
know shows like ``Seinfeld'' and ``ER'' aren't real either, but we
watch them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   RATINGS ROCK
</P>
<P>
   Ratings of cable USA's ``WWF RAW Is War'' and TNT's ``WCW Monday
Nitro'' are up nearly 40 percent from last year. (WWF stands for
World Wrestling Federation and WCW-nWo is World Championship
Wrestling _ New World Order.) Last week's issue of TV Guide reveals
that the programs are extremely popular among viewers in part
because of the edgy pranks. Ratings indicate 24 percent of WCW
viewers are between the ages of 2 and 17.
</P>
<P>
   Youths say they like the actions and personalities of the
wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro wrestling is fun to watch because you never know what is
going to happen next,'' said Tommy Chenault, 10, a student. ``For
example, on `Massacre' during February, Stone Cold was facing
Vincent McMahon in the Steel Cage fight. Paul White, known as the
Giant, came and threw Stone Cold through the steel cage and broke
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his buddies, Tommy doesn't control the TV remote.
His parents closely monitor what he watches. Although a fan, he
admits the sport can get a little gross to watch, especially when
the ``Undertaker'' starts his bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, if they go too far, it's kind of sick to watch,''
Tommy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's mom, Cindi Chenault, a substitute teacher, said the
sport is influencing young boys. There's a lot of mimicking of the
wrestlers' behavior, such as grabbing private parts and doing choke
holds around the neck, she said. She suggests youths talk to their
parents about the wrestlers' behavior, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   TOO OBSCENE?
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Indiana University, commissioned by ``Inside
Edition,'' of 50 ``WWF Raw'' episodes last year on the USA network
turned up a staggering number of profane incidents, AP reports. WWF
places a parental warning on ``WWF Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's researchers counted instances of characters grabbing
their crotches and making obscene and sexual gestures. One segment
featured a satanic activity in which people supposedly drained
blood from a ``dead'' wrestler and drank it.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestlers are constantly being struck by objects like garbage
cans or night sticks, said Indiana University Professor Walter
Gantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow they manage not to hurt each other,'' Gantz said.
``I'm not certain that a 10-year-old realizes that they are skilled
at doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy disagrees. He said he and his friends know the moves are
fake and therefore the violence doesn't seem so bad. ``It's violent
but not that violent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWPOINT: WHAT IS THE ATTRACTION TO WRESTLING?
</P>
<P>
   It may be fake, but there's no denying the popularity of
wrestling. CLASS ACTS asked readers, ``What is the attraction to
wrestling and why is it so much fun to watch?''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people watch wrestling not just for the matches, but
for the way the characters interact with each other and the story
behind each character,'' said middle school student Rob Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like wrestling because it's fast-paced and exciting. And I
like the Undertaker because of his moves,'' elementary school
student Craig Souder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really watch or like wrestling, because I believe it's
just actors portraying angry men who just got out of jail or
something. But most ofmy family watches it and I think I know what
attracts them to WWF. You have your roaring crowds, your big
`heroes' of the arena, your bright lights and the promise of a
fight,'' said Allie Bolton, elementary school student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids watch wrestling because it has violence, like
fighting, and kids like violence ... They watch it to be cool, like
if that person hears other kids talk about wrestling, they'll start
watching to try to fit in,'' said David Smith Jr., elementary
school student.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite tag-team wrestlers are the New Age Outlaws. They
are really cool. Sometimes they will get aggressive, too, and they
are funny ... There is one person who gets real crazy and he is my
favorite wrestler. His name is Stone Cold Steve Austin. When the
manager gets Steve mad, he will get anything he can in his hands
and will use it to hurt the manager,'' Rafael Vazquez, middle
school student, told CLASS ACTS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started watching it with my brother for one reason _ those
guys from Generation X are really cute,'' added high school student
Meagan Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   But high school student Jennifer Leatherwood admitted ``I don't
watch it. It's too fake for me.''

 MOVIE REVIEW: ``EDtv''  World rights. 
 Includes one color slide of of Matthew McConaughey in a scene from
the movie ``EDtv.'' (Credit: 1998 Walt Disney Pictures.) 
 By THANE TUTTLE 
 Copyright 1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``EDtv''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson,
Sally Kirkland, Martin Landau, Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Reiner, Dennis
Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Ed (McConaughey) is selected by a floundering network,
TrueTV, to have his life filmed live. Although he starts off
slowly, Ed soon becomes involved with his brother's girlfriend.
While this does increase Ed's ratings, it sets him at odds with the
rest of his family. Now, Ed must deal with both his family's
resentment and his new girlfriend's growing dislike of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Although ``EDtv'' is very similar to ``The Truman
Show'' in both concept and execution, it differs from ``Truman'' in
its focus. While ``The Truman Show'' is about a man finding out
that his life is being filmed, ``EDtv'' is about a man who has to
deal with his new-found fame.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ron Howard gets the film off to a rocky start, but
after the first 15 minutes, the film becomes genuinely funny.
Nearly all of the jokes are good, but some may be too mature for
younger audiences. The most annoying thing about the movie is the
all-too-frequent use of Pepsi advertisements. There are frequent
close-ups of Pepsi cans and machines. And at one point, Ed even
says that he prefers Pepsi to Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for rating: The PG-13 rating is for language, partial
nudity, and blatant innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 score: 8.

<P>
   Is there a girl out there who doesn't know about 'N Sync?
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've been hiding in a cave, you probably are fully
aware. With all the buzz, CLASS ACTS managed to steal a few minutes
with 27-year-old 'N Sync member Chris.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are things going with you guys?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're on tour right now. We've put a lot of sleepless nights
into it. It's always fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know there are tons of 'N Sync fans, but how do you respond
to all the negative energy out there?
</P>
<P>
   A: We try not to read our press. I mean, even if it's good or
bad, we don't read it. We put it behind us. We play for our fans.
It's all just opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you ever get tired of the mobs of fans?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not really. It's always nice to be recognized. We try to make
time for our fans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there anything that you think could break y'all up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think so. We try not to let things come between us.
If we have a disagreement, we always quash it before the show.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does your family feel about yr success?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're very supportive. They're just happy that I'm happy.
They would be supportive of anything I chose to do, as long as I
was happy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you each take on certain roles in the group?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, we're not the Spice Girls. There isn't like a sporty one
and whatever. We all have our own personalities, and some mix and
some are different.

<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April): A family argument will arise in your
household. Your best bet will be to not take sides. The scene may
become ugly if no one will compromise. It is your job to be the
mediator of this situation. You have been in a similar disagreement
with a friend; you will know precisely what to do.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): You will receive good news
concerning your summer plans in the next few days. Do not forget to
say `thank you' to the necessary people. Your gratitude will be
very much appreciated. You will also encounter a new friend this
week. Do not try to push them away because they are part of your
usual group of friends.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): April and May are the most hectic
months of your year. To make sure that you are able to stay on top
of the situation, you need to eat from the correct food groups. You
must also get a regimented amount of sleep. If you do not take care
of yourour health may wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): You need to do something you have
been putting off for the longest time. You realize over and over
again that procrastination is your biggest problem. Do something
about it. If you try to get on top of things, your problems will
begin to diminish gre that is hard to find these days. Keep up the
good work, and try to involve your friends more in what you do. It
is amazing what you can complete when you all have the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): You will be faced with a very
difficult decision really soon. However, there is good news. Before
then, you will have many smallerto make to help you prepare. They
will not be insignificantly small, so you need to take them
seriously. Play your cards right, and this weekend will open wide
for you and a cutie.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): You cannot let a secret eat away
at you. You have to get it off your chest and out in the open if it
starts to bug you or keep you awake at n in trust, but if you do
tell and it is for the better, there is no way that people can be
mad at you. You are a great friend, and friends will see your point
of view before too long.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): Give a little time to yourself this
week. It has been a long time since you have sat and thought about
what all is going on. You need to develop your own opinion before
you can listen to other people talk on some subjects that you are
facing. The more time you spend by yourself, the more you are
happier with who you are.

   WHERE'S THE FORCE WHEN YOU REALLY NEED IT?
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Ewan McGregor says playing young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the
new ``Star Wars'' movie wasn't all swords and special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the filming was ``the epitome of tedium,'' the
28-year-old Scottish actor admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work was so complex with all the special effects and stuff
that I found myself hanging around for days,'' he said. ``I was
frowning a lot. It became just a frowning exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   The George Lucas-directed movie, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace,'' is the first installment in the much-anticipated
three-part prequel to the blockbuster space trilogy. It comes out
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Boredom didn't stop McGregor from signing up for the two other
``Star Wars'' movies, which are to be completed by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just an actor who can't say no. Besides, there's
nothing cooler than being a Jedi knight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NO BUTTS ABOUT IT, YOUNG MORE VULNERABLE TO SMOKE DAMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Even if teen-agers who smoke quit as adults, they may inflict on
themselves long-lasting damage that can put them at high risk for
lung cancer later on, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have known that tobacco smoke's brew of
cancer-causing chemicals latches on to the genetic material DNA,
forming compounds called adducts, which set the stage for cancer.
Now a study suggests that young smokers may be more susceptible to
this chemical damage.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at lung tissue from 143 lung-cancer patients,
researchers found that among 79 ex-smokers, those who picked up the
habit as teen-agers had more DNA adducts in their tissue than did
ex-smokers who had started later in life.
</P>
<P>
   This study's evidence may also aid in convincing kids never to
take up smoking, said Dr. Alex Prokhorov, a behavioral scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to find some meaningful message threvents
kids from smoking,'' he said. ``They don't see immediate effects of
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   STUDENTS WILL MIND THE STORE
</P>
<P>
   GRANDVILLE, Mich. _ When students in three western Michigan
school districts talk about the school store, they don't mean a
closet stocked with pencils, erasers and notebook paper.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it's a ``laboratory,'' soon to open in a shopping mall,
that will teach retailing skills that can be used after graduation.
Backers say it may be the first mall store run by students in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Together with General Growth Properties Inc. based in Chicago,
60 students in grades 6-12 will design, market, stock and staff the
store to be known as ``School Spirit!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,118-square-foot store will look like any other sportswear
retailer, except that sweatshirts and baseball caps will bear
school logos and the staff will work for school credit and minimum
wage.

<P>
   Here is a look at the headlines for next week's CLASS ACTS kids'
stories. We hope this will help you in your planning.
</P>
<P>
   You may wish to localize some topics, for example, or illustrate
the text with photos of local kids.
</P>

US SETS SIGHTS ON MILOSEVIC FINANCIAL ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>

 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ UN sanctions may have crippled Serbia's
economy, but Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his inner
circle have become multimillionaires through their control of
state-controlled monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia gathers steam, US
officials say they have secretly stepped up their efforts to locate
and seize those assets from overseas accounts in Russia Greece,
Cyprus and elsewhere. They say they believe Milosevic's illicit
financial empire _ which they describe as ``Serbia Inc.'' _ is
being used to finance Serbia's war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at ways to increase pressure economically and
financially on Milosevic,'' said a senior US official familiar with
the covert effort. ``We intend to undercut his ability to conduct
military operations and sustain and maintain his national
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The covert operation is aimed at cutting off Serbia's ability to
buy weapons and jet fuel, feed troops, repair tanks and power their
radar systems. It has also provided grist for NATO propagandists
seeking to portray Milosevic, his family and his inner circle as
corrupt scam artists with little concern for the hardships faced by
ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say American intelligence agencies, preoccupied
with the hunt for war criminals and the security of American forces
in the Balkans, have missed countless opportunities to cut into the
Serb leader's war chest. They said numerous initial requests to the
CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency by US Ambassador Robert Gelbard
_ who has spearheaded the administration's hunt for Milosevic's
assets _ yielded little.
</P>
<P>
   But an official familiar with the operation has received growing
support during the last year from high-level administration
officials, the Treasury Department and the three key US
intelligence agencies _ the CIA, the DIA and the National Security
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence has uncovered evidence that Milosevic's brother,
Boris Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow, and Serbian
banker Bogoljub Karic, have laundered hundreds of millions through
several banks in Russia, including the Moscow based branch of
Karic's bank, according to a US official familiar with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karic is a key board member of Serbia Inc.'' the official
said. ``We will get them,'' said an administration official
involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials say they also have evidence of money
laundering in Greece and Cyprus. But Washington has been reluctant
to disclose details that would embarrass the Cypriot government
when it was engaged in a diplomatic effort to free three American
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Former US diplomats and intelligence officials say that efforts
to financially squeeze Milosevic has been painstaking. Tracking the
flow of illicit money through the secretive international banking
and financial system is extremely difficult. And Washington's
attitude toward Milosevic _ who was instrumental in negotiating an
end to the Bosnian war at Dayton, Ohio _ frequently shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has always been ambivalent'' about how
aggressively it should pursue Milosevic, said a former US
intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been able to take advantage of that ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, several months before Milosevic began his military
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels, the West allowed the
Serbian regime to obtain billions of dollars through the sale of
private assets.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a joint venture by two NATO allies _ OTE Telecom
of Greece and Telecom Italia _ purchased 49 percent of the Belgrade
state telephone company for $880 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was handled by an investment bank from Britain, NatWest
while the American accountancy firm Price Waterhouse advised the
Serbian communications ministry, according to Pyramid Research of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claimed to use the money to pay pensions, and to reform
the postal and telecommunications infrastructure, according to
Julie Altman, a telecommunications analyst at Pyramid. But she said
it was impossible to determine how the money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Others suspect the money helped finance the military's offensive
in Kosovo in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been his war kitty,'' said Mark Kirk, a staffer at
the Republican House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Britain has disclosed details on the web of
offshore holdings that have kept Milosevic in power. Relying on
American intelligence, Britain's Foreign Minister Robin Cook said
that Milosevic stashed millions in offshore banks, and purchased
villas in Corfu, Crete and Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Milosevic's son, Marko, is sitting out the war in a
villa in Greece. Marko Milosevic own a bakery, a duty-free import
business and the Madonna discoteque in Pozarevac, Milosevic's home
town.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Maria, owns a radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the people of Serbia how much wealth you have sucked out
of Serbia during the same years they have been impoverished,'' Cook
said on April 7. ``Let them see the luxury yacht you keep in Greece
while they struggle to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Britain's Defense Minister George Robertson identified
key government ministers who have been rewarded for their loyalty
to Milosevic with lucrative state monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Marjanovic, the prime minister of Serbia, is president of
the country's natural gas monopoly, Progress.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of the federal
republic of Yugoslavia, heads the RTB Bor Copper Mine. And Dragan
Tomic, the speaker of the parliament, is director of NIS
Jugopetrol, which has a near monopoly on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption and nepotism,'' Robertson said ``are...the cancer
at the heart of Milosevic's empire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He corrupted the system,'' said Milan Panic, a California
pharmaceuticals executive and former Yugoslav prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister is also the manager of a large business. Some of
them were decent people before he corrupted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic said Milosevic recently confiscated more than $170 million
in assets from a Belgrade-based subsidiary of his pharmaceuticals
company, ICN.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money all went into financing Milosevic's adventures such
as the Kosovo war,'' said Panic. ``He is draining the last of our
economic resources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Panic said that he believes Milosevic is running out of
money. He said that senior Russian officials have warned that they
would stop selling him fuel unless he paid his bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you are going to find billions of dollars in his
accounts,'' he said. ``I would let him have all the money if he
would just resign and leave the country.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The enormous human crisis building in Kosovo with
hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians hiding in forests from
Serb forces is pressing the issue of sending ground troops into a
matter of grave urgency, a group of military and foreign policy
experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House on Wednesday dismissed a question about
President Clinton's plans for ground forces with a blunt ``he still
has none,'' some experts fear there's no time left to think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal reason for not waiting,'' said Richard N.
Haass(CQ), director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, ``is not simply that the Serbs might be digging in...
but it's the plight of the internally displaced. At some point I
want to make sure there are some Kosovars left to save.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress agreed earlier this week to postpone a debate on the
issue, but the White House and NATO continue to emphasize the value
in letting weeks of bombing accumulate on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic as a way to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea summarized the strategy
this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a situation where the correlation of forces
is turning to NATO's advantage with every passing day because every
day Milosevic has less, and every day we have more.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the alliance acknowledges that it has no
solution for the riddle of how to feed scores of stranded, starving
ethnic Albanian refugees while it wages its campaign of gradual
degradation of the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war of attrition does nothing to protect the people whose
lives and welfare are at stake,'' Haass said. ``The assumption (of
the air campaign) is time is not a factor, and I just don't think
that assumption is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the equation is the physical reality that a call to
deploy troops into Kosovo would take weeks to execute, as evidenced
by the recent experience with NATO's request for 24 Apache
helicopters from the U.S. Army. The helicopters, and their massive
support structure of personnel, are expected to arrive in the
Balkans at the end of this week, more than two weeks after NATO
first sought them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Desert Storm, which was preceded by a lengthy build-up
of forces called Desert Shield, the United States would have to
start nearly from scratch to assemble a decisive force to
participate in the liberation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vickers, who studies military issues at the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, said he thinks the United
States will need to commit 80,000 troops to help NATO retake enough
of Kosovo to save the lives of those trapped in its forests. And he
estimates that it'll take up to three months to get them into
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question is, 'Could we sustain the air campaign for
that long?'' Vickers said. ``There are no short answers.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they last reviewed the potential need
for ground forces late last summer, when diplomats were crafting a
peace plan that included an international peace-keeping force. That
``assessment'' hasn't been updated since NATO went to war with
Belgrade, Serb forces flushed Kosovar Albanians out and untold
thousands ended up stranded in the wilderness without access to
food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not too interested in whether they have plans,
they know how to deploy forces,'' said Michael E. O'Hanlon, who is
a military analyst, also at Brookings. ``We know how to move fast,
the question is do we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon believes the U.S. could deliver a single brigade, about
4,000 troops, in a week to meet up with 12,000 NATO troops already
in Macedonia and another 4,000 U.S. Marines on ships in nearby
waters. Also, U.S. and NATO bases in Germany could provide
additional troops to create a large force in short order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think weeks is the way to think about the first (group),''
he said. ``You may be able to start to put people into Kosovo in a
couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But there remains the matter of when to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should deploy immediately,'' O'Hanlon said. ``Deploy forces
to Italy immediately to have them ready. We shouldn't waste any
more time on that at all.''

YELTSIN PICKS CHERNOMYRDIN AS PERSONAL ENVOY IN YUGOSLAV TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday chose former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin as his personal envoy in talks to
settle the Yugoslav conflict. More than a few outsiders said the
appointment was driven as much by domestic as foreign necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they see Chernomyrdin, a bland but respected
middle-of-the-road politician, as Yeltsin's counterweight to Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has until now led Russian efforts to
find a solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, 61, affable and politically astute, has the
background to bargain with the West. A Communist Party member for
30 years, many of them as a senior policy-maker, he seamlessly
moved to capitalism in 1989 as chairman of the world's largest gas
company, Gazprom, first under Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
leader, and later Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin made him prime minister in 1992 and he clung to the job
until early 1998, when Russia's growing economic problems led to
his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was never known as an ardent capitalist or
reformer. But he was a reliably pro-Western and pragmatic prime
minister, and developed an especially close relationship with Vice
President Al Gore, with whom he shared the leadership of a
commission formed to address joint U.S.-Russian economic and
military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin asked Chernomyrdin to return to the prime minister's job
last September, after Russia's economic crash. But Communists and
nationalists in Parliament blocked the move. And despite
Chernomyrdin's open ambition to run for president in 2000, many
Russian analysts have written him off as a political force.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Chernomyrdin would soon be meeting with parties
to the conflict ``at the highest levels,'' but offered no further
hints as to what tacks he would take.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Chernomyrdin suggested that his ties to Gore could
prove useful in finding a way out of the Yugoslav conflict. ``We
must persuade the Americans, including the Democratic Party, which
is preparing for a presidential election in 2000, that it is in
their interest to end the strikes,'' he was quoted as saying by the
Russian news service Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin clearly would be a more acceptable representative
to Western officials than would be Primakov, who spent most of his
career needling the West in Soviet and Russian foreign-policy jobs
and as Yeltsin's head of Russian intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also has an interest, some political analysts say, in
reclaiming some of the policy turf that Primakov began to occupy
during the extended period last fall and winter when Yeltsin was
ill and in seclusion.

SENATORS DEBATE OLYMPIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Olympic scandal moved to Capitol Hill
Wednesday, as frustrated senators wrestled with how quickly they
should use the US tax code and other laws to force reforms on the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, a consensus
appeared to emerge that it would be a mistake to take immediate
action on proposals that would dramatically alter Olympic financing
mechanisms and weaken the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Among those proposals are stripping the IOC's tax-exempt status,
denying tax deductions to its corporate sponsors, and redirecting
lucrative television rights fees to its US affiliate, the United
States Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing at this moment is to threaten some
kind of Draconian measure,'' said committee chairman John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican from Arizona echoed the hearing's lead witness,
former Senate majority leader George Mitchell, who said rash action
by Congress could derail the IOC's internal reform process and
jeopardize funding for athletes. Mitchell served as chairman of an
independent ethics commission assembled by the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of McCain's colleagues were willing to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we all waiting on?'' asked Ernest Hollings, a
Democrat from South Carolina, who was among several senators
calling for the ouster of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. In
a reference to the IOC's home city in Switzerland, Hollings
demanded, ``Heavens above, we've got to . . . clean up Lausanne.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollings then implored his old friend Mitchell to drop the
diplomatic role of Northern Ireland peacemaker and ``give us some
marching orders here and tell us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell demurred, saying, ``I don't believe one can fairly
make a conclusion at this time on whether legislation should be
enacted.'' He said Congress should give the IOC until the end of
this year to clean house with help from a reform panel called IOC
2000, whose newly appointed members include Henry Kissinger and the
organizer of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Peter
Ueberroth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing marked the most notable response by Congress
to allegations of bribery and influence peddling surrounding the
choice of Salt Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Games. Ten IOC
members have resigned or been expelled in the worst scandal in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   While committee members generally supported a methodical
approach to enacting laws that would affect the IOC's primary
funding source _ an estimated 60 percent of Olympic revenues come
from the United States _ there was widespread support for
immediately including the IOC under the chief US law against
bribery of foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that by the end of the day he would file legislation
to amend the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to include a ban on
bribery of IOC members. Mitchell's commission and the USOC last
month recommended that President Clinton issue an executive order
applying the bribery law to the IOC, but Justice Department
officials have said privately they doubted it could be done as the
statute is now written, making action by Congress necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sharpest moments of the hearing came when McCain
peppered IOC members Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton, both US
citizens, with questions about the IOC's willingness to accept the
Mitchell commission's recipe for reform, including term limits for
IOC members; election of IOC members by national Olympic
committees; and immediate public release of IOC meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other than term limits, which they both supported, one or the
other expressed reservations or opposition to the rest of the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared particularly angered by DeFrantz's support for
keeping IOC meeting minutes secret for 10 to 20 years, which she
said was necessary to protect IOC members in their home countries.
McCain said DeFrantz's position ``flies in the face of everything
I've ever thought in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz and Easton appeared in place of Samaranch, who declined
McCain's invitation to attend. Easton confined his remarks to an
apology to McCain, whom Easton had suggested was using the issue as
a publicity ploy for his presidential aspirations. McCain accepted
the apology.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had warm praise for another witness, USOC president Bill
Hybl, whose organization McCain said had accepted its share of
blame for the Salt Lake City mess and responded quickly to the
Mitchell commission's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Though most senators on McCain's committee appeared content to
withhold judgment on laws affecting the IOC's financial status, not
all members of Congress are so inclined. On Monday, two
representatives from New York, Democrat Henry A. Waxman and
Republican Rick Lazio introduced a bill to ban US corporations and
individuals from financially supporting the IOC until it adopts the
Mitchell commission's recommendations.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The enormous human crisis building in Kosovo with
hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians hiding in forests from
Serb forces is pressing the issue of sending ground troops into a
matter of grave urgency, a group of military and foreign policy
experts said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House on Wednesday dismissed a question about
President Clinton's plans for ground forces with a blunt ``he still
has none,'' some experts fear there's no time left to think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal reason for not waiting,'' said Richard N.
Haass(CQ), director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution, ``is not simply that the Serbs might be digging in...
but it's the plight of the internally displaced. At some point I
want to make sure there are some Kosovars left to save.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress agreed earlier this week to postpone a debate on the
issue, but the White House and NATO continue to emphasize the value
in letting weeks of bombing accumulate on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic as a way to get him out.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea summarized the strategy
this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a situation where the correlation of forces
is turning to NATO's advantage with every passing day because every
day Milosevic has less, and every day we have more.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the alliance acknowledges that it has no
solution for the riddle of how to feed scores of stranded, starving
ethnic Albanian refugees while it wages its campaign of gradual
degradation of the Serb military.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war of attrition does nothing to protect the people whose
lives and welfare are at stake,'' Haass said. ``The assumption (of
the air campaign) is time is not a factor, and I just don't think
that assumption is accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the equation is the physical reality that a call to
deploy troops into Kosovo would take weeks to execute, as evidenced
by the recent experience with NATO's request for 24 Apache
helicopters from the U.S. Army. The helicopters, and their massive
support structure of personnel, are expected to arrive in the
Balkans at the end of this week, more than two weeks after NATO
first sought them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Desert Storm, which was preceded by a lengthy build-up
of forces called Desert Shield, the United States would have to
start nearly from scratch to assemble a decisive force to
participate in the liberation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vickers, who studies military issues at the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, said he thinks the United
States will need to commit 80,000 troops to help NATO retake enough
of Kosovo to save the lives of those trapped in its forests. And he
estimates that it'll take up to three months to get them into
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question is, 'Could we sustain the air campaign for
that long?'' Vickers said. ``There are no short answers.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they last reviewed the potential need
for ground forces late last summer, when diplomats were crafting a
peace plan that included an international peace-keeping force. That
``assessment'' hasn't been updated since NATO went to war with
Belgrade, Serb forces flushed Kosovar Albanians out and untold
thousands ended up stranded in the wilderness without access to
food or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm not too interested in whether they have plans,
they know how to deploy forces,'' said Michael E. O'Hanlon, who is
a military analyst, also at Brookings. ``We know how to move fast,
the question is do we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon believes the U.S. could deliver a single brigade, about
4,000 troops, in a week to meet up with 12,000 NATO troops already
in Macedonia and another 4,000 U.S. Marines on ships in nearby
waters. Also, U.S. and NATO bases in Germany could provide
additional troops to create a large force in short order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think weeks is the way to think about the first (group),''
he said. ``You may be able to start to put people into Kosovo in a
couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But there remains the matter of when to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should deploy immediately,'' O'Hanlon said. ``Deploy forces
to Italy immediately to have them ready. We shouldn't waste any
more time on that at all.''

DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER GIVES $1 MILLION TO RECONSTRUCT JEFFERSON
LIBRARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jerry Jones, the flamboyant Dallas Cowboys owner
best known in the rough and tumble worlds of sports and business,
made a foray into the intellectual world on Wednesday with a $1
million gift to honor Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his wife, Gene, gave the money to the Library of
Congress to replace volumes in the third president's personal
library that were destroyed in a fire in the Capitol in 1851.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be on the team in this way,'' Jones said,
speaking at a news conference in the ornate office of James
Billington, librarian of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a display of some of Jefferson's original books,
Jones called them ``treasures of our past'' and said he wanted
students learning about Jefferson ``to feel the roar of the crowd,
so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Also evoking sports imagery, Billington said: ``The generosity
of this gift is, in itself, remarkable. But in the heart of
Washington Redskins territory, it is particularly appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones kicked off the library's plan to celebrate its 200th
anniversary next year by giving Billington a duplicate of a grammar
book purchased by Jefferson in 1785. The book, published in 1765
with the title ``Hermes, or a Philosophical Inquiry Concerning
Universal Grammar,'' was written by James Harris, an English
scholar.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress plans to use the gift from Jones to
recreate Jefferson's original collection of 6,400 books by
replacing 987 destroyed or missing volumes with rare duplicates
from other libraries, private collections or antiquarian
booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare himself with Jefferson, the Cowboys' owner at
first demurred, saying that the author of the Declaration of
Independence ``is an example to us all.'' Then he added: ``I'd like
to think he was a sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, the library's expert on Jefferson, curator Gerard
Gawalt, stepped forward to speak about Jefferson's love of horse
racing and hunting. ``The fit between Mr. Jones and Mr. Jefferson
is a lot closer than one would think at first glance,'' Gawalt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take that,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson had a direct connection to the Library of Congress.
His books were purchased by Congress to be the core of the library
after British invaders burned the Capitol in 1814 during the War of
1812, which ended with a peace treaty signed Dec. 24, 1814, in
Ghent, Belgium. The Library of Congress was first housed in the
Capitol; it is now directly across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The second fire, in 1851, started in a faulty chimney flue in
the Capitol and destroyed two-thirds of the collection. Jefferson's
catalogue survived the flames, enabling curators to rebuild the
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Billington described it Wednesday as a ``universal collection''
that reflected the diverse interests ``of this universal man.''
Among the items that the Library of Congress' experts will be
seeking are a pamphlet on pomegranates and a book on pasta
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress has a collection of more than 115
million items, including the diaries of aviation pioneers Orville
and Wilbur Wright, the music of George and Ira Gershwin and Leonard
Bernstein. It is now digitizing many of its collections to make
them accessible on the Internet.

WORLD COMES CRASHING DOWN ON FORMER PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Will Miller, a former prosecutor who now faces five
felony drug charges, has a pretty good idea what the future holds.
And it makes him shudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to prison; I know that,'' Miller said from the
kitchen table of his Seattle home yesterday. ``I will probably lose
my house, and I will probably lose my job. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller fell from being a well-respected prosecutor to, by his
own admission, a drug addict who spent every dime he could raise to
pump methamphetamine into his veins. But even after he righted
himself and began a new career as a defense attorney, a mixture of
drugs, love and stupidity pulled him back down.
</P>
<P>
   The end announced itself with the pounding on his front door in
February. King County narcotics officers broke in to arrest him,
culminating an investigation in which Miller sold drugs to an
undercover agent three times.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he sold the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all my fault,'' he said Tuesday in his first interview
since he was charged.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not smart to grant an interview, he concedes.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, who put criminals away for 10 years in New York,
then Seattle, said he wants to counter what he sees as a campaign
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of getting smeared, my name and my reputation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he complained that he was set up, then denied a plea deal
most people in his situation would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they've gone out of their way to take me down,''
Miller, 37, said during an interview in which he frequently broke
down into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Canova, the state assistant attorney general who is
prosecuting Miller, could not comment on the details of the case.
But he denied that he had treated Miller unfairly or that he is
harshly prosecuting Miller because of publicity Canova got last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Those news reports came after an initial investigation ended
with Canova deciding not to charge Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miller faces more than 10 years in prison if convicted.
The best Canova has offered him is a deal of four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is out of money and about to default on his mortgage. His
telephone has been turned off, and his legal problems have all but
dried up his business prospects. So the only lawyer he can afford
is himself.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Douglas Willas Miller stood on the other side of the
law. He spent one internship away from Duke University Law School
at the district attorney's office in Brooklyn, working homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was hooked. It was a job where you followed the truth, he
said. Guilty people were prosecuted; the innocent were set free.
</P>
<P>
   From 1988 to 1995, he was a full-time prosecutor in New York,
working sex crimes in Brooklyn, then Queens. He was good at his
job, from press reports and according to spokesmen at those
offices.
</P>
<P>
   His life was so charmed that he even escaped a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   A mugger shot at him on a Brooklyn street 1991, but the bullet
only grazed his head. The New York Post proclaimed him ``Miracle
Man!'' worthy of its front page. Miller keeps a framed copy in his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the beauty of Seattle, Miller went to work for the King
County Prosecutor's Office in 1995. He gave up his seniority in New
York and started over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I did was win cases,'' he said. By his count, 16
of 17 King County juries gave him convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was different in polite Seattle. He didn't mind
confrontation in the courtroom. He was open about his sexuality,
too, he said, talking about the men in his life.
</P>
<P>
   One he met was Jeff Vinson. By September, the two moved in
together, and in November, Miller filed with the county to make
Vinson his domestic partner, eligible for his health benefits.
Miller still calls Vinson his spouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, Miller moved into a new position,
supervising new prosecutors in misdemeanor courts. He also began
snorting methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson, who would later lead narcotics officers to Miller, liked
to stay out all night, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller existed on three or four hours of sleep a night, and then
went to work, he said. And he used methamphetamine four times a
week.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, he began showing up late for
work.
</P>
<P>
   One time was on the morning of March 2, 1998. A call from
Miller's secretary woke him at 10 a.m. In a rush, he grabbed his
briefcase and art case _ Miller sketched in the courtroom _ and
left. A search of the art case by courthouse security turned up a
scale, a drug pipe and a small amount of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the items belonged to Vinson. And his lover backed
him up. But the damage was done. Miller resigned as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started shooting up the day after I resigned. I had a
nervous breakdown. I didn't know what I was doing with my life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went to work as a defense lawyer. He stopped injecting drugs,
but still used them, he said. He ordered Vinson out of his house.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, an investigation in the courthouse incident
continued. The case was turned over to Canova to avoid an
appearance of a conflict of interest inside the King County
Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Canova decided not to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   That decision met with some critical press reports. Canova
himself had been an unsuccessful candidate for the Washington
Supreme Court that year.
</P>
<P>
   Canova and the criminal justice system had a score to settle,
Miller contends. Canova, he asserts, made him a ``whipping boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Canova flatly denies that he is prosecuting Miller in response
to bad press or to further his political career.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Vinson contacted a King County
detective around the start of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Vinson contended that Miller was dealing drugs, which Miller
denies. And Vinson said the statement that he had made about the
courthouse incident in March 1998 was false.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Vinson called him three times, asking him to sell
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Canova said he cannot comment on any of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February, Miller sold drugs to the undercover
officer three times. Then came the raid on his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I realized it was the police,'' Miller said, ``I knew it
was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug use stopped that day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Miller's only defense is to claim entrapment. That will
require finding Vinson, whose whereabouts are unknown to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Canova said Miller can question Vinson through the normal legal
channels.
</P>
<P>
   What Miller wants is a lesser sentence than Canova is willing to
recommend. That would allow the former prosecutor to go to a work
ethic camp instead of the harsher environment of a prison.
</P>
<P>
   Canova said he cannot discuss plea offers.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't get a deal to his liking, Miller said he will ask a
judge to remove Canova for what he contends are unethical and
immoral actions, then ask for a change of venue. In a new locale,
he said, he might get a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   But to the veteran prosecutor, the outcome doesn't seem much in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid,'' he said, ``and I will go to prison for it.''

HIP-HOP STAR EMINEM'S LYRICS ARE ANYTHING BUT VANILLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``My name is ... my name is ... my name is ... Slim Shady.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Ought to. These days, ``My Name Is,'' the
flagship single of Detroit rapper Eminem's debut CD, ``The Slim
Shady LP,'' is, almost literally, anywhere there's radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   Tune in a pop station, or an alternative-rock station, or a
modern R&AMP;B station, and ``there he is again,'' this crazy white boy
with the nasty mouth whom nobody had ever heard of as recently as
Christmas. He's rapping about impregnating a Spice Girl, driving
drunk, smacking his English teacher, finding out that his mom does
more drugs than he does, and about the Incredible Hulk and Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   An all-purpose, wide-screen blast of pop-culture references,
fantasy and young-adult frustration, ``My Name Is'' has propelled
24-year-old Marshall Bruce Mathers III to hip-hop superstar status
in less than two months. He has sold more than 500,000 copies of
the profanity-filled ``Slim'' and appears on the cover of the
current issue of Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   What to make of this? That's the funny part _ ``My Name Is''
certainly qualifies as a mass-appeal novelty song, what KRBV/100.3
FM program director Carmy Ferreri calls ``quirky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something different _ it stands out on the radio,'' he
says, explaining why the song is being played on his Dallas-Fort
Worth station amid the likes of Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston and
Brandy. ``It's sort of like (Bobby McFerrin's) `Don't Worry, Be
Happy.' Everybody played it _ pop stations, rock stations, even
country stations.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all it is. For all the suddenness of Eminem's
rise, for all the ways in which this blond-kid-goes-supernova
recalls the big-bang ascension of Richardson homeboy Vanilla Ice
with ``Ice Ice Baby'' back in 1990, there's something else afoot.
Eminem long ago got respect from the black hip-hop community, the
hard-core guys who put out songs that don't get played on
KHKS/106.1 FM and KDGE/94.5 FM _ or even KRBV.
</P>
<P>
   Those musicians and producers, both in Detroit and around the
country, genuinely respect Eminem, in part because of his
association with superstar rapper/producer Dr. Dre (who produced
three tracks on the CD) and in part because he simply has the
goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of American music is that white people spin black
music and make it accessible to a broader audience,'' says Janine
Coveney, hip-hop editor of ``Gavin.'' ``And there's some resentment
about that in the black music industry. But there's none of that
with him. He's dope. His lyrics are amazing. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eminem's lyrics vary greatly from song to song _ and it's not
always pleasant. For example, on ``97' Bonnie &AMP; Clyde,'' a parody
of Will Smith's pro-family ``Just the Two of Us,'' he fantasizes
about enlisting the help of his daughter to dispose of the body of
her mom, whose throat he has slit after she hit him with a
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs mention sex with minors, goof on Kurt Cobain's
suicide, and discuss what a pain it is to help a date who has
overdosed on hallucinogenic mushrooms. Then again, there are
others, such as ``If I Had'' and ``Rock Bottom,'' that find him
ruminating about a life of dead-end jobs and meager paychecks, real
slice-of-life stuff from a guy who grew up in a tough inner-city
neighborhood and worked as a cook before the CD blew up.
</P>
<P>
   The violence and misogyny on ``Slim Shady'' has earned Eminem a
scathing editorial from Billboard editor Timothy White. But it's
precisely his darker, rougher lyrics that have landed his song on
the playlists of alternative stations that rarely, if ever, feature
hip-hop artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an edgier attitude _ that's why a lot of alternative
stations have embraced him,'' says Alan Smith, music director and
assistant program director of KDGE, the Edge, in Dallas-Fort Worth.
``The audience likes that. It's not happy _ if he had been, we
wouldn't have looked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eminem may play a pivotal role in bringing hip-hop to
alternative stations, according to Mike Peer, music director of New
York's WXRK. ``He bridges the hip-hop and alternative worlds,''
says Peer. ``He has elements of alternative music, with the image
and the lingo and the references to Nine Inch Nails, with the beats
of a hip-hop record.''
</P>
<P>
   Eminem has arrived at a time, says Peer, when hip-hop is ``a
huge force in white suburban America,'' outselling hard rock _ and
just about everything else, for that matter. Young males, his
target audience, find the elements of street culture and danger
that used to be provided more often by hard-rock acts. By playing
Eminem, Peer says, he can appeal to the guys who want to hear Tool
and Jay-Z and DMX _ and keep them from flipping to another station.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can do that, you'll clean up,'' he says. ``Young white
kids are leaving rock 'n' roll in droves to listen to rap, because
``their parents don't get it.'' Their parents get the Stones. They
don't get rap _ and that's the appeal.''

</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Pa.)  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A deep financial crisis is spreading like a virus
through the nation's teaching hospitals. It is undermining their
honorable and historic mission, which has been to train new
generations of physicians, to conduct critically important medical
research and to provide treatment for, among others, the poor.
</P>
<P>
   A devastating combination of financial pressures ``has produced
a situation in which our best hospitals are now essentially all
losing money,'' said Joseph Martin, dean of the Harvard Medical
School. He was referring to hospitals in the Boston area, but
similar pressures are being felt at teaching hospitals across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching hospitals (or, more accurately, academic medical
centers) have been hammered by the Medicare cuts that were part of
the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. As teaching hospitals are the key
providers of the nation's charitable care, they are affected
disproportionately by cuts in government funding. At the same time,
they are being squeezed by the drastic reductions in payments that
have resulted from the changeover to managed care in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cost of delivering care continues to rise. The
bottom line has been an explosion of red ink that threatens not
just the mission but the very existence of some of the finest
teaching institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only payers who help balance the books have been those who
pay through private insurance, and the payments for that are
declining as well,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the medical center known as UCSF Stanford Health
Care expects operating losses of $50 million this year. Layoff
notices have already been sent to 250 employees, and officials said
2,000 of the center's 12,000 staff members would probably be let go
over the next year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Without the layoffs, UCSF Stanford would see an operating loss
of $135 million next year, according to the center's chief
executive, Peter Van Etten.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably the center's mission will be diminished. Said Van
Etten: ``I have to say the services we will provide can't be of the
same quality that we would provide with 2,000 more people.''
</P>
<P>
   You cannot overstate the importance of teaching hospitals to the
health care system in the U.S. They offer the most advanced and
sophisticated treatment in the nation. They are essential to the
health of the poor, providing nearly 40 percent of the nation's
charitable care.
</P>
<P>
   They are also the places, as Neil Rudenstine, the president of
Harvard, noted, ``where physicians get educated,'' where they get
their first, carefully guided exposure to the connection between
scientific study and the real world of clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And they are medical research centers, the places where cures
are found, treatments developed, miracles realized.
</P>
<P>
   Toying with the future of such a system is as dangerous as
Russian roulette.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday how much of a threat the financial problems
pose to the mission of the teaching hospitals, Rudenstine replied:
``It's a total crisis, a complete crisis. I think anybody who would
call it less than that would really just not know what's going on.
I'm not quite sure what the cumulative deficit of our four or five
closely related hospitals is, but it's certainly well over $100
million so far, and we haven't even finished the year yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is not good. The cutbacks in Medicare funding, the
single biggest source of revenues for teaching hospitals, will
accelerate over the next few years. This is not a case of
administrators crying wolf. The situation is dire. The University
of Pennsylvania Health System lost $90 million last year and the
Temple University system lost nearly $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   When he mentioned the financial losses at Harvard's affiliated
hospitals, Rudenstine said: ``Two or three more years like that and
you're going to see either some people go out of business or become
for-profit institutions, which means they will drop the research
and teaching components because those things don't make any money.
They'll become perfectly good hospitals up to a certain level, but
not up to the level at which we now treat disease, and not up to
the level where you can actually train the best physicians.''

GILBERT E. MERRILL, 78; NATURALIST RAN SCIENCE MUSEUM PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Gilbert E. Merrill, a naturalist who was director of education
at Boston's Museum of Science and the first director of the Squam
Lakes Science Center in Holderness, N.H., died following surgery
Monday in St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Mass. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, as the assistant director of education at
the Museum of Science during the 1950s, Mr. Merrill logged
thousands of miles on New England highways as he brought Spooky the
Owl, the museum's ``goodwill ambassador,'' on public appearances.
During the presentations, Mr. Merrill delivered lectures on natural
history and put the keen-eyed predator through its paces.
</P>
<P>
   While Mr. Merrill piloted the car, the horned owl paced back and
forth across the top of the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plainly,'' Mr. Merrill said in a story published in the Globe
on Jan. 7, 1954, ``the owl is very fond of motoring. He never
misses a thing when we're riding. Spooky can spot a bird or an
animal before I do. When he gets bored with looking out the window,
he leans against my head, or monkeys around with the back of my
neck. The only place he doesn't like is the Sumner Tunnel. The
flicking lights upset him.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird was the museum's roving ambassador until its death in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Merrill was born in Salem, Mass. and raised in Danvers. He
graduated from Tufts University and earned a master's degree in
biology at Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served in Europe as a medic in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   He was a professor of biology and environmental science at
Elmira College in New York, and had long affiliations with the
Holderness School in New Hampshire and the Tanglewood Nature Center
in the Berkshires.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, RoseAnne (Barry); four daughters, Anne Walsh
of University Park, Md., Jane E. of Albuquerque, Elizabeth Burnham
of Beverly, Mass., and Polly Curran of Wenham, Mass.; a son,
Gilbert L. of Worcester; a sister, Virginia Byrd of Danvers; and 10
grandchildren.

EUROPEAN LEADERS OFFER KOSOVO PEACE PLAN; U.S. SEES LITTLE CHANCE
OF SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
   (ac)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Joining in the search for a diplomatic
solution to the crisis in Kosovo, leaders of the 15 European Union
countries presented a plan Wednesday under which the province would
be placed under temporary European administration if Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces and
allowed hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
   American officials gave the European initiative, and a more
detailed one separately made public by Germany on Wednesday, little
chance of being accepted by Belgrade. NATO reiterated that it would
continue bombing military targets in Yugoslavia until Milosevic
withdrew all police and military units from Kosovo and allowed its
Albanian population to return.
</P>
<P>
   But the European proposal could break new ground by signaling to
Yugoslavia's leaders and to Russia that the United States and the
North Atlantic alliance it dominates do not have to be the only
players if Milosevic is interested in any outcome in Kosovo other
than his own fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials here said that Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had also discussed some of the ideas in the European plan
in Oslo on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
However, a senior administration official denied Wednesday that
specific details of the plan had been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no discussion of a _ quote _ German plan _
unquote,'' he said. ``We did discuss the need for a Serbian
withdrawal from Kosovo and how it would be implemented, the ideas
behind a German plan. But I don't believe that there was any
discussion of the specifics of what the German government has now
unveiled.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO continued bombing Serbian military targets on Wednesday
despite more bad weather over the Balkans, and Serbian officials in
Kosovo said that an attack on a convoy of vehicles had killed
scores of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The allied command said that planes had attacked a convoy of
military vehicles near a highway bridge just east of Djakovica at
3:30 p.m. Wednesday, and that the planes had taken fire from
antiaircraft artillery and hand-held surface-to-air missiles. The
command said it could not confirm that the bombing had caused
civilian casualties but said the incident would be fully
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing the discussions of the European leaders, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday night that the goal of
both diplomacy and of NATO military action was to create a change
in Yugoslavia that would stop Serbian attacks on Albanians, who
made up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people before Serbian
paramilitary units and Yugoslav soldiers began a campaign to drive
them out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heads of state and government reiterate their
determination not to tolerate the killings and deportations in
Kosovo,'' Schroeder said, ``and believe that the use of the most
severe measures, including military measures, was both necessary
and justified.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that European leaders now considered ``establishment of
an international interim administration which the European Union
could take over'' an essential part of an eventual peace settlement
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of a settlement package that the leaders had
discussed, Schroeder said, included a police force that would
reflect the province's ethnic composition, elections and
``deployment of international military forces that will guarantee
protection for the whole population of Kosovo.'' The NATO allies
insist that any such force should be led and commanded by the
alliance, possibly under a mandate from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The European leaders insisted that the United Nations, the
European Union and Russia should all play a role in the diplomatic
resolution of the crisis. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who
attended the European Union discussions Wednesday, said that all
the members of the U.N. Security Council would be consulted about
the European proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Milosevic suddenly gives up and accepts a diplomatic
solution, the only way to impose one on him remains the bombing
campaign, now being carried out by about 1,000 American, British,
French, Dutch and German warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The original German proposal suggested a 24-hour suspension of
the bombing if Milosevic began pulling forces out of Kosovo by
deadlines set by Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain is staunchly opposed to any letup of the bombing
until an international military force can go into Kosovo and the
refugees are allowed to return to their homes in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a halt to the NATO action until the
demands that we have set out, which are entirely reasonable,
humane, civilized demands, are met in full,'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow Milosevic to get away with the
policy of ethnic cleansing. He will be defeated on that policy and
the military objectives that we have set at the beginning of this
campaign will be seen through in their entirety, in their
entirety,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has so far refused to discuss any kind of
international force in Kosovo. Russia, a permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council with veto power over its decisions, has said
it would approve such a force only if Milosevic was willing to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the original German plan, which Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer discussed with the United States, Britain, France, Canada
and Italy at a NATO meeting here on Monday, the U.N. Security
Council would set firm deadlines for Milosevic to start and finish
a withdrawal of all Serbian and paramilitary forces from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   If he began withdrawing, according to the proposal, NATO forces
would break off air strikes for 24 hours. If the Serb police and
army troops kept withdrawing, the 24-hour pause would be extended
as long as they kept pulling out, with peacekeepers moving in as
the Serb forces left.
</P>
<P>
   American and other allied officials reacted to the German plan
skeptically, but apparently agreed to see if the Russians would
help try it out on Belgrade. ``Nobody thinks it will work,'' an
American official said. ``First of all, Milosevic will never accept
it. But at this point, everybody is willing to try everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, James P. Rubin, State Department spokesman, said,
``The main point in the German plan that's relevant here is that
this would be done ideally by resolution of the Security Council,
which would be fine with us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Acceptance of a plan to surrender Kosovo to international
administration would mean, for the fiercely nationalist Milosevic,
giving up Serbian sovereignty over historically Serb territory,
something not even required in the plan he refused in negotiations
at Rambouillet Castle in France this winter.
</P>
<P>
   His refusal to accept that plan's proposals _ to leave the
province under Serbian sovereignty but give its 1.8 million
Albanians political and legal autonomy _ set off the NATO bombing
that began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   An outline of the original German plan released by the Foreign
Ministry in Bonn on Wednesday proposed an international
peacekeeping force under United Nations auspices that should be
``robust.'' The report said that the force should not be hamstrung
by the ``double key'' arrangements that made U.N. peacekeepers and
NATO forces unable to launch any military operations unless both
civilian officials and allied military officers agreed on them. But
no such language found its way into the European consensus
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the scenario outlined by Bonn, the peacekeepers from
participating countries could begin moving into Kosovo as the Serbs
withdrew from the province, and when the entire peacekeeping force
was in place, it would begin disarming and demilitarizing the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bonn plan also proposed that the international observers
sent in by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
last October and withdrawn just before the NATO bombing began last
month would go back in, ``under new conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied air forces would continue to patrol the skies and react
to Serb threats to security in Kosovo, the plan says, and the
nearly 20,000 allied soldiers planned for refugee relief operations
in Macedonia and Albania would receive other assignments yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   The European consensus did not stretch far enough to embrace the
entire proposal, but according to Schroeder, it did reaffirm plans
announced last week for the European Union to provide $160 million
for refugee relief and $107 million to Albania, Macedonia and
Montenegro to help them provide for the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who have fled to those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also said that the European Union would convene a
conference on southeastern Europe to consider ``further
comprehensive measures for the long-term stabilization, security,
democratization and economic reconstruction of the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the countries in the region have the right to aspire to
the European Union,'' he said. German officials believe that even
Serbia, if it turns to democracy and a free market economy, has the
same right, and hope that the perspective will eventually lead it
to change the disastrous course it has followed through the 1990s.

BRUINS FOCUSING ON THE PLAYOFF GAME, NOT THE OPPONENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Down the stretch they come, the regular season all but
in their dust, and now the Bruins look ahead to see the who, what,
and where of the playoffs coming up around the bend.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the Senators, the Devils, the Hurricanes? With the
regular season set to close Sunday, will the horses in the Eastern
Conference continue to careen off each other and reshuffle their
order of finish right to the wire?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care who we play,'' coach Pat Burns said after
Wednesday's practice in suburban Wilmington, a mantra torn from the
pages of the Coach's Guide and Handbook. ``I don't want to discuss
the playoffs. It's (not important) where we're going to finish _
it's how we're going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins visit the FleetCenter Thursday, the first of three
formidable opponents the Bruins will face in their
made-for-the-postseason tuneup. The Sabres are here for a Saturday
matinee and then the Bruins travel to Philly for a season wrapup
vs. the Flyers. All three opponents also are headed to the
playoffs, each one wondering who they'll draw in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the standings Wednesday morning, the Bruins would be
headed to Ottawa next week for a best-of-seven series vs. the quick
and nimble Senators. Only a slight reshuffling would have them
instead headed to Exit 16W to face the broad-shouldered Devils. If
they were to win all three of their final matches, then the
playoffs would find the Bruins in Greensboro, N.C., suiting up
against the former Forever .500s ( a.k.a. the Hurricanes).
</P>
<P>
   So here's what we know after 79 games of the regular season: the
Bruins are in the playoffs; otherwise, consult this space for
shift-to-shift updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottawa's got very stong goaltending,'' said Bruins netminder
Byron Dafoe, who'll be back in the pipes, in pursuit of his 31st
victory (and perhaps 11th shutout). ``In fact, that's one thing
they all have in common: great goaltending _ that's why they are
where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins only recently got their No. 1 netminder, Tom
Barrasso, back in action. They've been in a free fall for much of
the second half, due in part to Barrasso's broken hand (a cracked
bone near the wrist). If the Senators and Devils are the divisional
favorites, the Penguins rate as the darkhorse, the biggest hole in
their game closed by Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ottawa is a very skilled and talented team,'' said Dafoe,
assessing the field of the Bruins' prospective opponents.
``(Alexei) Yashin has had an unbelievable year. Then you go to New
Jersey, a big, strong, disciplined team. They're like a machine out
there _ all parts are moving in the same direction. Carolina's more
well-rounded than some people think, with a good offense and
(goaltender Arturs) Irbe doing just a great job in net.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you ask, `Who do you want to play?' What matters to me,
right now, is that we've got three games left with teams all around
us in the standings, and I'd love to win all three just to keep up
the momentum going into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have won five of their last six games, a run that
included a 5-2 triumph in Florida that clinched their second
consecutive trip to the postseason. They enter Thursday's action
with a 37-29-13 mark with a chance to win 40 games for the first
time since the 1995-96 season. To improve on their 91-point season
of 1997-98, they need to capture five of the six points available
in these three remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no soft or easy teams,'' said Ray Bourque, also
assessing the field of possibilities with three games to go. ``One
team may have more experience, another might have more speed or
skill, but you have to compete against all these teams. There are
some interesting matchups, be it first place vs. eighth, 2-7, 4-5,
2-3, what have you . . . and it's not going to be easy for
anyone.''

COMMENTARY: BUSH SPEAKS OUT ON FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``I believe we ought to be slow to engage our
military, slow to commit our troops,'' says Gov. George W. Bush,
``but when we do so, we must do so to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he think it was a mistake for President Clinton to say
specifically we would not send in ground troops?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do. I do. I think we ought to leave all options on the
table, but I think those tactical decisions ought to be made by
military planners and not by politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that include the option of massing NATO troops on the
borders of Kosovo? ``If that is what the military advisers
recommend, the answer would be yes.'' Bush cautioned that he did
not have the full intelligence at his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   What's our mission there? ``Our objective is to remove the
Serbian troops from Kosovo and have the Kosovars returned to their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Remove Slobodan Milosevic from office? ``I think he ought to be
treated as a war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence for Kosovo? ``I do not believe that ought to be the
immediate objective. It could be a long-term objective, but not the
short-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are we involved in this, anyway? ``The actions of Milosevic
are destabilizing, and a stable Europe is in America's best
strategic interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's staff had failed to warn him that the stated
purpose of my visit was to examine his foreign-policy views, he
could not very well throw me out of his office. So he gulped and
took the plunge that he mistakenly thought would be premature.
</P>
<P>
   Should we urge admission of China to the World Trade
Organization? ``I believe that if we were to turn our backs on
China, on an entrepreneurial class that is just beginning to grow
there, it would be a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The theft of nuclear secrets, the illegal Chinese campaign
contributions _ that doesn't upset him? ``Sure, I am upset about
that. . . . That does not necessarily say that we should stop
trading if it is good for American producers and good for American
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   No retaliation for that, or for the crackdown on human rights in
China? ``Do I think we ought to sanction trade as a result of that?
No, I don't, is my answer to the question. . . . I think we ought
to be very careful about the application of unilateral sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Should we tie admission of China to the WTO to Taiwan's
admission, on the same basis as Hong Kong? ``No, I would not. I
would hope, expect, Taiwan to come in at some point in time, but I
would not have tied it in as a condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting my visible dismay, the Texas governor added: ``We need to
make sure that China understands there are limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush thinks Clinton sent a ``mixed signal'' in crossing the
Pacific to visit only China last year. ``The president should visit
our friends. China is not our friend in the Far East. Our friends
are Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. He didn't visit our friends. I
think it is important that we maintain our friendships and always
remember who our friends are.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought us to Israel. I recalled how both his father,
President Bush, and President Clinton made clear their preference
for Labor over Likud in past Israeli elections. How about him? ``I
don't think Americans ought to be picking sides when it comes to
Israeli elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem? ``Peace has to be negotiated
between the parties involved. And I am confident that they are
going to be able to resolve Jerusalem in a way with which the
Israelis are comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great trip to Israel,'' he went on, relaxing for the
first time. ``I had a very good visit with Benjamin Netanyahu and
with Ariel Sharon. I met the opposition leader, Ehud Barak, who is
now running for prime minister. It was a great experience. I saw
the Arrow missile system in action, an intermediate-range
anti-ballistic-missile system that works, much of it funded by us.
It will help prevent our friend and us from being blackmailed.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm out of space. Next column: ``George Dubyuh'' on Russia and
the IMF, the ABM treaty, Iraq, Iran, North Korea and the
foreign-policy split in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidate says, ``I've been studying up.''

GRIER AFTER HIGHER PICK IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bobby Grier has spent the last several weeks
watching a lot of video of Ricky Williams amd Edgerrin James. But
it appears somewhere in the tape rack, Grier has slipped a tape or
two of Mark McGwire because it's obvious following Wednesday's
predraft press conference at Foxboro Stadium that Grier wants and
needs to hit a home run with Saturday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, who is in control of the 20th and 28th picks in the first
round, confirmed what had been reported the past 10 days _ that he
is trying to move up, ideally to Washington's fifth spot, where he
could take a running back such as Williams of Texas or James of
Miami. Grier said he thinks his chances of doing so are
``reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he's had talks with teams below Washington to trade
up and fill needs other than running back, which is a glaring hole
because of Robert Edwards's career-threatening knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots move up to five, they should have a clear shot
at James. And if the Indianapolis Colts, who draft fourth, decide
to draft a defensive player, which they desperately need, Williams
also could fall to five.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland still could have a say about that, though. The Browns,
at No. 1, are trying to feel out negotiations with Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch and if they think they won't be able to sign
him, the Browns may look to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he's talked with Washington general manager Charlie
Casserly several times over the past week, most recently last
weekend. Casserly confirmed that he had talked to Grier, but the
Redskins are saying they don't think there's much chance of a deal
coming about. Washington reportedly has interest in defensive
back/receiver Champ Bailey of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens, who pick 10th, had talked about swapping
picks with the Redskins so they could take a quarterback, but it
appears they'll still be able to take a quarterback or a top
receiver if they stay put.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams, who pick sixth and also covet Williams, also
are trying to swap spots with the Redskins. And the New Orleans
Saints have offered their entire draft and possibly their No. 1
pick next year.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, however, feels he might be able to top the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two No. 1 picks, a second-round pick, and two
third-rounders,'' said Grier. ``The Saints have only one
first-round pick and no second-round pick.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first three rounds, the Patriots have the 20th, 28th,
53d, 84th, and 93d picks while the Saints have the 12th and 73d.
Grier also spoke of possibly giving up a first-round pick next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're willing to expend picks is because the two
running backs are exceptional,'' said Grier. Last year, the
Patriots tried to move up to Oakland's fourth spot to take Charles
Woodson but the price was too high. Ditto with the Bears' No. 5
slot for Curtis Enis.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who obviously would require a major contract (Woodson
received an $8 million signing bonus last season), would be a great
fit in New England because he loves Boston and has many friends in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said that he saw little difference between Enis, Fred
Taylor, and Robert Edwards a year ago, but this year Williams and
James are head and shoulders above the pack. Grier said if the team
didn't draft Williams or James, they would likely fill other needs
in the first round and think about a running back later on. He said
the second tier of running backs is led by LSU's Kevin Faulk,
Mississippi State's J.J. Johnson, and Boston College's Mike Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Grier, who is in charge of the Patriots' draft picks for the
third year following the Bill Parcells era, said he doesn't feel
any added pressure to make the right choices in this draft just
because the 28th pick is the final compensation pick from the Jets
for Parcells. He said of the four players already chosen as
Parcells compensation, ``Damon Denson has a chance to be a starter
for us'' and of wide receiver Tony Simmons, ``there was only one
player better'' that being Randy Moss, whom Grier had taken off his
draft board. The other Parcells picks were Sedrick Shaw, who has
been a bust, and Greg Spires, a situational pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Grier also may be willing to give up a veteran player or two to
sweeten a deal with the Redskins. The Patriots probably won't be
able to sign both Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy, and with the team
looking to open a spot in the defensive secondary for Tebucky
Jones, Milloy might be made available.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said that teams haven't asked for specific players yet,
but ``we haven't closed the door on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier is close to closing the door on any chance of acquiring
Colts running back Marshall Faulk, who is being shopped to several
teams, but not the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to make a deal within the division,'' said
Grier. He did say, however, he may try to work a deal for a running
back if he can't get Williams or James in the draft. Adrian Murrell
of the Arizona Cardinals is on the market.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots stay put, they likely will try to fill needs on
both lines with their first-round picks and possibly go for a back
in the second or third rounds.

FLEET EARNINGS RISE 36 PERCENT IN FIRST QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Striding into its planned merger with BankBoston Corp.
on a solid footing, Fleet Financial Group Inc. reported a strong 36
percent rise in first quarter earnings Wednesday, exceeding Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The growth, which the Boston-based bank attributed to recent
acquisitions in the credit card and asset-based lending businesses,
pleased industry analysts, who said New England's largest bank was
a bulwark of strength and set to grow more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were strong earnings across the board and they set the
foundation for the merger going forward,'' said Carla A. D'Arista
of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. Fleet is acquiring BankBoston
to form the nation's eighth-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three months of 1999, Fleet said net income rose
to a record $438 million, or $0.72 per share, from $323 million, or
$0.53 a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat estimates of $0.69 a share by First Call Corp.,
the Boston-based company that compiles analysts' predictions. For a
regional bank, such a margin of outperformance is impressive,
analyst Edward Najarian of Wheat First Union said.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the first quarter of 1998 were depressed by a $44
million charge _ equivalent to $0.07 a share _ from Fleet's
acquisitions of discount brokerage Quick &AMP; Reilly Group Inc. and
the credit-card operations of Advanta Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But Fleet, like many other major banks, still had strong growth
in the most recent quarter _ evidence that the bank's strategy of
branching out into financial services is succeeding. ``It was a
spectacular quarter,'' Fleet's chief executive, Terrence Murray,
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the latest period rose 21 percent to $1.9 billion,
fueled by Fleet's recent acquisition of Sanwa Bank Ltd's US leasing
and lending company. Net interest income grew 11 percent to $1
billion, driven by Sanwa and the acquisition of $1.3 billion in
credit-card receivables from Household International Inc. in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, revenue from credit-card operations rose sixfold to $30
million, while earnings from Quick &AMP; Reilly nearly doubled to $47
million. The brokerage's earnings include revenue from Fleet's
market-making specialist unit, acquired from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
last year.
</P>
<P>
   One fly in Fleet's champagne glass last quarter was a rise in
the company's charge-off ratio _ essentially, bad consumer debt
that the bank writes off. Fleet's ratio increased to a relatively
high 7.4, equivalent to around $12.7 billion in written-off debt,
D'Arista said. Fleet, now the nation's ninth-largest bank, with
$104 billion in assets, is also struggling with a lawsuit against
Advanta, which it claims overcharged Fleet for its credit-card
receivables.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet shares, which fell immediately after the BankBoston merger
was announced but have since risen, nudged up 3/8 Wednesday to
close at 43 7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said
Fleet's stock price underestimates the value of Quick &AMP; Reilly,
which operates SureTrade, an on-line brokerage that Fleet started
18 months ago and now wants to spin off. Najarian said Quick &AMP;
Reilly could be worth anywhere from $5 billion to $8 billion _
figures he said could boost Fleet's stock price by at least 20
percent.

 &HT;    GINGRICH ALMOST HELD BACK 'BIG BANG'
 &HT;    With BEGINNING.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Producers of a new Smithsonian Institution
educational movie on the origin of the universe almost banned the
words ``Big Bang'' and ``evolution'' from the script for fear they
could keep the movie from being shown in the South.
</P>
<P>
   In its final form, the movie, ``Cosmic Voyage,'' does refer to
those sometimes controversial ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But fear of how ``Newt Gingrich Republicans'' might respond
caused Smithsonian officials to temporarily ban the terms from the
script, said Joel Primack, a professor of physics at the University
of California, Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was produced to be shown in specialty theaters such as
the Smithsonian's own Imax facility, which features a huge
wraparound screen and sophisticated sound system to create ``being
there'' sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Primack presided Wednesday over a scientific conference in which
cosmologists and theologians discussed the origin of the universe.
During a break, he recalled his involvement in initial work to
create the movie in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was right after the Newt Gingrich Republicans had taken
over the House and the Senate in 1994,'' he said, ``and one of the
first things that this new Republican majority did was go after the
head of the Air and Space Museum, Martin Harwit.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwit, the first astronomer ever named to head the
Smithsonian's popular space museum, resigned in the aftermath of
veteran organizations' displeasure over the tone of a planned
exhibit of the Enola Gay, the B-29 bomber that dropped a nuclear
weapon on Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Primack said at one point, questions were raised over whether a
movie that contained references to the hypothesized spontaneous
creation of the universe in the ``Big Bang'' or the Darwinian
evolution of life on Earth ``could ever be shown in the American
South.''
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere dominated by fear because of Harwit's
resignation, Smithsonian officials told scientists working on the
script to leave the two terms out.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Primack said, ``things calmed down and the people in
charge had a little bit more courage than before, and we went back
into the script and made it a little bit closer to what we had in
mind.''

US SETS SIGHTS ON MILOSEVIC FINANCIAL ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ UN sanctions may have crippled Serbia's
economy, but Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his inner
circle have become multimillionaires through their control of
state-controlled monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia gathers steam, US
officials say they have secretly stepped up their efforts to locate
and seize those assets from overseas accounts in Russia Greece,
Cyprus and elsewhere. They say they believe Milosevic's illicit
financial empire _ which they describe as ``Serbia Inc.'' _ is
being used to finance Serbia's war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at ways to increase pressure economically and
financially on Milosevic,'' said a senior US official familiar with
the covert effort. ``We intend to undercut his ability to conduct
military operations and sustain and maintain his national
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The covert operation is aimed at cutting off Serbia's ability to
buy weapons and jet fuel, feed troops, repair tanks and power their
radar systems. It has also provided grist for NATO propagandists
seeking to portray Milosevic, his family and his inner circle as
corrupt scam artists with little concern for the hardships faced by
ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say American intelligence agencies, preoccupied
with the hunt for war criminals and the security of American forces
in the Balkans, have missed countless opportunities to cut into the
Serb leader's war chest. They said numerous initial requests to the
CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency by US Ambassador Robert Gelbard
_ who has spearheaded the administration's hunt for Milosevic's
assets _ yielded little.
</P>
<P>
   But an official familiar with the operation has received growing
support during the last year from high-level administration
officials, the Treasury Department and the three key US
intelligence agencies _ the CIA, the DIA and the National Security
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence has uncovered evidence that Milosevic's brother,
Boris Borislav, the Yugoslav ambassador to Moscow, and Serbian
banker Bogoljub Karic, have laundered hundreds of millions through
several banks in Russia, including the Moscow based branch of
Karic's bank, according to a US official familiar with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karic is a key board member of Serbia Inc.'' the official
said. ``We will get them,'' said an administration official
involved in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   US and British officials say they also have evidence of money
laundering in Greece and Cyprus. But Washington has been reluctant
to disclose details that would embarrass the Cypriot government
when it was engaged in a diplomatic effort to free three American
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Former US diplomats and intelligence officials say that efforts
to financially squeeze Milosevic has been painstaking. Tracking the
flow of illicit money through the secretive international banking
and financial system is extremely difficult. And Washington's
attitude toward Milosevic _ who was instrumental in negotiating an
end to the Bosnian war at Dayton, Ohio _ frequently shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has always been ambivalent'' about how
aggressively it should pursue Milosevic, said a former US
intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has been able to take advantage of that ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, several months before Milosevic began his military
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels, the West allowed the
Serbian regime to obtain billions of dollars through the sale of
private assets.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a joint venture by two NATO allies _ OTE Telecom
of Greece and Telecom Italia _ purchased 49 percent of the Belgrade
state telephone company for $880 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was handled by an investment bank from Britain, NatWest
while the American accountancy firm Price Waterhouse advised the
Serbian communications ministry, according to Pyramid Research of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade claimed to use the money to pay pensions, and to reform
the postal and telecommunications infrastructure, according to
Julie Altman, a telecommunications analyst at Pyramid. But she said
it was impossible to determine how the money was spent.
</P>
<P>
   Others suspect the money helped finance the military's offensive
in Kosovo in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been his war kitty,'' said Mark Kirk, a staffer at
the Republican House International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Britain has disclosed details on the web of
offshore holdings that have kept Milosevic in power. Relying on
American intelligence, Britain's Foreign Minister Robin Cook said
that Milosevic stashed millions in offshore banks, and purchased
villas in Corfu, Crete and Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Milosevic's son, Marko, is sitting out the war in a
villa in Greece. Marko Milosevic own a bakery, a duty-free import
business and the Madonna discoteque in Pozarevac, Milosevic's home
town.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Maria, owns a radio station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the people of Serbia how much wealth you have sucked out
of Serbia during the same years they have been impoverished,'' Cook
said on April 7. ``Let them see the luxury yacht you keep in Greece
while they struggle to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Britain's Defense Minister George Robertson identified
key government ministers who have been rewarded for their loyalty
to Milosevic with lucrative state monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Marjanovic, the prime minister of Serbia, is president of
the country's natural gas monopoly, Progress.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola Sainovic, the deputy prime minister of the federal
republic of Yugoslavia, heads the RTB Bor Copper Mine. And Dragan
Tomic, the speaker of the parliament, is director of NIS
Jugopetrol, which has a near monopoly on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption and nepotism,'' Robertson said ``are...the cancer
at the heart of Milosevic's empire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He corrupted the system,'' said Milan Panic, a California
pharmaceuticals executive and former Yugoslav prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each minister is also the manager of a large business. Some of
them were decent people before he corrupted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Panic said Milosevic recently confiscated more than $170 million
in assets from a Belgrade-based subsidiary of his pharmaceuticals
company, ICN.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money all went into financing Milosevic's adventures such
as the Kosovo war,'' said Panic. ``He is draining the last of our
economic resources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Panic said that he believes Milosevic is running out of
money. He said that senior Russian officials have warned that they
would stop selling him fuel unless he paid his bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you are going to find billions of dollars in his
accounts,'' he said. ``I would let him have all the money if he
would just resign and leave the country.''

SENATORS DEBATE OLYMPIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Olympic scandal moved to Capitol Hill
Wednesday, as frustrated senators wrestled with how quickly they
should use the US tax code and other laws to force reforms on the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee, a consensus
appeared to emerge that it would be a mistake to take immediate
action on proposals that would dramatically alter Olympic financing
mechanisms and weaken the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Among those proposals are stripping the IOC's tax-exempt status,
denying tax deductions to its corporate sponsors, and redirecting
lucrative television rights fees to its US affiliate, the United
States Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the worst thing at this moment is to threaten some
kind of Draconian measure,'' said committee chairman John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican from Arizona echoed the hearing's lead witness,
former Senate majority leader George Mitchell, who said rash action
by Congress could derail the IOC's internal reform process and
jeopardize funding for athletes. Mitchell served as chairman of an
independent ethics commission assembled by the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of McCain's colleagues were willing to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we all waiting on?'' asked Ernest Hollings, a
Democrat from South Carolina, who was among several senators
calling for the ouster of IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. In
a reference to the IOC's home city in Switzerland, Hollings
demanded, ``Heavens above, we've got to . . . clean up Lausanne.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollings then implored his old friend Mitchell to drop the
diplomatic role of Northern Ireland peacemaker and ``give us some
marching orders here and tell us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell demurred, saying, ``I don't believe one can fairly
make a conclusion at this time on whether legislation should be
enacted.'' He said Congress should give the IOC until the end of
this year to clean house with help from a reform panel called IOC
2000, whose newly appointed members include Henry Kissinger and the
organizer of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Peter
Ueberroth.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing marked the most notable response by Congress
to allegations of bribery and influence peddling surrounding the
choice of Salt Lake City as host of the 2002 Winter Games. Ten IOC
members have resigned or been expelled in the worst scandal in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   While committee members generally supported a methodical
approach to enacting laws that would affect the IOC's primary
funding source _ an estimated 60 percent of Olympic revenues come
from the United States _ there was widespread support for
immediately including the IOC under the chief US law against
bribery of foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that by the end of the day he would file legislation
to amend the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to include a ban on
bribery of IOC members. Mitchell's commission and the USOC last
month recommended that President Clinton issue an executive order
applying the bribery law to the IOC, but Justice Department
officials have said privately they doubted it could be done as the
statute is now written, making action by Congress necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sharpest moments of the hearing came when McCain
peppered IOC members Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton, both US
citizens, with questions about the IOC's willingness to accept the
Mitchell commission's recipe for reform, including term limits for
IOC members; election of IOC members by national Olympic
committees; and immediate public release of IOC meeting minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Other than term limits, which they both supported, one or the
other expressed reservations or opposition to the rest of the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain appeared particularly angered by DeFrantz's support for
keeping IOC meeting minutes secret for 10 to 20 years, which she
said was necessary to protect IOC members in their home countries.
McCain said DeFrantz's position ``flies in the face of everything
I've ever thought in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz and Easton appeared in place of Samaranch, who declined
McCain's invitation to attend. Easton confined his remarks to an
apology to McCain, whom Easton had suggested was using the issue as
a publicity ploy for his presidential aspirations. McCain accepted
the apology.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had warm praise for another witness, USOC president Bill
Hybl, whose organization McCain said had accepted its share of
blame for the Salt Lake City mess and responded quickly to the
Mitchell commission's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Though most senators on McCain's committee appeared content to
withhold judgment on laws affecting the IOC's financial status, not
all members of Congress are so inclined. On Monday, two
representatives from New York, Democrat Henry A. Waxman and
Republican Rick Lazio introduced a bill to ban US corporations and
individuals from financially supporting the IOC until it adopts the
Mitchell commission's recommendations.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ All Carl Dahlberg wants is for people driving down
Sunset Boulevard to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   As the concerned father of an 18-month-old boy, Dahlberg worries
so much that he sometimes rushes out into the street waving his
arms to make drivers hit their brakes in West University Place, a
Houston suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become sort of a racetrack out there,'' said Dahlberg, a
physician specializing in pulmonary problems. ``The speed limit's
30 miles an hour, and these people are going 40 or 50. We almost
had a child hit out there six months ago, and I've been at my wits'
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by what they consider the suburb's inability to
reduce speeds along one block of Sunset _ a stretch used as a
shortcut by many drivers _ Dahlberg and his neighbors went further
and posted their own yellow signs along the curbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children at play,'' the signs stated.
</P>
<P>
   But West University police, enforcing an ordinance aimed at
keeping signs for political candidates from decorating roadways,
informed residents the signs had to be moved out of the public
right of way.
</P>
<P>
   That meant repositioning the small signs on the sides of the
sidewalks farthest from the street _ in places where they were less
visible to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile,'' Dahlberg said, ``the speeders got even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   That led residents to move their signs back out to the curbline,
which promptly earned them warning tickets from police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Police Department does what they're supposed to do, and
they asked (residents) to move their signs,'' City Manager Sherman
Yehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers wrote tickets, Yehl said, because other Sunset
Boulevard residents complained about the signs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for about a year, the people who put up the signs
have been writing increasingly harsh letters to the city and
circulating petitions containing dozens of signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Yehl, saying the city lacks the ability to watch Sunset
Boulevard around the clock, indicated some plans are under way to
force motorists to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   One approach might be ``traffic bubble-out curbs,'' which narrow
the width of streets and make it difficult to go too fast, Yehl
said.
</P>
<P>
   If police begin handing out real tickets to sign-posting Sunset
Boulevard residents, one of them, attorney Steve Monks, is prepared
to go to court and battle on behalf of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give them discounts,'' he promised.

BACK IN THE FRAY, YELTSIN SHOWS HIS ENEMIES WHO'S BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Just a week ago, things were looking dire for President
Boris Yeltsin. The Communist opposition had set a date for his
impeachment. A fast-moving corruption inquiry was knocking on the
gates of the Kremlin itself. NATO bombs over Yugoslavia threatened
to damage not only Russia's relations with the West, but also the
tenets of the country's fragile democracy.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Yeltsin, always at his best when things could
not be worse, returned to the fray. Back in the Kremlin after a
long convalescence, the 68-year-old president held a series of
meetings, rattled a few sabers, floated a few rumors and dropped a
few hints, all intended to prove once again that for all his
physical and political weaknesses, he is still boss.
</P>
<P>
   It may be only a passing victory, but for the moment anyway,
Yeltsin's opponents seem to have been disarmed. The impeachment
drive has been slowed, if not stalled. The corruption inquiry looks
headed for an impasse, as top Russian politicians, after heavy
wooing by the Kremlin, back away from their support for Yuri
Skuratov, the prosecutor under fire who has been enlisted by
anti-Yeltsin forces.
</P>
<P>
   And so far Yeltsin seems to have managed to ride the tiger of
Russia's anti-Western mood long enough to stay ahead of his more
bellicose opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, Yeltsin has been helped by the ineptitude of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that he is such a brilliant chess player,'' said
Leonid Radzikhovsky, a political commentator for the newspaper
Sevodnya. ``It is just that it's easy to win when your opponents
can't tell the difference between a pawn and a knight.''
</P>
<P>
   As a lame-duck president with one year left in his term, Yeltsin
these days is not looking to stage a comeback. His popularity
ratings are so low he probably couldn't be elected to the City
Council in Yekaterinburg, his hometown. But he is intent on keeping
power _ always the name of the game in Russian politics _ and in so
doing, has emerged once again as the key defender of Russia's
hard-won democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a charismatic leader anymore, to put it mildly, and
there is great popular resentment against him, but it is clear that
we need to hold on to Yeltsin as long as possible so as not to
allow these other fools to take his place,'' Otto Latsis, a veteran
political commentator, said in an interview. ``Whether he is
defending himself or his record, the situation is the same: The
defender of liberal ideas in Russia is still above all Yeltsin.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or for worse, he might have added. Like many
liberals, Latsis saw his faith in his president severely damaged by
the war in Chechnya. For others, the Yeltsin era will be forever
blighted by the rampant corruption and abuses of power openly
tolerated by the Kremlin in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent public statements, Yeltsin has again confirmed his
credentials as a democrat, ruling out the abolition of direct
elections of Russia's regional governors and a ban on the Communist
Party, and defending _ as he always has _ the freedom of Russia's
unruly press.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the financial collapse last summer, a majority of
Russians are just plain bitter _ bitter about being poor, and now
after NATO's show of strength in the Balkans, bitter about being
weak. Wages in Russia are now on average 71.8 percent of what they
were a year ago, and a staggering 38.2 percent of the people are
living beneath the poverty line, compared with 22.4 percent in the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Given this sour mood, nobody would declare an end to Russia's
recurrent political warfare, let alone predict how it will turn
out. If anything, with parliamentary elections just eight months
away, the fight has moved to a new and increasingly intense phase.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Yeltsin's recent remarks, his fears for a reversal
in the course he set for Russia since 1991 now rest not so much in
the Communist-dominated Parliament but in the government of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the former foreign minister whom he
himself appointed last September.
</P>
<P>
   The friction between Primakov and Yeltsin is now an open secret,
after Yeltsin stated publicly last week that his prime minister was
``useful'' _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, we will see,'' he said, raising the specter of yet
another government shuffle that would likely produce a dangerous
confrontation between the president and Parliament, as occurred in
1993. A less radical option would be the replacement of the two
Communist ministers in Primakov's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying theories for Yeltsin's displeasure with
Primakov. One holds that Yeltsin is simply jealous of Primakov's
popularity (the prime minister is Russia's most trusted leader,
according to opinion polls) and his stature, both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But another theory, more widely held, has to do with the growing
suspicion that Primakov's alliance with Yeltsin's Communist
opposition _ the basis of a much vaunted political stability that
has been Primakov's main achievement _ is not just tactical, but
rather a strategic platform for the coming elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He is afraid to leave this government in place until the
elections, allowing it to draw more and more money for the
Communists in the agrarian and military-industrial sector,'' said
Radzikhovsky, who has written that Yeltsin's quandary in his last
year is how to thwart his longtime opponents from legally usurping
his historic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has also publicly revealed his uneasiness with
Primakov's political instincts, which at times seem more in line
with a Soviet-era apparatchik than a post-Communist politician. The
prime minister's loyalty to the president has also seemed at times
sluggish: It wasn't until last Saturday that Primakov came out
openly against impeachment, and for the ouster of Skuratov, whose
future is to be decided next week by the Russian Parliament's upper
house.
</P>
<P>
   With his reminder that Primakov serves at the pleasure of the
president, Yeltsin sent out a heavy-handed signal. That signal was
reinforced on Tuesday by a lengthy meeting with Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
of Moscow, a leading contender for the presidency in next year's
elections, who after months of chilly relations has emerged the
Kremlin's favorite heir apparent _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentators noted that Yeltsin has already enlisted
the support of Luzhkov, who on Tuesday denounced the attempts to
impeach the president. His next move, some predicted, could be to
join other members of Parliament's upper house in withdrawing their
support for Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Yeltsin seemed on his way to putting his house back
in some kind of order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panicky sensation of losing the last chance to keep power
that has long tormented the presidential strategists has given way
to some wholly sensible actions,'' Yelena Tregubova wrote in the
newspaper Kommersant on Wednesday.

YUGOSLAV PUBLISHER'S MURDER SEEN AS ATTACK ON INDEPENDENT
JOURNALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ About 1,000 citizens of Belgrade came out
Wednesday to bury Slavko Curuvija, an independent publisher who was
assassinated Sunday. As air raid sirens sounded their own peculiar
dirge through the lime and chestnut trees, his mourners tried to
take courage from one another's public presence _ their refusal to
be intimidated in a troubled time.
</P>
<P>
   Tears were mixed with wariness, as many of those who went to
Novo Groblje, Belgrade's main cemetery, quietly wondered if the
killing of Curuvija would be the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a political killing, aimed at independent
journalism,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the opposition
Democratic Party. ``But it was also aimed at spreading fear across
democratic Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija, the publisher of the daily newspaper Dnevni Telegraf
and the biweekly magazine Evropljanin, was killed in front of his
apartment building on Orthodox Easter as he was returning from
lunch with Branka Prpa, a well-known historian.
</P>
<P>
   Two men in black leather jackets shot him in the back,
pistol-whipped Ms. Prpa, and then, as he lay face down on the
ground, shot him again in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija, 50, was under a suspended five-month prison sentence
for violating Serbia's draconian press law, passed in October, and
the state television and the tabloid Politika Ekspres falsely
accused him of favoring NATO's bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid quoted Mirjana Markovic, the wife of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, as saying that ``the owner of a
Belgrade daily newspaper said he supports the United States in its
desire to bomb Serbia.'' The writer of the article then continued,
``This is, of course, Slavko Curuvija.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These commentaries were like a death sentence,'' said a senior
Serb journalist at the funeral. Curuvija, who had become a man of
means, was once close to Ms. Markovic. But he took his publications
down an increasingly independent, serious and outspoken path.
</P>
<P>
   Veran Matic, the editor in chief of the once-independent radio
station B92 _ taken over last week by the Milosevic government _
said Curuvija's slaying ``was meant to be an example to anyone who
intended to take the same road.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic said he believed that the killing would boomerang,
reminding Serbs that free speech can be easily lost. But the true
effects can be only when NATO's bombings stop, he said, because it
is almost impossible to criticize the Milosevic government while it
is defending the country from outside aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all collateral damage from NATO's bombs _ Curuvija, B92,
the democrats,'' said another senior editor of B92. Curuvija
himself, before he died, spoke against the bombing and bemoaned the
inability of democrats and dissidents to speak out during what he
called ``this war fever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that many people would be too afraid to come''
to the funeral, said Aleksandara Joksinovic, an official of the
Democratic Party. ``It's a horrible, tragic moment, but I'm glad
people were not afraid to show their disgust at such brutality.
This killing really was too much, to eliminate people with
different opinions while the country is at war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against the bombs, of course. But Serbs must be united
against the aggression, not fighting one another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is a point made with increasing urgency in the last few
days by the most liberal member of Milosevic's government, Deputy
Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, who has been the only official voice
condemning Curuvija's slaying and the manipulation of patriotism
for the political advantage of ultranationalists and leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has also condemned Parliament's vote to bind
Yugoslavia in an ill-defined union with Russia and Belarus,
attacking those who would return Yugoslavia to the failed
anachronism of communism.
</P>
<P>
   But as this funeral took place, across town at his presidential
palace, Milosevic was greeting autocratic president of Belarus,
Alexander Lukashenko, with a red carpet and a big fraternal hug. It
was the first time journalists had seen Milosevic in person since
the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting, Lukashenko said that Milosevic remained
opposed to any foreign soldiers entering Kosovo under a peace
settlement, and that Yugoslavia would accept civilian peacekeepers
under a United Nations banner, and only if none came from NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion is so far from NATO's demands for an armed
international security force with a NATO core as to be a
non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic did not attend the funeral, but his wife, Danica, was
there, along with other opposition party leaders like Vuk Obradovic
of the Social Democrats and Vladan Batic of the Christian
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the small chapel, where wreaths of white calla
lilies, tulips, jonquils and carnations were mounded around the
coffin, Liljana Smajlovic, the foreign editor of Evropljanin,
remembered Curuvija's last staff meeting on the day the bombing
began, March 24, when he suspended publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember two things Slavko Curuvija said: He would
not publish newspapers for the censors, and second, that NATO's
aggression against Yugoslavia was illegal, illegitimate and
immoral,'' Ms. Smajlovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brave man,'' she said, ``braver than those who shot
him in the back like cowards, and braver than those who bombed him
from the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking over the coffin at Curuvija's gravesite, as reporters
and mourners jostled each other on the jumbled tombstones of
others, Voja Zanetic, an editor of the Dnevni Telegraf, said, ``It
is impossible to describe today's situation in a headline, or even
in an entire newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   As he put copies of Curuvija's publications into the grave and
weeping family members bent to toss clods of earth onto the coffin,
Zanetic called the spot ``holy ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Then workers in blue overalls, with ``Public Enterprise,
Belgrade Cemeteries,'' embroidered on their pockets, filled in the
grave, their shovels clanging against marble and granite. As some
sobbed and others turned away, the workers heaped the memorial
wreaths and bouquets for Curuvija on top of the raw grave, until
the pile of flowers rose above the headstones.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked along, another senior Serbian journalist noted that
few of the mourners were wearing the target logo that has become de
rigueur at anti-NATO rallies. ``This is normal Belgrade,'' he said,
gesturing to the crowd. ``In a way, this is a funeral for normal
Belgrade.'' But he, too, mournfully, asked a reporter not to print
his name.
</P>
<P>
   The war was not far away. On the outer wall of the cemetery,
next to Curuvija's death notice, there was another, announcing the
death of Bandur Mihajlo, known as Miki.
</P>
<P>
   Mihjalo, the notice said, died April 8, aged 25. ``You died
bravely defending the homeland, our dear and beloved son,'' the
notice read. It was signed by his father, Stevan, and his mother,
Milka, and it bore a picture of a baby-faced Mihjalo, his hair
shorn, in his uniform.

INDIA'S HINDU COALITION LOSES MAJORITY   IN PARLIAMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The Hindu nationalist-led coalition that has
governed India for the past year lost its parliamentary majority
Thursday when its largest coalition partner, a state party from
Tamil Nadu headed by the temperamental former actress Jayalalitha
Jayaram, formally withdrew its support.
</P>
<P>
   President K.R. Narayanan, after meeting with Jayalalitha _ who
is known here by her first name _ and leaders of the opposition,
directed the government to seek a confidence vote in Parliament.
Narayanan did not set a deadline for the vote. Parliament
reconvenes Thursday after a recess to take up the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government asks for the lower house of Parliament to
begin considering the confidence motion right away, there would
probably be several days of floor debate before a vote that gave
both the incumbent government and those who sought to oust it, time
to bargain for the votes it would take to win.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where political power has splintered, and regional
and caste parties now hold the balance of votes needed to govern,
it has proved very difficult to put together a stable, lasting
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who heads the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said Wednesday that he was
confident his ruling coalition would stay in power, but that to do
so his government would have to win over a handful of tiny, fickle
political parties that are now playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition Congress Party, which has dominated
Indian politics for most of the past 50 years but now has the
second-largest block of votes, said they will try to cobble
together a new majority.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has presented itself as the party that will champion a
secular approach to governing that serves all of India's religions
and castes, in contrast to the Hindu nationalists, whom Congress
accuses of playing on religious differences for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress succeeds, its coalition would probably wind up
depending on the same Jayalalitha who is facing numerous charges of
corruption and who has made the current government's life miserable
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, she had harshly and repeatedly criticized the
government of which she was a part for an ever-shifting set of
reasons, most recently for refusing to get rid of the defense
minister, George Fernandes, who had been accused of corruption by
the fired naval chief, Adm. Vishnu Bhagwat.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' willingness to put together a new coalition marks a
shift in strategy. Sonia Gandhi, president of the party, had taken
the position that it would be better if the party could rebuild
both its grass-roots organization and its vote base in Parliament
before reclaiming power.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, the enigmatic Mrs. Gandhi _ who usually lets
other politicians come to her _ visited a reception in honor of
Jayalalitha, who heads the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham. The two women are expected to meet again soon to talk
over the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Congress can put together a majority
coalition. There are serious conflicts within the opposition. For
example, officials in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have
said they will have no part of any coalition that has Jayalalitha
as a member.
</P>
<P>
   But Jayalalitha met with leaders of the Communist party
Wednesday. Afterwards, smiling, she said coyly to the throngs of
waiting reporters, ``Why are you so sure AIADMK wants to be part of
the new coalition?''
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha is now holding court in the largest suite at the
Maurya Sheraton Hotel. Her former allies seem to be taking the
opportunity to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   A grim-faced Venkaiah Naidu, spokesman for the Bharatiya Janata
Party, accused her of betrayal and of conspiring with the Congress
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will succeed in defeating the game plan of our political
rivals,'' he vowed.

   OSAKA, Japan _ Shigeru Ishimura was hard at work at his father's
bankrupt welding company when he heard a groan coming from across
the small yard that separated the office from the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing down his tools, he ran to his father's office. What he
saw there last Sept. 16 is etched into his memory as if by acid.
His uncle was slumped on the floor, a knife sticking out of his
belly. His father's hand was wrapped around the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the recession strangling Japan's economy is playing
out in personal tragedies, as business owners struggle to keep
their companies afloat, workers find themselves jobless and
housewives wrestle to stretch shrinking family budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these private epics ever surface, however. Japanese take
pride in their ability to endure suffering while presenting a
serene face to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the Ishimura family offers a rare window on the
private anguish inflicted by a prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost unheard of for Japanese to speak openly about
matters that shame them and their families. The Ishimuras
repeatedly resisted speaking to a reporter, who finally convinced
them to share their story after attending a trial session and
meeting their lawyer. Shigeru said he decided to speak out in hopes
of explaining what his father did and because he felt he had
nothing more to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Murders, though increasing, are rare _ only 1,338 in 1998, in a
population of some 125 million _ and fratricide is usually little
more than the stuff of bad samurai dramas. But for the Ishimuras,
the strains imposed by the recession exploded into just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives have turned 180 degrees,'' said Kinoku Ishimura,
Shigeru's mother. ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her days now revolve around visiting her husband, Satomi, in
prison, where he awaits trial for killing his brother, Kagenori.
</P>
<P>
   The daily visits are heart-breaking. Her husband is frail and
cries frequently. Listening to an employee who was at the scene of
the murder testify in February, Satomi spent the whole court
session shaking his downcast head and grimacing in apparent horror
at the description of his own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mrs. Ishimura takes heart that he is crying at all. ``His
tears have come back, and he's remembering critical moments of the
incident,'' she said. ``I think that's positive. At the beginning,
he could not even cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearings are held about once a month in Osaka before a judge who
will determine Satomi's fate. Murder can be punished by death in
Japan, but it is unlikely in this case, lawyers said, given that
this was Satomi's first crime and that he has a long history as an
upstanding citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Satomi Ishimura once epitomized the Japanese economic
miracle. Koyo Welding, the business he founded with a
brother-in-law, was a high-flying success, making metal doors for
industrial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   As the second son in his family, Satomi had made his own way in
the world. His father had doted on his elder brother, Kagenori.
``My grandfather had great expectations that his eldest son would
become something,'' Shigeru said.
</P>
<P>
   So while Shigeru's uncle was becoming something, his father
worked. ``He worked from the morning until late in the evening,
every day, all the time, and my grandfather changed his mind about
his sons,'' Shigeru said. ``He began placing a lot of faith in my
father and less in Kagenori.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather was not the only one impressed by Satomi's
business sense. Shigeru, who is Satomi's oldest son, remembers
bankers calling on his father, urging him to expand, expand,
expand. And expand he did, opening a second factory in 1989 and a
third in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father made some money and was a bit of a success,''
Shigeru said. ``He owned three plants and the real estate
underneath them, and he had a nice family and a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the third factory was completed in 1991, Japan's
economic miracle had gone bust, and Koyo's business shrank and
wobbled.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru's father tried to sell off the land under his factories
to pay off his debts, but land prices had collapsed. And the
bankers that once were so eager to lend him money now wanted to be
repaid. ``If we hadn't been so adventurous and built the third
plant, we wouldn't have had to go bankrupt,'' Shigeru said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his mother still have trouble believing the family
business failed. Instead, they say that Kagenori deliberately
ruined the business so that he could reap the profits that can be
made from liquidation. That betrayal, they believe, drove Satomi to
madness and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, counters Shinsuke Ishimura, Kagenori's only son. ``I
don't know what Shigeru told you, but we were indignant at the
one-sided stories that ran in the local press that described my
father as a bad guy who tried to take over the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined, however, any further discussion of the matter. ``I
talked with my relatives about whether or not I should do an
interview, and I have decided not to because for us it is a sad
story that we don't want to touch on any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shigeru, his mother and their lawyers insist that Kagenori
was a small-time gangster affiliated with one of the many yakuza,
or organized crime families, that rule the underground economy
here. They say he made his living by working his way into
struggling businesses and milking them to death, one of the many
shadowy enterprises that the yakuza engages in here, where
liquidation is not the respectable business it is in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``My uncle was quite good at making money out of bankruptcies,''
Shigeru said. ``He would find a company on the brink of failure and
convince the owners that they could make 1 billion or 2 billion yen
by putting their company in bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a year or two ago, his uncle and his father had maintained
a rather distant relationship. Then his uncle suffered a heart
attack in late 1996 and ended up in the hospital, and Satomi paid
some of the expenses, according to Shigeru.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Kagenori left the hospital, he and Satomi grew closer.
Satomi seemed willing to give his brother a second chance, and
Kagenori seemed like a changed person.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business conditions grew tougher and tougher for
Satomi's business, Koyo Welding. Last spring, it needed money but
no banks would extend loans and business was slow. By May, it was
effectively bankrupt, with about $17.6 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Kagenori suggested he had connections in the financial community
who could help bail Koyo out, so he became an adviser to the
company and started frequently showing up at the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru said his uncle offered to help his father obtain a loan,
but never did so.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mrs. Ishimura said, Kagenori was encouraging
her husband to commit suicide. Terushi Sugimoto, a former employee
of Koyo, testified in court in February that once, over a dinner at
a restaurant, he had heard Kagenori tell his brother that many
business owners were committing suicide to take responsibility for
their companies' failures and that it was an idea he should
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking and I didn't think it was good manners to
listen to their conversation,'' Sugimoto testified. ``But I did
notice the word suicide was mentioned a number of times.''
</P>
<P>
   As the company's situation continued to worsen, Shigeru's uncle
convinced his father to write promissory notes to himself in the
company's name that would allow him to get cash on a short-term
basis. To cash in some of the notes, they had to go to the black
market, where they paid more than half of the face value in fees _
and then the uncle also demanded a fee, according to Shigeru and
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear that Koyo was headed for bankruptcy, Satomi's
mental state plummeted. ``He was different,'' Sugimoto, the former
employee, recalled in court testimony. ``His face looked different,
and the tone of his voice was like a child's. I really thought
something was the matter with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of July, Mrs. Ishimura insisted that her husband
go to the hospital. ``He wasn't my husband any more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He began taking tranquilizers and sleeping pills and seemed to
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, the company defaulted on one of its promissory notes,
which often precipitates bankruptcy in Japan. Satomi and his
brother quarreled over whether the company should be liquidated to
raise cash or whether, as Satomi wanted, it should pursue a
court-administered bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mrs. Ishimura and her husband fled to a house they
had rented in a nearby suburb to escape their creditors. She had
bought a knife at her husband's instruction, and he brought it
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Let's commit suicide together, please die with
me,' '' Mrs. Ishimura said, her eyes pooling with tears at the
memory. ``I accepted his request and was committed to die with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to change my mind after looking at my children's
faces,'' she said after a pause. ``If my children lost us, my
brother-in-law would be able to ruin our whole family.''
</P>
<P>
   She convinced her husband not to kill himself, and they returned
to their home next to the company's factory in Daito City, just
outside Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, Satomi met with Kagenori for the first time since the
bankruptcy. No one knows what was said between them, but Satomi
returned home agitated and restless. ``I could see immediately that
he was in a very bad state,'' Mrs. Ishimura said. ``I thought he
had gone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   With two of his sons restraining him, the family rushed Satomi
to a psychiatric hospital, where he was given medication to sedate
him.
</P>
<P>
   Midmorning on Sept. 16, the phone rang at Shigeru's house, where
the family was then staying. It was Kagenori. After hanging up,
Satomi insisted on going to the office to meet his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko, Satomi's daughter, drove him there and went on to the
bank. She had just finished her errand when her mobile phone rang.
It was her brother Shigeru, telling her that her father had killed
her uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Satomi used the knife he meant to kill himself with.. He has
never attempted to deny the murder. Indeed, he directed Sugimoto to
call the police.
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived, Satomi walked to them, thrust out his
wrists and said, ``I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, the Ishimura family has regrouped. Its
savings are gone, tied up as they were in the business. Satomi's
defense has eaten up any money that materialized from the
bankruptcy and is going to cost more. The whole family is living
together in Shigeru's tiny house on a narrow street of an Osaka
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Mrs. Ishimura's days revolves around the visit to see
her husband, a trip that takes half an hour each way for an
appointment that lasts 15 minutes and takes place through glass.
Keiko, a former kindergarten teacher who is now unemployed, serves
as her mother's driver.
</P>
<P>
   Satomi's mother died recently, but the family has not told him
yet. His youngest son, Mamoru, is finishing college and working
part-time to support his family. Yutaka, another son, works in a
pachinko parlor; his income also goes to the family budget.
</P>
<P>
   Shigeru, who grew up expecting to take over his father's
business, has started his own business making fire-proof doors,
which are a necessity in earthquake-prone Japan. He is working
18-hour days. He made no money in September and October but has
been able to pay himself a small income thereafter, which he gives
to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to his wife, Shigeru's father rued the day he
ever invited his brother into his life. ``His promises for
arranging loans were all fake,'' he wrote. ``It is a very stupid
story, but as president, I had a responsibility to rehabilitate my
company for my family, the bank and my employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for that reason that I let my brother in. That was the
stupidest mistake of my life.''

LOW TAXPAYER GIVING SQUEEZES CAMPAIGN MATCHING FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With fewer taxpayers than ever agreeing to earmark
$3 each for presidential campaign funds, the federal government may
have only one-third of the requested $60 million in matching funds
next January, putting a financial squeeze on White House candidates
counting on the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In a combination of circumstances that has never occurred
before, a record low number of Americans are expected to check off
the campaign contribution on tax returns due April 15, while an
unusually high number of serious presidential candidates are likely
to seek those funds. In addition, next year's compressed primary
schedule has put added importance on receiving the federal matching
funds as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around, some of the candidates may not get their
money till well after the primaries,'' said Federal Election
Commission spokesman Ian Stirton. ``That is one of the reasons that
the experts are saying they have to collect so much money up front
because there may not be the matching funds available.'' Some
campaigns hope to make up for the shortfall with bank loans, but
that could add significantly to campaign expenses.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may help the top-tier candidates with lots of money,
but hurt the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas Governor George W. Bush might have enough
campaign money to be unaffected or may forgo matching funds
altogether in order to evade spending caps. And millionaire
publisher Steve Forbes, another Republican candidate, has said he
won't take matching funds because he plans to rely partly on his
own fortune. Thus, Forbes can evade the spending caps and spend
more money than any other primary candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the field, especially among the crowded
Republican slate, the shortfall could prove painful. Senator John
McCain of Arizona and commentator Patrick J. Buchanan already are
counting on the matching funds in their spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from a long-festering taxpayer rebellion
against earmarking $3 of their tax money toward the pool of
campaign matching funds, a program that began in 1972. (Some of the
money is set aside to pay for the major parties' national
conventions.) While the contribution does not increase taxes, many
people either dislike the idea of supporting the matching fund or
don't understand it.
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, 27.5 percent of taxpayers agreed to the contribution,
which then was was $1. By 1997, 12.6 percent of taxpayers made the
check-off. A sampling of 1998 tax returns conducted earlier this
month showed that only 10 percent of taxpayers supported the fund,
the lowest ever, an IRS official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   What has caused the decline? Just listen to a top official in
one campaign who has a vested interest in the check-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I typically do not check it,'' said the official, who
requested that his name not be published. ``I don't know why, I
just don't.'' When told that the federal government might have a
$40 million shortfall as a result of taxpayers like himself, the
official said, ``I intend to check it off this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign illustrates the potential problem. An
individual's contribution up to $250 can be matched
dollar-for-dollar with taxpayer funds. (Individual contributions
are limited to $1,000 per candidate during the primary.) If McCain
qualifies for $10 million in matching funds, as is possible, he
would receive only $3.2 million at the beginning of next year
because of the shortfall, according to FEC projections. He would
receive the remainder as it became available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is we are eligible for the matching funds,''
said McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky. ``That is certainly part of
our plan.'' He added that the campaign hoped to take out a loan to
cover the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   But if most of the likely candidates _ 11 Republicans and two
Democrats _ seek matching funds, the pool of money will run out
more quickly than ever. According to FEC estimates, the candidates
are expected to seek $61 million to $67 million in matching funds
in January.
</P>
<P>
   That is far more than ever requested. For comparison, the
matching funds requested on Jan. 1 in previous campaign cycles
were: $7.8 million in 1984, $28.7 million in 1988, $6.4 million in
1996 and $37.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To put the problem in perspective, there was never a shortfall
until 1996, when the government was shy $15 million for the
candidates. Candidates received about 60 percent of their
qualifying matching funds in January 1996. But the shortfall was
quickly made up by April 1996, with candidates getting loans to
cover the delay.
</P>
<P>
   But now the projected shortfall is far greater, more than $40
million, with only 32 percent of the matching funds expected to be
available on Jan. 1, 2000. Moreover, the government doesn't expect
to make up for the shortfall until April 2001 _ a full year later
than in the previous campaign _ because so few taxpayers are
marking the check-off.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the presidential campaigns are already making
contingency plans. Stan Huckaby, who works as a financial
consultant to a number of Republican candidates, spent much of
Wednesday talking with bankers about getting loans for the
anticipated matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found some banks in (Washington) D.C. will do it very
quickly, but most out-of-town banks look at it and say, `My God,
this is crazy,' '' Huckaby said.
</P>
<P>
   Huckaby said he is confident the loans will come through, but a
possible 10 percent interest rate on the loans will add to the
expense of a campaign. Some government officials and campaign aides
worry that it will take so long to make up for the shortfall that
it will be difficult to obtain the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Some FEC officials think part of this problem could be solved if
they could promote the notion of making the $3 check-off. But the
agency has determined that would be deemed too political and
dropped the idea of airing public service announcements.

SPACE-AGE SOUNDS FOR `PHANTOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STACK  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ May the Force surround you.
</P>
<P>
   That's the plan when a cutting-edge sound system is put into
service with the May 19 release of ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _ The
Phantom Menace.'' The new system, called Dolby Digital Surround EX,
was developed by an unusual partnership of Lucasfilm's THX division
and Dolby Laboratories in San Francisco. The Chronicle got a sneak
preview on Monday of the new THX trailer, which will use the
surround-sound format.
</P>
<P>
   Theaters across the country are eager to install the system
because they want to showcase what everybody believes will be the
movie of the year. The ``Phantom'' soundtrack will be the first
recorded in Dolby EX.
</P>
<P>
   Costs to theaters are relatively low _ between $2,000 and $4,000
_ and installation is simple. Theaters install four speakers along
back walls, then hook up wires to an adapter. The belief is that
the system will revolutionize the way audiences hear movies, just
as Dolby Stereo did 22 years ago when the original ``Star Wars''
was the first movie released in that format.
</P>
<P>
   Surround EX allows filmmakers to direct the sounds of onscreen
action to different locations within the auditorium. Audiences will
be enveloped by the sound of, say, a spaceship coming from behind
them, passing overhead, then advancing into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 theaters in North America are expected to have the
system by the time ``Phantom Menace'' is released, according to
Dolby Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Dolby and THX have created new trailers to introduce
Surround EX that are scheduled to be released May 19, the same day
as ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   THX's 15-second trailer launches a new slogan, ``Let's See It in
THX,'' with letters that break apart while the synthesized sound of
a bowed cello playing the single note A turns into a D-major chord
enveloping the listener.
</P>
<P>
   Dolby's new 30-second ``Aurora'' trailer will feature 50 voices
of the Sonoma State University Chamber Singers and Sonoma County
Bach Choir, plus 10 members of the San Francisco Symphony brass
section. They are recording on Friday at Lucas' Skywalker Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The next major film to use Surround EX is ``The Haunting,'' a
special-effects thriller by ``Twister'' director Jan De Bont, due
July 23 from DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   The new format was devised by Oscar-winning sound designer Gary
Rydstrom, who is still mixing ``The Phantom Menace'' at Skywalker
Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted audiences to be completely encircled by (our system),
as well as hear sounds directly played behind them ... to open up
new possibilities and place sounds exactly where you would hear
them in the real world,'' Rydstrom said when Surround EX was first
announced in October.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration for theater owners, the audience sits in a
dark room and hears the sound of a helicopter. Its clippity roar
lets listeners know where it is at every moment. Suddenly the sound
of a missile is heard from one corner. It whooshes overhead, hits
the chopper and downs it in a blast. It all sounds so real that it
creates an action picture in the mind of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a milestone, giving ambient sound a whole new meaning,''
said Kurt Schwenk of THX. ``We're talking about motion sound, if
you will, now playing with the motion picture. But it's not about
noise; it's about placement of sounds to reflect the real world.''

EDIT-MILITARY (Phoenix) - Sp far, if anything positive can be

examination of America's military history. Will the introduction of
American ground forces into Yugoslavia provoke this nation's next
Vietnam? We've heard a lot of that talk lately.

BOMBS IN YUGOSLAVIA SHAKE NEIGHBORING NATIONS BARELY STANDING
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia is
destabilizing neighboring regions in which the United States and
Europe have stationed tens of thousands of troops, spent billions
of dollars and invested years of work in trying to secure peace,
build democracy and improve moribund economies.
</P>
<P>
   Since bombing started on March 24, the 32,000 NATO-led troops
who keep Bosnia's shaky peace have faced numerous attacks from
Serbs and are on high alert in the worst tension since the end of
war in 1995. The government put in place by the West is frozen and
inactive.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, a president who has won backing from Washington
and other foreign capitals is devoting all energies to averting a
coup backed by the Army of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, already coping with hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
refugees, is worried about tens of thousands more arriving, and
Croatia's tourist-dependent economy faces a bleak summer of empty
hotels and beaches.
</P>
<P>
   For foreigners and locals alike, the real fear is that prolonged
NATO bombing of the Serbs will reopen all the wounds still
festering from the Balkan wars of this past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security situation is stable, but the longer the bombing
goes on, the more difficult it will be to control the situation,''
said Lt. Gen. Mike Wilcocks, a British officer who is the deputy
commander of Stabilization Forces in Bosnia, the NATO-led
peacekeepers. ``We are watching the situation like a hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia and Montenegro, the best face that diplomats or
military officials put on the Serb fury stoked by three weeks of
bombing is that they should be able to contain it until Milosevic
is defeated, at which point they suggest that prospects for
democratic development in the region will soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If getting rid of Milosevic fails, then everything else
fails,'' said Carlos Westendorp, the Western envoy who essentially
runs Bosnia since the 1995 Dayton peace accords. ``That is the
condition we need for full development of the region, respect of
borders and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other Western officials concur, however, that the longer
the bombing campaign continues, the more difficult it will be for
peacekeeping forces in Bosnia to hold back Serb radicals and for
the elected government in Montenegro to escape a coup that could
spark a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has halted efforts to rebuild infrastructure or
return Bosnians who fled the war to their old homes. Hundreds of
Westerners have evacuated what is called Republika Srpska, as the
Bosnian Serbs' half of Bosnia is known. Westendorp has ordered the
elected Serb assembly not to meet until the Kosovo war is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am doing is freezing the situation,'' Westendorp said
here Wednesday. ``The hard-liners are constantly harassing the
moderates. It would do a lot of harm to have the assembly meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door, fears of a coup in Montenegro, a Yugoslav republic
where the American government is making significant diplomatic and
financial investments, have paralyzed the economy while backing
elected leaders into a corner. They are struggling to stop the
Yugoslav Army, which Milosevic controls, from taking over the news
media, conscripting senior officials in the republic and fomenting
street violence.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing also scuttled a bid to improve relations between
Montenegro and its neighbor, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Western diplomat, Montenegro had been planning
before the bombing to apologize to Croatia for shelling the
historic coastal city of Dubrovnik in 1991 and 1992. Dubrovnik is
the jewel of Croatia's Adriatic coastline and was once a major
tourist draw.
</P>
<P>
   While Croatia has supported the bombing of its old foe, Serbia,
the assaults appear to have shattered prospects for the country's
tourist industry this year. Most summer hotel bookings in
Dubrovnik, as well as in resorts up and down the Adriatic coast,
have been canceled, hotel owners said.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, too, there is
widespread concern that the flood of refugees from Kosovo _ and the
possibility of tens of thousands more in coming days _ could
destabilize a government that has been receptive to Western
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The West has the most control in Bosnia, where it has the most
military muscle. There, peacekeepers from 37 countries, including
6,200 American troops, are heavily armed and have more than three
years' experience dealing with the terrain and with managing the
anger of local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing began on March 24, Wilcocks said he ordered a
ban on the training and movement of local armies across Bosnia.
Peacekeeping troops have been ordered to wear body armor in the
field at all times and not to travel in groups of less than three.
</P>
<P>
   In the week after the bombings began, there was a sharp increase
in Serb attacks on peacekeeping troops, including several incidents
when hand grenades were thrown at soldiers from moving cars.
Wilcocks would not say how many incidents there have been, only
that they have subsided somewhat in the past week. No troops have
been injured in the attacks, he said.

SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina: attacks, he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The general said in an interview that forces in Bosnia ``have
nothing to do with NATO.'' But the credibility of that distinction,
if it ever held much weight among Bosnian Serbs, took a severe blow
on April 3, when peacekeeping troops whose nationality has not been
disclosed, acting on orders from Washington, blew up a stretch of
railroad that connects Belgrade with Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks were destroyed in a stretch of the railroad that cuts
across a tip of Bosnia. Western diplomats here said the
peacekeeping troops were ordered to take immediate action because
of information that a trainload of armed Serb paramilitary forces
was headed to Montenegro to make trouble for the pro-Western
government there.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of the tracks, during which the troops shot and
killed a local watchman who fired at them, gave Serb nationalists
in Bosnia a reason to argue that their country was being occupied
by the same forces that are bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing, moreover, exacerbated an already severe
political crisis in Republika Srpska, which covers about 49 percent
of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in March, Westendorp in effect fired the elected
president of the Serb republic, Nikola Poplasen, a radical Serb
nationalist who had refused for months to work with the
government's moderate prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On that same day, an arbitrator in Vienna denied the Serbs
exclusive control of a city, Brcko, that connects two parts of
their territory. Many Serbs regard the city as an essential link
for the survival of their government inside Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, then, was perceived as part of a triple whammy by
the West against Serbs and has sharply raised the risks of
violence, said Bryan Hopkinson, director of the Sarajevo-based
Bosnia project of the International Crisis Group, a think tank
funded by European governments and Western foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At worst, the capacity might soon exist to mount an armed
secessionist movement, at least for that part of Republika Srpska
east of Brcko, perhaps using paramilitaries so that the political
instigators would not be directly implicated,'' Hopkinson, a former
British ambassador to Bosnia, wrote in a report last week. ``The
public, in its present baffled and enraged state, would probably
not be hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkinson said in an interview that any secessionist movement by
the Bosnian Serbs would be easily handled by peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Montenegro, however, Western diplomats are not at
all certain that the elected government could resist an Army coup
ordered by Milosevic. The Army has tanks and artillery, while the
republic's police, although well-trained and believed to be highly
motivated, do not.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, has told American
diplomats that he was confident that he could avoid bloodshed in
Montenegro while challenging Milosevic's authority, but only if the
West refrained from bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombs started to fall, Djukanovic has said in
interviews that his police would prevail in a fight against the
Army, but he and other officials have conceded that such a fight
could ignite a civil war among his heavily armed population.

LUCK OF THE LOTTERY BRINGS JOY, SADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As it turned out, while the Nigerian cab driver was
being hounded into hiding, the Chilean nanny was in Louisburg
Square, quietly planning a new life of profound fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' biggest money mystery reached its denouement
Wednesday under the glare of TV lights when Maria Grasso, the
richest individual lottery winner in US history, calmly claimed her
prize.
</P>
<P>
   As she marveled at her luck and the luxury it will bring, the
winner had only sympathy for the taxi driver, who for days was
wrongly believed to hold the ticket to life on Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I feel sorry for him,'' Grasso said of cabbie Patrick
Okusanya. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the two immigrants _ the man who hired a lawyer to
insist he had not won and the woman who prudently sought counsel
before emerging victorious _ is a dramatic story about reversal of
fortune and fascination with instant wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God! The babysitter's a millionaire,'' said Lisa de Roetth,
a neighbor of venture capitalist Chris Gabrieli, who employed
Grasso as a nanny and a cook at one of Boston's most exclusive
neighborhoods. ``There ought to be little miracles in life. And
there's magic in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also elements that captivate lottery players and
spectators from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   At base, specialists say, the lottery is about envy and greed,
and glee for the winner _ as long as he or she conforms to the
Horatio Alger dream that propels the betting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rags-to-riches story and deep down inside of us we all
have a little bit of envy for what someone else has,'' said Robert
Butterworth, a Pittsfield native and Los Angeles psychologist who
has studied lottery wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not millionaires and when somebody like us or
someone in worse shape than us wins, it reinforces the idea that
there might be a chance some day for us, too,'' said Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University
and author of ``Luxury Fever,'' said the intense publicity
surrounding lottery winners comes from the public's fascination
with how unimaginable wealth will affect regular people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vivid tranformation of someone's life that's just very
interesting to watch,'' Frank said. ``It's a transformation that
many of us fantasize about and we can construct a more vivid
fantasy if we can see it happening to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of last week's Big Game jackpot, fantasy often
substituted for fact.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after officials for the six-state Big Game lottery
determined where the winning ticket had been purchased in Boston, a
fleet of television trucks and a battalion of reporters descended
on the Star Market in the Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that caromed around the city were amplified when drivers
for a local taxi firm said they had detected the winner and were
willing to provide delightful details:
</P>
<P>
   He was an African immigrant. He worked 60 hours a week. Someone
had seen his ticket. When they shouted, ``Oh my God, you won!'' the
startled cabbie drove away and did not answer radio dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   As lottery officials warned against speculation and rumor, the
search for the reluctant winner only intensified as the week wore
on.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion about the number of the cab that the
supposed winner had been driving. There were denials from some
cabbies, secrecy from others.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, a weary Okusanya left messages on a reporter's
answering machine: ``Please I want you to stop it. For my security
reason, stop going around telling people.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer said flatly he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Okusanya _ pursued by network magazines and TV
tabloid shows _ emerged to deny it in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story that he won was made up entirely,'' John M. Ricci,
the attorney, said Wednesday. ``We'd love to know where it came
from. One day, his life is normal. He's going about his business.
He's got friends. He's got sports activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he wakes up to find that's all gone because the entire
world is hunting him down,'' Ricci said. ``It doesn't seem fair to
me that, based on rumor, something ends up on the front page of the
(Boston) Herald or the front page of the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Okusanya vigorously denied that his fortunes had changed,
Grasso was across town, secure in the knowledge that her
babysitting days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   She had checked her ticket against the television announcement.
Then she checked it again. ``I couldn't believe it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso put the slip of paper that carried enormous wealth into
safekeeping while she consulted with lawyers and prepared to
carefully step into the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get legal advice and clear (my) mind,'' she said
Wednesday, wearing a broad smile. ``This is a pretty big day for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, too, for Okusanya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Patrick because it's going to help him get this
behind him,'' said Ricci, still confounded by the media storm that
encircled his client.
</P>
<P>
   It's a storm that has blown up before, when fate aligns the
numbers to confer vast riches on regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society we are fascinated with the `big score' in any
number of ways _ whether it's what Bill Gates' net worth is this
week or what Michael Jordan makes or the latest overnight Internet
billionaire,'' said John Helyar, who has written about lottery
millionaires for Money Magazine. ``The lottery really represents
the one way that the little guy can achieve the big score.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day you're a baby sitter from Chile and the next day
you're a zillionaire. It's the one way that the Average Joe, the
blue-collar person can participate in that Big Score game.''

HEROIC RESCUE PERSUADES ATLANTA'S MAYOR TO GRANT FIREFIGHTERS A
RAISE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID FIRESTONE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The loudest cheers at the ceremony honoring Matt
Moseley on Wednesday afternoon came from his fellow firefighters,
and not just because he transfixed the country on Monday in the
breathtaking rescue of a construction worker trapped high above an
inferno.
</P>
<P>
   No, Moseley became a particular hero to his colleagues with an
action the next morning that may have required even more bravado:
He urged Mayor Bill Campbell to end a longstanding feud with the
firefighters union, and give its members a long-sought raise.
Campbell agreed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, at Moseley's behest, the mayor sat down
with union leaders and agreed to seek a bonus of up to $2,000 for
the city's 800 firefighters, along with new breathing masks to
replace devices that the union says are defective. It was the first
time in his six years in office that he has met with the union,
which has endorsed his opponents, and it required ingesting some
crow. But he said Monday's spectacle swept away petty disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being there on the scene, seeing the incredible heroism, I was
truly moved,'' he said in an interview. ``I thought it was a good
opportunity for us to metaphorically overcome all our differences.
It seemed like if they could do that, and rescue this guy from a
crane in a burning building, I could certainly sit down and talk to
these firefighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is a man of storied pride, and his disputes with a
lengthy series of enemies have been enduring. After receiving
repeated criticism from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, for
example, he announced a few years ago that he would no longer read
the city's daily newspaper, a vow he insists is still in effect.
</P>
<P>
   But for both Campbell and his city, the rescue on Monday became
one of those collective moments of redemption in which an entire
populace can partake of an individual's bravery. Thousands of
downtown workers gathered open-mouthed at their skyscraper windows
watching a state helicopter lower Moseley on a rope to the edge of
a construction crane where Ivers Sims, the crane operator, lay
prostrate amid intense heat. At the base of the crane 200 feet
below, a landmark cotton-bag mill was burning in the city's largest
fire in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more saw the rescue on a live television broadcast that
was carried nationally. When Campbell honored the rescue workers at
a ceremony Wednesday, throngs of small children surrounded Moseley,
begging him to sign their outstretched palms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dramatics of the moment clearly put additional pressure on
the administration, and for that matter the City Council, to do
something else for the firefighters,'' said Robb Pitts, the
council's president. ``People were saying shame on you all for not
paying them more, and the city was kind of backed into a corner by
the tide of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he didn't know the origin of the dispute with the
firefighters, but union members and other elected officials said it
resulted from the union's endorsement of Campbell's opponents in
1993 and 1997. Last year, after the union criticized the city's
black fire chief, Campbell, who is also black, said the criticism
was motivated by racism.
</P>
<P>
   The union, whose membership is about half African-American,
denied this, and relations got worse. Earlier this year, the mayor
and the council gave a $2,000 raise to the police but not to the
firefighters, a decision that David Rhodes, the union president,
said was the ``ultimate insult.'' Firefighters make between $26,500
and $34,000, and many officials at City Hall have maintained that
their jobs are not as dangerous as those of police officers.
</P>
<P>
   When Moseley met the mayor at a television appearance Tuesday
morning, he could not resist the opportud to
be said.'' Less than a day after the helicopter set him and Sims
down on solid ground, the union's leadership had been invited to
City Hall and given almost everything they requested.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I'm glad it happened,'' said Campbell, looking
almost wistful. ``If you don't grow and mature, then you lose the
essential nature of humanity.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a burst of heavy snow whitened the landscape of
eastern Colorado as cold, moist air was directed southwest into the
Front Range of the Rockies. On Thursday, the low pressure
responsible for the late-season snow will intensify as it moves
into the Mississippi Valley, bringing a potpourri of inclement
weather to portions of the central and eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Warm, humid air surging north from the Gulf of Mexico will set
the stage for scattered strong thunderstorms from Kentucky to
Alabama and north Georgia. A few of these storms will be quite
formidable, capable of producing hail and damaging winds. The
highest risk for destructive storms will be in Kentucky and
Tennessee. Meanwhile, a large swath of rain with embedded
thunderstorms will occur from northern Illinois to Ohio as the Gulf
moisture is lifted up and over a warm front near the Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow stripe of wind-blown snow will fall on the northwest
periphery of the Mississippi Valley low, causing several inches to
accumulate from north-central Kansas to southern Minnesota. Farther
west, strong winds from the northwest will buffet the Plains
Thursday with local gusts near 50 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the north and east will also affect the
Southwest. These offshore winds, combined with abundant sunshine,
will propel 80-degree heat to the southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will cover most of the Eastern Seaboard Thursday.
Plenty of sunshine will occur across southern New England while
clouds thicken along the Middle Atlantic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Large Hail
</P>
<P>
   Baseball-sized hail pelted parts of western Texas on Tuesday
evening as a bevy of severe thunderstorms erupted. Within
thunderstorms, updrafts of air must be sufficiently strong for
embryonic hailstones to grow to large sizes while suspended high in
the subfreezing upper parts of an intense thunderstorm. Hailstones
grow as tiny water drops freeze on contact. Once they become too
heavy for updrafts to support, hailstones careen toward earth. In
the case of the Texas hailstorm, the speed of rising air must have
been at least 60 mph in order to support the giant stones aloft.

`OPEN YOUR EYES': A HEAD TRIP WORTH TAKING
</HEADLINE>
 OUR RATING: 3 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everything we see in the riveting Spanish
psychological thriller ``Open Your Eyes'' comes through the eyes of
a man locked inside a mental institution. His name is Cesar
(Eduardo Noriega), and he's imprisoned because he killed somebody.
Cesar doesn't remember committing the crime, but then his memory
has been playing tricks on him. He doesn't know what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you. Writer-director Alejandro Amenabar has fashioned a
marvelously complex movie that moves in and out of reality with
such verve and intelligence that it keeps its audience guessing
right up until the provocative conclusion. An inherent sense of
logic makes ``Open Your Eyes'' a rarity among movies that deal with
alternate points of view. This is one head trip you can actually
buy into, unlike, say, the spectacularly filmed mumbo-jumbo of
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Your Eyes'' opens with Cesar waking up (or is he?),
getting dressed and heading out to the streets of Madrid, which are
incongruously devoid of life. (Or are they?) Cesar then wakes up
and realizes he has been dreaming. (Maybe.)
</P>
<P>
   Cesar is one of those spectacular specimens who gets by in life
on his pretty face and facile charm. At a party celebrating his
25th birthday, he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz) and believes he may
finally have met a woman worthy of his attention. Problem is,
Cesar's current girlfriend, Nuria (Najwa Nimri), is still in the
picture and inclined toward obsessive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Nuria begs Cesar for another chance, appealing to his
considerable ego. Cesar relents and hops in her car, which she
proceeds to drive into a brick wall, killing herself and horribly
disfiguring Cesar's face.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the setup. The film initially appears to be heading
into familiar territory, with Cesar coping with his deformities and
wounded pride. But then fantasy and reality begin to blend
seamlessly together. Cesar wonders why he's in a psychiatric
prison, accused of murder. He also doesn't understand why he
remembers having his face cosmetically repaired and, yet, here he
is, wearing a rubber mask while talking to a prison psychiatrist
(Chete Lera).
</P>
<P>
   Another stumper: the various recollections of a cryogenics
infomercial and its elderly actor spokesman. Are all these things
part of a dream, or are they real, or has Cesar, as the
psychiatrist suspects, gone completely mad?
</P>
<P>
   Amenabar, whose previous film ``Tesis'' won seven Goya Awards
(the Spanish equivalent of the Oscar), successfully keeps his
audience thinking, constantly upending expectations and appearances
in surprising and fantastic ways. Amenabar doesn't use special
effects as a crutch; he's a sufficiently skilled filmmaker to be
able to employ camera angles and lighting to convey Cesar's
shifting reality. It's superb work, as is Hans Burmann's haunting
cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are quite good, too. Noriega, playing Cesar in
three different mental states _ ladies' man, fearful paranoid and
deformed victim _ displays an impressive range, and the beautiful
Cruz (``The Hi-Lo Country,'' ``Belle Epoque'') continues to reveal
an emotional expressiveness that labels her as an actress to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open Your Eyes'' was a box-office sensation in Spain two years
ago. Tom Cruise's production company, Cruise-Wagner, has bought the
English-language rights to the movie, but don't wait until
Hollywood remakes it. (That's rarely a good idea, anyway.) This is
one movie that demands immediate attention. &QL;

YUGOSLAVIA BLAMES NATO FOR DEATH OF 75 KOSOVARS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yugoslavia claimed Wednesday that stepped-up NATO
air attacks struck two convoys of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
killing 75 and injuring 25. The Pentagon said Serb forces may have
slaughtered civilians after military vehicles at each end of the
columns were hit.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, pondered a German cease-fire proposal
that the White House welcomed guardedly _ at the same time the
Clinton administration ruled out a quick bombing halt.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces again shelled a region of the Albanian border near a
town that troops of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic held
briefly on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the military action and diplomatic maneuvering, NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea argued that the vise was closing on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer a question of if we win, but when,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government-controlled Serb Media Center in Pristina, capital
of Kosovo, said two columns of refugees were fired on by NATO
planes near Djakovica. In one of the incidents in southwestern
Yugoslavia, the center said, a refugee column of more than 1,000
people was hit twice. It described the refugees as mostly old
people and children.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujevic denounced
the strike as a ``crime against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon confirmed NATO airstrikes in
the area but said U.S. military officials did not have ``the full
facts'' about the incident. Bacon quoted U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark,
NATO military chief, as saying Serb ``military people got out and
... began to attack civilians in the middle of the convoy.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon sources said allied military personnel were
scouring in-flight tape looking for footage to buttress their
version of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO statement said allied pilots ``state they attacked only
military vehicles. We cannot confirm press reports alleging that
these attacks may have caused civilian casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the White House met the latest Yugoslav claim with
countercharges that Serb aircraft had begun to attack refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Shea laid another humanitarian disaster at Milosevic's feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, one of the most appalling stories is simply of large
numbers of Kosovar Albanians being herded around Kosovo like groups
of migratory cattle, sent to the border, then sent back to their
villages by Serb security forces, then told to leave again, as if
they are sort of pawns being moved around on a chess board,'' Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brussels meeting of European Union leaders, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder outlined a proposal that would allow a
24-hour halt to NATO airstrikes once Milosevic begins to withdraw
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sought to picture the Schroeder proposal as only
an amplification of the NATO demands that Milosevic withdraw all
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, agree to deployment of an
international security force and allow the return of Kosovar
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said NATO's conditions must be
met ``without compromise or half measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions that NATO set down are the absolute minimum to
make sure this policy of `ethnic cleansing' is defeated,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said there was no guarantee the German proposal would
work, but he pledged to circulate it.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, military and administration officials,
including Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, briefed House and Senate members and warned, participants
said, that the NATO air campaign could last well into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   At his daily news briefing, Shea held out the hope that
Milosevic, seeing his military assets being beaten down, would
yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had to calculate into his planning the fact that NATO is
not going to be bought off or is not going to be divided,'' Shea
said. ``And he may be a cynical man, but I think he's also, deep
down, a rational man, and eventually he will have to realize that
he has no option but to comply with the demands of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Giuseppe Marani, a NATO military planner, said that in the
24 hours ending at noon Wednesday, five waves of NATO planes flew,
two were canceled and two missions were only partially executed
because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the attacks focused on bridges, air defense, command
installations, fuel installations and lines of communication.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS BEGIN DRIVE TO FORCE VOTE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats on Wednesday launched a petition
drive to buck Republican leaders and force a vote on campaign
finance overhaul. It marked the opening salvo in a battle over the
issue that promises to be as spirited and convoluted as it was last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Although majorities in both houses of Congress support
legislation to impose more stringent controls on campaign
contributions, particularly the unlimited and unregulated donations
known as ``soft money,'' Republican leaders have blocked such
changes since their party took control of Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A similar petition drive last year forced House leaders to allow
legislation sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass., to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders used a variety of procedural tactics, including
weeks of truncated late-night debates, to delay the vote until late
in the year and then block a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said that this year's petition drive was an
attempt to compel action earlier this year and give proponents a
better chance to rally the support necessary for legislation to
pass both chambers before next year's campaigns kick into high
gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must act now, in a non-election year,'' Rep. Tom Allen,
D-Maine, said on the House floor on Wednesday morning. ``If you
thought that the presidential election year of 1996 was awash in
soft money, 2000 promises to be a deluge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill finally got 61 Republican votes and passed
the House by a decisive margin of 252 to 179 votes last August just
before Congress' summer vacation. But the Senate, which had seen a
companion measure filibustered to death earlier in the year, had no
appetite for another go-round.
</P>
<P>
   This year's petition, sponsored by a group of conservative House
Democrats headed by Rep. Jim Turner of Texas, would limit the
debate on the Shays-Meehan bill or any alternative measures to a
maximum of 17 hours. The petition needs 218 signatures, or a simple
majority of House members, to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   By early Wednesday evening, 184 Democrats and the one
independent member of the House had signed it, a measure of the
ardor Democrats bring to the issue and their desire to put
Republicans who oppose campaign finance overhaul on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Although enough Republicans in the House support such
legislation so that it will likely pass once it comes up for a
vote, none had signed the petition by early evening. For the
moment, they were heeding insistent appeals from party leaders to
leave the timing on campaign finance overhaul in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, told reporters at
a news conference on Wednesday: ``I expect some kind of campaign
finance reform bill will come forward sometime this year. But I
can't tell you when.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats accused Republican leaders of once again trying
to doom legislation by delaying it and said that the House must
pass a bill in the next few months if there is any chance for a
measure to muster the requisite number of votes in the Senate,
where it faces more formidable obstacles, especially from Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell heads the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee,
which provides money to candidates, and the Senate Rules Committee,
which handles election law legislation. Last year, he led the
successful filibuster that killed the bill in the Senate. Only 52
senators of the 60 needed voted to bring the bill to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Wednesday if he would take the same steps to prevent a
bill from coming up for a vote this year, McConnell answered, ``Is
grass green?''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the co-sponsor of the Senate
version of the campaign finance bill with Sen. Russell Feingold,
D-Wis., expressed guarded optimism for a bill's chances in the
Senate this time around. ``There's a much better opportunity if the
House passes it early on,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would not only eliminate soft money but
also severely restrict the ability of independent groups to plow
money into advertisements that attack or endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of such regulations say they are necessary to lessen
the influence of wealthy interests in campaigns; opponents like
McConnell say the regulations would restrict free speech and
unfettered participation by Americans in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an utter disaster,'' McConnell said of such a scenario,
adding: ``That kind of bill is not going to pass the Senate just
because it'll pass the House.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that kind of resolve that the Democrats hope to
overcome by beginning a petition drive earlier this year than they
did last year and inaugurating it with such a dramatic flourish.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered by the dozens for a news conference outside the
Capitol on Wednesday morning, then marched en masse up the steps
and onto the floor of the House to form a dense, snaking line in
front of the petition.
</P>
<P>
   If the number of petition signers neared 218, Republican leaders
might move to bring the legislation up under rules and procedures
they could control _ as they did last year.

INDIA'S HINDU COALITION LOSES MAJORITY   IN PARLIAMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede to change `THURSDAY' to `WEDNESDAY')   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The Hindu nationalist-led coalition that has
governed India for the past year lost its parliamentary majority
Wednesday when its largest coalition partner, a state party from
Tamil Nadu headed by the temperamental former actress Jayalalitha
Jayaram, formally withdrew its support.
</P>
<P>
   President K.R. Narayanan, after meeting with Jayalalitha _ who
is known here by her first name _ and leaders of the opposition,
directed the government to seek a confidence vote in Parliament.
Narayanan did not set a deadline for the vote. Parliament
reconvenes Thursday after a recess to take up the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government asks for the lower house of Parliament to
begin considering the confidence motion right away, there would
probably be several days of floor debate before a vote that gave
both the incumbent government and those who sought to oust it, time
to bargain for the votes it would take to win.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where political power has splintered, and regional
and caste parties now hold the balance of votes needed to govern,
it has proved very difficult to put together a stable, lasting
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who heads the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said Wednesday that he was
confident his ruling coalition would stay in power, but that to do
so his government would have to win over a handful of tiny, fickle
political parties that are now playing hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition Congress Party, which has dominated
Indian politics for most of the past 50 years but now has the
second-largest block of votes, said they will try to cobble
together a new majority.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has presented itself as the party that will champion a
secular approach to governing that serves all of India's religions
and castes, in contrast to the Hindu nationalists, whom Congress
accuses of playing on religious differences for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress succeeds, its coalition would probably wind up
depending on the same Jayalalitha who is facing numerous charges of
corruption and who has made the current government's life miserable
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, she had harshly and repeatedly criticized the
government of which she was a part for an ever-shifting set of
reasons, most recently for refusing to get rid of the defense
minister, George Fernandes, who had been accused of corruption by
the fired naval chief, Adm. Vishnu Bhagwat.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' willingness to put together a new coalition marks a
shift in strategy. Sonia Gandhi, president of the party, had taken
the position that it would be better if the party could rebuild
both its grass-roots organization and its vote base in Parliament
before reclaiming power.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, the enigmatic Mrs. Gandhi _ who usually lets
other politicians come to her _ visited a reception in honor of
Jayalalitha, who heads the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra
Kazagham. The two women are expected to meet again soon to talk
over the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that Congress can put together a majority
coalition. There are serious conflicts within the opposition. For
example, officials in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have
said they will have no part of any coalition that has Jayalalitha
as a member.
</P>
<P>
   But Jayalalitha met with leaders of the Communist party
Wednesday. Afterwards, smiling, she said coyly to the throngs of
waiting reporters, ``Why are you so sure AIADMK wants to be part of
the new coalition?''
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha is now holding court in the largest suite at the
Maurya Sheraton Hotel. Her former allies seem to be taking the
opportunity to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   A grim-faced Venkaiah Naidu, spokesman for the Bharatiya Janata
Party, accused her of betrayal and of conspiring with the Congress
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will succeed in defeating the game plan of our political
rivals,'' he vowed.

FIDELITY NET OFF 16.8 PERCENT IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments, the nation's biggest mutual fund
firm, said Wednesday that net income plunged 16.8 percent last
year, mostly due to big spending on technology projects and work to
remedy in-house systems for the millennium computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based fund behemoth reported revenue rose 15.3
percent to $6.8 billion from $5.9 billion, mostly on the strength
of Fidelity's ownership of Colt Telecom Group plc, a booming
telecommunications company based in London.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show that while returns by Fidelity's funds have
improved dramatically, privately-held Fidelity is struggling to
regain an edge with investors.
</P>
<P>
   After years of sluggish performance, Fidelity stock funds are
once again doing well. Last year they had their best gains in five
years, beating 73 percent of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity portfolio managers, now more disciplined and better
supervised, have forsaken wild bets of recent years to focus on
high-returning large company stocks. Research teams and personal
review processes have been beefed up, and the firm has spent
heavily to use legendary stockpicker Peter Lynch as a sales magnet.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes haven't translated into strong sales.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity's net sales of mutual funds of all stripes nearly
doubled last year to $32.6 billion, sales of stock funds _ the
company's benchmark product _ dropped by half. Fidelity said it
recorded 1998 net sales of $8.5 billion in equity funds, far below
the nearly $15 billion it took in during 1997. It also sold $4.4
billion in bond funds and a whopping $19.8 billion in money markets
funds last year, figures that reflect investor caution during a
volatile market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast the Vanguard Group, a big competitor, took in nearly
$49 billion last year, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the lower sales, Fidelity's 24.4 percent growth in assets
under management, to $765 billion, came mostly from last year's
rising stock market. A bull market translates into heftier fees,
which are calculated as a percentage of assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``While reasonable, Fidelity's overall corporate results were
somewhat disappointing,'' said Eric Kobren, publisher of the
independent Fidelity Insight newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   There are other challenges at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fidelity's renewed focus on its flagship mutual-fund
operations, including recent sales of non-core businesses, the firm
is once again looking to avoid putting all its eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the highly-successful Colt, which Fidelity acquired
several years ago, Fidelity chairman Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III
wrote in the report that Fidelity ``must continue to make strategic
investments that may bear fruit in the future and diversify our
business to be less subject to stock market cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said Fidelity must balance growth by retaining
``the entrepreneurial spirit of a small company'' _ no mean feat
for the giant, which manages the retirement funds of on in four
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, long intrigued by technology, throws hundreds of
millions of dollars at pet technological projects every year.
Rather than buy from vendors, Fidelity designs all its own computer
systems. It is spending heavily to create a sophisticated
voice-recognition system to enable customers to trade via telephone
and has beefed up its Web-based trading capabilities. Over 70
percent of Fidelity's commissionable brokerage trades were
conducted on line last year, more than double 1997's amount.
</P>
<P>
   While Fidelity declined to state how much it spent on technology
last year, the firm will spend a total $300 million readying its
systems for Y2K, according to Jim Lowell, publisher of the
independent Fidelity Investor newsletter.

LUCK OF THE LOTTERY BRINGS JOY, SADNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As it turned out, while the Nigerian cab driver was
being hounded into hiding, the Chilean nanny was in Louisburg
Square, quietly planning a new life of profound fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' biggest money mystery reached its denouement
Wednesday under the glare of TV lights when Maria Grasso, the
richest individual lottery winner in US history, calmly claimed her
prize.
</P>
<P>
   As she marveled at her luck and the luxury it will bring, the
winner had only sympathy for the taxi driver, who for days was
wrongly believed to hold the ticket to life on Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I feel sorry for him,'' Grasso said of cabbie Patrick
Okusanya. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the two immigrants _ the man who hired a lawyer to
insist he had not won and the woman who prudently sought counsel
before emerging victorious _ is a dramatic story about reversal of
fortune and fascination with instant wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God! The babysitter's a millionaire,'' said Lisa de Roetth,
a neighbor of venture capitalist Chris Gabrieli, who employed
Grasso as a nanny and a cook at one of Boston's most exclusive
neighborhoods. ``There ought to be little miracles in life. And
there's magic in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are also elements that captivate lottery players and
spectators from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   At base, specialists say, the lottery is about envy and greed,
and glee for the winner _ as long as he or she conforms to the
Horatio Alger dream that propels the betting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rags-to-riches story and deep down inside of us we all
have a little bit of envy for what someone else has,'' said Robert
Butterworth, a Pittsfield native and Los Angeles psychologist who
has studied lottery wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not millionaires and when somebody like us or
someone in worse shape than us wins, it reinforces the idea that
there might be a chance some day for us, too,'' said Butterworth.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University
and author of ``Luxury Fever,'' said the intense publicity
surrounding lottery winners comes from the public's fascination
with how unimaginable wealth will affect regular people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vivid tranformation of someone's life that's just very
interesting to watch,'' Frank said. ``It's a transformation that
many of us fantasize about and we can construct a more vivid
fantasy if we can see it happening to someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of last week's Big Game jackpot, fantasy often
substituted for fact.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after officials for the six-state Big Game lottery
determined where the winning ticket had been purchased in Boston, a
fleet of television trucks and a battalion of reporters descended
on the Star Market in the Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors that caromed around the city were amplified when drivers
for a local taxi firm said they had detected the winner and were
willing to provide delightful details:
</P>
<P>
   He was an African immigrant. He worked 60 hours a week. Someone
had seen his ticket. When they shouted, ``Oh my God, you won!'' the
startled cabbie drove away and did not answer radio dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   As lottery officials warned against speculation and rumor, the
search for the reluctant winner only intensified as the week wore
on.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion about the number of the cab that the
supposed winner had been driving. There were denials from some
cabbies, secrecy from others.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, a weary Okusanya left messages on a reporter's
answering machine: ``Please I want you to stop it. For my security
reason, stop going around telling people.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer said flatly he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Okusanya _ pursued by network magazines and TV
tabloid shows _ emerged to deny it in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story that he won was made up entirely,'' John M. Ricci,
the attorney, said Wednesday. ``We'd love to know where it came
from. One day, his life is normal. He's going about his business.
He's got friends. He's got sports activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he wakes up to find that's all gone because the entire
world is hunting him down,'' Ricci said. ``It doesn't seem fair to
me that, based on rumor, something ends up on the front page of the
(Boston) Herald or the front page of the Globe.''
</P>
<P>
   While Okusanya vigorously denied that his fortunes had changed,
Grasso was across town, secure in the knowledge that her
babysitting days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   She had checked her ticket against the television announcement.
Then she checked it again. ``I couldn't believe it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso put the slip of paper that carried enormous wealth into
safekeeping while she consulted with lawyers and prepared to
carefully step into the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get legal advice and clear (my) mind,'' she said
Wednesday, wearing a broad smile. ``This is a pretty big day for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, too, for Okusanya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for Patrick because it's going to help him get this
behind him,'' said Ricci, still confounded by the media storm that
encircled his client.
</P>
<P>
   It's a storm that has blown up before, when fate aligns the
numbers to confer vast riches on regular folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society we are fascinated with the `big score' in any
number of ways _ whether it's what Bill Gates' net worth is this
week or what Michael Jordan makes or the latest overnight Internet
billionaire,'' said John Helyar, who has written about lottery
millionaires for Money Magazine. ``The lottery really represents
the one way that the little guy can achieve the big score.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day you're a baby sitter from Chile and the next day
you're a zillionaire. It's the one way that the Average Joe, the
blue-collar person can participate in that Big Score game.''

 &HT;    Black farmers to divvy $2 billion settlement
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roughly 20,000 black farmers will divide up to $2
billion in the settlement of a 2-year-old race discrimination
lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, approved by U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman
and announced Wednesday, is believed to be the largest recovery in
a U.S. civil rights case. Black farmers on average will get
$100,000 to $200,000, estimated Alexander Pires, the lead attorney
representing the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so happy to get this over with after two years of
litigation,'' Pires said from his office in Washington. He conceded
that some black farmers are opposed to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And Friedman acknowledged in his 66-page opinion that the
settlement does not correct years of discrimination that has led to
a decline in the number of black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ... proposed settlement ... will not undo all that has
been done. Despite that fact, however, the Court finds that the
settlement is a fair resolution of the claims brought in this case
and a good first step towards assuring that this kind of
discrimination that has been visited on African American farmers
since Reconstruction will not continue into the next century,'' the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman said he believes the
settlement is fair and just. ``We will work to quickly and
efficiently implement this settlement agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Georgia's estimated 1,329 black farmers are expected to
meet in Macon on Saturday to discuss the judge's decision, said
Melvin Bishop, president of the state chapter of the Black Farmers
and Agriculturalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Friedman, the settlement contains a provision
allowing a panel of retired judges to review settlement claims in
individual cases of discrimination. Arbitrators in those cases will
answer to Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, worked out by Pires, civil rights attorney J. L.
Chestnut of Selma, Ala., and government attorneys, awards farmers
with limited proof of discrimination $50,000, plus $12,500 to pay
taxes on that amount. Their USDA debts will be written off,
boosting damages for individual farmers to between $100,000 and
$200,000. Farmers with more far-reaching claims can take them to an
arbitrator for possibly higher settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, black farmers charged that for the last 15
years, the USDA has discriminated against them by violating the
1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act when
processing applications for farm programs and loans. The farmers'
claims were supported by studies, the USDA, and an admission by
Glickman that they were treated differently.

 &HT;    Lobbying gets heavy over bill on car sales
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is never mentioned in a 15-page bill
passed by the General Assembly this year to regulate relations
between auto manufacturers and the franchise dealers who sell their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But several groups outside the auto industry are lobbying Gov.
Roy Barnes to veto the legislation out of concern that it will harm
consumers' ability to find better deals by buying products online
and will undercut the state's efforts to promote high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can buy a book, a CD or an airline ticket over the
Internet, I don't see why I shouldn't be able to buy an
automobile,'' said Richard Keck, attorney for the Georgia
Electronic Commerce Association. ``In Georgia, we're trying to be
seen as a pioneer in electronic commerce. This bill would be a
smack in the face at that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Barnes has been silent on the bill. The governor faces a
May 3 deadline for signing or vetoing the bill. After that, it
becomes law automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says auto manufacturers cannot ``offer to sell or sell,
directly or indirectly, any new motor vehicle to a consumer in this
state, except through a new motor vehicle dealer.'' It also makes
it illegal for a manufacturer to ``engage in business as a
dealer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Davis, an attorney for King &AMP; Spalding, which represents
General Motors, thinks ``this would certainly prohibit sales over
the Internet by the (auto) manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Dubose Porter (D-Dublin), who sponsored House Bill 356,
argues that car makers are whipping up the Internet issue to kill a
bill that gives dealers protection from heavy-handed manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers, who are committed to heavy overhead costs, felt
threatened when Ford recently made an unsuccessful overture to buy
stakes in several north Atlanta Ford dealerships. They worried Ford
would find ways to favor the dealerships it partially owned.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealers have a powerful lobby, with their bill carried in
the Senate by Majority Leader Charles Walker (D-Augusta), one of
Barnes' key African-American supporters in his 1998 election
campaign. On the other hand, Barnes has portrayed himself as a
high-tech advocate by launching an expensive state initiative to
educate engineers to feed Georgia's growing electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Industry Association, which represents more than 100
businesses employing more than 82,000 Georgians, and the Georgia
Textile Manufacturers Association are among those lobbying Barnes
to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Barnes is wisely investing tax dollars in promotion
of intellectual capital and high-tech industry development,'' said
James A. Adams Jr., president of GIA. ``But it will be worth
nothing if Georgia's public policy prohibits Internet sales by the
product makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Morie, president of the Georgia Automobile Dealers
Association, said he was surprised groups outside the auto industry
care so much about an auto bill. ``Somebody's fueling this fire,''
Morie said. ``It's scare tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech economics Professor Mark J. McCabe, a former
economist with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Justice
Department, said the bill would protect dealers at the expense of
consumers, who he thinks would tend to pay more for cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust laws of this country are meant to protect
competition in the marketplace, not competitors,'' he wrote in a
recent letter to Barnes.

 &HT;    Few problems predicted for conventioneers in Atlanta over
Freaknik weekend
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the past, there have been occasions when they mixed
like oil and water. But this weekend, officials expect few problems
between visitors in town for Freaknik and those in the city for
conventions and meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is the city expects a smaller Freaknik crowd,
said Bill Howard, vice president of marketing, tourism and
communications for the Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. Last
year, an estimated 50,000 were in town for the annual street party,
and even that was down from previous years.
</P>
<P>
   It reached chaotic proportions in 1995, when about 200,000
Freaknik visitors converged on the city, clogging downtown streets
and interstates.
</P>
<P>
   What the city doesn't want is a repeat of 1997, when TruServe,
parent company of True Value Hardware, held a convention of 15,000
retailers in Atlanta during Freaknik weekend. Conventioneers were
so upset by the crowds and traffic jams that Mayor Bill Campbell
went to Chicago later and apologized to TruServe's president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel, based on the amount of interest _ or lack of
interest _ that we've seen, that the event is likely to be smaller,
and we are anticipating the impact on conventions and activities in
the city will not be significant,'' Howard said. ``In the past,
we've gotten a lot of inquiries, but the calls are way down this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to be ``responsible,'' Howard said the bureau passes on
as much information as possible to groups coming to the city during
Freaknik weekend. He said the city's traffic plan will help keep
congestion around downtown to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners are doing their part as well. Many said they
have gotten wise to the goings-on of Freaknik and often schedule
events at the convention site so attendees have few reasons to
venture outside.
</P>
<P>
   Others contract with bus companies to ferry conventioneers
around and advise exhibitors to ship freight in advance to avoid
delays
</P>
<P>
   Several conventions will be in town during the Freaknik weekend,
according to the ACVB calendar, including: the Military Chaplains
Association of the USA, which will bring 125 participants; the
International Tunnel &AMP; Turnpike Association, with 300; and the
International Association for Management Education, with 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We booked this piece of business about five years ago,'' said
Anita Craig, director of conferences for the International
Association of Management Education. ``It wasn't until much later
that we became aware of the possibility that we would be happening
in concert with this activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig estimates about half the convention visitors will arrive
on Saturday for the IAME conference at the Atlanta Hilton. Several
events, including a tour of CNN and a reception at the World Of
Coca-Cola at Underground Atlanta, won't occur until Freaknik is
winding down or ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do is to get some information from
city officials about strategies for traveling,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some conventions end right before Freaknik begins
or starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For instance the Association for Information &AMP; Image Management
convention, which was expected to bring about 37,000 people, ends
today, but some people likely will stay over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be an issue for us,'' said
spokesman Evan Weisel. ``The exhibits end at 4 p.m. on Thursday and
we will start breaking down that afternoon through the night.''
</P>
<P>
   But conventions and Freaknik won't be the only draws in the city
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta Hawks take to the courts against the Orlando Magic
at 7:30 p.m. Friday at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   _ About 1,200 people have paid between $50 and $75 each to
attend the Biltmore Diamond Jubilee from 5:30 p.m. until midnight
Saturday. The event is a benefit for the Atlanta Preservation
Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also on Saturday, there will be a 7:30 p.m. semi-pro soccer
league game at DeKalb Memorial Stadium on North Indian Creek Drive.
Traffic leaving the soccer game will not be allowed to exit onto
Memorial Drive. Instead, it will be routed from North Indian Creek
Drive through Clarkston to Ponce de Leon Ave., and Interstate 285
North.

 &HT;    Dry season filled with wildfires expected in South
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fields too dusty to plant in South Georgia. Wildfires
flaring up from the Everglades to the Appalachian Mountains. A
Chattahoochee River tumbling whitewater down from the North Georgia
hills at less than half its normal volume.
</P>
<P>
   A dry winter and spring are slowly pointing toward a drought
summer throughout most of Georgia, Florida and parts of Tennessee,
Alabama and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   The trends indicate the summer of 1999 could return the region
to the parched 1980s, a time when water shortages plagued metro
Atlanta, farmers suffered crop failures and reservoirs like Lake
Lanier dropped water levels to show muddy, red banks all summer
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get some significant rain in the next month, we
will experience the same drought conditions we had in the 1980s,''
predicted Jack Bushong, a hydro-meteorologist with the Southeast
River Forecasting Center, a branch of the National Weather Service
that predicts stream flows.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of a likely drought in Georgia is the fact that
all major rivers in the state are flowing at one-third to one-half
of normal this month, a time when those streams should be cresting
from spring rains, Bushong points out.
</P>
<P>
   Already, scores of wildfires are scorching chunks of the
Southern landscape from the mountains to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, the dry weather contributed to a brush fire
along Ga. 400 Wednesday afternoon. Thick smoke from the pine-straw
blaze halted northbound traffic for about 15 minutes and caused a
traffic backup to Interstate 285.
</P>
<P>
   In Tennessee, jail inmates and the Air National Guard were being
used to battle forest fires in the central and eastern sections of
the state. More than 4,000 acres have burned in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, where raging wildfires last year ruined the Fourth
of July tourist season, Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday declared a state
of emergency and may call out the National Guard to help fight
fires popping up from the fringes of Miami in the south to near
Jacksonville in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The past two days, Georgia has had more than 200 wildfires
covering more than 6,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Campers were evacuated from Stephen Foster State Park in the
Okefenokee Swamp last weekend in the wake of a 600-acre blaze that
is still burning. In the high country of North Carolina, the U.S.
Forest Service has banned all campfires expect those in designated
fire rings and grills in the Pisgah and Nantahala National forests.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists are blaming the trend on La Nina, a cooling of
Pacific waters off the coast of South American that affects global
weather. While El Nino is famous for bringing storms to North
America, experts say La Nina tends to cause drought in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The wildcard in all the predictions by weather experts is the
fact that La Nina years also tend to produce more tropical storms
and hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get all the rain back at once and that's not
necessarily a good thing,'' says Mike Helfert, director of the
Southeast Regional Climate Center in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   For now, what concerns experts is that winter and spring rains
were far below normal throughout much of Georgia. That is the time
of year when rain and snow seep into the earth to recharge the
groundwater tables. It is groundwater boiling up from springs that
feed rivers like the Chattahoochee and Etowah during the normally
drier summer and fall seasons. The Chattahoochee, which flows into
Lake Lanier, and the Etowah, which flows into Lake Allatoona,
provide most of metro Atlanta's drinking water. Right now, both
lakes are three feet below normal for April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern for us, but it's too early to draw any
conclusions,'' said Rob Holland, spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, the agency that manages the two reservoirs vital to
Atlanta. ``The weather can change pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Southeast Region Climate Center scientists are
predicting that current drought conditions in Florida and South
Georgia will likely expand northward over the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-range forecast is for hotter than normal and dryer
than normal this summer,'' says Helfert. ``Atlanta could be in for
a long, hot and dry summer. And there are lot more people there to
put demands on the water supply than 13 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past several weeks, a weather pattern has emerged that
blocks most of the moisture of cold fronts from reaching Georgia,
Florida and parts of the Carolinas, Alabama and Tennessee, said
Helfert.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of hot, dry air is holding steady over the Southeast.
The wedge of higher pressure is forcing cold fronts to go north and
what moisture does make it through the ridge falls only as light,
scattered showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a powerful cold front to break through this
ridge, but we are running out of time for that to happen,'' Helfert
added.

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER CAUGHT OFF GUARD DURING LIVE TV DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is usually the
supreme master of the television screen, his gaze more direct than
any anchor's, his language more focused, authoritative and
articulate than any other politician's in this country.
</P>
<P>
   And so it astonished Israelis to see him unfocused, rattled and
on the defensive in a live, informal debate Tuesday night with his
former defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, the Center Party candidate for prime minister,
skewered his former boss as untrustworthy, while the prime
minister, looking ashen-faced and stunned, shuffled his papers as
if searching for the best response. Ehud Barak, the Labor Party
candidate, chose to absent himself, perhaps with keen foresight,
since he emerged as above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Close associates have never seen Netanyahu, the Likud Party
leader, at such a loss for words.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, with a knowing smirk on his face, not only jabbed at
Netanyahu's weak spots but also mocked him, sometimes laughing at
the prime minister's answers.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Netanyahu by his nickname, Bibi, he attacked him as
Barak never could, from the vantage of someone who knows well how
the prime minister behaves behind closed doors. Mordechai described
him as too impatient to listen to others during Cabinet meetings,
and too arrogant to interpret defections from his Cabinet and from
his party as reflections on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there is something really wrong with you, with your
values, your behavior and your trustworthiness?'' Mordechai asked,
staring at the prime minister. ``What? Everyone's wrong and only
you're right?''
</P>
<P>
   The judgment by Nachum Barnea, a political columnist for Yedioth
Ahronoth, a leading Israeli newspaper, was, ``Netanyahu, the
television wiz, was beaten on his home court.''
</P>
<P>
   One television critic likened it to an episode of ``The Jerry
Springer Show'' titled ``Israeli Prime Ministers and the Defense
Ministers Who Hate Them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the most riveting moment so far in a campaign that
has been strangely lackluster: ``a long drawn out, dismal play in
which there has been little ado about nothing,'' in the words of
the writer Gideon Samets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that last night was important, even very
important, a kind of turning point,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a
political scientist at Hebrew University, speaking on Wednesday.
``It offered the first public evidence that Netanyahu is
defeatable. It showed the chinks in the armor of the invincible
political manipulator. Can the emperor in `The Emperor's New
Clothes' recover by getting dressed and reappearing in the parade?
That is the question.''
</P>
<P>
   In the attenuated election race, which began in December when
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government was dissolved, all
three major parties have been vying for the many voters in the
political center by de-emphasizing their ideological differences.
It has made for dull interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Barak have been running neck in neck in the polls,
with Mordechai trailing. But many Israelis do not trust the polls
since they failed to predict Netanyahu's victory in 1996. Political
commentators here like to twist an adage, saying Israelis tell the
truth to the pollsters, but lie in the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   For this debate, television viewership was very high, with 44
percent of the 1.5 million Israeli households watching, more than
saw the popular Miss Israel beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   For many the debate seemed to underscore two things: that the
race is a referendum on the performance and credibility of
Netanyahu, who may be showing uncharacteristic signs of strain, and
that Mordechai, underestimated throughout his career, plays a
pivotal role, even if it is more as spoiler or kingmaker than as
potential prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, political commentators noted that Netanyahu's strategic
accomplishment during the debate was to push Mordechai to say
publicly that he would not withdraw. If Mordechai did pull out and
join forces with Barak, polls indicate, they would trounce the
prime minister in the first round of voting. With Mordechai in, no
one will get a majority on May 17 and there will be a run-off
election on June 1, the polls show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The freewheeling debate sizzled with the unresolved tensions
between the politicians. Early this year, Netanyahu dismissed
Mordechai as defense minister, and he did so live on television, at
the top of the evening news. Mordechai almost immediately left
Likud to lead the fledgling Center Party, whose principal aim is to
oust the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting back, Netanyahu called it ``a party of losers'' that
stood for nothing but ``hate'' _ of him.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Cabinet members, Mordechai had never publicly aired
his disagreements with Netanyahu. Popular with Israelis for what
they perceive as his decency, he is not known for personal attacks.
Perhaps then Netanyahu did not expect the assault; perhaps he was
tired from round-the-clock campaigning while continuing to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli voters may have been turned off by Mordechai's
treatment of a prime minister. ``Bibi, relax, don't lose your
cool,'' Mordechai said at one point, laughing at him. ``I know what
you look like when you lose your cool.''
</P>
<P>
   When Netanyahu tried to portray himself as the leader who
oversaw an era relatively free of terrorism, Mordechai immediately
retorted that he, as defense minister, was in charge of security.
</P>
<P>
   Like boxers, both candidates had teams who rushed in to freshen
their makeup and offer strategic counsel during commercial breaks.
But Sima Kadmon, a political writer for Yedioth Ahronoth, did not
think that Mordechai, motivated by the desire to ``exact
retribution against his ex-boss,'' needed all that help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mordechai didn't need any coaching,'' she said on Wednesday.
``He didn't need any papers. The person scrambling after the papers
and charts was, oddly enough, the grand master of television. He
lost his tongue last night.''
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Netanyahu likened the event to the Nixon-Kennedy
debate in 1960, saying Netanyahu won the debate on ideas _ there
was some discussion of issues _ but lost it in body language.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts said the real winner was Barak, whose chief
opponent's character was brutally attacked _ by someone else. Barak
chose on Wednesday to dismiss both opponents in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw last night was a good show for television,'' he
said. ``It gave a lot of insight into the way the country was
managed for the last two and a half years.''

WHEREVER YOU ARE, DR. ROSS, I WILL FIND YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a cad! Almost two months and not a peep out of Doug Ross,
the peevish pediatrician from ``ER.'' Two months! Where are his
manners?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right. He doesn't have any.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you may recall that I wrote him in February, right after
he walked out on all his friends at County General in Chicago and
hinted that he might be heading for Portland, Ore., or Seattle. Has
he written back? Nope. Has he shown his face? Uh-uh. Bubkes. No
letter. No e-mail. Not even a phone call, and all he has to do is
dial 10-10 CHEAPSKATE. James Garner said so. Or Dennis Miller?
Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else to do but try again.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Ross,
</P>
<P>
   Word is you've been in Communicado, which I understand is very
pleasant this time of year as long as the sand fleas haven't
hatched. But is there no post office in Communicado? No telephone
booth? No fax machine next to the nacho-cheese pump at the
quickee-mart?
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that your failure to reply to my letter of Feb. 25
has been duly noted by the human relations directors of every
hospital and clinic in the Puget Sound region, including the Mold
Spore Institute and its new offshoot, the Constant Runny Nose
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't about your future in the Magnificent Moist, Doug.
We'll deal with your qualifications as a physician later, and don't
think that lying low for a while will make people here forget what
you did in Chicago: lying high, insubordination, failure to steer
into the skid. These things will stay on your record for a long
time, mister, possibly as long as it takes Peter Benton to smile.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, recent developments in Chicago have forced me to
redouble efforts to reach you. This letter is about being a man,
Doug. An hombre. A mensch. A chilovyek.
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that I know Russian? Me too. But I thought it might
make you think of Carol Hathaway, your Ukrainian princess, the
woman who adores you, though I can't figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   She's pregnant, Doug. With child! In a family way! Bun in the
oven! And you da man!
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that? You're a doctor, for Pete's sake. And who's
Pete? He shouldn't be your main concern right now. Haven't you ever
heard of pro, pro, protection?
</P>
<P>
   Carol says she hasn't heard from you since you left Chicago, yet
your picture in USA Today shows you at the Playboy Mansion
celebrating Hugh Hefner's birthday last weekend. Says you attended
under the name George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   Nice try, Doug. But I'll track you down. And when I do, I'll
make you do right by Carol or, or, or I'll start watching ``48
Hours'' on CBS. I will.

CHILEAN IMMIGRANT CLAIMS $197 MILLION LOTTERY PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BRAINTREE, Mass. _ She lived in one of the grandest homes on
Beacon Hill, a brick townhouse in exclusive Louisburg Square. But
until last week, Maria J. Grasso was hired help, a live-in
babysitter who cared and cooked for the four children of
multi-millionaires Chris and Hilary Gabrieli.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Chilean immigrant who has spent the last three decades
caring for other people's children, is richer than her former boss.
And as the single winner of the $197 million Big Game lottery _ the
second largest jackpot in U.S. history _ she'll never have to work
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had the time to think clearly but I have a lot of
plans. I want to help my family with this big fortune,'' Grasso
said Wednesday, standing before a slew of reporters at State
Lottery headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso, a 54-year-old divorced mother of two, wore a crisp navy
suit speckled with gold at the wrist and along the collar _ one of
the few indulgences she has made since her windfall, said her
attorney Robert Jahrling.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour before the press conference, Jahrling deposited
Grasso's check for $70,244,814.02 _ her lump sum payment minus
$34.5 million in taxes. It amounts to $104 million because she
chose a lump sum payment, rather than the total amount spread out
over 26 annual installments.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement laid to rest intense, persistent speculation
that a Nigerian taxi driver named Patrick Okusanya had won. On
Friday, after published reports included his full name, Okusanya
sought the help of an attorney to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not win,'' he insisted, even as rumors grew that the
winning ticket was locked in his attorney's safe.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso, for one, said she felt bad for Okusanya and wished she
could've spoken up earlier, but couldn't because she wanted to
consult lawyers first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sorry for him,'' Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a faint accent, Grasso recounted the moment that
changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday night, she sat down to watch the nightly news and
jotted down the lottery numbers as they were drawn. She debated
with herself over whether she should check her ticket right then or
wait until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to check them right away but then I said, `Oh, I
will check them,' and I did and I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In one hand, she held the numbers she had written down. In the
other was the winning ticket. But, she thought, how could she have
won?
</P>
<P>
   So she waited anxiously till the end of the news, and checked
again when the winning numbers were flashed one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it,'' Grasso said.
``I couldn't sleep that night. I couldn't believe it could be me. I
thought, `It can't be me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Grasso said she kept the ticket by her side on the
bed. The next morning, she told Hilary and Chris Gabrieli _ and she
quit her job.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said she had purchased three tickets at the Star Market
in Boston's Fenway neighborhood while shopping for groceries for
the Gabrieli family. Grasso said she usually doesn't play the
lottery, but was enticed by the signs declaring the huge jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   She purchased one ticket with three chances to win, picking the
numbers randomly. The odds of winning the jackpot: one in 52
million.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso said while she doesn't have specific plans for the money,
she will ``take care of my large family'' including her parents in
Santiago, Chile, as well as her daughter and son, both college
students raised in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In her native Santiago, Grasso's jackpot quickly became national
news. At 12:30 p.m., Grasso's older sister, Ana Luisa Becerra
appeared on Television Nacional de Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very good sister,'' Becerra said. ``She will help us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Becerra said that Maria has labored all her life and deserved to
win. ``She suffered. She had to go outside the country and help
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after Becerra appeared on television, reporters had
surrounded the family home in La Reina, a tree-lined neighborhood
on Santiago's east side. The family ultimately fled to a hide-a-way
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Louisburg Square Wednesday, peals of laughter and whoops
of delight rang out from the Gabrieli kitchen, where the Gabrieli
children were watching Grasso on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our Maria,'' said one young voice. ``Oh, yay! Hooray
Maria!'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   The downstairs windows were covered with black paper to block
prying eyes of reporters _ a sharp contrast to the openness of the
family during Gabrieli's failed campaign for a seat in Congress
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli, a venture capitalist and co-Chairman of MassINC., a
public policy institute, spent $5 million on his failed campaign.
He placed sixth in last summer's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Grasso's fortune rippled past the potted topiary
shrubs on the Gabrielis' home and quickly spread throughout the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute postman Chris MacDonnell said he had not met Grasso,
but he'd sure like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna know her so I can ask her to marry me,'' said
MacDonnell. He added that already has a wife, but she might
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But one prim neighbor scoffed at the idea of going public with
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gabrielis are being so open,'' said the woman in a smart
black suit who declined to give her name. ``I wouldn't tell a soul
if I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso lived with the Gabrielis for 2 1/2 years, and came to
know them as a second family, particularly since her grown children
were away at college.
</P>
<P>
   While Grasso declined to give details about her children,
associates said her son is studying for the priesthood in New
Jersey and her daughter is married and studying in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso was 26 when she arrived in New York City in 1971 to visit
a friend, but liked the city so much she decided to stay, said Ray
Howell, a public relations representative she was urged to hire.
Howell said he's unclear whether she arrived with a visa allowing
her to visit.
</P>
<P>
   She married in 1976, but it ended a decade later. Her first job
was very much like her last _ a live-in nanny.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her time in New York, Grasso tended to find jobs as a
caregiver. She was a teaching assistant at a day treatment center
for mentally disabled adults, and later in the Staten Island public
school system while working part time for United Cerebral Palsy of
New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso earned a General Education Diploma in New York and
attended college there, but ultimately moved to Boston in 1996. A
newspaper ad led her to a full-time, live-in job with the Gabrieli
family.
</P>
<P>
   Though she'll never have to work again, Grasso said she intends
to stay involved with special-needs children and those with
physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't do it physically,'' Grasso said. ``This would be a
chance for me to give something.''

<P>
   Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of
Ireland scheduled urgent talks in London on Thursday after two days
of negotiations in Belfast failed to resolve the impasse over
guerrilla disarmament that is blocking formation of a new
government in Northern Ireland. Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, and its hard-line Protestant rival brought the talks to a
halt by rejecting a blueprint for settling the dispute.

   The House of Lords rejected a bill passed by the House of
Commons lowering the age of consent for gay sex from 18 to 16, the
age at which heterosexual sex is legal in Britain. The action
delays but does not defeat the measure since the government can

STARR DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS AT HEARING INTO FUTURE OF INDEPENDENT
COUNSEL LAW

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rebuked by Democrats at a Senate hearing Wednesday,
Kenneth Starr defended his prosecutorial tactics and judgment in
the investigation of President Clinton's relationship with a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go out on the steps of the courthouse and
say, `The prosecutor is out of control,' '' Starr declared
indignantly when senators referred to him as a legal zealot whose
inquisitorial approach had ignored professional standards for
federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, whose professorial demeanor cracked several times
during the hearing, said that the courts had never reproached him.
``How frequently does the judge supervising the grand jury say,
`The prosecutor is out of control'? To us, none. Not once have we
been found to have conducted ourselves inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than three hours of testimony at a hearing of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which is considering changes in the
independent counsel law, Starr insisted that he had followed
Justice Department rules that apply to all federal prosecutors.
Democrats expressed skepticism at Starr's announcement that he
opposed reauthorizing the statute that had created his multipronged
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you live long enough, you'll experience everything,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., after Starr defended his own
inquiry while he recommended jettisoning the independent counsel
law, whose failings were underscored for many lawmakers through
Starr's own conduct in the Monica Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Sen Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., who is not a Governmental Affairs
Committee member, issued a statement saying that Starr's remarks
were ``like Jack the Ripper calling for more neighborhood patrols
because of the surge in victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has told Starr that it plans to open an
inquiry into his operation, including his handling of Ms. Lewinsky
at the outset of the inquiry. It will also examine whether Starr
failed to disclose possible conflicts of interest in January 1998
when he asked Attorney General Janet Reno to expand his
jurisdiction to investigate the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry has been slow to get under way because of conflicts
between Starr and Ms. Reno over how it will be conducted. Ms. Reno
has wanted to ensure that she retains her authority to discipline
independent counsels, and Starr has insisted that no investigation
should undercut his independence from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to shelter Starr from partisan attacks. Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the chairman of the panel, lavished praise
on Starr's prosecutorial record, saying that he had obtained a
dozen guilty pleas and convictions and ``weathered withering
attacks, some of which were exceedingly personal and
vituperative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., regarded as one of the Senate's
most knowledgeable students of the independent counsel law,
criticized Starr for conduct not intended under the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, you've gone beyond what an average prosecutor
would do in the investigation of a private citizen,'' the senator
said, adding: ``You've spent millions investigating possible
perjury in a civil suit that top prosecutors of both political
stripes who were not personally involved in the matter have said no
reasonable prosecutor would pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Also testifying about the independent counsel law was Judge
David B. Sentelle, the head of the panel that appoints such
counsels, who said that lawmakers could not expect the panel to
review the conduct of those they appoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``My answer is that the panel can exercise no or at least
virtually no oversight,'' he said, because the Supreme Court had
ruled that such an oversight function would erode the authority of
the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard J. Durbin, D-Ill., asked Starr what he would do if
the statute was not renewed when it lapses in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the statute lapses the independent counsel is called upon
to make a professional judgment as to whether it is required that
he continue certain matters,'' Starr said. ``And that's a judgment
that I haven't had to face yet. But presumably I may or will have
to face that on June 30th.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin shot back, ``And it is possible that Congress may
intervene and decide that in its judgment it's time for you to head
off to some university, or whatever your future plans may entail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do that once, senator,'' Starr responded, referring
to a plan he once had to take an academic post at Pepperdine
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you did,'' Durbin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't work out,'' Starr went on. ``But maybe you can do it
for me, senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin stared at Starr. ``Be careful what you wish for.''

SENATE PANEL APPLAUDS CHANGES AT IRS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year after sharply criticizing the Internal
Revenue Service, saying it abused taxpayers, members of the Senate
Finance Committee praised the new tax commissioner, Charles O.
Rossotti, Wednesday for beginning fundamental reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But they were far from sure that the problems had been entirely
solved. Republicans expressed fear that abuses would continue,
while Democrats warned that reform would fail without more
financing. Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the
committee, in praising Rossotti for his initial reform steps, said
he was implementing the spirit as well as the letter of the IRS
restructuring law that Congress passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then he began pressing Rossotti about who had been disciplined
for past abuses and what was being done to create a culture ``that
is intolerant of abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti replied that he disciplined 12 officials in September
for using dollar quotas in collections. He said such quotas had not
only been banned but also that he had made regulations that would
result in new ways of measuring performance, such as how well
officials serve customers, as the IRS now calls taxpayers. He
detailed several changes he had made to encourage the flow of ideas
within the agency and to protect whistle-blowers from even subtle
forms of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R- Fla., said he was concerned that despite
the outrage flowing from last year's hearings ``SWAT-team tactics''
were increasing. He cited a report on Tuesday by William H.
Webster, former director of the FBI and CIA, about abuse of
taxpayers by IRS criminal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But Webster, whose report cited isolated examples of misconduct
but no systematic abuse, did not dispute the need for armed raids.
He said only that agencies with more appropriate training should
conduct them on behalf of the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who said that he expected his $8.2 billion budget to
be the same next year, outlined plans to retrain all employees and
replace an outmoded computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats said that without extra money the costs for
training and new computers would have to be financed by making deep
cuts in audits and other enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to collect what is owed,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad,
D-N.D., and a former tax commissioner of that state. He said that
IRS audits of the highest income taxpayers had fallen to 1 in 60
last year from 1 in 9 a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who has played a crucial role in
changing the IRS, repeatedly pressed for more financing, but none
of the Republicans said a word about increasing the IRS budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the IRS budget, adjusted for inflation, has declined
5 percent, while the number of tax returns has grown nearly 12
percent and tax collections have grown 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey emphasized the need for the independent nine-member IRS
oversight board that was called for in the IRS restructuring act,
``so its chairman can come before this committee and say, `Sen.
Roth you are making our job of reform hell because you are not
getting us the money we need to do the job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton missed a January deadline to appoint six citizens to the
board, which will also include the tax commissioner, the Treasury
Secretary and an officer of the Treasury workers union. Senators in
both parties were critical of delay.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, responded that the law set
an unrealistic deadline for finding the six citizens and
investigating their backgrounds. He said the appointments would
soon be announced.

 &HT;    It takes a village to make a Carter
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCHIEL, South Africa _ Here, they call him Musa.
</P>
<P>
   The word means ``kindness'' in Zulu, but Jason Carter says
that's not necessarily why these villagers on the eastern edge of
South Africa call him that. It just happens to be a common name.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that they love him. Everywhere he
walks, people hail him from the yards of their huts or from the
roofs they are repairing, and he answers in fluent Zulu, sharing a
joke, a smile, a wave _ and, it seems, more than a little of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to me, I would stay with him forever,'' said
Lucky Sipho, an occupational therapy assistant who lives in
Lochiel. ``I wish he could be in South Africa to be employed
permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Carter has given something to Lochiel, a little village
that time and Pretoria have forgotten, it is obvious, too, that
Lochiel has given something back to him.
</P>
<P>
   For in this village, while serving in the Peace Corps, Jason
Carter _ grandson of former President Carter, great-grandson of
Peace Corps volunteer Lillian Carter _ has found himself.
</P>
<P>
   To watch him in action is to see someone fully alive. He brims
with vitality. He lopes up the village hills. He grins as he greets
the multitude of friends he has made. He cannot wait to explain the
insights he has gained into South Africa, and everything he sees _
a house, a road, even the telephone wires _ reminds him of
something else he's figured out about the place.
</P>
<P>
   His mind is so active, there will never be time enough to tell
it all. The words tumble one over the other in his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 23, is the son of Jimmy Carter's son Jack, a commodities
trader. He left Atlanta on Jan. 16, 1998, as part of the second
group of Peace Corps volunteers ever to serve in South Africa. By
August, when the fourth group of volunteers arrives, about 110
volunteers will be in the country.
</P>
<P>
   After three months of training, both in Zulu and more generally
in how to be a Peace Corps volunteer, Carter arrived in Lochiel on
April 14 of last year.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a masonry cabin, part of a hotel built by a Scotsman
in the 1920s. The room is bare but for a bed, some shelves and
Carter's laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   On one shelf sit two caps _ one bearing the logo of the Atlanta
Falcons, the other from the USS Jimmy Carter, a nuclear submarine
the Navy named last year in honor of his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Carter spends his spare time these days reading ``Taking
Charge,'' a book based on Lyndon B. Johnson's White House tapes.
But his most prized possession _ the only thing he says he's ever
felt like showing off to other people _ is another book: ``Long
Walk to Freedom,'' the autobiography of South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the front cover, the book bears this inscription: ``To
Jason, Musa, Best wishes to one of our impressive future leaders.
Nelson Mandela. 6-4-98.''
</P>
<P>
   The main job of Peace Corps volunteers in South Africa is to
help rural schools recover from the effects of decades of neglect
under the apartheid policy of ``Bantu education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bantu Education Act was introduced in 1953 by Hendrik
Verwoerd _ the apartheid government's minister of Native Affairs
and later prime minister _ who described its purpose this way:
``Natives will be taught from childhood to realize that equality
with Europeans is not for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bantu education was opposed prominently by an anti-apartheid
activist named Nelson Mandela, who said at the time that it was
``an inferior type of education designed to relegate Africans to a
position of perpetual servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that in the early 1970s, the government spent 16
times as much on each white student as on each black one. Although
that disparity was cut in half toward the end of the apartheid era,
the effects of that official neglect will linger for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Sisukumile Secondary School in Lochiel, for example, has no
electricity, no science lab, not nearly enough textbooks and no VCR
or television to show instructional videotapes, said the principal,
July Amos Tshabalala.
</P>
<P>
   The average class size is 60. Most parents are illiterate,
unconvinced of the benefits of education and unsupportive of their
children's studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids do not have role models,'' Tshabalala said. ``They
have no one to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   The government pays the teachers' salaries, but nothing else,
Tshabalala said. To meet the school's other expenses, he charges
each student 30 rands a year, about $5. He tried to double the fee
last year, but backed down in the face of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   With 700 students, that gives him a budget of $3,500. Of that,
he spent $1,500 burglar-proofing the school. About $470 went to buy
paper. Then there's money for sports _ uniforms, balls and other
equipment _ and precious little else.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are those the only problems, said Carter. It is not uncommon
to see a child having an epileptic seizure in school for lack of
medicine. Some children walk long distances to school and faint in
class for lack of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any really grandiose ideas about how much I'm
going to accomplish,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is trying to make small improvements where he can _
improvements that will last after he has gone. He is teaching
administrators to use a computer that was donated by an outside
organization a year ago, but never turned on. He is helping set up
a library at the secondary school, where he also works once a week
as a guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job,'' Tshabalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter works mostly with the primary school, where he is having
teachers meet regularly so they can help one another solve
problems. He is helping implement a new outcomes-based education
curriculum _ geared more to problem solving than to stuffing
students with facts _ that is being put in place nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   And when he runs into trouble, he consults Serena Hayes, a
teacher who is a Peace Corps volunteer in a nearby village, a sight
that initially stunned the people of Lochiel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see that I'm a white male and she's a black woman, and
I'm asking her for help,'' he said. ``Which is a big thing. It's a
sight to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has seen the Third World before, having worked with the
Carter Center in the Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East. What
astonishes him most about South Africa is not that Third World
conditions exist, but the contrasts that persist within the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In upscale suburbs of Johannesburg, with their concentrations of
Mercedeses and malls, one could just as well be in London or New
York or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But in Lochiel, as in much of rural South Africa, people live in
traditional homes made of mud and sticks and the schools have no
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want people to understand about South Africa,''
Carter said. ``And one thing you've got to understand is that it is
a First World country. And the other thing you have to understand
is that it is a Third World country.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city, there is a stock exchange. In the village, there is
no water safe to drink.
</P>
<P>
   All around him, Carter sees metaphors _ the highway on which
cars whiz by without even knowing they've passed a village; the
electric wires that run overhead without stopping. Traffic,
telephones, electricity and progress have passed by Lochiel as if
it were not even there.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter stayed, and it has been to his benefit.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves the Peace Corps next year, the Duke University
graduate will probably go to law school. It will be hard for him to
leave Lochiel, Carter said, but he knows that, in important ways,
the gifts of Lochiel will never leave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he said, ``is where I've become who I'm going to be.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES POSTS HUGE LOSS FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With the market already limping from Tuesday's
earnings report by Intel Corp., the massive first-quarter loss
reported Wednesday by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. sent investors in
technology stocks scrambling for the exits, leaving NASDAQ with a
75-point drop, its eighth largest point decline ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a permanent _ and I emphasize the word
`permanent' _ change in the microprocessor business, and I don't
think prices will ever recover,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with
S.G. Cowen. Noting that the basic design behind Intel and Advanced
Micro's microprocessors is now 20 years old, he said that ``PCs and
microprocessors have stagnated in their technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is the PC business driven by technological
advancement,'' Peck said. ``It's driven purely by price.''
</P>
<P>
   And the brutal price competition of the last two years is now
exacting a heavy toll.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro had warned on three occasions that the quarter
would be weak, and the actual loss was slightly smaller than
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended March 28, Advanced Micro reported a loss
of $128.4 million, compared with a loss of $62.7 million in the
comparable period a year ago. Revenues rose 17 percent to $631.6
million, from $540.9 million in the first quarter of 1998. The
results for the first quarter include a charge of $15 million for
restructuring and other special charges.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's loss was equivalent to 88 cents a share, or 81 cents a
share without the restructuring and other charges. Analysts, who
had been projecting a loss of 9 cents earlier in the quarter, had
by Wednesday upped that to 92 cents, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues declined 20 percent from the $788.8 million reported in
the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Those results, widely viewed as devastating, further clarified
what Intel's modest revenue shortfall Tuesday only hinted at _ that
the pricing environment for microprocessors, the silicon brains of
personal computers, is the worst it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   But while Intel eked out earnings of 57 cents a diluted share _
in line with analysts' expectations _ through manufacturing
efficiencies and cost savings _ Advanced Micro struggled to make
projected volumes of its AMD-K6-2 microprocessors, particularly the
faster chips, which command higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of disappointing first-quarter results, Intel warned
Tuesday that second-quarter sales would be flat or slightly lower,
a direction the company attributed to seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
   Further fueling investor anxiety Wednesday was the fact that
both chip makers' earnings reports followed a warning from Compaq
Computer Corp. on Friday that its first-quarter results would fall
far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, this week has also seen strong comebacks by two
recently troubled technology companies. Tuesday, Motorola Inc.
reported a 20 percent rise in profits, mostly as a result of its
cellular telephone business, and Apple Computer Inc., which was all
but written off by the market in the last few years, Wednesday
released solid net income well above analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro shares closed Wednesday at $14.75, down 75 cents,
on the New York Stock Exchange. Intel closed at $57, down $3.50, in
NASDAQ trading.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the immediate future, the basic arithmetic leaves
little hope for much improvement. With a $500 personal computer
offering most of the performance and features of a $1,500 PC,
nearly all of the industry's growth has shifted to the low end.
There is no room for a $500 microprocessor in a $500 PC, so the
bulk of Advanced Micro and Intel's sales volume has shifted to less
costly chips.
</P>
<P>
   Intel can still make respectable profit margins with
lower-volume high-end chips for workstations, but Advanced Micro,
which does not make a workstation-class microprocessor, saw the
average price for its processors drop to $78 during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At National Semiconductor Corp., whose Cyrix unit has also
shared in that pain, chief executive Brian Halla blamed ``Intel's
jihad against AMD and AMD's production problems'' for the weakness
in the microprocessor business. Last month, National reported a
smaller than expected loss for its third fiscal quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, AMD chairman and chief
executive W.J. Sanders said, ``The best thing that can be said
about the first quarter is that it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders added, ``The significant decline in revenues reported by
AMD in the first quarter was almost entirely due to previously
reported AMD-K6-2 microprocessor yield issues.'' Yields improved in
the final weeks of the quarter, he said, asserting that the company
believed it would hit its goal of shipping five million units in
the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Peck remained skeptical. ``If they spend enough time and money,
presumably they can iron out the kinks in the manufacturing
process,'' he said. But he added that even if the yields can be
improved, there would be no foreseeable letup in pricing pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Intel, execution is quite good,'' he said, ``so some of
this is being disguised. For the time being, there's the appearance
of normalcy at Intel, but underneath they are facing the same kind
of turmoil.''  &QL;

 &HT;    S. Africa feels like home to ex-Georgian
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCHIEL, South Africa _ Moses Turner has traveled such a long
road since his childhood in the Timothy Road neighborhood of
Athens, Ga., that he has almost come full circle.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the Georgia of the 1940s and '50s, the son of a
carpenter and a maid. Water in his neighborhood had to be drawn
from a well. Turner was the first person from his community ever to
go to college.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't go to the University of Georgia, even though it
was in his back yard, because UGA in 1958 accepted no black
students. So he attended Albany State, in southwest Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to school, the best I could hope to be was a
teacher or a preacher,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end his career took a different arc. After serving in
the Army in Germany, where he developed an interest in
international travel that never left him, he became a dean at Texas
Tech and then spent 15 years at Michigan State, part of that time
as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from Timothy Road to become one of the chief executives
of a major educational institution _ ``that's a fair jump,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the age of 60, Turner has turned his career in a
different direction. As the new country director for the Peace
Corps in South Africa _ he began work here in March _ he is working
with a black population struggling to recover from years of racial
segregation, inferior education and an internalized sense of low
status that has outlived the official end of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   It's a job for which he feels well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many circumstances here which reflect the experiences of
a black growing up in rural Georgia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner still has ties to Georgia. His daughter, Shaul Turner,
was until recently an on-air reporter with Atlanta's WXIA, and his
sister, Myrtle Scott, owns a string of barbershops in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Turner plans to be an active country director, consulting often
with South African authorities and checking on Peace Corps
volunteers in the villages where they serve, just as he recently
visited Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy
Carter, in the village of Lochiel, near South Africa's border with
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Corps, unwelcome here during the apartheid era, has
operated in South Africa only since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, volunteers serve only in two provinces _ Mpumalanga
and the Northern Province _ and only in villages.
</P>
<P>
   Turner would like to expand to other provinces over time _ and
to the townships, the sprawling, densely populated areas that are
home to many poor urban blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues in the townships are more complex, and the safety
of volunteers there is more troublesome, so for now, he said, the
Peace Corps will stick to the villages.
</P>
<P>
   Turner believes the Peace Corps in South Africa can fulfill its
original mission more fully than it has yet anywhere in the world.
One step is having a far more diverse group of volunteers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the world, only about 3 percent of Peace Corps
volunteers are nonwhite. In South Africa, the number is more than
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That allows people in South Africa to see the true diversity of
the United States, and it compels volunteers, as they live and
train with other volunteers, to work through their own feelings
about race, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the international spotlight on South Africa as it
works to make its 5-year-old democracy function, the operation here
can be the flagship for the Peace Corps around the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do it well, people will know about it,'' he said. ``If
we screw it up, people will know about it.

 &HT;    Alabama lawmakers approve lottery
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Critics invoked the Bible, Sunday school,
innocent grandchildren and cherished Mommas, but even in this
bedrock conservative state, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   State senators approved Gov. Don Siegelman's controversial
lottery bill Wednesday, clearing the way for residents to vote on a
referendum to establish state-sponsored games to fund education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic moment for the state of Alabama,''
Siegelman said at a news conference after the vote. ``The future of
generations of Alabama children is now in the hands of the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he signs the legislation, Siegelman will set the date for
the referendum, which some officials said could come as early as
October 12 when Birmingham and Montgomery hold municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina also appears headed for a vote on a statewide
lottery this year. Both the House and Senate have passed lottery
bills and are now working out the differences between the two
versions.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, the 24-11 vote on the constitutional amendment
already approved by the House came after lottery opponents staged a
16-hour filibuster that carried over into the wee hours Wednesday,
with bleary-eyed, gravel-voiced senators trading hourlong turns at
the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't some little old bill that doesn't mean much,''
railed Sen. J.T. ``Jabo'' Waggoner, a leader of the small, mostly
Republican coterie of lottery opponents. ``This is an issue that
will affect our lives and our state for generations to come. This
is not what I want to be remembered for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waggoner and other doomsayers were swept aside by a tide of
pro-lottery sentiment triggered in part by the success of Georgia's
lottery and the gambling-fueled boom along the Mississippi Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that hundreds of millions of dollars have left
this state to buy lottery tickets in other states,'' Siegelman said
Wednesday as he prepared for the campaign to sell the lottery to
voters. ``We want to capture those dollars and keep them Alabama.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials have said it's too early to tell if an Alabama
lottery might hurt sales there.

   KUKES, Albania _ U.S. and NATO officials launched a probe
Wednesday into an apparent military attack that killed as many as
70 ethnic Albanians in a refugee convoy moving through Yugoslavia's
embattled Kosovo province near this border outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the incident were sketchy and in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, however, investigators with the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said refugees
reporting firsthand knowledge of the incident suggested that the
attack was staged by Serb troops who wanted to make it appear that
the killings were the work of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to my guys on the radio, they are convinced it's a set
up,'' Owen O'Sullivan, head of the OSCE field office in Kukes, said
late Wednesday night. The OSCE is a multinational organization
based in Vienna that groups the United States and more than 50
countries from western and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of stories (from refugees) that suggest it
was not NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy disaster occurred as Germany floated a peace proposal
that reportedly would allow Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia, a 24-hour reprieve in the NATO air
strikes, if he agrees to the terms the alliance has set forth for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials said the initiative was a
``constructive'' step toward keeping the diplomatic door open. They
dismissed out of hand, however, a suggestion by Milosevic that
United Nations monitors might take the place of NATO peacekeepers,
as the alliance has insisted upon, once the current conflict ebbs
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very useful effort and a necessary effort to begin
reflection in the alliance,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said of the
German proposal. ``But it's simply at the moment what you might
call a food-for- thought paper, a discussion paper, to provoke this
necessary reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from halting the bombing, officials with the Clinton
administration insisted that they would continue to intensify the
air campaign. The point was underscored with the deployment of 24
additional F-16 fighter/bombers and four more A-10 combat attack
jets. The aircraft, part of some 80 fresh warplanes and refueling
tankers the Pentagon approved last weekend for the NATO mission,
are due to arrive at Aviano Air Base in Italy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, the Pentagon is likely to order 300 more
warplanes and support craft to join the mission, said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the first of 24 Apache combat helicopters were
scheduled to fly out of Germany on Wednesday and arrive at a base
in Albania on Thursday. All of the helicopters were scheduled to be
in place in Albania by Saturday, though it wasn't clear how soon
they might be flying missions into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will persist relentlessly, and with determination, until
the crisis ends on acceptable terms,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in Washington. ``Serb security forces must leave so
that the refugees can re-enter, an international security presence
must be permitted, and the people of Kosovo must be given the
democratic self-government they have long deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic offered no such guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Citing mounting reports from eyewitnesses inside Kosovo, State
Department spokesman Jamie Rubin for the first time officially
accused Serb forces of using rape as a weapon of terror in a
campaign of repression that has driven up to 1.4 million ethnic
Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often takes time to confirm these reports,'' Rubin told
reporters, ``but there are so many credible reports from throughout
Kosovo that the conclusion is inescapable that Milosevic's forces
are using rape as a weapon of terror in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the continuing atrocities unfolding inside
Kosovo, the Pentagon produced a detailed map identifying more than
100 villages and towns across the tiny province that have been
torched, shelled or otherwise destroyed by rampaging Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO had verified at least three areas inside Kosovo
where military units continue to shell civilians, and the
Pentagon's Bacon said U.S. officials have received reports in
recent days of Serb helicopter attacks on refugee convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the reports had not been independently verified. They
echoed earlier incidents that were verified, however, by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO had also received reports of three more mass
graves, including one near Pristina reportedly containing 100
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most appalling stories is simply of large numbers
of Kosovar Albanians being herded around Kosovo like groups of
migratory cattle, sent to the border, then sent back to their
villages by Serb security forces, then told to leave again, as if
they're sort of pawns being moved around on a chess board,'' said
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This permanent movement, lack of shelter,'' Shea said, ``is
producing incidences of typhoid, cholera, scabies and pulmonary
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials estimate that there are somewhere
between 500,000 and 750,000 ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo that
have been driven from their homes. Many are concentrated in rugged
mountain areas more than a mile high, with little if any food or
shelter, to escape the depredations of the marauding Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO pressed its around-the-clock air campaign into their
23rd day with fresh attacks early Thursday, Shea said the
intensifying pressure the raids are placing on Serb forces in the
field and their support structures around Yugoslavia were quickly
turning the tide against Milosevic and his army.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials showed clips Wednesday of successful
attacks over the previous 24 hours on 14 major targets in Kosovo
and elsewhere across Yugoslavia -- a huge fuel storage and
distribution center in the provincial capital of Pristina, a
bridge, a railroad tunnel and other sites -- as well as tanks,
armored personnel carriers and military trucks supporting Serb army
and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO building toward a 1,000-aircraft armada over the
coming week, Shea said the arithmetic of the campaign is working in
favor of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day Milosevic has less, and every day we have more,''
said Shea. ``So this situation cannot go on indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In a harrowing new episode in the Kosovo crisis, refugees in a
convoy along a road near the southwestern town of Dakovica came
under a withering attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two starkly different versions of events quickly emerged.
</P>
<P>
   State-run television in Yugoslavia blamed the attack on NATO
pilots, saying they bombed the refugee convoy.
</P>
<P>
   If correct, that would be the single worst case of civilian
casualties in the three-week-old air campaign and the second major
incident this week involving civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Footage of the catastrophe was replayed over and over in
Yugoslavia, replete with scenes of children and elderly people
alike weeping and nursing what appeared to be serious wounds, after
their rag-tag convoy of tractors, wagons, livestock and carts came
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the issue is being investigated and details
could be available as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, pilots involved in the mission
told U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO supreme allied commander,
that they bombed military vehicles shortly after 3:30 p.m. (local
time) in the area where the convoy was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe they hit only military vehicles,'' Bacon told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, and the forward command aircraft that guide each
plane's individual bombing run, are under orders not to bomb unless
they can identify their target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to tell the difference between a tractor and a
tank,'' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald. ``Unless they're
sure, they will not drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark told Bacon that he had received independent, but not yet
verified, reports that Serb troops had positioned military vehicles
near the front and rear of a refugee convoy. Clark was
investigating reports that the Serbs, after being hit by the NATO
attack, turned their fury on the civilians, attacking them with
gunfire and grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he might have intelligence imagery to support that
claim as early as Thursday. He was looking into whether an unmanned
surveillance aircraft, a drone called the Predator, was in the area
at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the full facts are,'' Bacon said. ``We have
what Gen. Clark believes to be the facts, but he says the whole
thing is under review.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan had two teams of OSCE investigators trying to track
down what happened to the refugee column that came under assault en
route to this border town earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   He said none of the refugees who spoke to his teams said they
believed the assault came from a NATO plane.
</P>
<P>
   A translator for the humanitarian group Doctors of the World
said a woman had been treated in the white medical tent around 5:30
p.m. (local time) for wounds she said were caused by a hand grenade
or bomb. The woman had been transported out and had not given a
clear story of how she sustained the wounds.

   KUKES, Albania _ U.S. and NATO officials launched a probe
Wednesday into an apparent military attack that killed as many as
70 ethnic Albanians in a refugee convoy moving through Yugoslavia's
embattled Kosovo province near this border outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the incident were sketchy and in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, however, investigators with the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said refugees
reporting firsthand knowledge of the incident suggested that the
attack was staged by Serb troops who wanted to make it appear that
the killings were the work of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talking to my guys on the radio, they are convinced it's a set
up,'' Owen O'Sullivan, head of the OSCE field office in Kukes, said
late Wednesday night. The OSCE is a multinational organization
based in Vienna that groups the United States and more than 50
countries from western and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of stories (from refugees) that suggest it
was not NATO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The convoy disaster occurred as Germany floated a peace proposal
that reportedly would allow Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia, a 24-hour reprieve in the NATO air
strikes, if he agrees to the terms the alliance has set forth for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials said the initiative was a
``constructive'' step toward keeping the diplomatic door open. They
dismissed out of hand, however, a suggestion by Milosevic that
United Nations monitors might take the place of NATO peacekeepers,
as the alliance has insisted upon, once the current conflict ebbs
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very useful effort and a necessary effort to begin
reflection in the alliance,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said of the
German proposal. ``But it's simply at the moment what you might
call a food-for- thought paper, a discussion paper, to provoke this
necessary reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from halting the bombing, officials with the Clinton
administration insisted that they would continue to intensify the
air campaign. The point was underscored with the deployment of 24
additional F-16 fighter/bombers and four more A-10 combat attack
jets. The aircraft, part of some 80 fresh warplanes and refueling
tankers the Pentagon approved last weekend for the NATO mission,
are due to arrive at Aviano Air Base in Italy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, the Pentagon is likely to order 300 more
warplanes and support craft to join the mission, said Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the first of 24 Apache combat helicopters were
scheduled to fly out of Germany on Wednesday and arrive at a base
in Albania on Thursday. All of the helicopters were scheduled to be
in place in Albania by Saturday, though it wasn't clear how soon
they might be flying missions into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will persist relentlessly, and with determination, until
the crisis ends on acceptable terms,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in Washington. ``Serb security forces must leave so
that the refugees can re-enter, an international security presence
must be permitted, and the people of Kosovo must be given the
democratic self-government they have long deserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic offered no such guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Citing mounting reports from eyewitnesses inside Kosovo, State
Department spokesman Jamie Rubin for the first time officially
accused Serb forces of using rape as a weapon of terror in a
campaign of repression that has driven up to 1.4 million ethnic
Albanians from their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often takes time to confirm these reports,'' Rubin told
reporters, ``but there are so many credible reports from throughout
Kosovo that the conclusion is inescapable that Milosevic's forces
are using rape as a weapon of terror in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the continuing atrocities unfolding inside
Kosovo, the Pentagon produced a detailed map identifying more than
100 villages and towns across the tiny province that have been
torched, shelled or otherwise destroyed by rampaging Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO had verified at least three areas inside Kosovo
where military units continue to shell civilians, and the
Pentagon's Bacon said U.S. officials have received reports in
recent days of Serb helicopter attacks on refugee convoys.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the reports had not been independently verified. They
echoed earlier incidents that were verified, however, by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said NATO had also received reports of three more mass
graves, including one near Pristina reportedly containing 100
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most appalling stories is simply of large numbers
of Kosovar Albanians being herded around Kosovo like groups of
migratory cattle, sent to the border, then sent back to their
villages by Serb security forces, then told to leave again, as if
they're sort of pawns being moved around on a chess board,'' said
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This permanent movement, lack of shelter,'' Shea said, ``is
producing incidences of typhoid, cholera, scabies and pulmonary
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and NATO officials estimate that there are somewhere
between 500,000 and 750,000 ethnic Albanians inside Kosovo that
have been driven from their homes. Many are concentrated in rugged
mountain areas more than a mile high, with little if any food or
shelter, to escape the depredations of the marauding Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO pressed its around-the-clock air campaign into their
23rd day with fresh attacks early Thursday, Shea said the
intensifying pressure the raids are placing on Serb forces in the
field and their support structures around Yugoslavia were quickly
turning the tide against Milosevic and his army.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials showed clips Wednesday of successful
attacks over the previous 24 hours on 14 major targets in Kosovo
and elsewhere across Yugoslavia -- a huge fuel storage and
distribution center in the provincial capital of Pristina, a
bridge, a railroad tunnel and other sites -- as well as tanks,
armored personnel carriers and military trucks supporting Serb army
and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO building toward a 1,000-aircraft armada over the
coming week, Shea said the arithmetic of the campaign is working in
favor of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day Milosevic has less, and every day we have more,''
said Shea. ``So this situation cannot go on indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In a harrowing new episode in the Kosovo crisis, refugees in a
convoy along a road near the southwestern town of Dakovica came
under a withering attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two starkly different versions of events quickly emerged.
</P>
<P>
   State-run television in Yugoslavia blamed the attack on NATO
pilots, saying they bombed the refugee convoy.
</P>
<P>
   If correct, that would be the single worst case of civilian
casualties in the three-week-old air campaign and the second major
incident this week involving civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Footage of the catastrophe was replayed over and over in
Yugoslavia, replete with scenes of children and elderly people
alike weeping and nursing what appeared to be serious wounds, after
their rag-tag convoy of tractors, wagons, livestock and carts came
under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the issue is being investigated and details
could be available as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, pilots involved in the mission
told U.S. Army Gen. Wsley Clark, NATO supreme allied commander,
that they bombed military vehicles shortly after 3:30 p.m. (local
time) in the area where the convoy was attacked.

</P>
<P>
   The pilots, and the forward command aircraft that guide each
plane's individual bombing run, are under orders not to bomb unless
they can identify their target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to tell the difference between a tractor and a
tank,'' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald. ``Unless they're
sure, they will not drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark told Bacon that he had received independent, but not yet
verified, reports that Serb troops had positioned military vehicles
near the front and rear of a refugee convoy. Clark was
investigating reports that the Serbs, after being hit by the NATO
attack, turned their fury on the civilians, attacking them with
gunfire and grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he might have intelligence imagery to support that

surveillance aircraft, a drone called the Predator, was in the area
at the time of the incident.

   ``We don't know what the full facts are,'' Bacon said. ``We have

 &HT;    AirTran upbeat about modest profit
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran regained some financial altitude in the first
quarter, posting a modest profit that beat analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's second-largest airline also said cash reserves grew,
lessening the threat of a liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling better about the year than we did in January,''
said Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Leonard, who took over the
Orlando, Fla.-based carrier's recovery effort three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Holdings Inc. reported a profit of $3 million, or 5
cents a share, vs. a loss of $7.9 million, or 12 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $119.9 million from $94.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted a loss of 3 cents a share, according to
First Call. AirTran stock rose 47 cents to $5.47 in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterly profit was only the second since ValuJet acquired
AirTran in 1997 and adopted its name. The enlarged carrier made
money in the spring quarter of 1998 but then fell back into the
red.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, an industry veteran who has brought in other top
managers, announced the first-quarter results on the last day of
Robinson Humphrey's investment conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said the rebound reflects the growing success of several
prior initiatives, such as business-class service, along with
stabilizing costs after two years of restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership grew 14.8 percent on a 9 percent seat capacity gain in
the quarter. ``We are starting to get repeat customers. I think
we're building sort of a cult following,'' said Leonard, who
acknowledged low fuel prices also played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he expects few route changes in 1999 but added that
the carrier has asked for government help in gaining access to key
airports, such as Newark and Washington-Reagan National.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson Humphrey analyst James Parker said AirTran ``isn't out
of the woods yet.'' He said the carrier is benefitting from
enormous travel demand and ``spill'' traffic from Atlanta rival
Delta Air Lines, which reports first-quarter earnings today.
</P>
<P>
   Parker also said Delta may be softening its competition with
AirTran because of political heat on big carriers over service and
predatory tactics.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran said cash reserves, which had dwindled to $24 million at
the end of 1998, grew to $58 million at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said AirTran is negotiating for financing to buy 50 new
Boeing 717 jets. It's to get eight 717s this year, starting in
September. Leonard said the plane's arrival ``will transform this
company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will dramatically lower our operating costs and will
indicate that we're back and back for real with the most modern
equipment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard also said AirTran recently won approval to fly Defense
Department personnel, which should boost revenue growth. As
ValuJet, the carrier had failed to get defense approval, based in
part on a review of operations and safety. A defense spokesman did
not return calls.

 &HT;    BellSouth seeks share increase
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. plans to tighten its grip on the
Peruvian communications company in which it invested two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Wednesday that BellSouth will offer 50
cents a share _ about $16 million _ to boost its share from 59
percent to at least 74 percent control of Tele 2000, a company that
has 237,000 customers for its wireless phone service, cable
television and paging.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth plunked down $112 million to purchase its initial
stake in the company, which then had a license to serve only the 7
million people in the Lima area. Since then, Tele 2000 has won the
right to serve the rest of Peru, whose total population is more
than 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is the largest outside investor in Latin American
telecommunications. Last year, with uncertainty about the region's
economy rising, BellSouth basically passed on the chance to win new
licenses in Brazil, but extended its investment in other
properties. BellSouth also increased its share of telecom companies
in Ecuador and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The stock in Tele 2000 is being sold by a still unnamed partner
in the company.

 &HT;    Overall executive pay skyrockets
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Executive pay, already stratospheric, advanced 36
percent last year, thanks to pay structures that linked
compensation to the stock market, Business Week (April 19) reports.
Through big stock option grants, the average CEO earned $10.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   But that's peanuts compared to the top CEOs, headed by Walt
Disney Chief Michael Eisner's $575.6 million. The biggest portion
of that annual compensation _ $569.8 million _ was in stock options
and other long-term compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The others in the Top 5 were CBS chief Mel Karmazin, $201.9
million; Citigroup's Sanford Weill, $167.1 million; Stephen Case of
America Online, $159.2 million, and Intel's Craig Barrett, $116.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola chief M. Douglas Ivester ranked 10th at $57.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are staggering,'' said Business Week, ``but so is
the performance of America's business.'' Top pay in 1998 was 442
percent better than it was in 1990, reflecting the decade's
business boom and related bull market in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have become increasingly angry during the '90s at
the size of executive pay, but Business Week notes it's not a new
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, irate shareholders filed the first lawsuit over pay
after America Tobacco Co. paid President Georgia Washington Hill
$1.3 million. It did some good, because a year later the then-new
Securities and Exchange Commission decided shareholder proposals on
pay and other issues should be included in the proxies voted on at
annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Puncturing market
</P>
<P>
   Money (May) takes a look at well-known pillars of investing
wisdom, debunks some of them and points out how the others have
been misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks are supposed to outperform bonds over the long term, for
example. While true, the size of the annual return may fall below
the alleged 10 percent to 12 percent annual rate by the time
transaction costs and other expenses are factored in.
</P>
<P>
   Of more value, perhaps, Money adds a new section in its May
issue dedicated to helping individuals use the Internet as an
investment source.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual Funds (May) focuses on mutual fund groups specifically
for retirement planning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the ``whatever happened to'' department, U.S. News &AMP; World
Report (April 19) says Texas billionaire and two-time presidential
candidate Ross Perot is ``all business now'' after the Feb. 2
initial public stock offering of his technology services company,
Perot Systems.
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. economic ``model'' is held to be the clear world
winner, but The Economist (April 16th) says the performances of
other nations compares favorably in terms of good and bad points.
Germany is the closest rival.

TIME WARNER POSTS POSTS HEFTY EARNINGS GROWTH FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that it posted a
solid profit in the first quarter based on strong growth at its
cable television networks and the Warner Brothers film studio.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the first quarter was $138 million, or 10 cents a
share before preferred dividends, compared with a loss of $62
million, or 12 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for Time Warner and Time Warner Entertainment, which
includes the company's stake in Warner Brothers, Home Box Office
and the majority of its cable systems, rose 2 percent, to $6.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Operating cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization, rose 47 percent, to $1.25 billion, compared with $852
million in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts and investors use
cash flow to analyze the performance of indebted companies like
Time Warner because it focuses on how the underlying businesses are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the company's business segments performed well, and some
had turnarounds. The film studio, which had struggled, saw profits
jump to $346 million from $119 million. However, $215 million of
that leap was attributed a pretax gain from the early termination
and settlement of a long-term video agreement with
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., a unit of P&AMP;F Acquisition Corp. Without
that gain, the division's profit, fueled by the success of new
releases such as ``You've Got Mail'' and ``Analyze This,'' rose 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Dixon, who follows Time Warner for Paine Webber, said the
earnings were better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, shares of Time Warner fell $3.50, to $73.50.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings for Home Box Office jumped a record 20 percent, to $184
million, compared with $153 million in the quarter a year earlier.
Both subscription and ad revenue showed strong growth.
</P>
<P>
   The cable division also reported a stronger performance as cash
flow rose to $403 million, compared with $381 million in the
quarter a year earlier. That was a 10 percent increase after taking
into account some transactions last year.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Wednesday with analysts and reporters, Time Warner
chairman Gerald Levin said the music division would be a key area
for growth on the Internet. And though Time Warner does not have a
separate company related to the Internet, Levin did not rule out
creating one. Analysts think he may do so with Roadrunner, CNNfn or
Columbia House.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it planned to spin off its operations that
provide businesses with telephone systems. The operation, which is
not a strategic fit for Time Warner, had 1998 sales of $122
million. The company did not put any time frame on the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone business is a different area of the company,''
said John Tinker, who follows the company for Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities. ``It is capital-intensive and it is not a
core part of their business.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company said it was creating five Internet ``hubs'' for
common interest groups for its businesses, including entertainment,
life style, news, sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is to create a common engine underneath the five
that would provide each with the normal services provided by an
Internet portal such as e-mail and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a consumer could go to the business hub at CNNfn
and get business news from CNNfn, Fortune and Money, chat with
investors and do stock transactions.

 &HT;    MindSpring founder hints of future deals
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Could MindSpring acquire the Microsoft Network or
strike a deal with a telecommunications company? Neither is out of
the question, according to Charles Brewer, MindSpring founder,
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft might not be in the ISP (Internet service provider)
business for the long haul,'' Brewer told the standing-room-only
crowd at the Robinson-Humphrey Institutional Conference at the
Ritz-Carlton Buckhead. MSN is Microsoft's online service with
approximately 2 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer told the audience to watch for ``relatively dramatic
announcements'' regarding DSL, or digital subscriber line, and
content partnerships. Brewer is cautiously optimistic about the
possibilities of striking a deal with telecom companies such as
BellSouth to offer MindSpring DSL service. He said once-strained
relations with telecom companies were easing:
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the traffic. They don't care if it's over their own
network or MindSpring.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's comments may be indicators of what MindSpring plans to
do with money raised Wednesday from its public offering of 2.76
million common shares and an offering of 5 percent convertible
subordinated notes due in 2006 for $179.98 million. The offerings
were conducted under its shelf registration for up to $800 million
of debt and equity securities. Industry analysts say the money is
being put in reserve for MindSpring's growth. The company won't say
just how much money it raised from the offering, but based on
current stock valuations the amount could total approximately
$469.78 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer did acknowledge that current valuations in the IPO, or
initial public offering, market may slowacquisitions.

GOOD NEWS EXPECTED IN BOEING EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co.'s stock surged 10 percent to a
four-month high Wednesday, partly because of expectations that the
company will deliver some good news when it reports first-quarter
earnings on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the stock market away from technology also led
investors back to Boeing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the aerospace giant rose 3 and three-eighths to close
at $38. At one point, the stock traded at more than $39 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will release its first quarter numbers before the stock
market opens Thursday, and the company is expected to report that
net income rose 43 cents a share, according to the average estimate
of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., a research company
that tracks analysts' estimates of corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think Boeing's earnings could be as much as 50
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, it will be several times higher than the 5
cents a share Boeing earned in the first quarter last year when it
struggled with production problems in its Commercial Airplanes
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that Boeing must continue to show improvement going
forward,'' said Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen Mackenzie firm.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year Boeing has taken a number of steps to turn its
core airplane business around. It has cut overtime on the next
generation 737 model. Production lines are more efficient and work
force is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   But the commercial business will still fall well short this year
of posting the profits it once enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing 1997 and 1998, analysts were hoping for
better news this year. Then on Dec. 2, Boeing surprised Wall Street
by cutting earnings projections for 1999 and 2000. Its stock, which
had traded at $40.50 a share the day earlier, fell 17 percent in
one day.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial group has forecast profit margins of 2 percent to
3 percent this year, and 1 percent to 3 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said they want to see margins of more
than 7 percent in the commercial division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing earned $1.1 billion, or $1.15 a share, on
revenue of $56.2 billion. That was significantly better than 1997,
when charges related to jetliner production problems resulted in a
loss of $178 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $45.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 559 airplanes in 1998, and made zero
profit on those planes, though it did show a small commercial
profit in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Boeing plans to deliver 620 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts on Thursday morning will be looking closely at how well
Boeing's commercial margins for the first quarter compare with the
1.9 percent commercial margins the company posted for the fourth
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   That will indicate whether Boeing's performance is continuing to
improve.

 &HT;    Versatile chives good place for novice to start
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The stand of chives in the garden is already 8
inches tall. There is plenty to try these and other recipes. The
plant will just keep growing. For a summer-long harvest of new,
tender leaves, cut the plant back after flowering.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when recipes call for chives they are best added at
the end of any cooking time because heat dissipates their flavor
and color.
</P>
<P>
   Mashed potatoes seem like cold-weather comfort food, but the
addition of lemon peel and fresh chives bridges the seasons. For
mashed-potato lovers, these are a wonderful addition to your
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   MASHED POTATOES WITH LEMON AND CHIVES
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup snipped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Russet potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup buttermilk, warmed
</P>
<P>
   Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a small, heavy skillet over
low heat. Add garlic and saute 1 minute without browning. Mix in
lemon zest and chives. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling, salted water until
tender, about 15 minutes. Drain. Return potatoes to pot and mash.
Add the chive mixture and 1/3 cup of buttermilk and the remaining 3
tablespoons butter. Mash together. Add remaining buttermilk if
necessary to achieve the proper texture. Season with salt and
pepper.

   _ Recipe from Bon Appetit
</P>
<P>
   Chefs who have used herbs in all kind of flavored oils naturally
came up with chive oil. It is a pretty green oil with a light chive
taste. Don't be tempted to use extra-virgin olive oil, which can
overwhelm the delicate onion flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The oil is particularly pretty dribbled on white plates when
serving meats, seafood and poultry, and steamed vegetables. It also
makes a pretty presentation drizzled over creamy soups.
</P>
<P>
   CHIVE OIL
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1/2 cup
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chives cut into 2-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Drop the chives into boiling water for about 5 seconds, then
drain in a sieve and cool under running water. Drain well, then pat
dry between paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the chives and oil in a blender and blend until smooth.
Place in a glass container and refrigerate, covered, overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the oil through a fine sieve, pressing hard on the solids.
The oil will keep for about a week. For safety's sake, it must be
refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per tablespoon: 122 calories;
13.7 g fat; no cholesterol; no sodium.
</P>
<P>
   Chive butter is one of those staples that can be kept in the
freezer to be sliced off when needed to add a colorful burst of
flavor when needed. For another dimension, add a tablespoon of
Dijon mustard to the mixture before chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Have it ready to top little new potatoes that have been simmered
in salted water for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   CHIVE BUTTER
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced chives
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Combine the butter, chives and lemon juice in a blender or mini
food processor and blend. (The mixture can also be pounded in a
mortar and pestle.) Add a pinch of salt and 3 to 4 grindings of
black pepper. Spread the mixture on aluminum foil, shaping into a
long rectangle. Roll into a log and chill until firm. Use on
grilled meats, fish and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per tablespoon: 81 calories; 9
g fat; 25 mg cholesterol; trace sodium.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe was inspired by one in The Herbal Palate
Cookbook by Maggie Oster and Sal Gilbertie (Storey, $29.95). It
would also work well with pork chops or boneless chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED LAMB CHOPS WITH ORANGE-CHIVE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   6 large shoulder lamb chops about 3/4-inch thick, about 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   1 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   Additional minced chives for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1/4 cup orange juice, oil, 2 tablespoons chives and
pepper and pour over chops. Marinate, refrigerated for about 4
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat chops
dry, sprinkle with salt and brown them, about 3 minutes a side.
Remove to a plate and cover to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, for about 2 to 3
minutes, or until soft. Add the brandy and 2 tablespoons chives and
cook until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Add 1 cup orange
juice and simmer until reduced by half. Return the chops to the pan
to finish cooking for another 2 to 4 minutes and to coat the chops
with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle with fresh chives when serving.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per person: 363 calories; 21.8
g fat; 103.5 mg cholesterol; 81.6 mg sodium. (Actual fat will be
less because not all of the marinade is absorbed).

LIVE-IN BABY SITTER, 54, WINS $197 MILLION LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was last Wednesday that Chris Gabrieli, a venture
capitalist, discovered that his live-in baby sitter was a
multimillionaire like him.
</P>
<P>
   The baby sitter, a 54-year-old Chilean immigrant named Maria
Grasso, told Gabrieli's wife, Hilary, who then told him, that she
had won the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the largest lottery
prize ever won by one person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Gabrielis were among the few people who knew her secret
until Wednesday when, after a week of rumor and speculation about
who had bought the winning ticket at the Star supermarket in the
Fenway neighborhood last week, Mrs. Grasso, a modest, soft-spoken
mother of two, claimed her winnings at Massachusetts Lottery
headquarters in Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very down-to-earth person,'' Mrs. Grasso said at a news
conference, with the Gabrielis standing nearby, beaming. ``I work
hard in my entire life. I'm one of six children, and so I always
try to be low, down-key, and I'm going to continue that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso, who said she was an occasional lottery player,
chose an immediate lump sum payment of $104 million, instead of 26
annual payments that would have totaled $197 million, and collected
a check Wednesday for $70,244,814.02 after taxes. It was the
nation's second-largest jackpot. The largest, a $295 million
Powerball jackpot last July, was won by a group of 13 machinists in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso did not give details about her plans, other than to
say she would like to keep helping children, and she declined to
give any interviews beyond the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Raymond Howell, said Mrs. Grasso came to the United
States in 1971 and found work as a live-in baby sitter in New York
City. She earned a high school equivalency degree, attended
LaGuardia Community College and the College of Staten Island, both
in New York, and eventually got a job as a teaching assistant in
special education classes in the city's public schools. She also
worked part time for United Cerebral Palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso, who is divorced, has two children, both in college.
She moved to Boston in 1996 and went to work for the Gabrielis.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli had only praise for the woman who became his former
employee last Thursday with what was apparently some reluctance on
her part. ``She's a very warm and caring person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely family-oriented,'' Gabrieli said. ``She has
two children she's very proud of. She's got a large family in
Chile. When I talked to her, she said, `How can I make this a
blessing for them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli said Mrs. Grasso was in her apartment in his home in
the Beacon Hill neighborhood watching the 11 p.m. news last Tuesday
when she saw the winning number flash across her television screen.
``It matched,'' Gabrieli said. ``She couldn't believe it could be
true. She confirmed it on the second go-round at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a sleepless night, and the first thing in the morning,
she called up to our room on the intercom.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gabrieli already on his way to a meeting, Mrs. Grasso spoke
to Mrs. Gabrieli, a tax lawyer who is at home, raising the couple's
four children, ages 1 through 5. ``My wife's first thought was:
`Are you sure?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gabrieli congratulated Mrs. Grasso, put her in touch with a
lawyer and then telephoned her husband in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same reaction as my wife: `Are you sure, darling?'''
Gabrieli said.
</P>
<P>
   The new multimillionaire, meanwhile, insisted on putting in a
full workday. ``She actually worked Thursday as well,'' Gabrieli
said. ``Her first reaction was, `I'll work until you get a
replacement.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `I think this is going to be something that will
take all your psychic time. We'll muddle through.''' And so on
Thursday night, Mrs. Grasso moved out.

UNDER PRESSURE, WHITE HOUSE REVERSES ITSELF ON TRADE TALKS WITH
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It took a five-day roadtrip through America by a
stalwart of the Chinese Communist Party, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji,
and the anger of a lot of American capitalists to force President
Clinton, once again, to reverse his tactics in dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, a president who only a few days before had
sounded in no particular rush to conclude a huge trade deal with
China was suddenly in a big hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tracked Zhu to a suite at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in
Manhattan, where the prime minister was warning American executives
that many of the concessions China had made to try to get into the
World Trade Organization would unravel if the deal was not
finalized, according to some executives who met with Zhu. Taking
his case to American business interests, Zhu insisted that
compromises allowing American telecommunications firms, farm
products, banks and insurance companies into the Chinese market
could all perish.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Zhu talked for 20 minutes, during which
Clinton offered to issue the third ``joint statement'' in five
days, administration officials said, struggling to explain why one
summit meeting needed three successive announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Zhu that the statement would reiterate that the
United States was committed to getting China into the WTO this
year, and said the negotiations could be resumed as soon as a team
of American negotiators could travel to Beijing, officials said.
When Zhu resumed his Waldorf meetings with New York investors and
business executives Tuesday night, he confidently relayed that the
deal was ``99 percent done,'' the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials conceded on Wednesday that the turnabout
occurred because they had misjudged the dynamics of the China
summit. In the end, they had not only angered those in Congress who
oppose any deal with China, but those who think one is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, they said, focused on the issues far too late, and then
was stunned by the news reports emphasizing the ``failure'' to
reach a trade agreement rather than the concessions that the
administration had wrung out of Beijing on issues that had dogged
American trade relations with China for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But what really stung the White House was harsh criticism from
the business community. Clinton had earlier complained privately
that business lobbyists had not worked hard to persuade Congress to
get the deal done, officials said. But as news of the partial
agreements was released last week, with details of the concessions
by China disclosed, business executives concluded that the
president should just take what he had in hand and close the deal.
They began a campaign of e-mails and phone calls to try to bring
Clinton quickly back to the table to finish the accord.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Maurice Greenberg , the chairman of the American
International Group, a pathbreaker in selling insurance to the
Chinese, complained to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin that the
administration ``had missed the train.'' And when the White House
hastily that day set up a Monday briefing about the trade deal, the
administration encountered what one participant called ``a
firestorm.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitees, Washington representatives of major companies that
do business in China, gave a standing ovation to Charlene
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, who had negotiated a
deal that stunned many executives for how much she had extracted
from Chinese. Participants in the meeting said they greeted Gene
Sperling, the president's top economic adviser, with stony silence,
apparently blaming him for concluding that the deal was not strong
enough to make it through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Sperling was engaged in a heated argument with
Robert Kapp, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council,
which represents most of the major businesses that operate in
China, participants said. Kapp, nearly shouting, told Sperling that
the White House had shrunk from a deal that would bring billions of
dollars to American businesses, simply because it feared an ugly
fight on Capitol Hill. Trying to calm things, Sperling urged both
patience, saying the President wanted a deal _ but would wait for
the right one _ and concluded ``we're all in agreement here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No we're not!'' Kapp and several other executives yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   Kapp would not discuss the meeting on Wednesday, saying it was a
private session. But he added in an interview that ``once the U.S.
trade representative made clear the extraordinary range of
achievement she had wrought,'' it suddenly became apparent to
American businesses that ``nothing in this dazzling laundry list
would amount to a realized benefit for anyone unless they closed
the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, played into Zhu's hands _ and he fueled
the fires all weekend, from Denver to Chicago to New York to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went, he cited the advantages of the deal for
American companies. And he sounded persuasive. ``Zhu basically went
to the country,'' said Robert Hormats, the vice-chairman of Goldman
Sachs (International), the investment house that has handled many
of China's bond offerings. ``City by city he said, 'Look what's in
this for you.' It was remarkable. I've never seen a foreign leader,
much less a Chinese leader, pull this off.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zhu was keeping an active backchannel line open to
Washington, periodically striking fear into the hearts of
policymakers who realized that they had underestimated the public
relations skills of their negotiating adversary.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial close-but-no-deal announcement on Thursday,
Ms. Barshefsky released a list of the Chinese concessions, and said
there was an agreement that the deals were ``locked in'' _ meaning
the Chinese could not backtrack.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later, Zhu began to hammer out a theme that would last
through the weekend. In a public dinner speech to an array of
business representatives, he denounced the administration for
bowing to political pressures in Congress, and disputed the
administration's account by saying that nothing was locked in.
</P>
<P>
   His insistent note of displeasure with the administration
prompted another panicked round of talks, running through Friday
night. That resulted in a final agreement on Saturday to allow in
American wheat and other agricultural products, giving the Chinese
a clear statement that ``The United States strongly supports the
accession of the People's Republic of China to the WTO in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu had insisted on that wording, officials say, so that he
could go back to China with something to show for his efforts _ and
to quiet critics who said he gave away a lot, and got little in
return. He later told a group of senior American news executives
that he believed Clinton had to personally approve the wording.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu may have had another reason to obtain the American
commitment: He wants entry into the WTO before the start of another
round of worldwide trade negotiations, involving agricultural
issues critical to China. Nonmembers do not get to join in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu repeated his theme at every stop along his tour of cities.
So after the administration's briefing for business executives on
Monday, Ms. Barshefsky and Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser, suggested that Clinton ask Zhu to return his negotiators
to Washington to resume talks and move quickly toward a deal. But
Zhu requested that American negotiators be sent on to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the administration downplayed the impact of the
business community's influence on Clinton's decision to restart
talks so soon. In an interview, Rubin said the decision ``reflected
zero influence from the business community'' and was consistent
with getting ``the strongest deal possible, and one that could get
through the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress say that whether or not it affected Clinton,
the business pressure has certainly affected Congress. ``The good
news is that the business community is being heard from,'' said
Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., and a veteran of many trade battles.
``And that could change a lot of votes that would have gone against
a deal.'' But he said many of the open issues, including American
rights to enforce the accord, had to be solved to avoid the
criticism that the administration was signing a naive deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said that the fundamental problem of selling the whole
deal to Congress remains. ``It's going to be tough, it's going to
be controversial,'' he said. ``Business people feel very strongly
that it needs to get done.''

MCI EXECUTIVE TALKS DOWN A WIRELESS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The directors of Nextel Communications Inc., one of the nation's
biggest wireless telephone companies, convened Wednesday to
consider whether to sell their company to MCI Worldcom Inc., even
as one of MCI Worldcom's top executives said his company was in no
hurry to build a wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 long-distance carrier, has discussed a
potential takeover with Nextel over the last few weeks, but John
Sidgmore, MCI Worldcom's vice chairman, said Wednesday that the
company could bide its time on becoming a wireless carrier. Nextel
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom has long held that it does not need a wireless
business. Many analysts believe, however, that in the long run MCI
Worldcom would be better off with a wireless unit than without one.
The problem for MCI Worldcom is that a major wireless acquisition
could be costly and dilute its earnings for years.
</P>
<P>
   So Sidgmore's comments may have been a gambit to beat down
Nextel's stock to make a purchase less costly. According to
executives close to the talks, Sidgmore has been the cheerleader
for a Nextel deal among MCI Worldcom's top management. The
executives said that Bernard Ebbers, the chief executive, was in
some ways in the middle, while Scott Sullivan, the chief financial
officer, had lobbied against one.
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore's comments may also reflect the strategic reality that
MCI Worldcom seems to have more choices for expanding into wireless
service than Nextel has for being acquired. MCI Worldcom could
cobble together regional wireless companies or even take a run at
Sprint and its wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that Craig McCaw, the pioneer wireless
executive, who owns 20 percent of Nextel, would like Nextel to be
sold. He could make a tidy profit and escape the expense of
regularly exercising Nextel options.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel shares closed at $37.50 Wednesday, up $1.50. Nextel's
management would love to sell the company for more than $50,
executives close to the talks said, but the most that MCI Worldcom
seems willing to consider paying is in the low 40s.

MACEDONIA'S LEADER SAYS MILOSEVIC IS TRYING TO `DESTABILIZE' HIS
NATION
</HEADLINE>
  (ac) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The prime minister of Macedonia has accused
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia of trying to
``destabilize'' Macedonia by driving tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians across the border and upsetting his country's fragile
ethnic and religious mix.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, who has led Yugoslvia's
southern neighbor for five months, said on Wednesday that by
expelling more than 140,000 Albanians from Kosovo to Macedonia,
Milosevic had handed him a potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been these expulsions,'' Georgievski said. ``And by
them Milosevic practically wanted to destabilize Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of refugees who have entered the country over the
last few weeks is equal to 7 percent of Macedonia's population of
two million. ``It would be like having 20 million Mexicans coming
into the United States in one day,'' Georgievski said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has had to balance this influx of people with
a divided population, a significant proportion of whom support or
at least feel sympathy for Serbia. Forty thousand Serbs live in
Macedonia, and Macedonians, who are the majority, are also Eastern
Orthodox Christians. Albanians, who are mostly Muslim, represent 30
percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Although Macedonia could pride itself on being an example of
ethnic tolerance in the Balkans, the war has inevitably polarized
opinions, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that people have been made to chose between the
Albanians and Serbs,'' Georgievski said. ``It should not be a
question for a country that already has quite a complicated
political life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is playing on the fact of Christian-Muslim conflict.
I think we were very close to it,'' he said. ``He is playing to the
fears of the Christians that a surplus of refugees will make
Muslims predominant.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, whose country is home to 12,000 NATO troops
sent here as peacekeepers in 1995, has walked a precarious
tightrope between NATO and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   He is determinedly pro-West and pro-NATO, despite the fury this
has provoked from Belgrade and even from many in Macedonia. He said
his government's aim was to be accepted as a full member of NATO as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee crisis has provided one more sour note in a
relationship with Milosevic. Georgievski, who describes himself as
an anti-Communist and an advocate of Macedonian independence since
the 1980s, noted that Milosevic refused to recognize Macedonia for
five years after it gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 and
that the Yugoslav president still disputed their shared border.
</P>
<P>
   The border dispute made the capture of the three American
soldiers on March 31 a particularly sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia does not recognize the border and disputes about 10
points along it,'' Georgievski said. ``So I assume because of this
dispute they could say that they were on their territory, and we
say it was on ours.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The incident also raised concerns over Serbian attacks. A
Macedonian soldier was killed last week at a border post.
Georgievski said, ``No one has proved who fired. And it could have
been a provocation. So we withheld blame.''
</P>
<P>
   He aadded that, ``Yugoslavia has declared us aggressors and is
sending us daily diplomatic notes'' that protest NATO's use of
Macedonian airspace for its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO support aircraft fly over the country _ ``You can
hear them,'' Georgievski said with a shrug _ Macedonia had not
given NATO permission to use its territory or air space to attack
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   The particular fear among Macedonians is that the Albanians want
to create a ``greater Albania,'' which would eat into western
Macedonia. Albanian leaders in Macedonia have been careful to play
this down and voice full support for the territorial integrity of
Macedonia. Yet the issue remains in the back of the minds of many
Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions have been played out in other ways, too. Police
officers have come in for strong criticism for their often callous
treatment of the Albanian refugees. When asked about the treatment,
Georgievski defended the authorities. He said they faced an unusual
security and immigration nightmare and had at least managed to
avoid a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot find one refugee who was seriously injured,'' he
said. ``And there has been no disease or epidemic. So in the whole
chaos the Macedonian police passed this test.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a state we have had a difficult 20 days. And I think we
passed this exam.''

 &HT;    Panel decries IOC's reform pace
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a Senate panel on Wednesday warned the
International Olympic Committee to institute prompt reforms or face
congressional sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators called for the resignation of IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch because of the Olympic gift-giving scandal.
But former Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine recommended
several structural reforms to the world body, and members of the
Senate Commerce Committee said they would give the IOC more time
before seeking to enact potentially serious financial sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be given the chance to take the necessary action
on their own,'' Mitchell told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Early last month, Mitchell delivered a report to U.S. Olympics
officials critical of the IOC for tolerating a culture in which IOC
officials who decided Olympic host cities accepted free travel,
scholarships and lavish gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The report also criticized U.S. Olympic officials for lax
oversight of the Salt Lake 2002 bid and recommended broad
structural changes to the IOC. Among the changes were to impose
term limits on IOC members, make their elections more democratic
and open the committee to annual, independent auditing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Senate hearing was staged in part to keep the
pressure on Samaranch and other IOC members to implement the
changes. But senators and even some members of the oversight
commission that developed Mitchell's recommendations expressed
frustration with the IOC's initial response.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) noted that the IOC has yet to
name more than a dozen persons to a 20-member panel that will make
its own recommendations to the IOC executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the IOC views with the same seriousness the
comments of the Mitchell commission,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Distancing himself from Mitchell's more diplomatic approach,
former White House chief of staff Ken Duberstein, co-author of the
Mitchell report, told the panel that he does not think the IOC is
committed to reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommended strong medicine for the USOC and the IOC,''
Duberstein said. ``The USOC followed the doctor's orders. The IOC
seems to be looking for a second opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC was represented at Wednesday's hearing by the United
States' two IOC members, Anita DeFrantz and Jim Easton.
</P>
<P>
   The two said they could support only one of the Mitchell
commission's four recommendations _ term limits for IOC members.
Both members took issue with the Mitchell commission's
characterization of the IOC as having fostered a ``culture of
improper gift giving'' for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corruption was isolated to people who are no longer with
us,'' said DeFrantz, referring to the six members expelled by the
IOC and the four who resigned under threat of expulsion. ``It's not
right to paint all of the IOC with the same brush.''
</P>
<P>
   The members even balked at the suggestion that IOC board minutes
should be made public rather than kept embargoed for 10 years, as
is the current practice. Easton said the embargo was needed to
protect IOC members who could be punished back home for comments
that could be perceived to be disloyal to their native lands.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC will convene in June, when its 20-member review panel is
expected to meet for the first time. DeFrantz said all panel
members would be appointed by month's end.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said Congress should give the IOC until the end of the
year to propose and adopt reforms, although he suggested that
Congress could consider legislation concurrently in order to
demonstrate U.S. resolve.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will introduce legislation to bring the IOC under
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which would make IOC members
subject to U.S. bribery laws.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Rick Lazio (R-N.Y.) and Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), brought
legislation this week that would bar U.S. companies from giving
sponsorship money to the IOC until the group adopts Mitchell
commission recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Congress should not rush such sanctions, for fear of
having an adverse impact on the programs that fund athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go slow on something like this,'' McCain said. ``Anything
that would harm the Olympic movement we have to be very careful
about.

 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's April 15, time to complain about how taxes have become too
high. And the House will vote once again Thursday on a
constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds majority
to pass future tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem with the income tax system, many economists
say, is not that the typical family pays too much tax but rather
that Washington has made the tax code numbingly complex, wasteful
and irrational.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of ways to collect the same amount of money
from the same groups of taxpayers but with a fraction as much
damage to the economy. One alternative has been offered by Rep.
Richard Neal, D-Mass., who proposed an overhaul Wednesday that
would knock out needless complexity.
</P>
<P>
   There are good arguments for a flat code that sets the same tax
rate for nearly everyone. There are good arguments for a
progressive code that raises tax rates as family incomes rise.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hardly anyone who thinks the rate structure of the
existing code makes good sense. By statute, there are five tax
brackets, ranging from 15 percent to nearly 40 percent. The
marginal rate _ the highest rate that families pay on the last
dollars earned _ is supposed to rise with income. But the rates
that families actually pay are anything but smooth and predictable.
Marginal rates jump up and down in chaotic fashion, in a pattern
that Kevin Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise
Institute, calls a ``skyline.''
</P>
<P>
   The saw-toothed tax rates are a product of credits and
deductions added to the code primarily in the 1990s _ only a few
years after Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to simplify
the code. These tax cuts impose high marginal rates, a bizarre fact
that follows from congressional attempts to limit the lost revenues
from its tax cuts by phasing out credits and deductions as family
income rises. Phasing out a tax cut raises the tax payments of a
family as its income rises, in effect raising its marginal tax
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Marginal rates matter because it is the tax on additional
earnings that affects decisions by workers, especially spouses, to
find paying jobs, seek higher-paying jobs, work overtime and save.
Studies show that women are especially sensitive to marginal rates
when deciding how much they will work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple tax credits and deductions _ each with their own
phase-out schedule _ produce Hassett's jagged skyline. The marginal
rate starts out at 21 percent for some low-income families, drops
to zero for certain kinds of families earning about $30,000, shoots
back to over 40 percent for some families earning about $80,000,
falls to 28 percent for families earning about $100,000 and
continues in this seesaw pattern for wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the earned-income tax credit, the jewel of the
country's anti-poverty program, which adds up to about $3,800 to
the paycheck of low-paid workers. It begins to phase out at a
family income of about $12,000, reducing family income by 21 cents
for every extra dollar it earns. The child tax credit, passed in
1997 and now set at $500 for each child, begins to phase out at a
family income of about $110,000. The $1,500 credit for the first
two years of college tuition and the $1,000 credit for job training
and graduate study passed in 1997 begin to phase out at about
$80,000. Deductions for interest on student loans start phasing out
at about $60,000. Deductions for individual retirement accounts
begin to phase out at about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The phasing out of these credits and deductions adds enormous
complexity to the code. With complexity comes, says Professor Alan
Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley,
``deception.'' He says that ``few families know how much tax they
will owe on the income of a second earner because few know how all
these phase outs combine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marginal rates become quite high. A two-earner
family with a income of around $100,000 pays about 40 cents of each
extra dollar it earns in Federal income taxes. Add in Social
Security, Medicare and state and local taxes and the rate can climb
above 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the code imposes high marginal rates does not mean
that it imposes high tax payments. Recall, the saw-toothed pattern
of marginal rates reflect tax cuts passed in 1997 and earlier.
Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail point to
different statistics to buttress their accusation that tax payments
have grown too heavy under President Clinton. Clinton's 1993 tax
increase, passed over their opposition, has driven tax collections,
as a share of the national economy, to their highest level in
history except for a brief interval in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusation, says Auerbach, is misleading. For starters,
the share of federal tax revenues in national income bounces around
but almost always hovers close to 20 percent. At 20.5 percent
today, it is only modestly above the historical record. The rise
has been fueled by taxes on capital gains created by soaring values
on Wall Street as well as a shift in the share of income accounted
for by wealthy families in the highest tax brackets. Moreover,
Congress raised taxes in 1990 and 1993 to balance the budget. Yet
even after these tax increases, Americans pay less federal tax than
the citizens of nearly any other industrialized economy.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the conventional wisdom about the tax burden is wrong,
says Iris Lav of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. With
the single exception of 1983, taxes on typical middle-income
families have fallen to their lowest level in more than two
decades. For many families, it would be necessary to go back even
further. Auerbach and William Gale of the Brookings Institution
estimate that a family of four in the middle of the income
distribution ($55,000 in 1999) will pay about 7.5 percent of its
income in federal income taxes. That is the lowest tax rate since
1966. Families at half the median are paying the lowest taxes since
1955. Even families at twice the median are paying the lowest tax
since 1972. Only the rich are paying more tax.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach echoes another criticism that economists of all
political stripes level at the 1997 tax breaks. ``They are
gratuitous, serving no important economic function.'' Hassett
points to studies that predict that the tuition and job training
tax credits, for example, will go to families that would pay for
higher education without the government's help. The credits are
likely to do little more than encourage colleges to hike tuition
and cut financial aid because their applicants have more money
courtesy of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach offers a sensible correction, reflected in part by
Neal's bill. Even if Congress insists on preserving the package of
1997 tax credits and deductions, Auerbach says, it could apply them
equally to everyone. Eliminating the phase outs would eliminate the
hills and valleys of Hassett's skyline. To pay for this reform and
yet preserve a progressive tax code, Auerbach would raise the
statutory rate on wealthier families.
</P>
<P>
   Phaseouts will not disappear easily. Wednesday, Clinton proposed
tax-deductible retirement accounts for low- and middle-income
families _ a new credit that, no surprise, he would phase out. Add
another jag to Hassett's skyline. &QL;

10 DRUG MAKERS POOL EFFORTS TO FIND GENETIC ROOTS OF DISEASES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass., Md., Mo.)   (rk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten pharmaceutical companies and the Wellcome Trust of London
said Wednesday that they would pool efforts to create a fine-scale
map of the human genome. Their goal is to speed the discovery of
the genetic variations that underlie disease, and hence of new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The map should also help in devising a new category of genetic
tests that will better match drugs to individual patients, an
activity sometimes referred to as ``personalized medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's work is intended to build on the human genome
project, the effort to decode the three-billion-letter genetic
blueprint that resides in every human cell. A group of public
institutions are racing against the Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md.,
to be first to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome project will produce a common, or consensus,
DNA sequence. But it is the variations from the consensus that make
each person genetically unique. Of particular medical interest are
the variant genes that predispose some people to disease and
protect others. The new consortium aims to identify a large enough
set of markers along the DNA that researchers can pinpoint the
variant genes that contribute to each disease of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Research consortiums of private industry have been formed
before, as in the semiconductor industry's joint project known as
Sematech, and do not violate the antitrust laws as long as they
focus on very early stage, pre-competitive research. But the new
consortium is highly unusual in that the results of its research
will be made available to the public at the same time as to its
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a prior agreement like it,'' said Francis
Collins, director of the human genome project at the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the consortium's work would accelerate the search
for disease-associated genes and would complement the national
institutes' own efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's principal backer, the Wellcome Trust, the huge
London charity specializing in support of medical research and
health care, is putting in $20 million, and the companies will
provide a further $25 million. The nonprofit enterprise, known as
the SNP Consortium, will be based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morgan, the Wellcome Trust executive responsible for
genome research, said he hoped the map would become an accepted
standard for drug regulatory agencies in Europe and the United
States. The original budget for the map was $150 million, he said,
but new advances have reduced the expected cost by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   The participants say that by making the genome map publicly
available, the pace of discovery will be faster than if any company
tried to hoard the information for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this kind of tool should be publicly accessible
because it allows all medical researchers to add to what's being
discovered,'' said B. Michael Silber, a research director at Pfizer
Inc., a member of the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by banding together the companies avoid duplication
of effort and gain access to scientists in the academic
laboratories that are pioneering exploration of the genome. A
public genome map also diminishes the chances that biotechnology
companies like Genset and Celera, which are developing private
maps, will be able to lock up broad swaths of the genome with
patent claims.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's mapping work will be carried out by the genome
centers at Washington University in St. Louis, the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and the Sanger Centre in England,
the major centers of the publicly financed work on the human genome
project.
</P>
<P>
   Each will be given six DNA sequencing machines, of a powerful
new model costing $300,000 apiece. The centers' efforts will be
coordinated by Lincoln Stein of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
in Long Island, N.Y. Stein is an expert in bioinformatics, the use
of computer programs to analyze genetic information.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's goal is to identify and locate, within two
years, 300,000 map points along the set of human DNA molecules, or
roughly 1 every 10,000 nucleotides, as the units of DNA are known.
That is the spacing necessary to provide a reasonable chance that
at least one map point will lie in or near any gene of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The map points along the DNA are themselves components of the
genetic material. They are single nucleotide positions, at which at
least 1 percent of the population has a nucleotide different from
that of the standard sequence. These one-letter differences are
known to geneticists as single nucleotide polymorphisms _ SNPs,
pronounced snips, which is why the new mapping effort is called the
SNP Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Because working genes account for only 3 percent or so of the
human genome, most SNPs fall in the nonfunctional regions of DNA
and make no difference to the individual. But because the SNPs are
easy to identify, they form ideal markers for distinguishing one
region of DNA from another.
</P>
<P>
   Though genes get shuffled in each generation, the set of SNPs
close to a given gene is likely to be inherited along with it and
can be used to identify it. By looking at a family in which
diabetes, say, is prevalent, geneticists can hope to spot the many
genes that probably contribute to the disease by recognizing
patterns of SNPs that turn up in the diabetes sufferers but not in
unaffected individuals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like the concept of open software, in which programmers around
the world contribute to improving a publicly accessible program,
the new genome map is intended to grow and develop at the hands of
all its users. The human genome is so vast and so complex that
biologists believe it will take decades to annotate the sequence
fully, explaining the function of every gene and the origin and
effects of each of its many variants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the concept of empowering the individual
investigator,'' said C. Thomas Caskey, president of the Merck
Genome Research Institute. Though most drugs are discovered by
pharmaceutical companies, ``95 percent of all discoveries'' that
lead to new drugs are made outside of the pharmaceutical industry,
Caskey said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the genome mapping consortium was developed by Alan
Williamson, a former executive of Merck &AMP; Co., although Merck
decided in the end not to join. The member companies, 10 of the
world's 20 largest pharmaceutical concerns, are Bayer AG, the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Glaxo Wellcome PLC, Hoechst Marion
Roussel, Roche Holding Ltd., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Searle SRL,
SmithKline Beecham PLC and the Zeneca Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who is now a consultant in England, said that with
the map in the public domain, its accuracy could be guaranteed, a
matter that will be of importance to regulatory authorities
assessing drugs that are based on the map's information. Further,
if there are controversial findings, relating perhaps to
differences among ethnic groups, ``they ought to be checkable and
verifiable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SNP map is to be constructed from the DNA of individuals
drawn from the four principal human population groups, those of
Africa, Asia, Europe and pre-Columbian America.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are talking about building a genome map, it should be a
real catalog of human variation and not just northern Europeans,''
said Collins, of the National Institutes of Health.

EDITORIAL: MORE BAD ADVICE FROM KEN STARR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   The renewal of the Independent Counsel Act should not be a
referendum on Kenneth Starr and his conduct in office. Nor should
Congress or the American people take Starr's advice on the future
of the law. Starr, having been empowered under the act to
investigate the Clintons for nearly five years, believes that the
statute should not be renewed when it expires in June. His comments
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee had an odd
self-pitying quality. He blames the law for flaws that were, in
fact, the fault of his investigation. His lack of prosecutorial
experience, his tin ear for public relations and his conflicts of
interest have had a great deal to do with causing the law to fall
into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argues that the law has not achieved its main purpose,
which is to provide the public with confidence in a fair,
nonpartisan means to investigate high-ranking executive branch
officials. Starr said Wednesday, ``If politicization and the loss
of public confidence are inevitable, then we should leave the full
responsibility where our laws and traditions place it, on the
attorney general,'' and on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But politicization and loss of confidence are not inevitable,
nor can these problems be blamed exclusively on the independent
counsel law. They were in large measure peculiar to the Starr
investigation. He gave a partisan whiff to his investigation by
having ties to conservative think tanks and accepting an academic
post at a school with financing from Richard Mellon Scaife, a
wealthy Clinton critic. It did not help that Starr's appointment by
a federal three-judge panel had partisan overtones. He shook public
confidence in his probity by continuing to represent paying
clients, such as tobacco companies, when he should have been giving
his full attention to one of the most important inquiries in
presidential history.
</P>
<P>
   The most welcome aspect of Starr's testimony is that it may be a
harbinger of his exit from public life. But he should have spared
us the bad farewell advice. The inability of Attorney General Janet
Reno and her politicized Justice Department to investigate the
Clinton administration shows that the country needs to polish the
independent counsel mechanism, not junk it.
</P>
<P>
   Reforms to improve the appointment process, limit the covered
offices and restrict the jurisdiction of a single prosecutor to
closely related matters are worth considering. There is no perfect
answer, but long after Starr leaves office there will still be a
need for an independent authority to step in because an attorney
general cannot credibly investigate the president who appointed him
or her.

REPORT LOOKS AT CORRUPTION OF SOME U.S. AGENTS ALONG BORDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mexican drug lords are bribing federal agents to give
them information, wave their smugglers through border checkpoints
and even employing them to bring drugs into the United States, a
federal report says.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong study, the General Accounting Office reported
that it found that drug interdiction efforts in Texas, New Mexico,
Arizona and California are compromised by federal agents and other
field staff on the payrolls of the Mexican drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded there is a ``continuing and serious
threat`` of the cartels corrupting Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents, U.S. Customs Service inspectors and Border Patrol
agents along the Mexican border, and that the agencies are not
doing enough to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enormous sums of money being generated by drug trafficking
have increased the threat for bribery,'' said the report to the
Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control.
</P>
<P>
   INS and customs officials said the threat of corruption is real,
but only with a small number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Stephen Colgate and William Riley,
director of planning for the Customs Service, noted that only 28
INS and customs employees were prosecuted for drug-related
corruption along the Southwest border from 1992 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Department of Justice (which includes the INS) believes that
28 instances of corruption out of 9,600 agents over about a
six-year period is a commendable demonstration of the integrity of
ours and (customs) personnel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley also pointed out that GAO's conclusions are based on a
limited review of criminal cases and internal affairs files _ 123
randomly selected corruption cases from fiscal 1997, of which 72
involved INS and 51 involved customs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he readily acknowledged there are procedural problems
that must be addressed, Riley maintained that ``corruption is not
endemic in the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, agreed that corruption is a
serious problem on the border, but said Congress shoulders much of
the blame for underfunding both agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first line of defense is customs and they are
insufficiently staffed and underequipped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With cross-border trade up more than 200 percent since the
passage of NAFTA, Rodriguez said it often takes days for commercial
traffic to clear the border. For example, he said, customs has only
two X-ray machines that can scan an 18-wheeler _ and 5,000 trucks
per day crowd the checkpoint at Laredo, Texas, alone.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 INS and 2,000 customs inspectors must inspect foot
and vehicular traffic at the 25 entry points along the 1,962-mile
border from Brownsville, Texas, to Imperial Beach, Calif., 24 hours
a day, every day of the year. Last year, customs logged 77 million
vehicle entries into Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Between those ports of entry, about 6,300 INS Border Patrol
agents patrol vast expanses of sparsely inhabited terrain in Texas,
Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO cited five ways that some federal employees helped drug
smugglers, with examples of each:
</P>
<P>
   _ Waving vehicles through without inspection. For several years,
it said, an immigration inspector in El Paso, Texas, gave smugglers
his work schedule and lane assignment, allowing them to drive
vehicles loaded with up to 1,000 pounds of marijuana through
without inspection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coordinating movement of drugs in remote areas between ports
of entry. A Border Patrol agent in Douglas, Ariz., it said, had
telephoned marijuana smugglers to tell them where loads could be
brought across. The agent then picked the loads up in his
government vehicle and took it to another location.
</P>
<P>
   _ Transporting drugs past Border Patrol checkpoints. An agent in
Falfurrias, Texas, drove marijuana through the checkpoints manned
by his friends, then deposited it at a safe house before returning
to work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Selling the drugs themselves. One Border Patrol agent in Naco,
Ariz., seized drugs, then sold them to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Selling drug intelligence information. A customs operational
analysis specialist was paid to tip off importers suspected of
smuggling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO concluded that the INS and the Customs Service failed to
fully implement employee integrity measures or evaluate procedural
weaknesses revealed in the cases that were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Full implementation of those policies would identify employees
who were at risk of being corrupted, the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   One immigration inspector told GAO interviewers that he became
involved with a drug smuggler because he had substantial credit
card debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   A more complete financial disclosure, the GAO said, would have
raised red flags when a midlevel Border Patrol agent, who had no
credit card debt or mortgage, acquired a 40-acre ranch with an
indoor, Olympic-size swimming pool, five cars, a van, two boats,
100 weapons and $45,000 in Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   GAO also recommended that traffic be randomly assigned to
inspection lanes at border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Government witnesses have testified in several drug trials that
U.S. officials took payoffs from smugglers who brought cocaine,
marijuana and methamphetamine across the Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Drug cartel members testified in 1996 that drug kingpin Juan
Garcia Abrego kept a stash of cash and gifts for U.S. law
enforcement officers to help bring in large amounts of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Two INS detention officers and one former INS officer used an
agency bus to ferry cocaine and marijuana past a federal checkpoint
in Brownsville while taking illegal immigrants back into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 investigation also found that drugs were readied for
pick-up at an INS facility in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, six former law enforcement officers in Donna,
Texas, were indicted on charges of helping traffickers smuggle
1,700 pounds of marijuana across the border.
</P>
<P>
   But INS spokesman Greg Gagne said the GAO did not give the
agency credit for programs that are in place, such as the
leadership and ethics training center in Dallas, or consider the
effects of years of underfunding.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he has asked that 2,000 additional customs
inspectors and agents be hired nationwide and that $1.2 billion be
given to the agency over seven years to upgrade the computer and
automation system that processes commercial traffic at land ports
of entry.
</P>
<P>
   He told the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee on Tuesday
the increase is necessary because of the growing trade across the
U.S.-Mexico border and crackdown on narcotics smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These individuals are trying to do a job without sufficient
equipment or personnel. They aren't even fully computerized,'' he
said.

ADVERTISING: BURGER KING PLANS OVERHAUL OF RESTAURANTS AND IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to improve its image, food and sales, Burger King Corp.
said Wednesday that it would overhaul its 10,000 restaurants with
new kitchens, modifications to drive-through windows and elaborate
redesigns of the buildings and the company logo.
</P>
<P>
   The flame-broiled concept will remain, but customers can say
goodbye to those boxy structures huddling in the middle of the
shopping mall or along the interstate that have long meant Burger
King. The new restaurants are supposed to be elongated statements
with intersecting jutting planes and a fast-food interpretation of
a clerestory window. Inside, the kitchen will permit views of the
cooking process, flames and all. A children's playground is also
part of the plan. The prototype, hurriedly built in Reno, Nev., is
scheduled to open Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The logo has been recast as slicker and more contemporary. It
has spunkier lettering, and its burger image has been manicured to
make its bun look more like the kind of bread used for panini; a
blue crescent swooshes around three-quarters of the image. The
company also wants to improve service, with restaurants ordered to
focus on ``flawless execution.'' They will be monitored by
``mystery shoppers,'' people hired to pose as customers who then
report to headquarters on how they were treated.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, regarded as among the most extensive in the
ultracompetitive industry, were announced to franchisees Wednesday
in Reno, where Burger King is having an annual business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While McDonald's Corp. reconfigured its kitchens last year to
improve the way its food tastes, the steps that Burger King is
taking are seen as going well beyond that. Analysts wondered how
much the new restaurants would cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they are going a little too far in some of these
changes,'' said Howard Penney, who follows the restaurant industry
for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``The look is good, but this is a
franchise business. The ultimate success is going to depend on the
cost of the building and the sales generated from that building.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Burger King now rings up about $1.1 million in sales
a year, the company said. With the changes in design and service,
the company hopes that number will grow significantly. Penney said
that for every dollar invested in a new building, a typical
franchisee needed to bring in another dollar of business to make
the investment worthwhile. ``That leads me to believe that it is
not likely you will see this widespread anytime soon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King has been inching forward over the last several years
and gaining market share, company executives said, and the changes
announced Wednesday are supposed to continue that trend. ``We have
a lot of momentum, but all along the way we've known that in order
to continue our momentum, there were certain things consumers were
telling us about our brand that we needed to do,'' said Paul
Clayton, president of Burger King's North American division. The
company is a unit of Diageo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes that customers demanded, he added, were ``less
stress at the drive-through,'' where about 60 percent of Burger
King's sales are made. ``And they want it faster,'' he said.
Kitchen redesigns will make that possible, he said, and the company
is even adding a ``customer courtesy zone'' where people can pull
over, request more napkins or condiments and someone from the
restaurant will deliver them to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The look of many Burger King restaurants was also a concern, he
added. ``We know there's a large portion of our restaurant
portfolio that is dated and tired and needs refreshing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton would not disclose how much the Reno prototype had cost
to build, saying that because it was put up on an accelerated
schedule in time for the meeting, the cost would not be
``appropriate to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will remodel 43 restaurants that it owns in Orlando,
Fla., a project that will be finished late next year. ``We won't
know what the system costs are until we leverage the economies,''
Clayton said. Still, the company plans to offer ``a bundle of
incentives and investment options'' that are intended to help
franchise owners redo their restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Burger King said it had signed a new 10-year
contract with Coca-Cola Co. to provide soft-drink fountain service
at its restaurants. The contract, which begins Oct. 1, had been
hotly contested by Pepsi-Cola, a unit of Pepsico, and analysts
speculated that Coca-Cola had to sweeten its offer considerably to
retain the business. About 17 percent, or $1.75 billion, of Burger
King's $10.3 billion in sales last year came from soft drinks,
according to Jim Watkins, the company's vice president for
marketing. Fountain soft drinks have large profit margins for
restaurants, although margins for concentrate makers are smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our agreement is going to create many, many
opportunities for profitable growth for Coca-Cola and for Burger
King by building their soft-drink business,'' said a Coca-Cola
spokeswoman, Polly Howes.
</P>
<P>
   But a Pepsi-Cola spokesman insisted the deal had been costly for
Coke. ``Coke is making one more bizarre investment that their
shareholders are never going to see a return on,'' said the
spokesman, Jeff Brown, who estimated that whatever concessions
Coca-Cola made to Burger King would have to be matched at
McDonald's as well. Ms. Howes said every Coca-Cola customer had
specific terms ``that are based on mutually beneficial
arrangements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory for Coke, but I would imagine Coke's
margins on this are less than their historic margins in the
fountain business,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage
Digest. Still, he added, ``having a big fountain account like
Burger King provides a benefit over and above the sale of
products.'' He said, ``It is a valuable medium for brand visibility
and provides a huge sampling opportunity for a company's
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr Pepper/Seven Up Co., a division of Cadbury Schweppes, also
won a contract to install one spigot serving Dr Pepper in every
Burger King in the United States.

APPLE COMPUTER REPORTS STRONG 2ND QUARTER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reporting its second-quarter earnings Wednesday,
a resurgent Apple Computer Inc. again beat analysts' earnings
estimates. Apple said strong demand for its iMac and G3 machines
increased unit sales by 27 percent, or nearly twice the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's renewed fortunes are all the more striking at a time
when the rest of the personal computer industry is mired in price
wars and slowing growth. Last week the Compaq Computer Corp., the
world's largest PC manufacturer, warned that earnings for the
current quarter would fall far short of estimates, and on Tuesday
the Intel Corp. said sales for its first quarter were slower than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the doom and gloom out there in PC land,'' said
Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ``Apple
dances to its own tune, and it's a happy tune. At some point,
you've got to believe, and I think we're getting closer to that
point, especially since the second half of the year will be
punctuated by a lot of new products.''
</P>
<P>
   Because its computers do not adhere to the Wintel standard _ the
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel's
microprocessors _ Apple was considered weakened and irrelevant for
years. But now, with the Wintel market increasingly the same
regardless of brand, Apple has repositioned itself in the PC market
through ease of use and appealing industrial design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple, fortunately, does not make a Wintel machine,'' Wolf
said. ``Design counts, simplicity counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares closed at $35.5313 Wednesday, up 90.62 cents, in
Nasdaq trading. For the quarter that ended on March 27, Apple
reported earnings of $135 million, or 84 cents a diluted share,
compared with $55 million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-ago
quarter. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $1.53 billion from $1.41
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter's results included $42 million in
extraordinary gains _ $50 million realized in the sale of two
million shares of ARM Holdings PLC, partly offset by a charge of $8
million associated with improving the flexibility and efficiency of
manufacturing operations. Without these nonrecurring items, Apple
said earnings for the quarter would have been $93 million, or 60
cents a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Apple to earn 57 cents a share, according
to the First Call Corp., which tracks results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep making really great computers that people want to
buy,'' Steven P. Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, said in a
telephone interview. ``I don't think they were doing that 18 months
ago when I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, the Apple co-founder who is almost universally credited
with turning around the company that had once exiled him, said
Apple had reached new levels of operating efficiency. Inventory, he
said, has been reduced to just one day, below even that of the Dell
Computer Corp., and cash and short-term investments have been
increased to $2.9 billion, from just over $1 billion when he
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Apple said it was increasing the speed of the iMac
to 300 megahertz, from 266 megahertz, while keeping the price at
$1,199. Apple also announced Wednesday the early call for
redemption on June 1 of all of its 6 percent convertible
subordinated debentures due June 1, 2001.

OIL FIELD WORKERS IN TEXAS APPLAUD PAT BUCHANAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ODESSA, Texas _ More than 700 oil field workers who fear losing
their jobs to low prices and foreign imports warmly applauded
Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan as he promised
Wednesday to restore America's ``energy independence'' through oil
import fees.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan told the crowd at a local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall
that such fees would save the domestic oil industry by creating a
floor the foreign oil producers could not undercut in U.S. markets.
Buchanan said OPEC and Iraq have flooded the nation with cheap oil
with the intent ``to kill the American oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then OPEC and the foreign producers will have control of the
United States,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil field service worker Duane Moreland, 56, said Buchanan now
has his vote ``hands down'' for the GOP presidential nomination
over Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who opposes oil import fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I would have voted for George Bush without
question. But now his ego has gotten so big and he's so politicized
that he won't even address an issue, certainly not our issue,''
Moreland said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreland said Bush could have used his office as a ``bully
pulpit'' to push for oil tariffs to protect the domestic oil
industry. But Moreland said Bush has avoided the issue because ``it
would be politically unpopular to the rest of the country'' where
people want low-cost fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Ramirez, president of the Kermit chapter of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, said he lost his job as a pipeline
worker because of the oil slump.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez said he voted for Bush's re-election as governor last
year, but now he is open to voting for Buchanan for president
because he is talking about taking actions that will help average
oil field workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor passed the tax break for the ivory tower guys,''
Ramirez said. ``The worker didn't get anything extra, like the
Band-Aid the independents got.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently signed an emergency tax break for the owners of
marginal oil and gas wells, releasing them from paying state taxes
when oil prices fall below $12 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush differs sharply with
Buchanan on trade issues because the governor believes in ``free
and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) opposes an import fee. He believes it would create a
protectionist war ... that ultimately would hurt American
workers,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent his childhood in neighboring Midland, Texas, and
later worked there for about 10 years running an oil exploration
company.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is paying a private courtesy call on Bush
Thursday, avoided any direct criticism of the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides their differences on oil import fees, Bush supports the
North American Free Trade Agreement while Buchanan opposes it,
saying NAFTA has ``taken America's Sun Belt and shifted it south of
the Rio Grande.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan told his Odessa audience that contradictory national
policies have hurt the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last summer, we're bombing Saddam Hussein, American
fighter-bombers, while he's selling us 500,000 barrels of oil a day
at $8 and 1/2. He's bombing West Texas,'' Buchanan said. ``What is
going on in this country that Saddam Hussein can bomb us with this
imported oil at the same time we're bombing him?''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also toured the oil-drilling firm of Permian Producers
Inc. in Midland, where $4 million drilling rigs are sitting idle.
Company owner Tom Carman said he is in danger of going out of
business because he has a contract with Texaco to drill five wells
in New Mexico, but cannot start because the drilling site is the
nesting grounds of prairie chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said such kowtowing to prairie chickens could cost
Texas 1,000 jobs directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on when we are more worried about chickens than
the 1,000 people who depend on Tommy Carman?'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, who employs 25 people, said he has not decided who to
support for president. But he said Bush's tax break for marginal
well owners was a ``token amount.'' Carman said he is impressed by
Buchanan's talk of an overall fix for the oil industry but also
would like to have Bush tour his facility.

SERBS AND NATO EACH ACCUSE THE OTHER OF ATTACK THAT KILLED ALBANIAN
REFUGEES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A column of civilians came under fire
Wednesday and an unknown number were killed in southern Kosovo. The
Yugosvlav government and NATO exchanged bitter accusations over who
carried out the deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials charged that NATO warplanes bombed two columns of
Albanian refugees, killing 64. Describing what it claimed was one
of the attacks, Serb television broadcast a chilling film showing
mutilated bodies, destroyed tractors and stunned civilians. A
Reuters photo from the scene showed civilian vehicles, armed
soldiers, and bodies in civilian clothing scattered along the road.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of a day of confused battlefield reports, all
that was certain was that the civilians were killed by military
fire.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Pentagon acknowledged that NATO warplanes had
attacked a military convoy in the same area but said they had not
targeted civilians. They issued a series of contradictory
statements through the day about the possibility of civilian
casualties, ending with a Pentagon statement late Wednesday night
saying only that the U.S. military did not know precisely what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier at a news conference here, the NATO Commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark, said he had evidence that it was the Serbs who shot
up the refugees after the alliance's pilots had attacked military
vehicles near the town of Djakovica in southwest Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But later in Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said
that Clark no longer believed that was true and did not have
evidence to support his accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the Albanian refugees in Kosovo has become one of
the most politically charged aspects of the conflict in Yugoslavia.
NATO has used the images of suffering refugees streaming out of
Kosovo to muster public support for the bombing, while the Serbs
have presented the refugees as victims of NATO bombing attacks. As
the bombings continue, the number of civilian casualties has risen
and is becoming more inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a NATO warplane twice attacked a train in Yugoslavia
in an effort to knock out a bridge. NATO has acknowledged that the
train was hit by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's charges and countercharges raised the possibility
that NATO pilots had mistakenly hit civilians or that the Serbs
killed their own citizens so that they could show the carnage on
television and blame the deaths on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said the alliance was still reviewing the combat
film from the attack and completing its interview with the pilots
</P>
<P>
   NATO insisted Wednesday night, however, that it did not bomb
columns of displaced Albanians. In a statement, the alliance said
that its aircraft had carried out ``controlled attacks on military
vehicles'' at about 3:30 p.m. local time near a highway bridge,
just east of Djakovica. The NATO planes were fired on by
anti-aircraft artillery and hand-held surface-to-air missiles
during their bombing runs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Bacon said, ``We're quite sure that we only hit
military vehicles and we will obviously will review what happened
there to find out if there was a problem.'' His statement appeared
to leave open the possibility of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials told Western reporters in Belgrade on
Wednesday that the alliance's warplanes had bombed columns of
ethnic Albanian refugees in broad daylight _ the very people NATO
says it is trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb-run Media Center in Pristina charged that ethnic
Albanians were killed in several attacks in the southwest part of
Kosovo near the town of Djakovica. Serb television footage showed
dead civilians, lying near destroyed tractors and farm vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In his first account of what happened, Clark told the Bloomberg
news service: ``There was a military convoy and a refugee convoy.
We struck the Serb convoy, and we have very strong evidence that
the Serbs then retaliated by attacking the column of refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said there may have been a single column.
According to this version, military vehicles were at the front and
rear, with civilians in the middle of the convoy. The NATO planes
were careful to strike the military vehicles at both ends of the
column and broke off the attack when the pilots noted the
civilians, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Bacon said a NATO warplane had attacked a
military vehicle and that the pilot then broke off his attack when
he saw there were civilian vehicles in the convoy. He would not say
what sort of airplane was involved, what country it was from, what
weapons were being used and whether the attack was at a low-level
or a high altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said it has received reports of still another
attack against a column of refugees, which was carried out by Serb
helicopters and planes. It is based on reports that refugees
provided to U.N. officials after crossing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that hundreds of woman and children were on the road
from Prizren to Kukes when they came under fire from Serb aircraft.
That attack, the Pentagon said, took place about 2 p.m. local time,
about an hour and half before the attack near Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said that U.N. authorities had provided those accounts.
But the director of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees in Washington, Karen AbuZayd, said that her organization
had received no such report by Wednesday evening.

BRUSSELS, Belgium: Wednesday evening.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all accounts, the situation of civilians in Kosovo has become
increasingly desperate. NATO says there are about 260,000 displaced
civilians inside the province, bases its estimates on figures from
the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   American and British officials have said the number may reach
700,000 or even higher, using what a NATO military spokesman,
Italian Brig. Gen. Giuseppe Marani called a worst-case estimate.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insists it is not able to help the displace civilians
inside Kosovo because its transport planes might be shot down if
they tried to drop relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and disease are not the only threats the displaced
Albanians face in Kosovo, the alliance says. British officials
disclosed Wednesday that Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnia Serb
military commander who has been indicted by the War Crimes
Tribunal, was leading a Serb paramilitary group in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Zeljko Raznatovic, also known as Arkan, was also seeking
recruits in prisons in Yugoslavia to augment his paramilitary band
in Kosovo, British officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Serb units have been systematically raping young ethnic Albanian
women at a Serb checkpoint just a few miles from the border with
Albanian, according to refugee reports monitored by British
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to mobilize public opinion, NATO has said that it
is Milosevic who has put the Kosovars in jeopardy. To drive home
its point, the alliance has shown reconnaissance photos of long
lines of civilians along roadsides and in makeshift shelters.
Western officials say that Milosevic is depriving the refugees of
food and assistance and has even shelled them on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are citizens of his country,'' Clark said
Tuesday. ``That's what he has said all along. He needs to
demonstrate his leadership and concern for his own citizens, who
are being held out there hostage, isolated, and starved.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, however, has sought to pin the blame on NATO, saying
the air strikes had worsened their plight.

HARTFORD COURANT BUYS LOCAL ALTERNATIVE WEEKLY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Conn., Md.)   By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Two weeks ago, the irreverent tabloid editors
at The Hartford Advocate published an April Fool's parody of the
city's only daily, The Hartford Courant, lampooning ``America's
Oldest Continuously Published Newspaper'' as ``America's Lamest
Continuously Published Newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Advocate, meet your new boss: The Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, The Courant announced it had bought The Advocate and
its four sister publications in Westchester County, N.Y., Fairfield
County, New Haven and western Massachusetts. Purchase terms were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper industry analysts said it was one of the first times a
major American daily had taken over the major alternative weekly in
its home city, representing a novel extension of the monopoly on
local voices enjoyed by publishers in one-newspaper cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the other shoe people have been waiting for,'' said
Abe Peck, an associate dean of the Medill School of Journalism at
Northwestern University, who is an authority on the underground
press of the 1960s. ``The alternative is now the mainstream. The
alternative press emerged as a voice beyond the massified downtown
dailies. Now, we're just talking about an alternative tone.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement seemed to point to the convergence of two
publishing trends, experts said. Alternative weeklies, like The
Village Voice in New York, which have grown in number and girth as
they emerged as a successful way to reach younger and hipper
readers, began aggregating into regional and national chains.
Dailies began acquiring suburban papers and shoppers as a defense
against the loss of advertising or readers.
</P>
<P>
   The five weeklies purchased by The Courant are owned by New
Mass. Media Inc. of Hatfield, Mass., and have a combined
circulation of 270,000. The Courant, which on Monday was awarded
the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news for its coverage of a killing
spree at the state lottery headquarters, has a circulation of
211,000 daily and 303,000 on Sunday. It is owned by the Times
Mirror Co., the parent of The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Petty, the publisher of The Courant, said in a letter to
employees that the publications would remain separate. ``We believe
the alternative press can play an important role in keeping all
media, including The Courant, on its toes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some readers reacted with alarm to The Courant, seen as
reliable but bland, adopting the lively Advocate chain. The local
arts community treated Wednesday's announcement like a death in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big brother taking over,'' said Alyssa S. Peterson,
owner of NetFX, a Web design firm. ``The Advocate is everything The
Courant isn't. Where do we go now?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard M. Karpel, the executive director of the Association of
Alternative Newsweeklies, said he found Wednesday's announcement
disturbing, and hoped other dailies did not do the same in their
areas. ``Centralized management would strip out the idiosyncrasies
that make the alternative paper worth reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror publishes four daily newspapers in the Northeast:
Newsday on Long Island, The Courant, and, also in Connecticut, the
Greenwich Time and The Advocate of Stamford. Mark H. Willes, the
chairman of Times Mirror, said The Hartford Advocate and its sister
weeklies ``connect with a readership that we have not been as
successful with: the younger age group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find a way to reach out to literally every
segment we can in our markets,'' Willes said in a telephone
interview. ``Any time you can give either your readers or
advertisers, or both, more alternatives, we think you can grow your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The chain began with The Valley Advocate in Amherst, Mass.,
first published in 1973. The headquarters later moved to Hatfield,
and the chain's founders helped start each of the four other
papers. The Hartford Advocate is the largest, with a circulation of
70,000. It has 23 of the chain's 135 employees.
</P>
<P>
   All the newspapers are distributed free. The Valley Advocate now
has a circulation of 65,000. The New Haven Advocate, started in
1975, has a circulation of 55,000. The Fairfield County Weekly,
started in 1978, has a circulation of 50,000. The Westchester
County Weekly, started in 1993, has a circulation of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   John Morton, a newspaper analyst of Silver Spring, Md., said the
purchase made good business sense. ``It moves Times Mirror in small
way into a culture that they haven't been in before,'' he said.
``The problem that daily newspapers have is appealing to people in
the 18-to-35 age group. Clearly the alternative weeklies are
prospering in that niche, and that makes them attractive properties
to daily newspaper companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern, who publishes seven major weeklies, including The
Village Voice, said he was surprised that daily newspapers had not
found this strategy before. ``The demographics at almost all of the
major dailies begin at an age level where the alternatives leave
off. The alternatives continue the collegiate atmosphere: two or
three or four people live in an apartment, and someone brings home
the local weekly.'' The owners, Geoffrey Robinson and Christine
Austin, visited each paper Wednesay to explain the decision to the
staffs. Both said the purchase by a media giant constituted a
vindication of alternative weeklies.
</P>
<P>
   The Advocate's editor, Janet Reynolds, mentioned several Courant
features that she thinks were inspired by her newspaper, including
Cal, a tabloid arts section published on Thursday. ``They're trying
to be trendy and cutting edge, but instead it comes across as
patronizing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped. ``I may be talking myself out of a job,'' she said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Francis J. Zankowski, publisher of The Hartford Advocate, said
he intended to maintain ``a strong and independent voice.'' Would
he still publish that parody issue of the ``Hartford Not So
Current''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ab-so-lutely,'' Zankowski said, pounding his desk mirthfully.
``It's even funnier now.''

SOME REFUGEES IN ALBANIA READY TO FIGHT BACK 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ Sitting in a cold tent with rainwater
trickling across the floor, Hadja Berani said she has decided to
join the ethnic Albanian guerrillas battling the Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fight,'' said Berani, 22, as she glanced down at
her soaked stocking feet and wrapped her arms around her shoulders
in an effort to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to end quickly,'' she said of the misery in the
sprawling refugee camp that has sprung up on the edge of this dingy
port city.
</P>
<P>
   Berani said she plans to join her 20-year-old brother, Fuad, who
stayed behind in Kosovo to fight with the guerrillas when the rest
of the family _ fearing murder at the hands of the Serbs _ fled the
province two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, others of the estimated 300,000 Kosovars who
have poured into Albania since the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began
share Berani's intentions to take up arms, which they see as a way
to end the conflict quickly. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Training of troops for the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army is reportedly under way near Albania's border with Yugoslavia.
Young men who say they plan to join the guerrillas have been
arriving in Albania on the ferry boat from Italy each day.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Kosovar refugees say, however, that they expect the
crisis to be resolved by NATO ground troops within a few months, if
not weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to NATO soldiers and equipment,'' said Avdi Morina, a
37-year-old lab technician who now lives with his wife, two
children and about 900 other refugees in the cramped barracks of an
army training camp on the outskirts of the Albanian capital of
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are bombing, but now is the time to go in,'' Morina said.
``What are they waiting for? Ground forces are the only way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are apparently shared by some members of the
U.S. Congress, who asked President Clinton on Tuesday to begin
preparing for a ground war. Clinton, however, insisted that the
bombing campaign needs more time to work. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Thousands of NATO troops have been pouring into Albania.
Officials say the soldiers are here to aid the humanitarian mission
of caring for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Private relief agencies and NATO military planners seem to be
preparing for a long stay.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of aid _ including food, bedding, clothing and medical
supplies _ have begun arriving in Albania daily, both by ship
through the port of Durres and on the dozens of cargo flights
landing at the airport outside Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Military helicopters from the United States, France and
Switzerland have ferried the aid to refugee camps near the Kosovo
border and elsewhere in Albania. Food and other goods have been
loaded onto flatbed trucks lining the narrow road near the airport
runway each day.
</P>
<P>
   Swarms of four-wheel drive vehicles carrying relief workers and
foreign officials have overwhelmed the country's narrow, rutted
roads, adding to already monumental traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the start,'' said Corinne Woods, a worker for the
private aid agency Save the Children, as she passed out supplies to
refugees at a camp one day earlier this week. ``We're going to be
here for four or five years. Either here or in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Kosovar refugees continued to enter Albania and
Macedonia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the Kosovars who earlier fled their homes, the men,
women and children who passed through the small Albanian border
post of Hani i Hoti had been stripped of their identity papers and
money.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of Yugoslavia, the refugees were registered by Albanian
officials, who wrote their names and home towns in a ledger. The
Kosovars were then loaded onto buses and taken to a basketball
coliseum in the nearby city of Shkodra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait to see what happens, what we'll have to do,''
said a weary Mustafa Almetas, 48, who arrived at the Shkodra
coliseum with his wife and five children from the Kosovo town of
Cerle one day earlier this week. ``We can't go back as long as
there is no security.''
</P>
<P>
   The Almetas family joined about 1,500 earlier arrivals, whose
foam mattresses already were packed tightly on the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   With little space left on the floor, the Almetases were ushered
into low-backed plastic seats lining the perimeter of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Young Albanian volunteers handed out plates of canned beef stew
and chunks of bread provided by the United Nations. Foreign relief
workers waded through the crowd, passing out toothbrushes, soap and
other necessities.
</P>
<P>
   After he ate, Almetas stumbled across the floor of the
basketball court, threading his way through the narrow aisles
separating the mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they'll find us a place to sleep,'' a worried Almetas
said. ``But I don't see any place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we'll do,'' he said. ``I just don't know
what we'll do at all.''

ELIZABETH DOLE QUESTIONS CLINTON'S BALKAN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.) (mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ Elizabeth Dole accused the Clinton
administration Wednesday night of conducting a Balkan policy that
``encourages adversaries to shift strategies, wait it out, or
attempt to break our alliances.'' She called on President Clinton
to ``build up and deploy the forces necessary to win the war'' in
Kosovo, including sending ground troops if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy that her
campaign billed as a major foreign policy address, Mrs. Dole, a
Republican presidential contender and the only woman in the race,
also sharply criticized Clinton's credibility and steadfastness of
purpose in his approach to both Iraq and Yugoslav aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility counts,'' she said. ``And if you have any
questions about that, look at the U.N. weapons inspections mess in
Iraq or today's tragedy in Kosovo. When tough deadlines are set and
then repeatedly postponed, when the other side appears to break its
agreements with impunity, when we accept half- promises, we send
the wrong signal about our values and our will.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's speech placed her firmly in the internationalist
wing of her divided party and allowed her to show that a woman can
talk tough on military matters. Unlike the growing number of
Republicans in Congress who disdain international organizations,
she emphasized the importance of NATO as well as world financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership in international trade and monetary
organizations is essential for upholding our core economic
interests and promoting worldwide economic growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Dole, the speech served several particular purposes.
She has lagged toward the back of the Republican field in fund
raising and could benefit from respectful notices in the foreign
policy arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a circle in politics,'' acknowledged one of her
advisers. ``Good poll numbers raise money. Good press gets you good
poll numbers. Good press gets you money.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political commentators, particularly at this moment of
crisis overseas, have questioned whether Mrs. Dole has had any
experience that would give her a mastery of military matters.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Wednesday night she sought to show that she does
have international experience. She spoke descriptively of visiting
world trouble spots like the borders of Rwanda and Bosnia as
president of the American Red Cross and of meeting with Solidarity
leaders in Poland in 1989 as labor secretary. And she mentioned her
role as a negotiator with China on aviation and maritime matters as
transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster that experience, she announced Wednesday night that
she will leave on Thursday for Macedonia and Albania to visit camps
of Albanian refugees from Kosovo and meet with local leaders. Her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, met with Albanian leaders in Kosovo
last month as an envoy for the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning Clinton by name, Mrs. Dole deplored American
commitments ``caged in hesitation'' and said, ``Long experience
teaches that when we've committed military forces to a rightful
goal, we should use all the power necessary to achieve it.'' She
said she would endorse the use of ground forces if NATO commanders
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff said they were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of debate over the role of the U.S. military in the
post-Cold War world, when conservatives say that U.S. forces have
strayed from their primary military role, Mrs. Dole embraced the
kinds of refugee relief operations that NATO troops are carrying
out near Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled flying to Zaire (now Congo) to see the camps for
those fleeing massacres in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the plane's window I saw a huge mass of people in the
choking dust and heat,'' she said. ``I also saw jeeps and trucks
with our beautiful red-on-white cross _ and an enormous C-141
military aircraft, unloading critical supplies. To those who
criticize the military's role in such rescue efforts, I'll just say
there are simply times when nobody else can do the job.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole noted that some people ask why the United Nations and
regional bodies cannot take care of regional problems. ``The answer
is simple,'' she said. ``Wherever America's national interests and
our national values intersect, this nation must lead. That includes
using military force when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes she sidestepped hard questions. She failed to say
whether she thought the U.S. forces should have intervened to stop
the Rwanda conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On China, she endorsed engagement, but called simultaneously for
Beijing to be pressed harder on human rights and in trade
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time she said the United States should ``stand by
our friends in Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a midshipman questioned her pointedly on how far the
United States would go to defend Taiwan against China, she replied:
``I think there are some things that I want to look at very, very
carefully before I give you a definitive answer. I am not yet an
announced candidate, much less the elected nominee of the party.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I live in San Francisco and am committed to my Microsoft
Windows 95 system. My daughter lives in Hawaii and is committed to
her Macintosh, because she is a teacher and they use Macs at her
school. Is it possible to exchange floppies so I can do some typing
work for her, or do we need special equipment?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  If you're using the same software _ i.e., Microsoft
Word on both platforms _ you can ``sneaker-net'' files on floppies.
Use disks formatted for a PC, because Macs can read them thanks to
a nifty bit of software called PC Exchange that comes with the Mac.
PCs can't read disks formatted for a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to try having your daughter simply e-mail the
documents to you as attachments. If you're both using Microsoft
Word, you should be able to open the documents, work on them and
send them back to her. If you're using different word processors,
have her save the documents in RTF format before e-mailing them.
That will preserve much of the formatting while guaranteeing that
you can open the files.
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail, Sort Of
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question regarding the e-mail function in America
Online. I would like to be able to use Microsoft Outlook to send
and receive e-mail instead of the default e-mail client that comes
with AOL. Is that possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately not. Although most Internet service providers
let you use any e-mail program, including Microsoft Outlook,
America Online subscribers are stuck with AOL's proprietary Mail
system. There used to be a program called Claris Emailer, which
worked with AOL on Macintosh computers, but it's no longer being
made.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, there is a way that AOL users can send
and receive mail even when they're away from a computer that has
AOL's software. It's called AOL NetMail, and it lets you access
your messages from any computer with an Internet connection and a
browser. All you do is go to &LR;  www.aol.com &LR;   &LR; /netmail/  &LR; and sign
onto your account as you normally would. A Web-based version of
your AOL mailbox is displayed that provides most of the features
you'd normally get. You can write a new message, delete an old one
and check messages you've sent.
</P>
<P>
   Tidying Up the Desktop
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have had a problem removing icons from my desktop that
involve applications I have downloaded from the Internet. Whenever
I try to remove these icons, I get a message saying that if I
delete the icon, I will not be able to run the application. My
desktop is cluttered with these icons. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the icons are probably the installation files that
you downloaded (you double-clicked these files to install the
programs, right?) If that's the case, you can safely delete the
icons. The only reason you might want to save one is if it's a huge
file and you think you might have to reinstall it. By keeping it,
you wouldn't have to go through a long download again.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that an icon could represent the actual working
program, in which case deleting it would disable the program. But
that's highly unlikely. I don't know of any program that installs
itself right on the Windows Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Some of your icons also probably are shortcuts _ tiny links that
let you start programs from the desktop. If you go to delete one of
these icons, you won't get a warning message. By right-clicking an
icon and choosing Properties, you'll see right away whether you're
dealing with a shortcut or a program file of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   No Warm Welcome AtHome
</P>
<P>
   Q: I subscribed to AtHome two months ago and have experienced
outages and lethargic connections. Customer service is as close to
nonexistent as possible with this company. When calling by phone,
one is greeted with a standard message about unusually high call
volume and a wait of a minimum of 30 minutes. I have sent six
e-mails concerning service and have never received a reply. Is
there any recourse when an Internet service provider does not
respond? I've invested a couple hundred dollars in startup costs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There's no excuse for AtHome not responding to your
queries. Who do they think they are, anyway, the phone company? Why
don't you call one of their PR people and leave a complaint on the
voice mail: Try Matt Wolfrom at (650) 569-5195 or Molly Lynch at
(650) 569-5555. Don't expect them to call back _ heck, they don't
even call me back sometimes. But at least they'll know they've got
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  If you turn off your PC without going through the proper
procedure to shut down Windows, you may be treated to a delay the
next time you start it as Windows goes through a screening process
to make the system's all right. That takes only a minute or so, but
it's irritating. So here's what you do: As soon as the blue screen
appears and the screening process starts, hit the Enter key. That
will abort the process and immediately launch Windows.

   AMERICAN-ART-CENTURY (Undated) _ Art-wise, was this really the
American century? We take the cliche for granted because, well,
because we are so arrogant. Never mind that its just a catch phrase
cooked up in 1941 by Henry Luce, the most thoroughly
unreconstructed of American chauvinists, partly out of missionary
zeal and partly to sell his magazine. The American Century is the
title of what looks to be an immense two-part survey at the Whitney
Museum of American Art, the first part of which, covering the years
1900 to 1950, will open Friday. It's one of several century-ending
extravaganzas (the Modern is planning another). And no doubt they
all, to some degree, will confront the cliche of American
predominance in visual art, deciding what it means and whether it
really makes sense. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   JUDSON-DANCE (New York) _ In the not too distant past it was my
good fortune to chance upon the performance of an arresting,
unconventional work. A luminous fabric comprising music both vocal
and instrumental, literary fragments from varied centuries and
civilizations, and everyday movement functioning as dance, it
projected an irresistible aura of good will and celebrated the
wonderful power of artistic persuasion. And, for the best of
reasons, it reminded me instantly of the Judson Dance Theater, that
whirlpool of restless creative spirits performing at Judson
Memorial Church at Washington Square in the 1960s. Now, 37 years
after they first began enjoying Judson's hospitality, a group of
those formerly young would-be creators, who found performance and
exhibition space when they needed it most, are expressing their
gratitude in ``No Limits _ A Celebration of Freedom and Art to
Benefit Judson Memorial Church.'' Some 75 dancers/choreographers,
poets, painters and sculptors are expected to participate in events
that began at the church last Friday and will run through this
Saturday. By Allen Hughes. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NOBREGA-DANCE (Undated) _ Antonio Nobrega, a Brazilian performer
who will be making his United States debut at the Kennedy Center's
American Dance Festival April 27 through 29, trots out a variety of
characters in ``Figural,'' the one-man show he will use to greet
North American audiences. The figures he conjures, through mime,
dance, music and acrobatics, are not simply creatures of the
artist's fancy but a string of types meant as a showcase for
Brazil's culturally rich northeast. By Diana Jean Schemo. (Moved).

<P>
   THEATER-NIGHTCLUB (New York) _ Coaxing nightclubs from
legitimate theaters is not unheard of. Florenz Ziegfeld found room
for one in 1915 atop his New Amsterdam Theater on West 42d Street.
Throughout the life span of Ziegfeld's ``Follies,'' the New
Amsterdam roof was the toniest nightspot in New York. But Joe's Pub
on Lafayette Street, is a much less lofty enterprise, carved as it
is from ground-floor back-office space at the theater. The $2.35
million club is the result, in part, of a construction and
renovation grant to the Public from city capital funds that
includes refurbishment of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park.
There were some doubters when the Pub opened in October about
whether the Public Theater could make a theater-night life alliance
work. Six months later, according to George C. Wolfe, the producer
of the Public Theater, Joe's Pub ``is actually doing better than I
thought it would.'' By Barry Singer. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-WAR-MUSICAL (Undated) _ A wall of cannons atop a grassy,
open slope. Forty thousand men killed or wounded in three days near
Gettysburg, Pa. It was the numbers that got to Frank Wildhorn, the
composer of ``The Civil War,'' the new Broadway musical opening on
Thursday at the St. James Theater. At a time when Broadway is
devoted to revivals of American classics _ both straight plays and
musicals _ and imports from London, Wildhorn is one of the few
composers creating musicals that are new, American and popular with
audiences. By Roxane Orgill. (Moved). Photo.

</P>
<P>
   HISTORIC-RELEASES (Undated) _ Anyone who gets anywhere near a
record store or catalogue knows that ``historic'' releases are
coming from every direction. Legitimate enterprises like Nimbus's
``Grand Piano'' series and Philips's giant new survey of the
century's best pianists compete with pirate tapes of murky
legitimacy. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BOOMER-COMPOSERS (Undated) _ Going to a contemporary-music
concert in the 1970s to hear new works by young Americans could
often be a discombobulating experience. The composers were
baby-boomers who had grown up with Motown, rhythm-and-blues and 60s
rock. Yet from some of the music they composed, you would have
thought that they had been living in gas-lit garrets in Vienna
during the 1920s, completely in thrall to the radical 12-tone works
of Schoenberg, Webern and Berg. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).

<P>
   NY-ARTISTS (New York) _ What defines a New York artist at the
end of the 20th century? The question surfaced with the
announcement that the works to be exhibited at the next Whitney
Biennial would be chosen by a team of art professionals who neither
work at the museum nor live in New York. Maxwell L. Anderson, the
museum's director, spoke of giving the show a ``national
perspective.'' After 25 years of having New Yorkers select the
show, it could be interesting to reverse the gaze, as theorists
might say, and see what non-New Yorkers come up with. By Roberta
Smith. (Moved).

   BROADWAY-THEATER-ARCHIVE (New York) _ A venture called the

rebroadcast some of the productions as ``Treasures From the

<P>
   TV-WILL-AND-GRACE (Los Angeles) _ Last fall, when ``Will and
Grace'' had its premiere, television pundits took up column space
debating whether America was ready for a show about the sometimes
touching and always complicated intimacy between best-friend
roommates, one of whom is openly homosexual (Will) and the other, a
love-hungry heterosexual career gal (Debra Messing's Grace). But
viewers pronounced the discussion moot by declaring their love for
Sean Hayes's role as Jack McFarland. After three episodes, the NBC

hype the show by broadcasting a 30-second Jack spot, complete with
a fever-pitch montage of Jack footage and a goofy Jack theme song.

   CHANDELIER-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The Age of Reason was also the
Age of Reflection. Chandeliers dripped with cut-glass lusters,
moldings glimmered with gold leaf. Mirrors were placed behind
blazing candles and opposite sunny, full-length windows. And
surprisingly, at least some chimney pieces of the day were
literally architectural jewels, studded, paved and highlighted with
paste diamonds (in other words, rhinestones). ``There was such a
need to magnify the light candles gave out,'' said William Jay
Iselin, a former Christie's associate who now works with the
eminent Paris antiquary Ariane Dandois. ``Anything that could
refract light, to up the candle power, so to speak, was embraced.''
Recently exhibited at the Palm Beach International Art and Antiques
Fair, one of Iselin and Ms. Dandois's most spectacular finds is a
formally carved, rhinestone-studded chimney piece, circa 1790. The
chandelier, which is about 12 feet high and 14 feet wide, is for
sale at $95,000. By Mitchell Owens. (Moved).

 Making Digital Tunes Big Business
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The grassroots popularity of free MP3 songs on the Internet has
quickly reshaped the future of the worldwide music industry.
</P>
<P>
   But now that two of the biggest players in technology, Microsoft
and IBM, are competing to bring Internet music to the masses, it
should hasten the day when mainstream consumers can buy and
download digitized Top 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  And that same competition could eventually push MP3 out of
the spotlight, said analyst Mark Hardie of Forrester Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its 15 seconds of fame is not going to go on for much more,''
said Hardie of the MP3 format, which in the past year moved from
being an obscure audio compression technology to the second-most
requested topic on Internet search engines, right behind sex.
</P>
<P>
   The free format caused a revolution among teens and young adults
who were able to copy, trade and distribute songs from both popular
and unknown artists.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 software compresses the size of song files so they can be
sent more quickly over the Internet. MP3 songs can be played back
on a computer or a portable, Walkman-like device.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the music industry said MP3 fans break copyright laws and
blamed pirated MP3 songs for a recent drop in CD sales to young
consumers. MP3 proponents say big record companies are hyping
piracy issues to mask their real concerns that the format could
undermine the industry's elaborate CD distribution and revenue
stream while transferring more power to individual artists and
independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. In a recent report, Forrester Research
predicted the downloading of music from the Internet will add $1.1
billion in revenues to the U.S. music industry by 2003 as the Web
turns ``from a pirate's paradise to the (music) industry's
e-commerce growth engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Several developments this week show technology companies are
serious about making digital music big business.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest announcement came from Microsoft, which hosted a
splashy Los Angeles party at the House of Blues Tuesday night to
announce trial versions of its new Internet audio software, called
Media Technologies 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The program, which the Redmond, Wash., software giant will
distribute for free with its Windows operating system and over the
Internet, can compress songs to a size about twice as small as
available with MP3, so music can be downloaded more quickly and
take up less memory when stored on a computer hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gary Schare, Microsoft media technologies product manager,
said a song that is 40 megabytes on a CD-ROM can be compressed to
about 4 megs using MP3 and to about 2 megs using Media
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Media Technologies also enables artists and record labels to
protect copyrights with built-in encryption, or if they chose,
distribute free music for promotional purposes as some are doing
now with the MP3 format, Schare said. The MP3 format by itself does
not provide copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   The new format also plays FM-quality audio and video files
directly from Web sites, which puts Microsoft in competition with
RealNetworks Inc., the Seattle company whose RealPlayer software
``streams'' audio and video files to about 55 million Web surfers.
The MP3 format can't be used to stream audio in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, RealNetworks said it was teaming with IBM to
develop secure Internet music download software that would compete
with Microsoft's Media Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Questions still remain whether the big five record labels, which
reportedly are wary about siding with Microsoft, will use the new
technology to sell music. Music and technology industry leaders
have formed a consortium to hash out common standards to sell songs
on the Internet, but the process will take another year to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But analysts say Microsoft's &LR;   &LR; marketing of its Internet
music technology will push the market even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft ``may not always start the market, but they're masters
at entering into it,'' said Ron Rappaport, an analyst with Zona
Research Inc. in Redwood City. ``Microsoft lands wherever it
believes the market opportunity is large enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition could eventually eclipse the MP3 format, which
flourished when it stood alone on stage. While nobody is predicting
an immediate demise of the MP3 phenomenon or that the format will
disappear entirely, analysts say consumers will eventually
gravitate toward better technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie said Media Technologies produces slightly better quality
sound than an MP3 file, but its ability to create smaller files is
the major advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said MP3 is going to fade when commercially viable
solutions are available,'' Hardie said. ``It won't disappear
overnight. But its quality is limited, it can't get much better. If
you are a band, if you want to distribute your music online, you'll
want it in the best quality you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grady, marketing director for GoodNoise Inc., a Redwood
City company that is trying to become an online digital music
seller, believes the MP3 format for now will endure because its
popularity is not based on the technology, but freedom of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (MP3 fans) are excited about is the flexibility MP3 gives
them with their music, the fact that you are now empowered to buy
music in new ways and organize it the way you want,'' Grady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a certainty that something will replace MP3 as a
compression technology,'' he said. ``But MP3 has taken off because
of its availability and ubiquity, not because it's great
technology.''

CHINA LEADER ENDS U.S. VISIT WITH TRADE TALK AT MIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By   JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has a
theory about his country's trade surplus with the United States,
and he went on a shopping spree to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Scouring department stores during a stop in Chicago, he
collected athletic shoes made by Nike, Reebok and Adidas. Each pair
had a ``Made in China'' label, but the prime minister said it is
hardly a glorious business. He compared the prices with ones in a
similar survey he did a decade ago and found that the average price
of a pair has declined, to about $80 from $120.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even 15 years ago America did not produce many of these
goods,'' Zhu said in a speech devoted to trade at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology here Wednesday. ``Now, you could not find
anyone willing to make them in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was with such elementary logic that Zhu tried to debunk an
often heard complaint about China: that it has become an exporting
power at America's expense. China makes the things Americans do not
want to make, the prime minister said. Besides, he added, the U.S.
estimate of China's trade surplus, $57 billion last year, is
probably too high.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was the longest and most detailed of any during Zhu's
nine-day visit, which ended Wednesday with his departure for
Canada. Where others see U.S.-China relations revolving around
issues like human rights, strategic cooperation and political
reform, Zhu sees the two countries getting along so long as trade
between them flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by a student attending his MIT speech to release the
Chinese dissident Xu Wenli from prison, Zhu complained about the
amount of time he has spent talking about human rights on his trip.
``I practically have blisters on my mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is more the case. He has given meager lip service
to human rights while speaking several times each day about trade,
specifically China's bid to join the World Trade Organization. It
was only after his long discourse on trade Wednesday that he warmed
up to making a broader assessment of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that you see the strategic nature of our
relationship,'' Zhu said. ``We are not your enemy. We are your
trustworthy friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhu ran into the biggest demonstrations of his visit on his
final day. Cambridge is home to Harvard as well as MIT, and
students often turn out in large numbers to see, or shout at,
prominent visitors. But these protests had a twist: most people
were Chinese, and they were divided almost equally into pro-China
and anti-China groups.
</P>
<P>
   Two organizers of demonstrations in Tiananmen Square a decade
ago, Wang Dan, now a Harvard student, and Chai Ling, now an
executive with an Internet company, led the group protesting
China's human rights record. ``No arming China with trade,'' read
one banner.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also many Chinese who carried China's
yellow-on-red national flag, sometimes together with an American
flag. ``I love Zhu the most,'' said Cheng Wenhao, 26, a student at
Yale University in New Haven, Conn., who drove to Cambridge for the
prime minister's visit. He carried a bouquet of Chinese flags and a
picture of Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   A brief scuffle broke out between pro- and anti-China camps
after they tried shouting each other down with bullhorns, but
police quickly separated the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu came to MIT in part because, even as prime minister, he
continues to serve as honorary dean of the business school at
Beijing's Qinghua University, often called China's MIT for its
dominance in engineering and the natural sciences. Qinghua, Zhu's
alma mater, has a sister-school relationship with MIT.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That may be why Zhu considered MIT the right venue for his trade
speech. When Jiang Zemin, China's No. 1 leader, visited the United
States 18 months ago, he made his keynote address down the street
at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu's real intended audience was the U.S. Congress. He was
seeking to counter some legislators' arguments that the trade
deficit with China results from that country's unfair trade
practices. Many of these people also oppose China's joining the
world trade regulatory body, Zhu's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu does not deny that China has become an exporting power. But
he said the goods his country produces are frequently those that
developed countries, and increasingly even newly developed
countries in Asia, can no longer produce cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, about 70 percent of China's total exports to the
United States consist of products that are processed rather than
manufactured from scratch. That means that Chinese companies import
component parts and assemble them before exporting the finished
product.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic shoes are his favorite example. Though they are made in
China, foreign rather than Chinese factories do most of the work,
he said. Of the $120 sale price, $20 reflects production costs, and
only $2 goes to Chinese workers, Zhu estimated. ``China's added
value is very low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister also said that if the United States really
wants to reduce its trade deficit, it should not apply restrictions
on exports of high-technology goods. He cited the Clinton
administration's recent decision to limit the export of satellites
and computers that China wants to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just want to export citrus and wheat to China, OK, the
door is open,'' Zhu said, referring to a new accord to free up
trade in those commodities. ``But the Chinese people want to live
better. For that, they need to buy your technology, too.''

By building your own PC, you can:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Save a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; B:  &LR; Skin your knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C:  &LR; Ruin a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; D:  &LR; Have something to boast about at the next office party.
</P>
<P>
   If you picked B, C and D, you win. But if you think you'd save
money by putting together a computer from scratch, think again.
You'd be lucky to match the price PC-makers are charging these days
in their zeal to undercut the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, you can build yourself a bare-bones multimedia
system for well under $1,000 and a high-powered one for under
$1,500. And the best part is you have control over what goes in it.
You can select the components that fit you.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that you're into gaming. By constructing
your own PC, you can include the latest 3-D graphics card and a
state-of-the-art sound card, rather than settling for the
less-robust multimedia technology that comes with most PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a logical mind, are fairly good with your hands and
possess the patience of Job, there's no reason you can't skip steps
B and C above and build a PC. And if you do it right, it probably
will only take a couple of hours. Believe it or not, computers go
together pretty easily, thanks to industry standard connections for
all major components.
</P>
<P>
   To become your own computer company, you'll need these
components (you can get them at a big computer store or by mail
from a catalog company such as Tiger Direct at
 &LR; www.tigerdirect.com &LR; ):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Case for the system &LR; : around $60. Cases come in desktop or
tower models, and they usually include a power supply with
connections for various components.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Motherboard &LR; : $75 to $150. This is the big green circuit board
to which everything else inside the case &LR;   &LR; attaches. Get one that
includes connection ports for the keyboard, mouse, printer and
other peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Processor, such as a Pentium II, a Celeron or an AMD K6 &LR; : $100
for a 333 MHz chip to $750 for a Pentium II 500.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Memory chips &LR; : $100 for 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Hard drive &LR; : $175 for 8 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _CD-ROM drive &LR; : $75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Floppy drive &LR; : $35.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _A long drive in the country &LR; . That comes later and helps you
forget all about the PC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Video card and sound card:  &LR; $50 to $200 (video card); $30 to
$100 (sound card). These aren't necessary if you get a motherboard
that comes with built-in sound and video.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Keyboard &LR; : $30 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Mouse &LR; : $15 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Modem:  &LR; $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Monitor &LR; : $225 for 17-inch model.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Speakers &LR; : $30 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Windows 98 &LR; : $170, includes some starter software.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy bare-bones kits that include the motherboard
with sound, video and a case at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, PC components are interchangeable. Any floppy
drive, modem or monitor will work in any system. Motherboards,
however, are designed for specific processors, so make sure to
choose a motherboard that works with the chip you get.
</P>
<P>
   Also, look for a motherboard with enough expansion slots to
accommodate cards you may install for sound, video and other
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   To turn all this stuff into a PC, you'll need a screwdriver and
perhaps a small wrench. Set up a work area that's free of static,
because static can fry your motherboard and other components.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, have at the ready instruction manuals that came
with the parts. They'll be useful.
</P>
<P>
   First, connect the processor to the motherboard. If you have a
Celeron or Pentium II, you'll need a special mounting bracket. And
don't forget to plug the chip's fan into the motherboard. Powerful
chips need to stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Then plug the memory chip or chips into the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the motherboard to the case. Then connect the power
supply to the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   (Safety note: Don't plug the case into the wall until you're all
done, OK? Wouldn't want to lose a reader to electrocution.)
</P>
<P>
   With the motherboard installed, you can mount the hard drive,
the floppy drive and the CD-ROM. They slide into the case from the
front and are secured with screws that come with the case or with
the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Each drive must be connected to the motherboard with a flat
cable (also called a ribbon cable) that comes with the drive. Also
hook up each drive to a plug extending from the power supply.
</P>
<P>
   The case has a power button, a speaker and lights to show when
various drives are in use. You'll have to attach the wires for
those things to the motherboard, which should have clearly marked
connectors along one side.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, install audio, video and other cards, such as an
internal modem. You can put them into any slot they fit. And don't
forget to connect the CD-ROM drive to the sound card, so you can
listen to music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the hard part's over. Check the motherboard manual
for instructions on starting the system. You also probably will
have to install setup software for the hard drive, the video and
sound cards and the modem.
</P>
<P>
   There, that wasn't too hard, was it? Was it? You still there?
Hello????

   ...................................
</P>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ East Asia's current distress over moral
and economic choices is reminiscent of the crisis that gripped
Europe and America about three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Germany and the United States took different paths out
of the Great Depression. Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated
president and promised a New Deal. In Germany, Hitler and the Nazis
became a legitimate force in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There is much for Asians to learn from that chapter of Western
history. The economic crisis that began in July 1997 has brought
about our own Great Depression. And economic troubles have
engendered a political crisis of confidence, pitting ancient
regimes against a generation eager for change as it looks forward
to a truly democratic Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have already chosen their paths. South Korea has
decided to go with President Kim Dae Jung's Rooseveltian reforms.
In Indonesia, an aged dictator has been forced out, and new leaders
will be chosen in the first free elections in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand too is reforming, and its democracy is strengthening.
And President Joseph Estrada confounds his critics as he keeps the
Philippines on track toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it is in Malaysia, once the most stable of Southeast
Asian nations, that a power-crazed prime minister is trying to
block the tide. Mahathir Mohamad, 73, sees himself as the only
person alive who can lead Malaysia out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to his reasoning, there was absolutely nothing wrong
with his policies; things were perfect before ``outside forces'' _
George Soros, Jews, the International Monetary Fund, Washington,
Wall Street _ jealous of Asian success and hungry for new colonies,
came and spoiled it all. And those who disagreed and called for
reform were denounced as traitors and lackeys of Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   I became dangerous because as finance minister I would not do
Mahathir's ``business as usual'' and as a politician I had
widespread support for my work toward democracy and civil society.
So I was accused of sex crimes, treason and corruption and expelled
from government and party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scorning me, as they were meant to, many Malaysians
were outraged and began to see in Mahathir a has-been leader who
had descended to cruelty in a desperate bid to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on Sept. 20, 1998, Mahathir ordered me arrested.
That night, blindfolded and handcuffed, I suffered Gestapo-style
violence at the hands of the inspector general of police, who aimed
his punches and karate chops at lethal areas. I was then abandoned
for nearly a week, part of it in a dungeon, without medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after I appeared in public with my wounds, which
Mahathir said could have been self-inflicted, the inspector general
confessed to his crime. That this criminal still walks free, while
I am jailed for ``abuse of office,'' shows just how far Mahathir
has taken Malaysia down the abyss of injustice.
</P>
<P>
   Our judiciary was once among the most independent in the
developing world, but the farce that was my trial and the
persecution of the opposition lawmaker Lim Guan Eng, among other
cases, have confirmed suspicions that it has since become a mere
adjunct of the executive arm of the government.
</P>
<P>
   I had to be demolished so that Mahathir's slide from power could
be stopped. Falsely accusing me of sex crimes alone might not have
worked, so he threw in ``puppet of Washington'' and ``CIA agent.''
The American defense secretary, William Cohen, unwittingly inspired
this spy fiction by greeting me with a 19-gun salute when I went to
Washington in the spring of 1998. The event is cited as proof that
I am an American mole.
</P>
<P>
   Given Malaysia's political culture, it was just a matter of time
before ambitious politicians jumped onto the bandwagon of
xenophobia. But so far nothing has matched the bizarre claims of
two Cabinet members that the United States or some other foreign
power waged biological warfare by introducing into Malaysia a
deadly virus that is wreaking havoc in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such insults to the public's intelligence are a major reason for
the increasing popularity of the ``reformasi'' movement, which
emerged spontaneously upon my sacking and recently gave birth to a
multiracial political organization that my wife heads.
</P>
<P>
   We believe that the new party, in cooperation with other
opposition groups, will help pull Malaysia out of the morass and
pave the way toward civil society.

   &UR; (NOTE: Anwar Ibrahim was finance minister and deputy prime
minister of Malaysia until September 1998, when he was arrested.
Yesterday he was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to six
years in prison. The U.S. government has criticized the conviction,
saying there were serious flaws in the judicial process. He wrote
this article from his jail cell.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ...................................
</P>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ East Asia's current distress over moral
and economic choices is reminiscent of the crisis that gripped
Europe and America about three-quarters of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Germany and the United States took different paths out
of the Great Depression. Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated
president and promised a New Deal. In Germany, Hitler and the Nazis
became a legitimate force in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   There is much for Asians to learn from that chapter of Western
history. The economic crisis that began in July 1997 has brought
about our own Great Depression. And economic troubles have
engendered a political crisis of confidence, pitting ancient
regimes against a generation eager for change as it looks forward
to a truly democratic Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have already chosen their paths. South Korea has
decided to go with President Kim Dae Jung's Rooseveltian reforms.
In Indonesia, an aged dictator has been forced out, and new leaders
will be chosen in the first free elections in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand too is reforming, and its democracy is strengthening.
And President Joseph Estrada confounds his critics as he keeps the
Philippines on track toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it is in Malaysia, once the most stable of Southeast
Asian nations, that a power-crazed prime minister is trying to
block the tide. Mahathir Mohamad, 73, sees himself as the only
person alive who can lead Malaysia out of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   According to his reasoning, there was absolutely nothing wrong
with his policies; things were perfect before ``outside forces'' _
George Soros, Jews, the International Monetary Fund, Washington,
Wall Street _ jealous of Asian success and hungry for new colonies,
came and spoiled it all. And those who disagreed and called for
reform were denounced as traitors and lackeys of Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   I became dangerous because as finance minister I would not do
Mahathir's ``business as usual'' and as a politician I had
widespread support for my work toward democracy and civil society.
So I was accused of sex crimes, treason and corruption and expelled
from government and party.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scorning me, as they were meant to, many Malaysians
were outraged and began to see in Mahathir a has-been leader who
had descended to cruelty in a desperate bid to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, on Sept. 20, 1998, Mahathir ordered me arrested.
That night, blindfolded and handcuffed, I suffered Gestapo-style
violence at the hands of the inspector general of police, who aimed
his punches and karate chops at lethal areas. I was then abandoned
for nearly a week, part of it in a dungeon, without medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after I appeared in public with my wounds, which
Mahathir said could have been self-inflicted, the inspector general
confessed to his crime. That this criminal still walks free, while
I am jailed for ``abuse of office,'' shows just how far Mahathir

 Column: Web's Threat Prompts Newspapers to Put Up
Money-Losing  Sites 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The irony seemed obvious. Top newspaper editors in town for a
conference this week heard the same message from a lineup of
speakers from Internet companies: Change or die. Embrace the
Internet and stop killing trees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the people calling for change lose money hand over fist. The
companies they say need radical restructuring are highly
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Excite chief executive George Bell, whose Web portal lost $37
million last year, was among the most fervent proselytizers on
stage at the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention at
the Fairmont Hotel. He said more people get their news from Yahoo
and Excite than from any newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of threat that's prompted newspapers all over
the country to put up their own money-losing Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Editor and Publisher magazine reported that Web losses are
mounting for publicly traded newspaper companies. Web-related
losses last year were $20 million at Times Mirror, $35 million at
the Tribune Co., $23 million for Knight Ridder and almost $15
million for the New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   I can just hear the Internet execs saying that's a step in the
right direction. Even Andy Grove, the chairman of Intel Corp. _ one
of the world's most profitable companies _ warned the editors that
they'll have to shell out some bucks to avert the impending crisis
when everyone gets their news from the Web and stops reading
newspapers. ``You cannot save yourself out of trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No, but there are some steps newspapers can take. I spoke last
month with Ed Manning, director of sales and marketing for Thomson
Interactive Media, the Web arm of a Connecticut company that owns
68 daily newspapers in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Manning's message: Newspaper Web operations don't need to lose
money. Thomson made $3 million last year from its Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We preach a sustainable evolution to the Internet,'' Manning
said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers shouldn't start by simply digitizing their print
product, he said. Instead, start with classified ads, a
money-maker. Charge existing customers more to put their
classifieds online, and even more to put hot links in their ads.
</P>
<P>
   Papers can also cut costs by hiring another company to host the
Web site, instead of buying expensive computers and adding staff,
Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Other items well-suited for the Web are special sections, like a
wedding guide, which Manning said ``appears in print in March or
April and then it goes away. What a perfect product to put
online.''
</P>
<P>
   And each day, they should promote the Web site in print. ``They
have one of the most tremendously coveted marketing tools of any
media company. Microsoft covets it,'' Manning said. ``Every day,
they've got the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NET MAG BATTLES:  &LR; At the dawn of the Internet economy, only
die-hard techies understood what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   That was just last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of great timing, two Bay Area magazines launched to
cover that ``Internet economy'' _ the way the Internet is pushing
its tentacles into every facet of business _ at just the time that
the Net became  &LR; the  &LR; story on every business person's mind.
</P>
<P>
   As the two new magazines, the Industry Standard and Business
2.0, mark their first anniversaries this month, their leaders say
their readership has expanded. Instead of the original target
market of nerds at high-tech companies _ the so-called chief
information officers, or CIOs, who buy a company's computer systems
_ the magazines are increasingly ending up in the hands of top
decision-makers at a range of consumer companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has really started to push the technology
question out of the CIO's office and into the CEO's office,'' said
Steve Thompson, publisher of the Industry Standard. The Standard's
circulation has grown to 100,000 per week, much of that unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Business 2.0's latest reader survey shows that 64 percent of
readers work for companies that existed before the Internet, and
that 85 percent of readers hold managerial or professional-level
jobs. The monthly has a paid circulation of 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Each magazine was founded by alumni of Wired magazine, with
former Wired managing editor John Battelle now the president of the
Standard, and former Wired features editor Jim Daly the editor in
chief of Business 2.0.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For all their common ground and lineage, the magazines differ
in many respects. The Standard occupies brick and timber offices on
San Francisco's Battery Street, near bustling Broadway and the
Financial District. Business 2.0 is tucked in a secluded office
building in Brisbane, not far from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   They're both owned by computer magazine publishers, but the
Standard is the product of massive International Data Group, the
Massachusetts publisher of the wildly popular series of ``Dummies''
books, while Business 2.0 is published by comparatively small
Imagine Media, best known for computer gaming magazines.
</P>
<P>
   As a monthly, Business 2.0 has more long ``business strategy''
stories. ``We're not scoop-oriented,'' Daly said. ``I'm not sure
the world needs any more scoops.
</P>
<P>
   Although Business 2.0's Web site leaves a lot to be desired,
especially for a magazine devoted to the Net, Daly said an upgrade
is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Industry Standard each week publishes a breezy
digest of recent news and opinions, with one or two longer
features. Its 30 news staffers work on a Web site that's updated
daily, and the magazine also produces e-mail newsletters and runs
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no category for us,'' said Battelle. ``These are new
models, and it's fun. (The Standard) takes the best aspects of
trade publishing and the best aspects of business publishing. For
lack of a better term, it's diagonal, or horizertical.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, I'm sorry to report that he really did say
``horizertical,'' although he did seem to regret it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZD ZANINESS:  &LR; It's always a little funny when the offspring
grows bigger than the parent. But things are almost ridiculous in
the case of San Francisco's ZDNet, which rolled out its own stock
offering while remaining part of computer magazine publisher
Ziff-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet's tracking stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the
symbol ZDZ, has rocketed to a market valuation of more than $2.9
billion. That's more than the $1.9 billion the market says parent
Ziff-Davis, which trades under the symbol ZD, is worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's not just weird, it's absurd. First, a tracking stock
isn't the same as investing in just ZDNet. It's a stock that
measures ZDNet's prospects, but actually exposes investors to all
liabilities of Ziff-Davis, which continues to own 85 percent of
ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   But the really strange part is how ZDNet could possibly be worth
more than Ziff-Davis itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ziff-Davis, which is based in New York, has been around since
1927, employs more than 3,200 people, and publishes more than 30
magazines with a worldwide circulation of 8 million. Its products
include PC Magazine, InterActive Week, Yahoo Internet Life, Family
PC and Macworld.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ziff-Davis lost $78 million on revenue of $1.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet is a puny offshoot, by comparison. It employs 300 people
(half in San Francisco, the rest mostly in Cambridge, Mass.). It
lost $7.9 million on revenue of $56 million in 1998. Although it
produces original content, it also gets about one-fifth of its
content from Ziff-Davis magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It just goes to show: Wall Street thinks that content is worth
more when it's translated from the glossy page and put into digital
bits.

 E-commerce Is the Word At Trade Show   By Jon Swartz 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Los Angeles _ &UR;  &LR; Hundreds of Internet companies are giving e-commerce
a hard sell at Spring Internet World here.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech trade show, which runs throughout the week at the
cavernous Convention Center, is expected to draw 40,000 people, who
are a mixture of consumers, tech company executives and
brick-and-mortar retailers.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying number of the 600 companies exhibiting on the
convention floor or in nearby hotel suites were promoting
e-commerce, either selling products directly to consumers over the
Internet or supplying the software for others to build their own
retail Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle of Redwood Shores led an infantry of companies with
e-commerce announcements. It plans new software for
business-to-business transactions on the Internet, one of the
fastest-growing e-commerce segments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Gold Rush of the 19th century, you'll find
that those people who made money are the ones who provided the
picks and shovels,'' said Jeremy Burton, vice president of server
marketing at Oracle. ``We want to provide the picks and shovels to
the e-commerce gold rush.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, many thought banner ads, the static promos that
are fixtures at the top of a commercial Web site, would be the big
bread winner. But Web users are increasingly tuning them out and
instead buying more goods over the Net. E-commerce is projected to
be a $37.2 billion market this year, according Keenan Vision, a
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are shopping more on the Web as it becomes more
popular and they have fewer concerns about supplying their
credit-card information online,'' said Paul Gauthier, co-founder
and chief technology officer of Inktomi Corp. His San Mateo company
recently launched a shopping area on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier said the online industry has reached a ``transition
point'' in how it expects to generate revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is e-commerce, e-commerce and e-commerce,'' said Katrien De
Graeve, a teacher from Brussels. ``Every TV commercial here has
`WWW' at the bottom of the screen. In Belgium, maybe two out of 10
ads do that. But we, too, are getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Launchpad, an exhibit-within-an-exhibit for three
dozen eBay-wannabes, several companies are eschewing
business-to-business e-commerce with some unconventional business
plans.
</P>
<P>
   _SpeedVu.com is producing some of the first TV-style ads for the
Web. The company has already produced spots for Lexus and
Investor's Business Daily that run about 10 seconds. In one Lexus
spot, a car zooms across the bottom of an auto Web site
 &LR; (www.freeway.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason banner ads are ignored is because they are
constantly on your screen,'' said Curt Hutten, president of the
Newport Beach company. ``No one would tolerate a banner ad during
`Seinfeld.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are spending $20 million to develop TV-like content
on a free Web site, yet customers refuse to look at it because of
banner ads,'' he said. ``So why not create TV-inspired ads? That's
what the public is accustomed to.''
</P>
<P>
   _The Humor Network &LR;  (www.joke-of-the-day.com) &LR;  _ which, all
kidding aside, calls itself ``the world's largest portal for
jokes'' _ said it has acquired the definitive San Francisco jokes
site. That Web page will debut in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Targan, ``jokemaster'' and founder of the New York firm,
added that the site has kicked off a political section that pokes
fun at the 2000 presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   _SportsID.com &LR;  (www.sportsid.com)  &LR; yesterday unveiled an
instructional Web site for sports enthusiasts. Some 500 video
segments _ ranging from two minutes to 20 minutes _ provide how-to
advice from professional athletes, such as former 49er Ronnie Lott,
and coach on everything from throwing a fastball to traversing a
kayak through rapids.
</P>
<P>
   _Jotter Technologies Inc.  &LR; (www.jotter.com)  &LR; is offering free
software that acts as a Web assistant. The program automatically
fills out electronic template forms for users, reminds them of
important dates with a built-in calendar and aids them in making
travel arrangements. The assistant even allows consumers to choose
what banner ads appear on their computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   _V-Star, a Southern California startup, said disclosed  &LR; it is in
the final stages of testing software that would allow consumers to
simultaneously download and view animations without clogging up
their Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, an Internet show also can be a haven for the
downright wacky.
</P>
<P>
   _Talkingweb, a German company, stirred plenty of buzz with a
voice-activated Web browser it is testing. The software program
would allow computer users to access and navigate the Internet via
a telephone _ and without a PC. Company executives were scouring
the 350,000-square-foot floor looking for telephone companies to
adopt the product.
</P>
<P>
   _eFax.com said it will make available in May technology that
enables consumers to send faxes over the Internet for $3 to $5 a
month. In February, the Menlo Park company began offering a free
service for receiving faxes via the Net.

INTERNET TRADE SHOW FOCUES ON PRACTICAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Internet: It's not just for tech-heads
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the Web's growing influence, Wednesday's launch of
Internet World 99 saw mostly pitches for practical applications by
the 500-plus exhibitors. Two previous Los Angeles shows had leaned
more toward infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fascinating how far it's come,'' said Jack Powers,
conference chairman for Penton Media, which produces the traveling
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of introducing people to basic technology, exhibitors
now are into best practices, managing the Internet, marketing and
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Recurring themes were free services and migration to the
Internet of tasks previously conducted in a real-world setting.
Melding both were eFax.com (www.efax.com) and rival CallWave
(www.callwave.com), which offer free fax numbers to deliver
documents to an online mailbox for later viewing. CallWave now
offers business users bundles of up to 10 fax numbers for free;
eFax is throwing in a new viewer that lets users preview different
kinds of files attached to their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   FreeDrive.com (www.freedrive.com) offers users a ``virtual hard
drive'' with up to 20 megabytes disk space for backing up important
files at a remote locale.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com (www.stamps.com) and e-stamp (www.e-stamp.com) have
managed to move to the Internet a task that requires a trip to the
post office or supermarket. Both services let users buy postage off
the Internet for printing prestamped envelopes. Currently in beta
testing, the services are expected to be available this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs (www.soundblaster.com) launched what promises to
be one of this year's must-have technotoys _ NOMAD, a $249 device
about the size of a deck of cards that can store two hours of music
or four hours of voice recordings on a removable flash memory card.
NOMAD has no moving parts, so a jogger can listen to near-CD
quality music without missing a beat.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSupport.com (www.peoplesupport.com) showed off its online
customer support to help make sense of it all. By clicking a green
button on a PeopleSoft-enabled Web site, a user is engaged in an
chatroomlike dialogue with a technician who can answer questions
about that particular site. &QL;

 &HT;    Speier called up; Winkelsas sent to Greenville
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Braves called up reliever Justin Speier from
AAA Richmond on Wednesday after a deadline passed that prevented
them from bringing up a 40-man roster player who was assigned to a
minor-league roster out of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Speier fills Mark Wohlers' roster spot, as Joe Winkelsas, a
nonroster invitee to the major-league camp in spring training, is
on his way back to AA Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Speier, the 25-year-old son of former major-league infielder
Chris Speier, was acquired by the Braves from Florida the last week
of spring training in a trade for a player to be named later. He
pitched in the Cubs organization last season until July 31, when he
was traded to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   In one appearance for the Cubs and 18 for the Marlins last
season, Speier was a combined 0-3 with an 8.71 ERA. He had 17
strikeouts but allowed seven home runs in 20 2/3 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   He throws a low-to-mid 90s fastball, slider and split-finger
fastball. He brings the number of Braves relievers who can hit the
mid 90s to four, along with John Rocker, Rudy Seanez and Kevin
McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his problem has been controlling his other two pitches.
But Speier spent three months in Puerto Rico playing winter ball,
working on locating his slider and splitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in a groove down there and it carried over this
spring,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Speier made appearances in both exhibition games in Atlanta,
giving manager Bobby Cox a chance to see what he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his two appearances, it looked to me like he could pitch up
here,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   In two outings for AAA Richmond this season, Speier had one save
and a 4.50 ERA. He had just taken a flight into Richmond from
Charlotte on Wednesday morning when he was told to get back on a
plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about being with a championship team,''
Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelsas made only one appearance in his five days. He gave up
four hits and two runs and recorded only one out.
</P>
<P>
   Airtime
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine spent seven hours Wednesday morning
and afternoon shooting a Nike shoe commercial, that came with a
perk. Their co-star was Heather Locklear.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said the gist of the commercial was that if Mark McGwire
is popular with women because of his home runs, he and Maddux work
on their hitting in hopes of gaining the same popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a home run in batting practice and as soon as I hit it,
she's like `Hi Tom,' '' Glavine said of the ``Melrose Place'' star.
</P>
<P>
   They still have several hours more of shooting to do _ this time
without Locklear _ but may complete it by this weekend in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tedious process, but it's neat when it's all done,''
Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy, who was hit in the right hand by a grounder on
Monday, was fine by Wednesday. ... Entering Wednesday's game, the
Braves were 3-1 when they don't hit a home run, 2-2 when they do.
Braves pitchers had allowed 10 home runs this season, nine of them
solo, seven of them allowed by starting pitchers.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech reserves fight for the right to back up Hamilton
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ George Godsey awoke early Tuesday to attend physics
class. It might have been the lightest studying the Georgia Tech
industrial engineering major would do all day.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with interactions of matter and mastering the atomic
scale could be considered simple duty compared with learning the
intricate football offenses of Yellow Jackets coordinator Ralph
Friedgen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot on the quarterback,'' said Godsey, a redshirt
sophomore. ``It takes a lot of studying and knowing what to do when
you get out there. The offense depends on the quarterback making
the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 202-pound Godsey and redshirt freshman Jermaine
Crenshaw, 6-1, 203, are vying this spring to back up All-America
candidate Joe Hamilton on a team that has aspirations for a
national championship in 1999. The winner probably will position
himself as Hamilton's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, he will have to satisfy Friedgen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just grasping all the different formations of our offense is
only a start,'' Friedgen said. ``Having to read defenses is the
toughest part. They are so involved in knowing where all the
offensive players are, it can be a challenge to focus on the
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   To say Tech's offense guided by Friedgen was imaginative last
season while going 10-2 and averaging an ACC-best 35.5 points per
game would be an understatement. Hamilton, a senior, led a diverse
offense that mixed option runs with pro-set passing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets, who rushed for 2,021 yards and passed for 2,250,
sport more looks than Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit of everything,'' Friedgen said. ``We can be
one-back or two-backs. We can go no tight ends, one tight end or
two tight ends. Sometimes I wish we had more tight ends.''
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 100 basic plays in the offense, each of which
can be run five different ways. Crenshaw, from Greenville, Ala.,
demonstrated before he arrived at Tech that he was capable of
making the right call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed to Alabama,'' Crenshaw recalled. ``Coach (Mike)
DuBose was going to try me at quarterback, but he was going to
bring in three more. I didn't want to be in that type of situation.
Here, they liked me at quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   And still do.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's first major scrimmage, the duo shared first-team
play with Hamilton, while also splitting time with the second unit.
Crenshaw's numbers _ 4 of 7 passes, 33 yards, plus 35 rushing yards
_ topped those of Godsey _ 2-of-8, 22 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crenshaw did some nice things out there,'' head coach George
O'Leary said, ``and at times Godsey had some plays. It all depended
on what team they were with.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Godsey, from Tampa, appeared in six games,
including a 5-of-10, 63-yard passing effort against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to improve every day from where I left off at the
end of last year,'' he said. ``I want to be 10 times better a
player when I get out there (and) have a lot of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players credit Friedgen's acumen as a teacher for lifting
them to this point. Now, the rest is up to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Friedgen doesn't settle for anything but your very
best,'' Crenshaw said. ``You can complete a pass, but you still
have to explain to him why you went to that receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to step in without us missing a beat. I want
to run the offense with confidence. And after Joe graduates, I
don't want us to have to build up another quarterback.''

 &HT;    South Carolina a `good fit' for Holtz
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Lou Holtz laughs long and hard when he's asked,
``What's a nice coach like you doing in a place like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, one of the top coaches in college football, has had
various levels of success in a 27-year coaching career that
includes stops at William &AMP; Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas,
Minnesota and Notre Dame. Now, at age 61, he's probably facing the
ultimate rebuilding program at South Carolina _ a program that has
only had one season with more than eight victories in 107 years and
is coming off the worst season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Long known for his one-liners, as well as his coaching ability,
Holtz, fourth among Division I active coaches with 216 victories,
has returned to the sideline after leaving Notre Dame following the
1996 season and spending two years as a television analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Have the other SEC coaches called to welcome him to the league?
``Some of them have and some haven't,'' Holtz said. ``Most of the
ones that called were the good ones. They were probably thinking,
`We got us a real fish here.'''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina certainly is paying attention to Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I think it's been a pretty good fit here for me,'' he
said. ``It's been a better fit for me than for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz made a dramatic entrance into the state in December when,
during his initial press conference, he made an off-hand comment
that he was amazed at the amount of litter on the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   His trash-talking brought about an unbelievable response that
has resulted in an unprecedented statewide litter-prevention
crusade. Last weekend, Holtz had his football team out on the
highway picking up litter during his ``Don't be a Dirty Bird'' day.
He also has taped public-service announcements encouraging
residents not to litter.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz says his task in Columbia may be more daunting than those
he's faced in the past. ``It's a little more difficult than my
other situations,'' he said. ``Maybe it's the most difficult,
because of the schedule and because of the expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach also has his detractors, many of whom think he's in
Columbia only as a public-relations ploy by the university to spiff
up its low athletic profile. They say Holtz is marking time until
he can hand over the coaching reigns to son Skip, who serves as his
offensive coordinator and associate head coach.
</P>
<P>
   But those critics have yet to see Holtz in action on the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's enjoying himself, enjoying the job,'' says Kerry Tharp,
an associate athletics director at the school. ``You go out and
watch practice and he's everywhere. He's grabbing them by their
helmets, jumping in their faces. He's engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   The often apathetic student body also is paying attention. When
Holtz scheduled a campus-wide address on the state of the football
program, more than 4,000 turned out to see their savior and hear
what he had to say.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what's happening on the periphery, Holtz has sold
himself to those who matter most _ his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to play for him,'' said Darion Hutcherson, a
linebacker who played at Atlanta's Douglass High. ``He's
enthusiastic. He lives for the game of football. The first day we
met him, we knew he had fire. After we met him, we were ready to
play right then. He can do his part, but it's the players who've
got to have the desire. He's going to be sure that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Kerry Hood, an alum of Atlanta's Harper-Archer
High, says he's sold 100 percent. ``He's the most intense,
in-your-face coach I've ever had,'' Hood said. ``He won't allow you
to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   After the spring game Saturday, Holtz says, the really critical
time begins for his squad. ``What kind of year we have will depend
on what we do over the summer in individual workouts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the workers seem willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a little kid growing up, I watched Notre Dame play
and dreamed of playing for a guy like that some day,'' Hood said.
``It's like a dream come true that he's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz has done his best to keep things in perspective, as much
for the fans as for himself. ``Based on what we have here now,''
Holtz said, ``we can't be competitive this year. But then again, I
don't believe in four-to-five-year rebuilding efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   So where do the Gamecocks stand today and for the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't going to be an overnight turnaround,'' Holtz said.
``I'm not a miracle worker.''

DOLE TO VISIT BALKANS, BACKS U.S. GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Likely Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth
Hanford Dole on Wednesday joined a growing crowd of politicians who
say President Clinton should consider sending ground troops into
Kosovo if his military advisers urge such action.
</P>
<P>
   The former Red Cross director elaborated her position on Kosovo
as part of an address on international affairs at the U.S. Naval
Academy in Annapolis, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Dole initially supported the airstrikes ordered by Clinton,
citing the region's strategic importance and humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's remarks bring her in line with the more hawkish
voices in the Republican Party, which have been led by rival
presidential contender Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long experience teaches that when we've committed military
forces to a rightful goal, we should use all the power necessary to
achieve it,'' Dole said, according to a copy of her prepared
remarks. ``To accept the status quo is to risk defeat, defeat for
NATO and defeat for humanitarian _ and very American _ objective of
preventing genocide where we can. Does that mean ground troops? If
the NATO commanders and the Joint Chiefs of Staff say that ground
troops are required to accomplish our goals, then my answer is
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's speech to the midshipmen came as she prepared to travel
to Macedonia and Albania Thursday to visit the refugee camps filled
with ethnic Albanians pushed out of Kosovo by the Serbs. She will
return to Washington on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A Dole aide said she had been invited to the camps by the first
lady of Albania and a refugee organization, Mercy Corps
International of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's trip and her speech at the Naval Academy appear designed
to contrast her foreign policy experience to some of her
competitors, particularly Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dole talked about her travels as head of the Red Cross to
troubled regions of the world, including Bosnia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has had virtually no foreign policy experience, has
been criticized for stands considered vague and evolving on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Bush also appeared to be moving in the direction of a
tougher military action. He said that ``once the military is
engaged, it must be engaged with one thing in mind, and that is
victory.``
</P>
<P>
   Dole criticized the Clinton administration for the decline in
defense spending, which she said has caused lowered readiness,
reduced morale and and aging equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested that the current international problems may
have been caused by the president's lack of credibility stemming
from his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility counts,'' she said. ``And if you have any
questions about that, look at the U.N. weapons inspections mess in
Iraq or today's tragedy in Kosovo. When tough deadlines are set and
then repeatedly postponed; when the other side appears to break its
agreements with impunity; when we accept half-promises; we send the
wrong signals about our values and our will.''

 &HT;    Browns settle on Couch at No. 1
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The only thing that will keep Kentucky quarterback Tim
Couch from being the first pick in Saturday's NFL draft is if
Cleveland Browns officials decide in the next 48 hours that his
contract demands are excessive.
</P>
<P>
   After months of deliberation, the Browns on Wednesday settled on
Couch over Oregon quarterback Akili Smith as the top choice for the
resurrected franchise. Cleveland is expected to accelerate the pace
of talks with agent Tom Condon, with the goal to complete a
contract agreement before the draft begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal could be for seven years and be worth as much as $44
million, with the signing bonus about $12.5 million. Condon
represented former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning, last
year's No. 1 overall pick, and negotiated his landmark contract
with the Indianapolis Colts. Should the negotiations falter,
Cleveland officials will turn to Smith, whom they regard as nearly
the equal of Couch. In some physical areas, including arm strength,
Smith is the better prospect. Rookie coach Chris Palmer said early
this week that the pair was ``neck and neck.'' The team has ruled
out drafting Heisman Trophy tailback Ricky Williams of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Couch performed well Sunday, throwing 115 passes in a 90-minute
workout administered by Palmer in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 1971 draft, quarterbacks are
expected to be the first three choices, with Donovan McNabb of
Syracuse joining Couch and Smith as top prospects.

 &HT;    DuPont High's two ball belles
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLE, W.Va. _ Across the Kanawha River, the road signs along
Cabin Creek hollow proudly proclaim: ``Home of Jerry West, NBA
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side of the Chelyan Bridge, where the DuPont
chemical plant lights the valley sky even at midnight, there is
nothing to let you know that Belle _ population 1,421 _ and the
neighboring unincorporated community of Rand can claim two big-time
hometown heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while for the Jerry West signs to go up,'' said Jim
Fout, athletics director and basketball coach at DuPont High
School, which is consolidating with West's East Bank High to form a
new school next fall. ``Randy and Jason are only rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   True. But not since Bill Russell and Frank Robinson more than 40
years ago have two first-year players from the same high school
made as big a major-league splash as Randy Moss and Jason Williams,
DuPont High class of 1995 and 1994, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That Moss and Williams come from the same small school in
Appalachia and have traveled winding paths more treacherous than a
narrow mountain road make their stories even more intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real proud of what both those boys are doing,'' Belle
Mayor Larry Conley said. ``I hope things keep going well and
neither of them have any more trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   West, who grew up in a simpler time, has always been revered in
West Virginia. East Bank, a coal town of 892, changed its name to
West Bank in his honor for a day, twice _ after he led his high
school to the state title in 1956 and again when he completed his
All-America career at West Virginia University.
</P>
<P>
   Young fans snap up Minnesota Vikings jerseys with Moss' No. 84
as soon as they arrive at stores in the West Virginia capital of
Charleston, about 10 miles up the Kanawha River. Williams'
Sacramento Kings jerseys are expected to go just as fast when they
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   But Moss and Williams are still eyed with suspicion by many
older West Virginians, who have hungered for someone or something
to bring lasting honor to their often-maligned state since West
retired from the NBA in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, whose much-chronicled troubles began when he was arrested
after a hallway brawl late in his senior year of high school,
burned bridges by making some negative remarks about West Virginia
to a Minnesota reporter just before his record NFL rookie season
with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has brought a little of Pete Maravich back to the
NBA and dominates ESPN highlights, also has been too blunt for his
own good at times, especially when admiting to the marijuana use
that caused him to be kicked off the University of Florida
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Randy nor Jason is the kind of person some people
think they are,'' said Fout, their old DuPont basketball coach.
``But at times, both have been their own worst enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't learn from Randy's mistakes. I had to make my own,''
said Williams, who like Moss saw his draft position in the first
round drop because of character questions.
</P>
<P>
   But for a while, it looked as if Moss and Williams were headed
to making the area's infamous All 7-Eleven team, rather than
reaching major-league stardom. The parking lot in front of the
one-stop gas, food and liquor store near the school is where failed
athletes and others with little to look forward to have hung out
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the things that happened, we were both in that let-down
category,'' said Moss, who spent several months in jail for a
probation violation before getting a chance to shine at Marshall
University. ``But now it is nothing but smiles to know that both of
us are doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, 22, and Williams, 23, were reunited in late February when
Sacramento played in Minneapolis against the Minnesota
Timberwolves. The two spent time together the night before, and
then Moss took in the game, wearing one of Williams' No. 55 Kings
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything Jason does in the NBA, I've already seen in high
school,'' said Moss, a year behind Williams in school. ``He was
doing all that stuff way back then. It's not new to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Moss, who attended different elementary schools,
didn't meet for the first time on a basketball court or football
field, but rather on the Little League baseball diamond behind
DuPont High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always scared when I had a bat and Randy was pitching,''
Williams said in his mountain twang. ``He was real wild.''
</P>
<P>
   At DuPont Junior High, Williams was the football quarterback in
ninth grade and eighth-grader Moss his favorite target. As you can
imagine, it was an unstoppable combination.
</P>
<P>
   But when Williams entered high school, he gave up football and
baseball to concentrate on his only real love _ basketball. Moss
was a standout in football, basketball, baseball and track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is everything to Jason,'' said his father, Terry, a
retired West Virginia State Trooper who recently moved to
Sacramento to be near his son. ``Without it, I really worry about
him. He never had much interest in anything else. He always hated
school.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jason was growing up, his father helped provide security at
the high school, and they lived in a double-wide mobile home next
to the parking lot. That meant Jason always had a place to play
basketball _ any time, day or night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter when, you always would see Jason in the gym,'' Moss
said. ``He about lived in there, coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually by himself, Williams would concentrate on his passing
and dribbling, rather than on his shot. Wearing weights on his
ankles and occasionally gloves, he would circle the tiny gym,
boucing the ball off the wall with either hand. He spent even more
time there after his parents divorced.
</P>
<P>
   All of Williams' extra work, however, never produced a state
title for DuPont. With Moss leading the way, the Panthers won state
football titles in 1992 and '93, but DuPont shot an air ball in
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two best players in the state, and we choked,'' Moss said,
referring to the 79-73 loss to Martinsburg in the 1994 state title
game when he was a junior and Williams a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Fout disagrees. ``They had 27 and 26 points. It wasn't their
fault we lost. But I'll take that game with me to my grave.''
</P>
<P>
   No high school ever has produced two rookie-of-the-year winners
in a 12-month period. McClymonds High School in Oakland, Calif.,
came the closest. Baseball Hall of Famer Frank Robinson won the
honor in the National League in 1956, and basketball great Bill
Russell placed second in the NBA voting after the 1956-57 season.
</P>
<P>
   Moss won NFL honors last fall and Williams is one of the top
five candidates in the NBA this season. ``I'm yelling it, `Rookie
of the year,''' Moss said about Williams in a television interview
on TNT early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Toronto's Vince Carter wins the award, there is no
denying the impact of the two players from little DuPont, which
once had 1,300 students but now is down to fewer than 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all like a fantasy,'' said Fout, who was a standout
player at DuPont in the mid-1960s and a teammate of Jason's father.
``I can't believe two players from a school this size are doing
what they're doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, DuPont and East Bank, which now has fewer than 500
students, will become middle schools and a new four-year Riverside
High School will open in the Quincy area, east of Belle.
</P>
<P>
   But the framed color photos of Moss and Williams will remain in
the DuPont gym, on the wall where Jason used to bounce the ball at
all hours of the night. The old black-and-white photo of West _
wearing No. 12 instead of his famous 44 _ will remain at East Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the new school to start fresh,'' said Fout, who will
be basketball coach and athletics director at Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Moss and Williams, the new school will have a deal
with Nike. The free shoes will be appreciated, but memories of
DuPont and East Bank will die hard. Together, they won nine state
titles in football, although only one in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that those schools are closing,'' said West,
now vice president of the Los Angeles Lakers. ``Progress or not,
it's sad. Real sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Reynolds, personnel director of the Sacramento Kings,
said, ``They ought to bottle that water back there and make a whole
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be more valuable than coal.

 Apple Beats Estimates _ Profits Soar
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Yum'' says an ad for Apple Computer's iMac computers, which come
in strawberry, blueberry and three other colors. Apple's stock may
look pretty tasty too this morning in the wake of the company's
sixth straight profitable quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the results reported yesterday marked the best
performance yet for Steve Jobs, the prodigal son who became interim
chief executive in July 1997 and guided the Cupertino company back
after it had foundered under two previous leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by continued success of the iMac as well as strong sales
of the powerful and equally Jetson-like G3 models, Apple's income
from operations in the second quarter soared a better-than-expected
69 percent to $93 million (60 cents a share) from $55 million (38
cents) in the same quarter last year. Analysts had expected around
57 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the news came after the market closed, Apple's stock
jumped $1.13 to $35.75 as word of the stellar quarter got around
the Street.
</P>
<P>
   The rise also may have reflected investor reaction to Apple's
appointment yesterday of former Volkswagen marketing executive
Steve Wilhite as vice president of worldwide marketing. The
47-year-old Wilhite, who worked on the marketing campaign for the
new VW Beetle, has already joined Apple and is reporting directly
to Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months ended March 27, Apple's revenues rose 9
percent to $1.53 billion. The company said it shipped 827,000
computers, including 350,000 iMacs, the cute-as-a-button computers
that have been a hit with first-time buyers looking for a machine
with which to surf the Web. More than 1.1 million iMacs have been
shipped since their introduction last August.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Apple's second-quarter shipments were 27 percent higher
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted with the quarter's results,'' Jobs said in a
telephone interview. ``Apple has a plan and is executing it. The
plan has a lot of components, but the heart of it is coming up with
a great product strategy and making the best PCs in the world _ in
particular for getting on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he intends to scratch the ``interim'' off of his title
and become permanent CEO, Jobs, who also runs the Pixar animation
company, said, ``I really haven't had much time to think about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Apple Chief
Financial Officer Fred Anderson listed several factors that helped
the company beat Wall Street projections for the fifth straight
quarter:
</P>
<P>
   _Apple's share of the U.S. desktop market climbed as high as
12.5 percent during the quarter, according to ZD Storeboard. That
was more than double the company's market share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   _In an industry where profits have been squeezed by dramatic
price declines, Apple's gross margins increased year-over-year from
24.8 percent to 26.3 percent. A big reason was the increased sales
of G3 machines, which are Apple's most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   _Apple ended the quarter with just one day of inventory, pacing
the industry and besting Dell Computer for the third quarter in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   _In an indication that Asia's economy may be recovering, Apple
said its hottest geographical market was Japan, where shipments
rose 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the company is confident its shipments and
revenues will surpass the industry as a whole for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple is clearly back on track,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin,
president of Creative Strategies in Campbell. ``I don't see any
reason they won't be able to keep this momentum going, at least
through the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple took an $8 million charge in the just-completed quarter to
cover outsourcing of some computer assembly. It also recorded a $50
million gain from the sale of part of its stake in chipmaker ARM.

 Symantec Picks Boss _ IBM Exec
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Ending a four-month search, Symantec Corp. yesterday named
high-ranking IBM executive John W. Thompson as the antivirus
software-maker's new chief executive, president and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 49, replaces Silicon Valley pioneer Gordon Eubanks,
who today officially takes over as CEO of Oblix Inc., a Mountain
View company in the emerging field of business directory software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled and I'm energized I was selected and I'm ready to
get going,'' Thompson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thompsonn, a graduate of Florida A&AMP;M, worked at IBM for 28
years, most recently as general manager of IBM's Americas unit,
which had $37 billion in 1998 sales and 30,000 employees. Symantec
said the division, which handles Internet and electronic commerce
business accounts, accounted for 10 percent of all information
technology spending in North, Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been mentioned as a possible successor to current
IBM Chairman &UR;  &LR; Louis Gerstner, who last year signed a contract
extension that will keep him in that post for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the chance to run my own company,'' Thompson said.
``There can only be one CEO of a large company.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision to leave IBM came from ``the opportunities at
Symantec, not something I was running away from at IBM,'' he said.
``The size of the business is less important than your sense of
importance to customers. What Symantec does is of great importance
to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson previously headed IBM's personal software products
group and was in charge of developing IBM's OS/2 computer operating
system. Even though the operating system was eventually squeezed by
the dominant Windows NT platform, analysts said Thompson brings
Symantec a history of success and contacts in corporate software
sales, which is a key battleground for Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   Cupertino's Symantec, which posted $574 million in revenues last
year, has 2,300 employees and faces stiff competition from No.1
antivirus and computer-utilities-maker Network Associates Inc. of
Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson ``brings a lot of credibility to the company,'' said
analyst Robbie Owens of Pacific Crest Securities. ``He can
accelerate Symantec's move into the corporate side of the business.
He's got the relationships and that's key in this space.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also becomes one of the most prominent African American
CEOs in Silicon Valley at a time when civil rights leaders are
pushing high-tech companies to expand boardrooms, employment and
marketing to include more minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, for example, visited executives at SGI
and Apple Computer on Monday as the next step in his Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition's Wall Street Project. The project, which has purchased
stock in Symantec and 50 other Silicon Valley companies, aims to
bridge a so-called Digital Divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's qualified, experienced and accomplished,'' said Butch
Wing, California coordinator for the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. ``We
applaud his appointment and hope this opens the doors for other
people of color to become CEOs and decision makers in the high-tech
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks said he supports the Wall Street Project's goals and is
a fan of Jackson, but said the fact that Thompson was African
American played no part in the company's decision to hire him as
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think in those terms, we think in terms of getting
the job done,'' Eubanks said. ``Symantec attracted a top-notch
executive, one of the handful of the best executives of IBM.''
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference, Thompson said that at IBM, he ``never
thought of myself in the context of the most highly placed African
American. I was really focused on being the most effective leader I
can be. If my acting as a role model or a guide post (shows) that
it can be achieved, I'm delighted with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Symantec's current chairman, Carl Carman, will remain on the
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec closed at $14.13, up $1.13.

Claiborne, Katzenmoyer, Kearse destined to excel as NFL linebackers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Call this the tale of three linebackers who could become perennial
Pro Bowl selections, all underclassmen with almost unbelievable
God-given ability. They have taken different routes to the NFL, but
all will be No. 1 draft choices Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's Chris Claiborne is the best middle
linebacker prospect in years. He is what Ohio State's Andy
Katzenmoyer was supposed to be after his extraordinary freshman
year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Jevon Kearse is the most physically gifted of the
group, but he enters the draft without a true position. He is best
suited for the weak side in a 3-4. Ideally, he would only have to
play end in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne will be among the first six picks. Kearse will be gone
by the 10th pick. Katzenmoyer will be a first-round selection, but
no one is sure which team will draft him.
</P>
<P>
   If Claiborne, Kearse and Katzenmoyer could take their best
college season and apply it to the NFL, they will become stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'll be drafted, but I think I'm one of the
top defensive players in the draft,'' Claiborne said. ``I'm no
longer worried about when I go. Wherever I go, though, I'm going to
make an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne is so talented he can play inside or outside. Seldom
will you find a middle linebacker who drops into coverage so well.
He led the Trojans with six interceptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring everything to the table,'' Claiborne said. ``I'll even
play special teams. I'm fast. I'm a big hitter. I'm very consistent
in what I do. I play the pass and run very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Claiborne has outstanding size and speed. There is nothing he
can't do on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis has the fourth pick. The Colts could select
Claiborne. He is familiar with the Colts because he has done his
homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just a couple of points away from winning more
games,'' he said. ``All they need now is some defensive players to
come in and make plays. I've looked at every team I've felt could
draft me to see how I'll fit into their system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll definitely do my job. When you play football, it's not
about turning the whole defense around. It's about doing your job
and being consistent in what you do. I'm going to work hard every
day and learn the system, help them make calls. If the coach feels
confident in me, I'll bring that confidence on the field, make
plays and make the fans happy.''
</P>
<P>
   During his redshirt freshman year in 1996, no linebacker in the
country made more plays than Katzenmoyer. He was excellent as a
sophomore, too, and there was talk that he would try to enter the
NFL draft and take the league to court if he had to. Instead, he
stayed in school, was used differently, and his performance
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot more pressure on me, but I didn't think the
season was difficult,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``There's a huge amount
of pressure when you play middle linebacker at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I contributed everything I could. I did what the
coaches asked me to do. We ended up finishing second (in defense).
We were the No. 1 run defense in the country. I thought we did
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   After his freshman year, Katzenmoyer was supposed to be the next
Butkus. He was supposed to corner the market on awards. Last
season, he didn't win any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was because of the hype,'' he said. ``If you get
the hype, you have a better chance of going to the ceremony and
getting the award. Sportswriters all over the country vote on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer had a reputation for partying too much. He had
problems with grades and alcohol. He refused to be interviewed by
the media all season, a decision he regrets.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer has no regrets about not testing the NFL's
underclassman rule after his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been ridiculous,'' he said. ``Why would I
waste my time in court for a year when I can keep playing football
in college?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't difficult to come out this year. It wasn't the
easiest of decisions, but it wasn't really that difficult. I sat
down with my parents, talked it over and made my decision in 10
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts like Katzenmoyer on the outside to take advantage of
his speed and recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can play both,'' he said. ``I think I have the best
of both worlds. My style is to attack. When I'm allowed to attack,
I'll run right through you. I don't want anything to get in my way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've matured. I'm more knowledgeable about the game.
I really think I played the best last season that I've played in
three years at Ohio State. I did everything I was asked. I made few
mistakes. I didn't have the numbers, but we had a great defense,
and I put out a great effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm ready for the next level. This next step is a huge
challenge. Hopefully, I'll be able to live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Katzenmoyer, Kearse believes that his potential to play
more than one position is a blessing rather than a curse. Kearse
might be a super outside linebacker or defensive end. The scouts
agree that he has the ability to become a dynamite pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call me `Slash,''' Kearse says, laughing because he knows that
nickname belongs to Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart. ``Some
teams say if I put on another 15 pounds and keep my speed, I'll
play end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others say I can play end at this weight. Some think I should
lose weight to play outside linebacker. I love to rush the
quarterback, but it doesn't matter which position I play. Mainly, I
like a scheme where I can do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearse is 6-4{, 262. He consistently runs the 40 in the 4.5s At
his individual workout in March, he ran in the 4.4s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited about the draft,'' he says. ``I want to be an
impact player from day one. I want to just take over the game.''

TIME WARNER EARNINGS STRONG

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Time Warner Inc., continuing its stellar
performance, reported first-quarter results that blew through Wall
Street's forecasts and reflected strength in all of its businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner has become the premiere entertainment and cable
company in the world,'' said analyst Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum. ``There was not a single disappointment in the
earnings report.''
</P>
<P>
   The conglomerate posted profits of $138 million, or 10 cents a
share, easily beating the consensus estimate of a loss of 4 cents a
share. The 1998 quarter saw a loss of $62 million due to poor music
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues rose 2 percent to $3.27 billion while cash flow, a key
for debt-heavy media concerns like Time Warner, soared 47 percent
to $1.25 billion, aided by a $215 million gain from termination of
MGM's video distribution pact. Time Warner ended last year with
$16.5 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been heartened by Warner Bros., the Burbank-based
film-TV business, which rose 10 percent in cash flow to $131
million without the MGM gain as ``You've Got Mail'' and ``Analyze
This'' beat forecasts. Its movie business has rebounded with ``The
Matrix'' and solid forecasts for ``Austin Powers 2,'' ``Wild Wild
West'' and ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Music posted a 10 percent increase to $102 million on strong
sales by Cher, Alanis Morissette, Sugar Ray, Jewel and Madonna;
Cable-TBS rose 20 percent to $184 million and Cable-HBO was up 15
percent to $125 million; publishing gained 11 percent to $94
million; cable operations rose 6 percent to $403 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has doubled in value in less than a year,
touched an all-time high of $78.625 before falling back to $73.50
for a $3.50 loss as part of a sell-off of large-cap issues.
``Today's loss was market-driven and had nothing to do with the
earnings,'' Hyman said.

YUGOSLAVS STEP UP EXPULSIONS IN KOSOVO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Yugoslav forces in southeastern Kosovo are
stepping up a campaign of expelling ethnic Albanians from across
southeastern Kosovo, according to refugees crossing the border here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of Yugoslav attacks, growing food shortages and the
latest Yugoslav policy of allowing Albanians to freely cross the
border here has swollen the flood of refugees fleeing from Kosovo.
More than 3,000 disheveled and dispirited ethnic Albanians trudged
across the border here Wednesday clutching their life possessions
in tote bags and backpacks, triple the number who entered the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee officials, while cautioning that their information
about what is happening inside Kosovo is limited, said a new exodus
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could be dawning. ``It could very
well be that very large numbers of people are coming,'' said Paula
Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
adding that the situation in Kosovo was ``probably deteriorating
very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees painted a stark picture of thousands of people trying
to flee southeastern Kosovo as the Yugoslav expulsion campaign
spreads outward from the town of Urosevac, the site of a Yugoslav
army barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, refugees said, Serbian paramilitaries
and Yugoslav soldiers have attacked ethnic Albanian villages in a
20-by-5-mile valley of rich farm land that hooks through
southeastern Kosovo. Villages along the Macedonian border are also
being attacked, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Expulsions that began last week in villages around the town of
Urosevac have now been extended to Albanian villages in three
different directions: those around Ljipljane, about five miles to
the north; Kacanik, 10 miles to the south, and Gnjilane, about 15
miles to the West, refugees said. Those who refuse to leave their
homes are killed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians remain trapped in small
pockets in the hills bordering the now nearly deserted valley, an
area that Western diplomats said was not a center of activity by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic- Albanian guerrilla group
that has been fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the villages from Gnjilane to the border here were
empty,'' said Hysen Hoti, a 57-year-old construction worker who
said Serb paramilitaries forced him out of the village of Kmetovic
on Wednesday. ``You could see no people, only domestic animals and
cows wandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who fled from their villages to Urosevac are so
desperate to leave Kosovo that they are overwhelming the region's
transportation system. Over the last two days, word that the border
was open has spread in Kosovo, refugees said. They said that
thousands of ethnic Albanians jammed the Urosevac train station
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials brought in an additional train and three
buses to expedite the ethnic Albanians' flight, but their
generosity apparently has its limits. Refugees who were there on
Tuesday said that each departing ethnic Albanian was forced to pay
$20 for a ride into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers on the train from Urosevac said there were about 200
people at the station in Kacanik, a town on the way south toward
Macedonia, U.N. officials said. But the train was too full to let
them on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The refugees' problems do not end when they cross the border.
U.N. officials said that the Macedonian government, which was
initially criticized for callous treatment of the refugees, forced
1,000 Kosovo Albanians to wait in buses at the border for seven
hours before allowing them to go on to refugee camps. The officials
said another 1,000 to 1,500 people, presumably ethnic Albanians,
were waiting to cross from Yugoslavia into Macedonia near the town
of Kumanovo Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police were holding the group in a no-man's land, Ms.
Ghedini said, because they do not consider the area an official
border crossing. Two weeks ago in a similar situation, the
Macedonians eventually allowed the refugees to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's prime minister, Ljupco Georgievski, said on Tuesday
that he was unaware of delays at the border. Georgievski said his
government had at first been overwhelmed by the ``catastrophe''
that unfolded on its doorstep and was simply trying to keep the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``No state can allow the opening of its frontier, and that
anyone can enter uncontrolled,'' he said. ``There had to be some
kind of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships they have suffered since the NATO bombings
began on March 24, ethnic Albanians arriving here Wednesday voiced
strong support for the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   They conceded that the Yugoslav units now rolling through
southeastern Kosovo appeared undaunted by the NATO assault. But
they insisted that the bombing was slowing the Yugoslavs and that
the expulsions would have occurred whether or not NATO struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the same thing in the southwest of Kosovo even before
NATO bombed,'' said Skenderi Ifusi, who was forced from his village
near Urosevac six days before.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said they, too, supported the airstrikes but
added that it was a mistake for NATO not to have anticipated mass
expulsions. They called for NATO ground troops or the arming of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and immediate air drops of food into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Faruk Sinani, who was expelled from a village near Urosevac last
week, said he believed that many of the Albanians remaining in
Kosovo were trapped. But he insisted that others were intentionally
staying behind, believing that their liberators may soon appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are waiting for NATO,'' he said. ``Nothing else.''

HOUSE PASSES BILL THAT ALLOW LOCAL CHALLENGES TO 2000 CENSUS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Texas, Mo., Calif.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a partisan brawl, the House Wednesday night
approved a bill that would allow local officials to challenge the
accuracy of next year's census and to demand a recount of any
neighborhoods where they suspected errors.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 223-206. Only four Democrats voted for the bill,
and only one Republican, Rep. Constance A. Morella of Maryland,
voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said the bill would increase the accuracy of
the census. But Democrats said it was intended to frustrate the
Clinton administration's ambitious plans for statistical sampling
to correct the expected undercount of blacks, Hispanic Americans
and poor people, who tend to favor Democratic candidates when they
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The White House strenuously opposed the bill. The outlook for
the legislation in the Senate is not clear because senators have
not focused on it.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William M. Daley said he would urge Clinton
to veto the bill if Congress passed it. In an interview, Kenneth
Prewitt, director of the Census Bureau, a unit of the Commerce
Department, said, ``It's courting disaster to insert a major new
operation of this magnitude into the census process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the bill raised the question of who was better
equipped to spot mistakes in census tallies: local officials, who
deal with local residents every day, or federal statisticians in
Washington, who would adjust the figures. Many social scientists
have endorsed the use of statistical sampling, but Republicans said
they could never trust the Clinton administration to use it in an
even-handed way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican floor leader,
said: ``You should be counted in your home. You shouldn't be
estimated. The process of local review reveals where the count
wasn't complete or accurate. Should we ask the mayor and local
officials, or should the federal government use some abstract
mathematical model, defined by the Clinton administration, which
has politicized everything it has touched in this government?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader,
described the census as ``the last great civil rights issue of this
century.'' Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., said Republicans ``want
errors left in the census because they believe that those errors
create a political advantage for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said Democrats were ``playing the
race card,'' impugning the motives of Republicans. ``To argue that
the government must do statistical sampling because we are racist
is one of the most slimy political arguments I have ever heard,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars of federal money for roads and bridges,
education, health care and law enforcement ride on the census
results.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill approved Wednesday by the House, the Census
Bureau would provide local officials with certain preliminary data,
including the number of housing units on each block, a complete
address list and the total population count for each governmental
unit. Local officials could assert, for example, that the Census
Bureau had used the wrong geographic boundaries for a city or
county, missed a cluster of housing units or listed housing units
in the wrong location. The Census Bureau would have to investigate
such complaints and ``correct any miscounts,'' by recanvassing
blocks where there were possible problems.

INVESTORS TAKE PROFITS, WITH DOW GAINING BY 16.65 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a session showing exceptional shifts in focus,
investors Wednesday cashed in profits in high-flying technology and
consumer stocks and switched their money into neglected issues that
would benefit from revived world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   When the churning ended, seven of the 30 components of the Dow
Jones industrial average had surged more than 3 points, with Alcoa
jumping 6 9/16 to 53\, and six Dow stocks had more than 3 points,
with Wal-Mart down 5 15/16, to 98|.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip gauge eked out a 16.65-point advance to 10,411.66,
its third straight record but well off its day's high. It was ahead
by 131-points at mid-day. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index,
however, fell 0.83 percent for the session, and the NASDAQ market
slumped 2.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely the beginning of a sector rotation going on
that could become violent, given the relative valuations,'' said
Rosanne Cahn, equity economist at CS First Boston. ``All the stuff
that's cast a pall over the industrial cyclicals is starting to
turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few sessions investors have started to gravitate
toward such economically sensitive industries as paper, chemicals,
metals and machinery on the belief that foreign economic crises are
abating and that world economic growth will pick up, aided by last
week's European interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a select handful of favorite big-name stocks
have vaulted ever higher. ``Investors are taking another look at
price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios,'' said Daniel Eagan, a
portfolio manager at Black Rock in Philadelphia. ``The high
valuations are causing them to look for other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners were Dow Chemical, up 8, to 109{; Georgia
Pacific 6|, to 91\; Caterpillar 5 15/16, to 60 11//16, and Nucor, a
steel company, 3{, to 55 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a market that's moving away from the defensive names,
with people attracted to cyclicals,'' said Gary Dickinson,
portfolio manager at Columbia Partners in Washington, ``Most of the
problems of the global economy may be behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors' interest in smaller stocks has also picked up in
recent sessions. The Russell 2000 index pushed up Wednesday
morning, briefly moving into plus territory for the year before its
substantial gain largely evaporated during the afternoon. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of small-capitalization stocks posted a
1.15 percent gain Wednesday, trimming its decline so far this year
to 7.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., which reported a much bigger earnings
increase than Wall Street expected, soared as high 140 1/16 before
succumbing to profit-taking to close at 132~, leaving it a gain of
3 9/16. Boeing rose 3], the biggest gain in five months, to 38 on
optimism about its earnings report Thursday. Time Warner beat
earnings expectations but fell 3{, to 73{, although it traded
after-hours as high as 78|.
</P>
<P>
   TRW, which warned of lower profits, fell 1 1/16, to 41 15/16,
after hitting a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage houses joined technology and drugs among the weakest
sectors. Schwab tumbled 12\, to 138\, Merrill Lynch 5 5/16, 92 1/16
and Knight/Trimark 17 7/16, to 100 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Intel slumped 3{, to 57, America Online 8 7/16, to 150~, Dell 2
5/16, to 38[, Microsoft 4\,, to 85~, Amazon.com 10], to 168 and
Ebay 10, to 162~.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, Pfizer, Schering Plough and American Home Products each
fell more than 4 points, while Lilly and Warner-Lambert fell more
than 3.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume climbed to a hefty 952
million shares, with advancing issues outnumbering declining ones
by 1,766 to 1,285. A total of 113 issues hit new 52-week highs
while 63 made new lows.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilshire 5000 index, which includes nearly all American
stocks, fell 1.43 percent to pare its gain so far this year to 7.01
percent.

ANALYSIS: FROM NYC POLICE UNION, A VOTE WITH MYRIAD MEANINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association
cast a vote of no confidence in Police Commissioner Howard Safir,
the true meaning behind that unanimous vote remains as clear as the
inner workings of the PBA itself _ which is to say, not clear at
all.
</P>
<P>
   In another era, a no-confidence vote from the police union would
signal to the commissioner that he should begin removing those
Kiwanis plaques from the office wall. But these days, the
commissioner is able to interpret a union denouncement as a
perverse endorsement, knowing that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would
never allow himself to be seen as bowing to union pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Then why did James ``Doc'' Savage, the acting PBA president, put
such a motion before the union's 400 delegates Tuesday? And why was
it unanimously approved?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Savage's decision and the subsequent mandate
reflect the distrust that pervades all quarters of the city Police
Department, from the administrative offices to the rank and file to
the troubled union that is supposed to represent the interests of
its 27,000 members. It also suggests the kind of tactics to be
expected in the no-holds-barred campaign for PBA president, a
campaign in which candidates are trying to gauge exactly how hard
to attack the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it indicates that although his job appears safe, Safir
has allowed himself, through a recent spate of questionable
decisions, to become a useful symbol of poor judgment in a
department that tries to promote an image of having no tolerance
for such transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   At least three factors are at play in what, for lack of a better
term, can be called police politics.
</P>
<P>
   First, many officers have never forgiven either the PBA or the
Giuliani administration for agreeing to a five-year contract that
brought no pay increases in the first two years. They call it
``zeroes for heroes.'' As the city gained international renown for
its reduction in crime, the officers found the wage freeze all the
more galling.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African
immigrant who was repeatedly shot by four white officers in the
Bronx in February; the officers now face murder charges. Many
police officers feel that the dynamics of the shooting were created
by the Giuliani administration's insatiable demand for ever-lower
crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, there is Safir himself, a former federal law enforcement
official with a decidedly cold public persona. He is widely seen as
Giuliani's stunt double at the Police Department. He has also not
endeared himself to police officers by boasting that he has fired
more of them than any previous commissioner, at the same time that
he is criticized by civil rights advocates for not being tough
enough on errant officers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Safir has been subjected to public scrutiny and
ridicule for several decisions, among them sending detectives to
the home of a woman who had been involved in a minor car accident
with his wife, and traveling to the Academy Awards in Los Angeles
on the private jet of a corporate executive. In every case,
Giuliani has expressed support for his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday, Savage asked 400 union delegates gathered at
the Terrace on the Park in Queens to pass a resolution calling for
Safir's suspension. The acting president knew exactly what
emotional buttons to press. In particular, he accused the
commissioner of reneging on a promise to cut short the 30-day,
no-pay suspension of the four officers indicted in the Diallo case,
a charge that resonates on many levels, despite Safir's denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegates have wanted to take a piece out of Safir for a
long time for his policies, especially his disciplinary policies,''
Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents say that Savage needed to assert himself in
some way, to take action that would counter his soft-spoken
demeanor and diminish memories of his links to the PBA leadership
that agreed to the controversial contract. The election is in June.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for union office rarely desire the endorsement of
management, but the police commissioner may have inadvertently
aided Savage by favorably invoking the name of one of his
opponents, James Higgins, another veteran PBA executive board
member. ``I agree with Higgins of the PBA that this is a publicity
move by Doc Savage, who's desperate in this election to get
elected,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said he would not accept the endorsements of either
Giuliani or Safir (not that either would ever endorse a candidate
in a union election). Still, he said, he would work to re-establish
communication with City Hall, since the union's policy of burning
bridges has worked to the disadvantage of the membership.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other candidates for PBA president, including
Pat Lynch, who describes himself as a reformer. In interviews and
in press releases, he projected a general disgust with virtually
all the principals involved.
</P>
<P>
   Both Savage and Higgins, Lynch said, were part of the entrenched
PBA leadership, and as for Safir, he said, ``He doesn't have the
confidence of the police officers, and he never has.
</P>
<P>
   ``This no-confidence vote should have been called for months
ago.''

<P>
   ``We all look for strength, love, divine order and happy
thoughts. We all find it in our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now string that hike out from the mountains' high point to its
low point _ the ceiling to the sea _ and you're talking real
poetry. It's the result of tackling the 11{ mostly downhill but
strenuous miles from Circle X Ranch to Sycamore Canyon in Southern
Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   The route that travels over the Backbone, Old Boney, Serrano
Canyon and Big Sycamore Canyon trails is a study in extremes of
elevation and environment tied together by a common ruggedness and
stellar vantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's undeveloped and it's supposed to be kept as such,'' Point
Mugu State Park ranger Tom Evans said of the segment that passes
through Boney Mountain State Wilderness. ``The protection of it has
gotten to the point whereas I can't even patrol it on a routine
basis, so that would make it more lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most remote sections, don't expect to see any other
trekkers; Evans therefore recommends logging a detailed trail plan
with friends or family beforehand and traveling with a hiking
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   And don't depend on an entirely well-groomed pathway, so only
the hardy need consider the journey. The Old Boney Trail is
overgrown and infested with ticks and poison oak, while the portion
of the Backbone Trail that exits the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area has been in disrepair most of the decade
following fierce fires and floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are primitive trails, meaning they haven't been built up
to standard,'' said Mike Zenan, the recreation area's maintenance
work leader for roads and trails.
</P>
<P>
   But inspiring vistas are regular occurrences. ``You can't get
many places with as many views from the Western Santa Monica
Mountains as there, which includes pretty much ocean views,'' Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   The course commences in Circle X Ranch, the masterpiece of the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area with Boney Mountain
and the vast, parched chaparral and craggy outcrops that define it.
It concludes by meandering under a lush, cool creekside canopy of
sycamore and oak in Serrano Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at the Backbone Trailhead (elevation 2,100 feet), a
wide fire road climbs steadily, passing a connector to the stunning
Mishe Mokwa Trail (2,350 feet) in three-tenths of a mile before
cresting out at a saddle (2,800 feet) a half-mile later.
</P>
<P>
   Here view renowned Balanced Rock teetering to the north, above
Echo Cliffs and striking Carlisle Canyon. ``I can't understand how
that rock stays there with earthquakes going on,'' said English
outdoorsman Peter Smith, who makes the ascent during an annual
holiday vacation to the Southland.
</P>
<P>
   A milder grade takes hikers in another three-tenths of a mile to
the first significant plateau (2,950 feet), identified by a major
jog to the right and a poorly flagged signpost on the left pointing
the way up a series of stairs to Sandstone Peak, a worthwhile
diversion of a few hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the popular destination ``combines the highest point
and good views with... a lot of wildlife and flowers. A couple of
years ago, I was sitting here on a rock that had fallen down, and I
spotted two hummingbirds in the branches. So I sat still and one
came within inches of my face and hovered around it, sort of
viewing me wondering what I was. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring is wildflower season, and as the Backbone Trail descends
gently over the next 1.1 miles to a junction (2,660 feet) one can
spot the blue flowers of the hairy ceanothus, pink prickly phlox
and rose-purple owl's clover. Turn left at the sign that directs
visitors to the Backbone Trail and Tri Peaks, and left again in 30
feet at the post pointing toward the Backbone Trail and Sycamore
Canyon. A half-mile farther on, veer left again at the next T in
the trail (2,700 feet), following the sign to Sycamore Canyon as
you enter the state park.
</P>
<P>
   Overcast days can bring low-flying clouds that funnel over the
precipitous ridges to the south like, dare I say, Mount Everest;
must be the mountains' poetry catching up to me.
</P>
<P>
   The next 3.1 miles loses the most altitude of the trip, more
than 1,500 feet, as the track slides down the west shoulder of
Boney Mountain. A curious monolith split in two with a plaque
dedicating it to ranch owner and wealthy Los Angeles industrialist
Henry Chamberlain (1889-1954) _ ``Who loved these mountains'' _ is
passed along the way over several zigzags to Old Boney Trail (1,150
feet).
</P>
<P>
   Turn left, departing the Backbone Trail that is identified by a
skinny plastic sign, for nine-tenths of a mile, passing oaks,
Indian paint brush, California poppy, overgrowth and those pesky
ticks. (Beware: Ticks collected in the mountains in February tested
positive for Lyme disease for the first time; wear long pants and
long-sleeve shirts, and check often.)
</P>
<P>
   At the next junction, veer left on Serrano Canyon Trail (1,010
feet), which in 3{ miles connects with Big Sycamore Trail (115
feet). Serrano Canyon offers gentle grasslands and awesome shots of
Boney Mountain before crossing its namesake creek a dozen or so
times to the croaking of tiny beige frogs with booming voices.
</P>
<P>
   The final 1\ miles of the ugly fire road that is Big Sycamore
Canyon Trail brings visitors back to reality that this verdant
oasis is surrounded by concrete metropolis. But the diversion
brings out the verse and ballad in all of us, if only for a day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SIDEBAR: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Climb to the zenith of the Santa Monica Mountains and you face a
choice. No, it's nothing as monumental as whether to return to your
car and the workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   You can call the rock that rises to 3,111 feet Sandstone Peak,
as officially identified on topographic maps, or Mount Allen, as
the lonely bronze plaque stationed atop it proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   It may be confusing, but, take your pick, the panoramic view of
Circle X Ranch and its surroundings are just as stellar.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque notes the mountain was named in honor of W. Herbert
Allen; it was presented in 1965 by the Exchange Club of Los Angeles
to commemorate ``his gift of the mountains to the Boy Scouts of
America.'' Allen's bespectacled image appears with a Boy Scouts
emblem on the lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Further research reveals that Allen was a title insurance
executive who began acquiring land in the mountains in 1949 with
other members of the Exchange Club, a service organization for
downtown businessmen, to create a camping area for various youth
groups. Allen's wealth and vision were instrumental in preserving
the area as the scout's Circle X Ranch, named for the Exchange
Club's icon _ an encircled C and X.
</P>
<P>
   The property was leased to the Boy Scouts in 1951 for 99 years
at an annual rate of $1. In turn it was purchased by a conservation
group in 1987 and sold to the National Park Service two years
later.

THE STILL-DIGNIFIED BUT ANGRIER EX-MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note language in 4th graf.) 
(DW) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He still dresses as if he is going to dinner with
Brooke Astor, who by the way sent him ``the nicest note'' the other
day. He is still courtly, elegant, fussy, decent and remote. But
Wednesday, when David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, takes his place
as expected in the front lines of a large rally for police reform
alongside his combustible former antagonist, the Rev. Al Sharpton,
New Yorkers will be seeing an angrier man.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I had little to say, but there comes a time,
either speak up or leave,'' Dinkins said in his office at Columbia
University the other day. ``So I've chosen to speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is Dinkins on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the city he runs:
``As during World War II, the trains ran on time; there was no
crime in Nazi Germany. I'm not comparing him to Hitler and
Mussolini, but saying that efficiency in certain areas is not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   On the attitude of New York City police toward Deputy Mayor Rudy
Washington, who recently said he was harassed for racial reasons by
officers who didn't recognize him: ``If you don't know who he is,
he's just another nigger. But I'm not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   On the mayor personally: ``I don't like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows Dinkins will tell you that he has been angry at
the mayor since he lost to Giuliani in 1993 and that he has been
speaking out against police brutality since at least 1995. ``It's
just asinine to think that the police can police themselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a turning point came on March 15, when Dinkins got himself
arrested for criminal trespassing with 13 others at Police
Headquarters in a protest over the death of Amadou Diallo, the
unarmed African immigrant killed in February in a barrage of 41
bullets fired by four white officers.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the former mayor being led away in handcuffs _
the civil disobedience brought sneers from Giuliani _ gave new life
to the daily protests. When it was all over, 1,166 people had been
arrested in the three-week campaign organized by Sharpton, who has
helped build the multiracial coalition that is staging the protest
march from Brooklyn to lower Manhattan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have said there could be as many as 25,000 people;
Dinkins simply called it ``a monster,'' predicting ``thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, he is full of praise for Sharpton, the
sometimes hotheaded street preacher who in the old days lobbed
political grenades at Dinkins but has now offered him his best
platform since City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   I will be very pleased to walk next to him,'' Dinkins said of
Sharpton. ``Unquestionably, he has matured.'' Dinkins referred to
Sharpton's civil disobedience campaign as ``genius,'' insisted he
couldn't remember what he and Sharpton had fought over, then
praised him because ``I've never, ever known him to counsel
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, 44, more than returned the favor about the man he now
describes as an elder statesman: ``There were times when I said
things that were absolutely nasty _ that he acquiesces too much.
And he would never shoot back. It was almost like he was a father
thinking I would grow out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins, Sharpton said, ``always said to me that he felt I could
broaden my base, that he thought I should be more measured and
thoughtful.'' If Dinkins has a fault, Sharpton said, ``it's that
David Dinkins is an eternal optimist, and he really thinks that
people are innately good, and it drives me crazy sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sharpton said, ``if I can grow up to be David Dinkins, I
would be very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, one should not forget this story: When Sharpton was
recuperating in the hospital in 1991 after being stabbed in the
chest during a protest march against racism in Bensonhurst,
Dinkins, then mayor, went to his bedside. ``I'm always teasing
Mayor Dinkins that I looked up and I thought I had died and gone to
hell,'' Sharpton said in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins, 71, grew up in Trenton, N.J., where his father was a
real-estate broker, but moved to Harlem with his mother after his
parents separated when he was about 6. His mother cooked and
cleaned in houses in New Rochelle, Bronxville and Great Neck, then
became a manicurist at the Carlyle Hotel. ``I run into people all
the time who knew her and speak fondly of her,'' Dinkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins said the most painful racial experience of his life was
when he was turned down when he tried to enlist in 1945 in the
Marine Corps, which was then segregated. ``And this is a time when
people you know are dying,'' he said. ``This is very real. And you
don't give a thought to not going.'' But he persisted and got to
boot camp just as World War II was ending. The experience, he said,
was ``humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins graduated from Howard University and Brooklyn Law
School, then worked his way up through the Harlem political
establishment with Basil A. Paterson, Percy E. Sutton and Rep.
Charles B. Rangel. He is married with two children, is a professor
at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, and says
he has a ``29-year-old forehand'' in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's not competitive,'' said one of his tennis
partners, Betsy Gotbaum, the president of the New-York Historical
Society. ``He's so competitive it's unbelievable.''

TWIN LAKES KNOWN FOR RECORD CATCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB WHEAT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Calif. _ It wasn't until Norman Annett raised brown
trout that he realized they are so strange.
</P>
<P>
   Annett, whose family homesteaded the area around his Mono
Village Resort on Upper Twin Lake a century ago, began raising
brown and rainbow trout to augment those planted at the lake by the
Department of Fish and Game. He annually rears 8,000 2- to 5-pound
rainbows and 900 1- to 2-pound browns for the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   But Upper Twin Lake's brown population may not need Annett's
help.
</P>
<P>
   For four years running, the biggest fish caught on the opening
day of trout season in the Eastern Sierra has been a brown trout
from either Upper Twin Lake or neighboring Lower Twin Lake. And
with an abundant food supply, the brown trout's solitary lifestyle
and the Twin Lakes' colder waters, experts believe there is little
reason to doubt the lakes will again yield the trout-opener whooper
_ and again it will be a brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Browns) are weird because they just lay at the bottom when
we're growing them,'' Annett said. ``That's partly why they grow so
large, because they stay at the bottom getting fat. Last year we
had a guy catch a 7-pound, 10-ounce fish for the biggest fish of
opening day, and the state record was caught on a cold day with
gale-force winds a week after the opener in 1987.''
</P>
<P>
   A plaster replica of the record 26{-pound brown hangs from the
boat house at Annett's resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a big floating pig with it's huge belly,''
Annett said. ``I'd swear it's round as it is long. But it's pretty
with the different colors. It's just kind of odd looking, it's so
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Twin record brown edged out the previous state
standard, a 26-pound, 5-ounce brown taken at the Lower Twin Lake in
1983. (The world record brown titled the scales at 40\ pounds,
caught in Arkansas' Little Red River in 1992.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Lower Twin that produced a 13-pound, 6-ounce brown trout
as the big fish of the 1997 Eastern Sierra trout opener and a
7-pound, 15-ouncer for the first day's honors a year earlier. An
8-pound, 10-ounce brown was registered at Upper Twin as 1995's
opening-day leviathan.
</P>
<P>
   The reputation of the Twin Lakes has created a friendly
competition between the proprietors of the Upper and Lower resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Annett and counterpart Steve Marti, owner of
the Twin Lake Resort at Lower Twin, each predicts the opening day's
lunker will be boated out of their lake come April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Acton angler Marc Priore, an opening-day regular for the past
eight years, knows where he's laying his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm going to the Upper Lake because I caught a
fish just a bit shy of my personal best of 5 pounds there (in
October). But the lower lake is known for big ones, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti maintains the brown trout's loner way of life and
suspicious nature help it survive and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't travel in schools and are naturally very wary of
being caught,'' he said. ``But they're ambush fish, so you can
catch them around the bushes and grass off the shore. They do like
to lay around the bottom, especially after a big meal because
they'll eat until they're stuffed and won't feed again for about
four or five days.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason brown trout grow to such tremendous dimensions in
the Twin Lakes is the daily all-you-can eat buffet to which they
are treated. ``There are nine other species of fish besides the
brown trout in those lakes, and browns are very aggressive
fish-eating animals,'' said associate fishery biologist Curtis
Milliron of the DFG's Bishop office. ``... We also stock the lakes
(with other trout) pretty well, so there's no shortage for food for
those big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The lakes' colder temperatures _ at elevations of 7,091 feet for
the upper, 7,078 for the lower _ and deeper waters _ 110 feet and
150 feet or more, respectively _ contribute to the longevity and,
subsequently, the size of the brown trout, which tend to live
longer than their rainbow cousins. The cold preserves fish by
slowing their metabolisms, Milliron explained, and these browns are
content to live the sedentary life on the lakes' frigid bottoms,
making it difficult to hook them because they are so docile.
</P>
<P>
   Marti, who used to fish the area as a youngster in the 1950s and
has been a businessman there for more than 18 years, is convinced
the increased fishing pressure in Eastern Sierra waters should
prompt some changes in fishing regulations at Lower Twin Lake for
the protection of its fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never see a picture with a guy holding up a small fish
with a big smile on his face,'' Marti said. ``Anglers want to
capture `the big fish,' and we can help make this lake even more of
a hot spot, but it would take some changes, like gear restrictions
_ no artificial lures with barbs _ and size limits on what can be
taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A catch-and-release program would help build the fish up _
throwing them back if they are too small so they can grow some
more. And having a ban on barbs goes along with that. If you
release the fish, you want the least amount of damage to them so
they'll live. So hooks with barbs would be best left at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Marti believes he will face opposition with his recommendations,
but Milliron envisions such a plan would not ruffle too many
feathers since Lower Twin already has the reputation as a ``trophy
lake,'' while Upper Twin is more family orientated with its bigger
dock area that can also crank out big browns. The notion is that
anglers seeking trophy trout wouldn't mind stricter release
regulations as much as anglers with families who might want to keep
more fish.
</P>
<P>
   Priore does his best to edge on the amicable feud between Upper
and Lower Twin lakes, but he has bigger fish to fry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't care if I catch a darn thing, it's so
beautiful up there by the lakes,'' he said. ``I just love fishing.
So catching a big fish would be a great bonus. But, like they say,
`A bad day of fishing beats a great day at work anytime.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING ...
</P>
<P>
   To get to the Twin Lakes, travel highways 14 and 395 some 350
miles to Bridgeport, turn left onto Twin Lakes Road at the west end
of town and drive 11{ miles to Lower Twin Lake. Upper Twin Lake is
1{ miles farther.
</P>
<P>
   Camping and boat rentals are available at Twin Lakes Resort on
Lower Twin Lake, (760) 932-7751, and Mono Village on Upper Twin
Lake, (760) 932-7071.
</P>
<P>
   For details on first-come, first-serve sites at two public
campgrounds within the Twin Lakes Recreation Area _ Honeymoon Flat
and Robinson Creek (north half) _ call the Humboldt-Toiyabe
National Forest's Bridgeport Ranger District, (760) 932-7070.
Reservations are available for May 21 and later but are filling
fast; call (877) 444-6777 or (800) 280-2267 to reserve a site.
</P>
<P>
   The daily bag limit is five trout; 10 fish can be in possession.
</P>
<P>
   Don't confuse the Twin Lakes out of Bridgeport with the lakes of
the same name situated in the Mammoth Lakes Basin. &QL;

PART_TIME LANDSCAPER TURNS IN WALLET WITH $1,000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ernest LeGault felt sick when he realized what a
big mistake he'd made _ he'd left his wallet and his electronic
organizer on the roof of his Ford Explorer when he drove off to
work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of phone numbers for his software business, credit
cards, checkbook, family photos _ and $1,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   All gone.
</P>
<P>
   What LeGault didn't count on was that Ismael Gutierrez, a
part-time landscaper and full-time good Samaritan would find the
wallet and hand it over to police with the $1,000 and other items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel a whole lot better about the world in
general,'' LeGault said. ``It seems as you get older, you see
things going downhill. Then you see something like this and you
realize that not everybody's a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, LeGault met Gutierrez to offer his thanks and a
$200 reward. The landscaper explained that initially he was tempted
to keep the $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled over and opened it up and saw $1,000,'' said the
39-year-old man. ``I'm like, Wow, especially because I only had $2
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gutierrez changed his mind when he found in the wallet a
photo of LeGault with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had a guilty conscience _ just thinking about it
made me have a guilty conscience,'' he said. ``But after _ I felt a
lot better about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said he also lost his own wallet several years ago and
remembered the grief that comes with having to cancel credit cards
and get a new driver's license, not to mention the lost cash.
</P>
<P>
   During their meeting, LeGault shook hands with Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very often we run across such honest and good
character,'' LeGault said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't lose it again. I don't think I'll be around to find
it,'' Gutierrez said. The man from nearby Canyon Country just
happened to be on his day off Wednesday when he found the wallet
about 10 a.m. in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it is a lesson that LeGault learned well.
</P>
<P>
   He was on his way to work, a briefcase in one hand, a computer
in the other, when he left his wallet on the car's roof and headed
out to drop off his 3-year-old son at day care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I didn't have it after I dropped my son off,'' he
said. ``I thought I left it at home and went back there and looked
in the car, looked in the street, all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the ordeal all the more unbearable, LeGault said, was the
fact that he'd just cashed a check and planned to deposit the money
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, How often do you carry $1,000? Just my luck,''
he said. ``The thought of replacing all those things was just
sickening me. I was just about ready to start driving the streets
looking for it when the phone rang.''
</P>
<P>
   After driving home to his brother's house in the Winnetka
community in the San Fernando Valley, Gutierrez made the short walk
to the West Valley Division station where he handed Officer Eric
Holtz the bulging wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just walked it in the station,'' Holtz said. ``We
congratulated him for his honesty and integrity. He was just doing
his good duty looking out for another human being.''

   Gutierrez made no overture to officers about wanting a reward,
although he gave them his name and phone number so they could pass
it along to the wallet's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz said he'd seen wallets turned in before, ``but it's very
unusual for that large of a dollar amount to go untouched.''

   LeGault joked that he felt so lucky he'd better run out and buy

   It was a lucky day, too, for his electronic organizer, which

with just a small scuff.

   There again, Gutierrez can be thanked: ``I had to swerve to
avoid hitting it.''

DESPITE SNOW, CAMPING A GO

   MAMMOTH, Calif. _ While the region was pelted over the past week
by a series of storms that dumped 31 inches atop Mammoth Mountain
and 9 inches, in one day, at Bridgeport, campers targeting rainbows
and browns for the Eastern Sierra trout opener shouldn't fret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roads are clear, the sun is out and the snow is melting,''
said Kent Monroe, manager of the Mono Village Boat House and Marina
at Upper Twin Lake southwest of Bridgeport, earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A definite warming trend'' has moved into the Owens Valley and
Eastern Sierra slopes to the north and west, according to the
National Weather Service in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The extended forecast through Friday calls for mostly clear
weather and low breezes in the Owens Valley, with high temperatures
in the 70s and lows in the 30s; higher elevations will see a
similar pattern, with highs in the 60s and lows in the mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   The last storm of the recent system blew through Monday, and the
building of high pressure since is bringing back more seasonal
temperature, NWS forecasters report.
</P>
<P>
   The inclement weather of the past week coated the Twin Lakes
area with 2 inches of snow and patches of more than a foot, but
Mono Village Resort proprietors expect to open for camping as
planned Monday. While overnight lows dipped to a freezing 3 degrees
Monday in Bridgeport, daytime highs of 52 had melted all remaining
snow. Resort operators at June and Convict lakes reported 2 inches
of snow on the ground but were unconcerned that any would stick for
more than a couple of days. Camp sites around Crowley Lake remain
snow-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about this time of year is that if it snows,
it melts really fast,'' said JoBeth Brown, a spokeswoman for the
Mammoth Ranger Station in the town of Mammoth Lakes, where 4.25
inches of new snow was reported through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's best to heed the old Eastern Sierra adage, ``If you
don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes''... it often gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Unless late-season snow interferes with plans, most campgrounds
in the Inyo and Humboldt-Toiyabe national forests below an
elevation of 8,500 feet that are scheduled to be open before the
April 24 trout opener will be operating, according to U.S. Forest
Service officials. Traditionally, the big exception is the
campgrounds in the Mammoth Lakes Basin; it's no different this
year, as sites there won't open until Memorial Day weekend or
later.
</P>
<P>
   Questions regarding specific U.S. Forest Service campgrounds can
be directed to the five ranger stations in the region _ Mount
Whitney (in Lone Pine), (760) 876-6200; White Mountain (Bishop),
(760) 873-2501; Mammoth, (760) 924-5500; Lee Vining, (760)
647-3044; and Bridgeport, (760) 932-7070.
</P>
<P>
   Note to skiers: With this week's accumulations, Mammoth Mountain
reports a base of 12 to 14 feet; June Mountain closed operations
Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ As he contemplates retirement after 20 seasons in
the NHL and 21 as a professional athlete, Wayne Gretzky of the New
York Rangers hears many opinions, from old and young, both inside
and outside his profession and family. He recently spoke with
Gordie Howe, who called to congratulate Gretzky on goal No. 1,072,
which surpassed Howe's career total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `How ya doing?''' Gretzky said Wednesday after practice
in Playland Ice Casino. ``He said, `Oh, I just played in a hockey
game the other night.' I said `Gordie, you're 70 years old!' He
said `I love it.' I think I'm going to have the same feeling 30
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, 38, also spoke with his 6-year-old son, asking him if
he planned to attend Sunday's season finale at Madison Square
Garden against Pittsburgh, possibly the last professional
appearance of Gretzky's magnificent career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `No, I've got a baseball game,''' Gretzky said. ``I
said, `Well, I don't know about next year.' And he said, `Well, I
don't care. I've got a ballgame.' He seems to have everything in
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky smiled occasionally, turned serious often and rubbed his
hands on his bare forearms as he spoke during a news conference.
Then Gretzky and his teammates traveled to Ottawa for Thursday
night's game, which might be his last in his native Canada.
</P>
<P>
   With his production waning from age and his body hurting from a
seasonlong injury to a disk in his neck, Gretzky is debating
whether to accept or turn down a $5 million contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Although gratified that people are urging him to play one more
season, Gretzky hinted broadly that retirement is his strongest
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd probably be lying if I didn't say I was leaning somewhat
one way more than the other,'' Gretzky said after practice. ``No
question about that. What I'm going through is just totally about
myself, what I need to do, what's best for myself. It's my
decision. I'm seriously at a crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has spent recent days in talking with his wife, Janet;
his agent, Mike Barnett; his coach, John Muckler, and NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman, among others. He spoke in Ottawa later
Wednesday with Rangers general manager Neil Smith and was to meet
his father, Walter. Gretzky said Muckler was encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about a lot of things, mostly my importance to the
organization as far as my presence, what I bring to the hockey
club,'' Gretzky said. ``He said it will be a lot better team if I'm
back. So that was obviously very flattering and very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky has scored only nine goals this season, his minus-23
rating in the plus/minus ratio is the worst on the team and his
diminished mobility has led to several hard and painful hits from
opposing checkers. But Gretzky remains one of hockey's best passers
on the power play, creating scoring chances for others. Muckler was
asked whether he had suggested to Gretzky a reduced role in
1999-2000 as a power-play specialist, limiting him to what he does
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't get that far,'' Muckler said. ``That's a good
point, though. I wish I would have thought of it when I was talking
to him. He'd be very valuable in that area. Our power play has been
one of the better power plays in the NHL this year and he is the
main reason why.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an adjustment in Gretzky's role would limit his playing
time, reduce his exposure to injury and give the fans and clubs the
chance to give him a seasonlong farewell. ``I know I could play,''
Gretzky said. ``I'm not going to play at the level I did 10 years
ago. As John said today, I can contribute to the hockey team. I
don't want to let him down. On the other side of it, I don't want
to let myself down and I don't want to let the Rangers down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The retirement rumors began with the broadcaster John Davidson,
who sits with Gretzky on the team's charter flights. Davidson began
suggesting the Great One's imminent retirement on last Friday's
Ranger telecast on the MSG Network, then elaborated on Saturday
night's telecast of ``Hockey Night in Canada'' and on Sunday
afternoon's Fox network telecast in the United States. Gretzky
denied Wednesday that he is unhappy with how Smith has failed to
structure the team around his perceived wants and needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my business, nor did I ever want it to be,''
Gretzky said, referring to player personnel. ``Madison Square
Garden has treated me tremendous. Neil has always been fair to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gretzky has strongly urged the Rangers to sign free
agents this summer, he has often said that he dislikes the
widespread perception around hockey that he influences roster
decisions. His retirement option, rather than a use of leverage, is
merely a personal dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be an idiot about this,'' Gretzky said.
``It's a lifetime decision. Once it's done, it's done. It's 100
percent. There's going to be no wavering. Everyone wants to go out
like Michael Jordan did. It's not going to happen that way, this
year. It is nice to be able to say: you know what? People do want
me to play next year. Whether it be my teammates, coaches or from
what you people are saying, I'm listening to everybody. I know,
eventually, I'll make the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what one factor is most important, Gretzky said: ``Time.
That's the only word I can come up with. Twenty-one years is a lot
of time.'' &QL;

SENATE PANEL SEES IOC DALLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While members of a Senate committee harshly
reprimanded two U.S. members of the International Olympic Committee
on Wednesday for a ``culture of corruption,'' and suggested varying
timetables for reform, Sen. Ernest Hollings lent an air of blunt
impatience to the proceedings with a call for immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are y'all waiting for?'' asked Hollings, D-S.C., asked
during a Commerce Committee hearing on the IOC ``Why not get rid of
Samaranch?''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president since 1980, has been
under fire during the Olympic crisis, but has resolutely resisted
calls for him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not say, `Get rid of the guy?''' Hollings said, adding:
``Let them all resign. Get a clean group. That's the only way to
get structural change.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at George Mitchell, the former senator who headed a
special inquiry into the Salt Lake City bribery scandal on behalf
of the United States Olympic Committee, Hollings said: ``Give us
some marching orders. Tell us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission offered a road map for IOC and USOC
reform in March in its report examining the ``culture of improper
gift-giving'' that characterized Salt Lake City's successful bid to
host the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC quickly adopted the commission's recommendations, but
the IOC has moved at a slower pace, creating ethics and reform
panels that have yet to meet. A 30-member task force created by
Samaranch has so far named only six members.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated praise for the USOC's swift move to adopt some
reforms, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee's
chairman, chastised USOC president William Hybl for not turning
over the organization's internal report of its investigation into
the Salt Lake scandal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also repeatedly expressed annoyance with the two U.S.
States representatives on the IOC, Anita DeFrantz and James Easton,
for the vagueness of their answers during testimony, and for their
failure to fully support the Mitchell panel's recommendations for
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, McCain said he would have preferred to question
Samaranch, who declined to testify. ``I think he has the
information they clearly didn't have,'' he said, referring to
DeFrantz and Easton. DeFrantz, named to testify in place of
Samaranch, said of Samaranch's absence, ``English is his fourth
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell commission's recommendations for the IOC include
term limits and periodic re-election for its members; prohibiting
any country that does not sign an international treaty against
bribery from being the host of an Olympics; opening IOC meetings
and financial statements to the public, and requiring all IOC
members' visits to Olympic bid cities to be paid for by the
committee or by the members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Mitchell commission recommendations are not adopted,
there should be strong and valid reasons for not doing so,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's sincerity will determine the severity of possible
congressional legislation. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, suggested
measures to limit the IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States,
to reduce the tax deductibility of payments and sponsorship fees to
the IOC by United States television networks and other companies,
and to shift control of all domestic TV payments from the IOC to
the USOC.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Rick Lazio, R-N.Y.,
introduced a bill that would prohibit U.S. corporations and
individuals from providing financial support to the IOC until it
adopts the Mitchell commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Stevens cautioned against rushing into harsh
legislative action, in order to gauge how quickly the IOC acts and
to forestall any cuts in money from anxious global sponsors, which
would hurt athletes. Nonetheless, McCain said he would move
immediately to introduce legislation to place the IOC under the
federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars bribery of
foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was irked that DeFrantz, a former Olympic rower, could
not say what the IOC's revenues are or how much of the money flows
to athletes.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz could only guarantee McCain that the commission's
suggestions would be placed on the IOC's June meeting agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by McCain why the minutes of IOC general sessions have
been kept secret for 10 years and executive board minutes have been
embargoed for 20 years, DeFrantz said the policy protected members
from seeing their candor displayed publicly.

SPORTS COLUMN: MARBURY TOUCHES OFF A FUROR AT POINT GUARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an odd way, Stephon Marbury, the Nets' impetuous
point guard, has thrown down the gauntlet, issued a challenge to
the Knicks that may provide the impetus to push the team _ and its
backcourt _ into championship form. Following Sunday's blowout loss
to the Knicks, Marbury blasted Chris Childs and Charlie Ward,
declaring that the Knicks would never win a championship with them.
Never. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Time heals most wounds, but the venom of Marbury's words, their
harshness before the news media, will have long, lasting
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Childs refers to himself and Ward as the Knicks' ``two-headed
monster.'' They have shut down two of the league's best point
guards recently. Childs, who has been the rock of the Knicks'
backcourt all season, rendered Marbury ineffective (8 points) on
Sunday for the second consecutive time this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, while Marbury and the Nets were losing to the
Los Angeles Clippers, Ward and Childs hounded Philadelphia's Allen
Iverson into an atrocious game (4-of-16 shooting, 11 points, 6
turnovers).
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge facing Childs and Ward was the Washington
Wizards' Rod Strickland, one of the premier players at his
position.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday night's game, Stickland acknowledged that the
Knicks' two-player approach to manning one position worked for
them, but he wasn't sure if it could work for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really evaluate what they're doing because that's
their situation; they're there every day,'' he said. ``It probably
would be tough for me to be in a position where I play half and the
other guy plays half _ coming up in this league. That's why I
didn't want to be in New York at the time when Mark Jackson was
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Strickland, the issue is not Ward and Childs but Marbury;
not whether Ward and Childs can carry the Knicks to a championship,
or even whether they are championship players. The issue for
Stickland is Marbury's intemperance and apparent disrespect for
fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young guys speak their mind, but we're men first,'' said
Strickland, who will be 33 in July. I respect everybody in this
league. I respect that fact that they got in this league, you have
to be good to be here. But for me it's an issue of how we relate to
each other, man to man.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were interesting, given Strickland's background and
sometimes turbulent tenure in the league. Strickland was raised in
the Bronx and played at Truman High. Unlike Marbury, he did not
grow up with a passion to play for the Knicks. When they drafted
him in 1988 in the first round he was annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go there because they had Mark,'' he said,
referring to Jackson, who was the NBA rookie of the year. ``Back
then, playing in New York wasn't that important to me. Now I'd love
to go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing behind Jackson led to a deteriorating relationship with
Coach Stu Jackson, which set in motion a series of image-related
blunders, Strickland feels, that still haunt him. The attitude
problem. The troublemaker. The malcontent.
</P>
<P>
   While Marbury is being treated with kid gloves now, Strickland
warned that there's a thin line between indulgence and
image-staining ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get the stain it's almost impossible to get it off,''
he said. ``It's like a tattoo. It'll always be there. You've got to
do a lot to get it fixed _ you just can't rub it off.''
</P>
<P>
   After being traded to San Antonio in 1990, Strickland flourished
and built a reputation as an outstanding penetrator and assist
guard. He signed as a free agent with Portland in 1992 and stayed
until 1996 after a flurry of highly publicized run-ins with P.J.
Carlesimo, then the Trail Blazers' coach.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland came to the Wizards in 1996. There was a DWI charge
before the 1997 season and a fight with a teammate, Tracy Murray.
Since those episodes, Strickland has been quiet off the court. He
is known as an independent thinker who speaks his mind and is an
exquisite, prototypical point guard.
</P>
<P>
   His message for Marbury is that there is a price to be paid for
speaking one's mind; there's a point when talent is not enough.
Strickland has never made an All-Star Game, even last year when he
was considered the best point guard in the league. The run-ins with
Carlesimo have apparently worked against him.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury's outspoken comments' about fellow players may come back
to haunt him. ``The thing with Stephon, as long he understands that
there are ramifications and consequences for things he says, then
he can do what he wants to do,'' Strickland said. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SAMARANCH WISE TO DUCK THE SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It all goes back to ``good old Jim McKay.'' That's
how Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., explains his personal interest in
the nasty little Olympic corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The way the senator remembers it, McKay was the intelligent and
humane voice of the Olympics, the man behind the great moments.
</P>
<P>
   McCain talks about Cassius Clay's gold medal in 1960, Kerri
Strug's last golden leap on a damaged ankle in 1996, the 1980 gold
medal in ice hockey, Bob Beamon's leap into space in 1968, and even
though McKay wasn't the voice on all of them, his is the voice
McCain hears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it is a bit of nostalgia,'' McCain said Wednesday.
``But these are our transcendent experiences in sport. They
represent the kids from the farm, the kids from the inner city, the
kid from Minnesota who competed in the luge. They made our bosoms
swell with pride.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who spent time as a prisoner of war in the Hanoi Hilton
can get away with using a phrase like that. The senator is not
naive. He understands the Olympic movement is not amateur sports
any more _ never was all that amateur, probably _ but the new
Olympic events of delegates taking presents, taking tuition, taking
medical care, taking flat-out cash bribes, well, maybe he can do a
little something about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have oversight over sports,'' said McCain, the chairman of
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, in a
private interview after a hearing into the Olympic mess Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International
Olympic Committee, did not see fit to attend the hearing, and the
senator could understand that. McCain is a busy man himself. He has
been one of the more vocal senators on the current conflict in
Kosovo and he is also running for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch travels all over the world at the drop of an
invitation, but he knew better than to meander into the hurly-burly
of elected American public officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as upset as it might have seemed,'' said McCain, who
mentioned Samaranch's absence, oh, more than a few times.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch left the dubious pleasure of being grilled to a vice
president of the IOC, Anita DeFrantz, who started off by taking the
position that she was speaking for herself, as one of two American
delegates. Instead, she was rather pointedly informed by McCain
that she was representing the entire IOC _ in His Excellency's
absence, you understand.
</P>
<P>
   The senator asked her a lot of questions and seemed a trifle
crabby when she did not spew out figures. He said later, ``I was a
little disappointed in her lack of specifications.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz, a lawyer and foundation president and former Olympic
medalist, explained later that she is just not that great with
numbers. She insisted that the IOC is dealing with the scandal
which has seen 22 of its 107 delegates either resign or be
implicated.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz explain that Samaranch was not present because
``English is his fourth language.'' Samaranch often conducts
business in English, but more to the point is that he needs his
cadre of assistants to clarify his responses in whatever language
is being used. He gives the impression of being fixated on
finishing his term, through the year 2000, and not giving in to the
growing chorus that he resign. McCain said he did not think it was
his business to discuss Samaranch's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   William Hybl, the president of United States Olympic Committee,
came to the hearing Wednesday, apologized, and pointed to reforms
already in place, and that pleased McCain. ``Bill Hybl said they
had been wrong,'' McCain said later. ``What else is there to
investigate?''
</P>
<P>
   What can McCain hope to accomplish with these hearings? He
downplayed talk of legislation to end tax-exempt status, and said
in private that the worst-case scenario would be ``they don't get
the sponsors, because the sponsors think it's a dirty business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hearing, McCain claimed that ``between 60 and 70
percent'' of the IOC's income comes from American sponsors, some of
whom are currently leery about committing funds until the scandal
runs its course.
</P>
<P>
   James Easton, the other American delegate, pointed out in the
hearing that the corporate sponsors are doing it as a business
investment rather than from the goodness of their hearts. The
senator seemed to agree with that. He wasn't rushing with threats.
``The biggest mistakes I've made came when I was in a hurry,'' he
said in his office. ``I say we should let the tea sit in the saucer
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice phrase. ``Good old Jim McKay'' could not have said it
better.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It has been fine weather for the tourists here in
Florida, with day after day of blue skies, but firefighters across
the state have learned to despise these perfect days.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, during an unusually parched, brittle dry season that
lasted into midsummer, walls of fire 40 feet high swept through
palmetto scrub and pine barrens and destroyed homes, forced entire
communities to evacuate and left vast areas of the state in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst year for wildfires in state history.
</P>
<P>
   This year, say experts on these wildfires and the weather
patterns that cause them, Florida is even drier and more at risk
than it was at this time last year, and already fires are forcing
evacuations and burning thousands of acres in south and central
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is there for a bad year,'' said Scott Goodrick,
a meteorologist with the Florida Division of Forestry in
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gov. Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency as
Florida's drought index _ an analysis of rainfall, humidity,
temperatures and other factors _ climbed above 600 in most areas
south of Orlando. A drought index of even 400 this time of year can
create a serious potential for fires.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before rains finally started in mid-July, ending the
state's burning season almost two months later than normal,
wildfires had consumed 500,000 acres and 150 homes. Much of that
damage was in Flagler, Seminole, Brevard and Volusia Counties on
the east side of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate highways were shut down by fires that burned on both
sides of the roads, and one of the state's biggest sporting events,
the Pepsi 400 stock car race in Daytona, had to be postponed as
smoke hung over the state's central and northeastern coasts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 firefighters, including thousands from other
states, battled for months to keep the fires from destroying even
more homes and businesses. Firefighters, who battled the largest,
most threatening fires in June and July, said over and over that it
was a miracle that no one died.
</P>
<P>
   An unseasonably wet winter and early spring pushed the burning
season into late spring and summer last year, and forecasters hoped
that the summer rains would make it short. But, weather conditions
delayed the afternoon thundershowers that are part of life here and
set the stage for the fires, meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rainy season begins in the last of May or early June, but
last year it was the middle of July,'' Goodrick said. ``We're drier
this year than we were at this point last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities from Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle to Miami have
reported no measurable rainfall for April, said meteorologists.
Firefighters have battled more than 1,900 wildfires this year,
almost three times as many as this time last year, said officials
with the State Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   Several fires have raged across Miami-Dade County and in
neighboring Broward County. Across the state, a wildfire near the
border of Lee and Charlotte counties shut down Interstate 75.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 36 fires burned 1,015 acres in Polk, Hillsboro and
Pinellas Counties, on the western coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we get a considerable amount of rain this weekend, it's
going to stay bad,'' said Chris Kintner, the public information
officer for the state Division of Forestry's Lakeland District,
which covers those three counties.
</P>
<P>
   Again, firefighters are hoping for an early rainy season, and it
seems that weather conditions are right for such relief, said Andy
Devanas, the state meteorologist with the Florida Division of
Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   In the rainy season, easterly air currents sweep up moisture
from the tropics and into the state as rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything that would mean that the rainy season
would not start on time,'' said Devanas, but he stressed that
conditions can always change.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's declaration of a state of emergency allows him to
mobilize the Florida National Guard, including military
helicopters, to fight fires.

CIVILIAN DEATHS HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR NATO PLANNERS

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As NATO ratchets up its air campaign over
Yugoslavia, relentlessly bombing Yugoslav armored forces in the
field, the inevitable is happening: Civilians are dying, some at
the hands of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   This unintended but inescapable consequence of modern warfare
has an inevitable effect on the military planners who pick the
targets and worry about holding together a 19-nation alliance. They
understand that public opinion, which has supported the air
campaign thus far, can shift as quickly as pictures of children's
dismembered corpses flash across the world's televisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Gulf War, a single mistake _ the bombing of a bunker
that sheltered hundreds of family members of Iraqi intelligence
officers _ prompted Gen. Colin Powell, as the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to rein in the air campaign over Baghdad. All
future targets in the city had to win Powell's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Gulf war, American commanders have placed a premium on
minimizing civilian casualties, the price they must pay to keep
multinational coalitions united. ``I trace the problem we're having
back to our inability to embrace the idea of war,'' said Maj. Gen.
Chuck Link, a retired Air Force commander.
</P>
<P>
   American military officers say it is unrealistic to expect the
officers picking targets and the pilots flying at hundreds of miles
an hour to perform flawlessly day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Faulty intelligence reports, for example, indicated that the
bunker in Baghdad was being used solely by military personnel. The
passenger train hit twice by NATO missiles on Monday was crossing a
bridge that was being used by the Yugoslav army, NATO officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The single-mindedness of that strike, pursued even after the
pilot knew he had mistakenly hit the train with his first missile,
reflects a ruthlessness that seems inconsistent with antiseptic
notions of an air war.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, NATO said its planners and fighter-bombers take
extreme caution to avoid what the military calls collateral damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's 100 percent assurance that what you're hitting
is a military target, you don't drop,'' Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a
top officer on the military's Joint Staff who has flown bombing
runs over Iraq and Bosnia, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident involving a column of refugees in Kosovo on
Wednesday illustrates the political and propaganda stakes. Pictures
taken at the scene undeniably establish that people were killed,
and Yugoslavia immediately blamed NATO. The alliance, in turn,
initially accused the Yugoslavs of fabricating the incident, and
then said it did not know what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wednesday, Belgrade's state-run television had been
quick to air gruesome pictures of bodies from cratered
neighborhoods in Pristina and of the blasted train caught on the
bridge in Grdelica, pictures that were rebroadcast around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two fundamental surprises so far in this war.
Few expected Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to defy the West
and defy an extended round of bombing, which has now reached cities
across his country.
</P>
<P>
   And the alliance has shown an unusual unanimity in continuing a
three-week bombardment that has retained widespread public support.
</P>
<P>
   That support stems largely from the strong reaction to the
expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo
in scenes that evoked the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that Belgrade is moving to drive a wedge among
the allies by offsetting the pictures of terrified refugees
streaming into Albania and Macedonia with images of civilian
casualties it attributes to NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials suspect that this is one reason Yugoslav
commanders park their tanks next to residential buildings and
travel in convoys near refugees.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO moves down its list of targets, fixed buildings standing
alone, far away from populated areas, have given way to equally
important targets set in urban areas, or, in the case of mobile
forces, mingled among or near civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes on these targets carry a much larger risk of hurting or
killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Pentagon and NATO officials have even mused that the
complete expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo would give the alliance
a big military advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be Serb troops primarily left, and we would be
able to attack them with more precision and more concentration,''
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said recently.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The comment underscores the frustration military planners and
commanders are feeling, and shows how difficult it is to wage a
controlled air war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf War, there were civilian casualties in Basra and
Baghdad. But the war against forces in the field was waged mainly
in the desert, far from urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav campaign is trickier, not only because of the foggy
weather and hilly terrain that thwart NATO's armada of radar-guided
bomb droppers, but also because the enemy is mixed in among the
very civilians NATO is trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Wald told reporters Wednesday that in Yugoslavia, NATO's rules
of engagement _ which govern when pilots can drop bombs and fire
weapons _ are ``as strict as I have seen in my 27 years'' of
service.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials here and in Europe said the attack on the
train and Wednesday's civilian deaths were unlikely to force NATO
to ease up on its accelerated air war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train incident is a good illustration of the limitations
of this so-called surgical-strike myth,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert
Osterthaler, a retired Air Force general and former Pentagon
official who dealt with Bosnia. ``As precise as our weapons are,
they have limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet political leaders know that under the right conditions,
the searing images of civilian dead can clash violently with
Americans' expectations of near flawless military campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the images have sufficient political influence on people
who make the decisions, it could change things,'' said Osterthaler.
``I don't think so, but it could.'' l

EDITORIAL: COLLECTING TAXES, EFFECTIVELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   As Americans file their tax returns this year, they are dealing
with a tax collection agency that has been significantly hobbled in
its ability to enforce the laws. Congressional budget cutters have
constrained the funding for the IRS in recent years while
simultaneously expanding its responsibilities into new areas, with
the result that fewer agents are available to conduct tax audits
and investigations. Unless Congress reverses this trend, compliance
with tax laws may begin to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a panel headed by former FBI Director William
Webster found that there are fewer criminal investigation agents
and that their effectiveness is compromised because many are
diverted into investigating drug dealers rather than enforcing the
tax laws. The good news in the report was the conclusion that there
are few abuses of taxpayers by those agents, and that improved
disciplinary procedures have dealt with the isolated abuses that
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a report from Syracuse University this week showed
that big corporations are half as likely to face audits as they
were a decade ago. Such companies often file very complicated tax
returns, and the possibility that no one will be checking on them
makes it tempting to use corporate tax shelters of questionable
legitimacy. The explosion of such shelters has led the Clinton
administration to seek legislation to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS needs to continue its efforts to become more
taxpayer-friendly and efficient, and it is to be hoped that the
agency's reorganization into functional groups, dealing with
different areas of tax law, will improve the agency's performance.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to receive a call from the IRS, but taxpayers who
abide by the law have an interest in an effective agency that can
assure that others also pay their fair share. Legislators who have
sought headlines by investigating IRS abuses should now make sure
that the agency has the resources it needs to do an effective job.

WAITS PLAYS OUT `VARIATIONS' ON A TWISTED PERSONA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``All life interests me,'' lisps Renfield, the
feverish asylum inmate Tom Waits plays in Francis Ford Coppola's
film ``Bram Stoker's Dracula.'' Then he eats a worm.
</P>
<P>
   That small scene might best capture the singer-actor's trademark
affinity for life's strange beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Waits has cultivated an image that's slightly out of whack, and
it has served him well. A cult phenomenon by the early 1980s, the
scat-singing raconteur recast himself as rock 'n' roll's ingenious
rag man with a masterful series of experimental yet deeply
traditional albums. He took swatches of immigrant music _
secondhand tangos, pub ballads, Weimar-era cabaret songs _ and made
them uniquely American, uniquely his own.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27 &LR; ,  &LR; Waits releases his 12th studio album. They came
in bunches in the '70s, but this is his first, not including
soundtracks, since 1992's Grammy-winning ``Bone Machine.''
Anticipation is high.
</P>
<P>
   His first release for the punk label Epitaph, ``Mule
Variations'' will be Waits' most public project in ages. In recent
years he has earned a reputation as a bit of a recluse, playing
only the odd benefit concert while working on plays and soundtracks
at his family's home in the Sonoma County countryside, north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning select live dates, as well as a concert taping for
VH1, which recently named him one of the ``Most Influential Artists
of All Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he buys it, exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is I do yet,'' Waits rasps on a recent
afternoon, hunching over a plate of sweet-and-sour chicken at an
old-fashioned, dark-paneled Chinatown restaurant. ``I guess if you
figure it out, you're kind of all done.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Waits is dressed in rail-yard garb _ scuffed black
boots, stiff jeans, a tight denim jacket buttoned up like a shirt.
When he takes off his ever-present battered fedora, his kinky hair
springs up like a wire garden. It's the same look he took onstage
at one of his first concerts in years, in Austin, Texas, at the
South by Southwest music conference last month.
</P>
<P>
   Waits is reluctant to do interviews and will do only a handful
to promote his album, but he is less socially uneasy than simply
preoccupied.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about Waits is certain: He's the sort of guy who will
answer a question with a question. Asked about his long stretch be
tween albums, he replies: ``Did you know a rat's teeth will grow
through the roof of its mouth into its brain if it doesn't keep
eating?''
</P>
<P>
   There's a clear lesson to be learned from that zoological
tidbit, Waits claims, suppressing a smile: ``Always keep snacks
around.'' He cranes his neck for an imaginary waiter: ``Could we
get a little something over here as a starter, really quick?'' he
hollers. ``My teeth are growing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Waits has lived in rural Sonoma County for several years with
his wife and longtime collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and their
three children. ``Mule Variations,'' he suggests, is his attempt to
get back to the land. ``You know, Robert Johnson started writing
about automobiles, and from then forward people stopped writing
about animals.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the title phrase of the slow-roasting blues ``Get Behind
the Mule'' comes from something the late bluesman Johnson's father
told his shiftless son: ``You gotta get behind the mule in the
morning and plow.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Waits lived out the gutter-trawling lifestyle of his
characters. ``There have been plenty of days when I've gotten up
too late in the morning and the mule is gone,'' he says. ``Or
somebody else is behind the mule, and I have to get behind the guy
who's behind the mule.''
</P>
<P>
   The album, recorded last year, features contributions by Bay
Area musicians including harmonica veteran Charlie Musselwhite,
brass and woodwind player Nik Phelps of Clubfoot Orchestra, drummer
Andrew Borger of the Beth Lisick Ordeal and guitarist Joe Gore and
multi-instrumentalist Ralph Carney of the Oranj Symphonette. Primus
serves as Waits' backing band on the rambunctious lead track, ``Big
in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Brennan, Waits says, who urged him back behind the mule.
They met almost 20 years ago, while working at Coppola's Zoetrope
Studios. Among her many songwriting credits with her husband,
Brennan co-wrote Waits' music for ``Bunny,'' the short animated
film that just won an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   In between words of devotion, Waits takes great joy in making up
a past for his wife: He claims she's been an elevator operator and
an anchorwoman, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was Yma Sumac's hairdresser for a very short period of
time.'' His slate-colored eyes twinkle devilishly. ``They had to
let her go _ too much overhead!''
</P>
<P>
   Such absurdities peppered Waits' performance in Austin, a
midnight show that was the festival's most coveted ticket. At one
point he offered Brennan's description of his music. ``My wife says
I have two kinds of songs _ grand weepers and grim reapers,'' he
said.

3 CIVIC GROUPS SEEK REVIEW OF POLICE COMMISSIONER'S TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three civic groups announced Wednesday that they had
filed a complaint against Police Commissioner Howard Safir with the
city Conflicts of Interest Board because of concerns that Safir
violated ethics rules by accepting a trip to the Academy Awards in
March from a corporate executive.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's trip to the Los Angeles gala with his wife as the guests
of a Revlon executive is already being reviewed, at the
commissioner's request, by the city's corporation counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the groups _ the Citizens Union, Common Cause and the New
York Public Interest Research Group _ asked for a second, more
formal inquiry by the conflicts board, which is responsible for
disciplining officials who violate the ethics code.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the groups said the review by Corporation
Counsel Michael Hess was insufficient because there was ``an
intrinsic conflict in asking a mayor's top lawyer to judge the
ethics of a mayor's appointees.''
</P>
<P>
   The city ethics code bars officials from accepting free trips or
gifts if there is an appearance that the benefit is being awarded
because of an official's position. Safir has said he was given the
Oscars trip because of his friendship with his host, Revlon
president George Fellows, not because of his police post.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, whose review is expected to take several weeks, rejected
any notion that his inquiry was not impartial. ``I am an
independent agent,'' he said, ``and I would not be doing this job
if I didn't have that independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir's reaction was muted. ``The Conflicts of Interest Board
will make their determination and whatever determination they make,
I will certainly abide by it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars trip, in which the commissioner traveled in a
corporate jet and enjoyed the amenities of a $700-a-night suite in
a Beverly Hills hotel, raised the first in a series of questions
that have surfaced about his ethics in recent weeks. He has also
faced scrutiny for using detectives to investigate an auto accident
involving his wife, Carol, and to guard his daughter's wedding.
Safir has said those decisions were founded on bona fide security
concerns because of threats made against him. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has repeatedly backed the commissioner's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible ethical lapses were cited by the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association on Tuesday when it issued a ``no
confidence'' vote on the commissioner and Wednesday, another group,
100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, issued a second ``no
confidence'' vote as they faulted Safir's response to a number of
incidents, including the February police shooting of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   As he met reporters Wednesday at Police Headquarters and faced a
new barrage of questions about the mounting criticism and
suggestions that he resign, Safir spoke as if he felt the circling
news media had already decided he is chum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the papers today,'' he said. ``My picture is on the
front of three papers. If you look at what the allegations are,
there's a lot of misinformation. There's a lot of things that are
not true. There's a lot of prejudgment before any facts are known
and a lot of misstatements.''
</P>
<P>
   Again Wednesday, Safir found himself facing questions about his
judgment as he defended a five-day trip he took to Florida last
November with his wife. The trip was partly paid for by the Palm
Beach County Law Enforcement Foundation, whose expenses are largely
underwritten by New York City business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Safir's itinerary for the November trip, in which he made a
breakfast speech before the foundation, indicated that all his
meals, first-class air fare and four nights in the Breakers, a
resort hotel, were being paid for by the foundation at a cost of
$1,672.
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioner's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, said that the
itinerary was mistaken and that the foundation had only paid for
two nights in the hotel. Ms. Mode said the commissioner had paid
for the third night of his stay and had stayed with a friend, whom
she would not identify, on his final night in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the reimbursed stay is important because, while
city regulations allow officials to make trips of this type, they
state that the length of the stay should be in keeping with the
business purpose involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there was any conflict of interest at all,''
Safir told reporters. ``This was a law enforcement trip for law
enforcement purposes to spread the word about programs we are
involved with in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the executives on the Palm Beach foundation's board is
directly involved in doing business with the Police Department,
although several are prominent New Yorkers who also have homes in
the Palm Beach area. Among the directors are James Robinson III,
the former head of American Express; Michael Tarnopol, a vice
chairman at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.; Larry Fisher, a real estate
developer, and Jeffrey Silverman, president of Ply Gem Industries,
who hosted a dinner party in Safir's honor at his Palm Beach home
after the commissioner's speech to the group.

 SAN FRANCISCO _ reapers,'' he said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Like all his records, ``Mule Variations'' is exquisitely paced.
The tender numbers _ the ones on which you can hear the piano
pedals creak (``Picture in a Frame,'' ``Take It With Me'') _ arrive
at regular intervals between Waits' rattletrap, anything-goes
stomps and his craggy falsetto hymns.
</P>
<P>
   That pacing goes all the way back to his days in a high school
band called the Systems, when aspiring musicians learned to play
``three fast ones and then one slow one,'' he says. ``That's still
the shape of most records.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be argued that Waits is revisiting those high school
years. Epitaph, the Los Angeles label that launched Rancid and the
Offspring, seems like a curious home for a man who turns 50 in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But Waits says the label has been a good fit thus far. ``The
fact is, if I told them I wanted to do Cuban gospel disco cartoon
music, they'd say, `When are you going into the studio?'''
</P>
<P>
   As proof of the company's unflagging support of its artists,
Waits cites the case of the die-hard punk band NOFX, which demanded
that one of its songs be removed from commercial radio stations.
``They got their song taken off the air,'' he marvels. ``I like
that. Most people are trying to get (set ital)on(end ital) the
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Once touted as another ``new Dylan'' along with a young Bruce
Springsteen, Waits has long since abandoned any desire to achieve
mass acceptance. ``I've heard myself on the radio once or twice,''
he says. ``It's kind of a thrill.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't always been such a skeptic. ``There was a time when I
was a kid and I had my little crystal set and my aerial on the
roof, listening to Wolfman Jack, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Johnny
Horton, Floyd Cramer. The radio was a pretty great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He won't find himself on today's airwaves, other than on some
adventurous college stations. But Waits has been blessed by the
admiration of a wild array of performers. He's made considerable
publishing money with the help of Rod Stewart, for instance, who
has covered at least three Waits songs, including ``Downtown
Train,'' a No. 3 hit single in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Eagles' fame, they covered ``Ol' 55,'' the
first song on Waits' first album. Springsteen did ``Jersey Girl'';
Holly Cole did a whole album of reinterpreted covers
(``Temptation''). Waits' ex-girlfriend Rickie Lee Jones has sung
his songs; so has his former touring partner Bette Midler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Cash did a song,'' he says. ``That felt particularly
validating.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also fended off dozens of requests from advertisers. Waits
is adamantly opposed to songs being sold as jingles, and he won a
$2.5 million court decision some years ago from Frito-Lay, which
had hired a sound-alike for an ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he battled his ex-manager, Herb Cohen, who sold
Screamin' Jay Hawkins' version of Waits' ``Heartattack and Vine''
for use in a Levi's commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising aside, Waits is philosophical about sending his
songs out into the world to be reinvented by other artists. ``You
might not like the version they do, but I may do the same thing
with somebody else's song _ bend it around, change it,'' he says.
``If the arm's sticking up, I'm gonna break it so it'll fit in the
box.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Like every record Waits has done since 1983's revelatory
``Swordfishtrombones,'' ``Mule Variations'' teems with weird
sounds: plunking xylophones, wheezing pump organs, makeshift
percussion instruments, roosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything finds its way onto the records in some form or
another,'' he says, ``if you allow yourself to be open to the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Always on alert, Waits can be excitable and high-strung. It's
one reason he all but dropped out after ``Bone Machine.'' By all
accounts, he needed a break from his own mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're constantly saying, `Notice me, notice me,' and then
`Leave me alone,''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's annoying living up to cult status, he
acknowledges, ``but sometimes it's annoying to be a taxidermist, or
a train conductor. And there are times when, hey, this is about the
coolest thing there could ever be to be.''

   APPLE POSTS STRONG RESULTS WHILE RIVALS ARE STRUGGLING
</P>
<P>
   Reporting its second-quarter earnings, a resurgent Apple
Computer again beat analysts' earnings estimates based on strong
demand for its iMac and G3 machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's renewed fortunes are all the more striking at a time
when the rest of the personal computer industry is mired in price
wars and slowing growth. Compaq Computer, the world's largest
personal computer maker, has warned that earnings for the current
quarter would fall far short of estimates, and Intel reported
slower than expected first-quarter sales.

   HEDGE FUNDS LAG BEHIND MARKETS
</P>
<P>
   Several hedge funds, the private partnerships that control more
than $200 billion for pension funds, endowments and very wealthy
individuals, have gotten off to a poor start this year. For
example, Jeff Vinik, the former manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund
who now oversees about $2.5 billion at Vinik Asset Management,
gained just 1 percent in the first quarter after strong returns of
45 percent last year and 77 percent in 1997.

<P>
   PROFIT RISES 64 PERCENT AT JP MORGAN
</P>
<P>
   JP Morgan, regularly cited as vulnerable to a takeover after
successive quarters of weak profits, posted a stellar 64 percent
increase in first-quarter earnings, kicking off a year in which
management says the bank will finally prove its mettle.
</P>
<P>
   DOW RISES AS INVESTORS SHIFT FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders took profits in some recently high-flying sectors
and moved into some neglected basic industries. The Dow Jones
industrial average edged up 16.65 points, to 10,411.66, its third
straight record, but the Nasdaq plunged 76.22 points, or nearly 3
percent, to 2,507.28, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index
fell 21.38 points, to 1,328.44.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of Treasury securities drifted lower as weakness in the
dollar, stock gains and a big supply of higher-yielding corporate
debt securities weighed on the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert V. Cox, a small-town Pennsylvania newspaper reporter who
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for writing about the manhunt for a
sniper, died on Monday at at a health care center in Chambersburg,
Pa. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from heart bypass surgery, said Jim
Hook, a reporter at The Public Opinion, the 22,000-circulation
Chambersburg newspaper where Cox worked from after graduating from
the local high school until 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who lived in Fayetteville, Pa., won the Pulitzer for
general spot news reporting. He later wrote two books, ``Deadly
Pursuit'' (Stockpole Books, 1977) and ``Missing Person'' (Stockpole
Books, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Pulitzer, Cox made an unsuccessful run for the
state House of Representatives. In 1969, he joined another small
newspaper, The Record Herald of Waynesboro, Pa., from which he
retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Martha Rife; five daughters, Michele
Reed, Linda Jones and Kathleen Statler, all of Chambersburg,
Christine Miller of Philadelphia, and Julia R. Plank, of Orrtanna,
Pa.; a son, Robert M., of Waynesboro, Pa.; four sisters, Helen
Weaver and Delores Hawk, both of Chambersburg, Miriam Sollenberger
of Nashua, N.H., and Sandra Burkhart of Robesonia, Pa.; 13
grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.

U.S. BLOCKS HOSTILE BID FOR SHIPBUILDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La. )   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that the potential savings did not justify the deal, the
Defense Department Wednesday rejected an unsolicited $1.4 billion
offer by the General Dynamics Corp. for Newport News Shipbuilding
Inc. Within minutes of the Pentagon's announcement, General
Dynamics withdrew its offer.
</P>
<P>
   These twin announcements, not unexpected, end General Dynamic's
effort to create a shipbuilding giant that would have controlled
all of the nation's nuclear warship construction and four of the
nation's six military shipyards. Had General Dynamics' hostile bid
succeeded, it would have also brought an end to a friendly $519
million takeover by Newport News of Avondale Industries of New
Orleans, a smaller Navy ship supplier. The Pentagon has already
approved that deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Defense Department said that ``the savings
projected by General Dynamics did not now outweigh potential
competitive disadvantages from the proposed merger.'' The Pentagon
specifically said that with only one supplier of nuclear
submarines, ``there would be a reduction in the likelihood of
future competition.'' Similarly, the proposed merger would have put
more than 75 percent of all military shipyard engineering talent
and more than 95 percent of Navy research and development
investments in one company, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that a General Dynamics-Newport News
combination would have brought some savings, the secretary of
defense, William S. Cohen, said the savings were ``not now so great
as to override the management and competitive challenge we could
face from the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the withdrawal of his company's bid, Nicholas D.
Chabraja, General Dynamic's chief executive, called the Pentagon's
decision ``disappointing.'' Still, Chabraja said, ``We respect it
and have withdrawn our offer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``General Dynamics believes that its proposed acquisition of
Newport News Shipbuilding would have meant significant savings for
the U.S. Navy, enhanced value for the shareholders of both
companies, and still preserved jobs,'' he added. ``We will pursue
other acquisition opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Newport News, William P. Fricks, said
that with the collapse of the General Dynamics-Newport News deal,
his company would proceed with the Avondale takeover, a deal that
``we continue to believe makes sound strategic and financial
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics shares rose $2.50 each, to $69.5625, while
Newport News fell 25 cents, to $27.75; Avondale Industries rose
68.75 cents, to $31.9375.
</P>
<P>
   When General Dynamics announced its hostile bid last February,
it was seen as a bold stroke by both Wall Street and the military
industry. But it was given little chance of success because it flew
in the face of evolving Pentagon policy against larger mergers and
because it complicated the existing friendly deal between Newport
News and Avondale. It was seen as a last-ditch effort by General
Dynamics to thwart a friendly merger that threatened to challenge
its Naval shipbuilding dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Dynamics gave it a good college try,'' said Howard
Rubel, military industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.. ``It was
an innovative deal. General Dynamics is well positioned to continue
its expansion strategy. There will be other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some analysts began speculating that General Dynamics
might consider buying an electronics company. It recently lost in a
bid to acquire United Defense Limited Partnership, which makes
tanks. Among General Dynamic's existing product lines are nuclear
submarines, destroyers and auxiliary ships for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter J. Arment, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I.,
added that General Dynamics knew from the outset that it ``had a
50-50 shot at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hostile attempt,'' he added, ``and even if they won,
they would be in command and control of six major shipyards and
they obviously knew that the Pentagon might not allow that going
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal ran into considerable political opposition,
with the Virginia congressional delegation opposing the Newport
News takeover. Sen. John W. Warner, a Republican and chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, which helps determine Pentagon
spending, was opposed to the deal at a time when the Pentagon needs
the Senate committee's support for more military spending because
of the warfare in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Warner said that ``the greatest concern to me was,
and is, the concentration, in a single corporation, of well over
one-half of the Navy's shipbuilding account. This would not be in
the long-term national security interests of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a
research group in Arlington, Va., said: ``What this outcome says is
that General Dynamics will be looking outside of its existing areas
for future defense business acquisitions. It appears that
shipbuilding acquisitions are now foreclosed to it, which would
drive it into other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ginsberg, an analyst with Fourteen Research in New York,
said: ``You want to make sure, with the Yugoslavia conflict, that
the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee is on your side.
And, if the merger went through, there would be one key shipyard,
and the government would not tolerate that.'' &QL;

FORGED PAPERS OF KENNEDY AND NIXON CITED IN TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man accused of forging papers in the handwriting of
John F. Kennedy and selling them for millions of dollars to
unsuspecting investors also suggested to a business partner that he
wanted to sell a trove of secret papers of Richard M. Nixon, the
government charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by a federal prosecutor came in the opening
statements of the trial of Lawrence X. Cusack 3rd in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan. Cusack, a former paralegal, has been charged
with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud. He is accused of selling the
forged Kennedy papers to more than 100 investors for $7 million,
keeping about $5 million for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The papers were entirely phony,'' the prosecutor, Paul A.
Engelmayer, told the jury. ``They had been phonied up, forged,
manufactured by Lawrence Cusack himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelmayer offered no elaboration on Cusack's contention that he
had Nixon papers and even some tapes, except to suggest they were
fraudulent. But he said that the prospect of helping Cusack sell
them someday had two of Cusack's partners, who did not know the
documents were fraudulent, ``salivating.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial has been widely anticipated because of the publicity
surrounding the documents when they first surfaced two years ago
and were to be the subject of a television documentary and a book.
Some of the papers appeared to confirm a long-rumored affair by
Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe, and the payment of hush money for her
silence about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Cusack appeared relaxed in court as he sat by his
lawyer at the defense table, even smiling as Engelmayer pointed at
him for the jury, naming him as the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack has maintained that he found the papers in the files of
his late father, a prominent lawyer in New York, that they were
genuine and that he sold them in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Robert F. Katzberg, signaled to the jury that his
defense strategy would not be to try to prove that the papers were
genuine _ indeed, he conceded there may be problems with their
authenticity _ but to show that Cusack and his two partners had
every reason to believe that the documents they were selling were
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I expect that the government is going to be able to show in
various ways that there are problems with these documents?''
Katzberg told the jury. ``You bet I do. Can they raise questions
about these documents? Yes. But as you will learn during the course
of this trial, even if every single one of those documents is
bogus, that does not automatically mean that a crime was committed
by the people who sold them.''

NEW N.J. EDUCATION CHIEF PROPOSES HIGHER BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The new state education commissioner Wednesday
proposed a budget of $5.4 billion for the 1999-2000 school year,
$380 million more than the current year, in the state that already
has the highest per pupil spending rate in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, David Hespe, who started his duties last week,
told the Assembly Appropriations Committee that the proposed
education budget would be almost a third of the state's total
budget. ``It's a staggering sum,'' he said, ``but it is an
investment in our children and in our future.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey spends 11 percent more than Connecticut, the state
with the second-highest rate, Hespe said, and 20 percent more than
New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   But as he was addressing the committee inside the Statehouse,
officials from the state's 28 poorest districts, which were the
subject of a lawsuit challenging the state's school finance laws,
held a rally outside the building to protest that the state is not
spending enough on them despite a court order last year.
</P>
<P>
   At the rally, Assemblyman Craig Stanley of Irvington said the 28
districts have been ``victims of an administration that has shown
either the lack of compassion or the lack of capacity to implement
the Abbott decision,'' a reference to the decision last year in the
case, Abbott vs. Burke.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the State Supreme Court ordered the state to
spend millions of dollars on the 28 districts, which range from
cities like Newark to rural communities like Phillipsburg, to
equalize spending with wealthier districts. This is the first year
the state has drawn up an education budget that includes the
additional funds for the Abbott districts, as they are called, and
many officials said the districts have been slighted by the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is asking for a blank check,'' Stanley, a rally
organizer, said. ``Don't get me wrong. What we are asking for is
education funding fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the 28 districts complained that in many cases,
the Department of Education has turned down their requests for
additional funds for programs they believed were mandated by the
court ruling, like preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and
whole-school programs designed to revamp the whole school, from
curriculum to parent involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those proposals to this day have been subjected to an
arbitrary rejection by the Department of Education solely on the
basis, we would contend, that they asked for more funding,'' said
David Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center,
which undertook the lawsuit on behalf of the 28 districts.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra said that in its ruling, the court held that it was up
to the schools and the districts to create programs to improve
education and then present specific proposals to the Education
Department for those programs. Further, he said, the court ruled
that if the districts demonstrated a need for additional funds for
those programs, the education commissioner was to provide it.
Sciarra said the commissioner had violated the court order by
rejecting districts' plans.
</P>
<P>
   But at the committee hearing, Hespe said that it was the
department's job to review those requests, and that it had rejected
proposals that did not include enough justification for extra
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we are in compliance,'' he said. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has already approved plans for preschool programs in
21 of the 28 districts, he said, and whole-school programs have
already been started in 72 schools this year, and 100 more are
expected to be added in the next school year.
</P>
<P>
   The Abbott districts have requested funds in the tens of
millions of dollars above what they were already provided, he said,
and the department expects to make a decision on those requests
within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hespe's first appearance before the committee, and
committee members peppered him with questions.
</P>
<P>
   They asked him how schools were doing in adopting the state's
core curriculum requirements, the blueprint of minimum educational
standards for students at all levels. They wanted to know about the
process for deciding what will be built with the
multibillion-dollar school construction program proposed by Gov.
Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe said he was considering ways to reduce the number of
categories of state aid, and he pledged to communicate with
legislators and local school officials before making any policy
decisions. Critics of Klagholz, his predecessor, had said he failed
to do so.

BLAKE BACK, O'DONNELL OUT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings' sin bin had a revolving door
Wednesday, with defenseman Rob Blake escaping exile and defenseman
Sean O'Donnell preparing to serve his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Blake was preparing to return to the lineup tonight at home
against the Mighty Ducks after serving two games for cross checking
San Jose's Alexander Korolyuk. But the NHL announced that O'Donnell
will miss the next two games for cross checking Nashville's Cliff
Ronning in the head and spearing Sergei Krivokrasov in the lower
body late in Monday night's victory over the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand where (NHL discipline czar Colin Campbell) is
coming from,'' said O'Donnell, who will lose $10,416.66 of his
$1,000,000 salary. ``They're trying to crack down on anything above
the shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell will be eligible to return to the lineup Sunday
afternoon when the Kings (30-44-5) conclude their disappointing
season against the St. Louis Blues in what almost certainly will be
the final regular-season game at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I get to play one more game,'' O'Donnell said.
``We're going to have a long enough vacation as it is. I didn't
need an extra week off.''
</P>
<P>
   LEACH SELECTED (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   Kings assistant coach Jay Leach will be an assistant for the
U.S. team at next month's World Championships in Oslo, Norway.
Leach was an assistant two years ago when the U.S. team reached the
medal round, and he also was an assistant for the U.S. when it won
a silver medal at the 1991 Canada Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about it,'' Leach said. ``I'd much rather have our
team in the playoffs. But this is a chance to go over and represent
your country. It's a coaching challenge. You have to get 23 guys
and bring them together quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Terry Murray will be the head coach of the U.S. team
and Nashville's David Poile is the general manager. Asked if his
uncertain job status with the Kings might pose a distraction while
he's overseas, Leach said, ``I can't control that. I've been in
this business 15 years. I've never been without a coaching job.
I'll be somewhere next year. I'd like to remain with (the Kings),
but whatever happens, I can't control it.''
</P>
<P>
   RETURN OF WAYNE? (SUBHED)
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a possibility the New York Rangers' Wayne
Gretzky would take a job in the Kings' organization if he retires
after this season, General Manager Dave Taylor said, ``It's a
little premature to even talk about it. If Wayne announces his
retirement, we'd certainly be open to discussing something with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky reportedly is considering retiring after the Rangers
complete their season Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE PUCKS (subhed)
</P>
<P>
   The Kings are expected to send goalie Manny Legace to the Long
Beach Ice Dogs today and recall Ryan Bach. Coach Larry Robinson
said he didn't know if he would play Bach in one of the final
games. Jamie Storr will miss the remaining games with an ankle
injury. ... Blake was ill while serving his suspension, an
infection covering his body with a rash. He said he expects to play
tonight.

AN UNKNOWN ACTOR BATTLES THE SCREEN ACTORS GUILD IN A BITTER RUNOFF
ELECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Riding around Manhattan on her bicycle, Kelly Craig
resembles a lot of other young actresses in New York, with her
klieg-light smile, her willowy figure and her cheerful willingness
to live on a shoestring while working to make it big.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Ms. Craig has discovered some qualities she did
not know she had: leadership ability, organization skills and plain
old grit. Plus, she now has a good lawyer. That is because Ms.
Craig is the challenger in a bitter runoff election for a seat on
the New York board of the Screen Actors Guild, which represents
actors in the city who appear on film, including a lot of
television shows and commercials. Ballots are now arriving in the
mailboxes of 24,000 New York guild members, who have until May 3 to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Film work is probably the fastest-growing industry in New York
in terms of jobs, according to state figures, and spent more than
$2.5 billion in the city last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it may seem odd that the actors union is undergoing a sort
of civil war over economic issues. The incumbent leaders say that
concessions the union has made to producers in recent years have
helped lure the film industry back to New York City, which was
shunned by Hollywood in the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``By giving a little, we have gained a lot,'' said Jordan
Derwin, the longtime board member who is running against Ms. Craig.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Craig and her supporters argue that those concessions
came at the expense of the members who struggle the most. They
complain that the union is still fighting the last battle, rather
than working on new challenges like improving payments for actors'
work that appears on cable television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of ways to describe this election, including as
a contest between youth and energy on the one hand, and age and
experience on the other. Ms. Craig is in her 20s, (like many
actors, she's coy about her age) and a neophyte in union politics;
Derwin is a lawyer turned actor who has been serving on the union's
board for more than 16 years (and who also declines to say how old
he is).
</P>
<P>
   Neither has ever had a major role in a blockbuster, but then,
few people who serve on the board are household names. Probably the
most famous is Sam Waterston, who stars on NBC's ``Law and Order,''
which is shot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is not enough steady work here, Waterston said, but he
stays because ``the possibility of working regularly in film and
television while at the same time continuing in the theater is the
closest thing to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But well-to-do actors like Waterston are a rarity, and not just
on the guild's board. On any given day, according to Jayne Wallace,
a union spokeswoman, 85 percent of the membership is not working.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 of the 25,300 New York members in 1997 made more than
$100,000 from guild-covered work in 1997, according to the union's
data. Meanwhile, more than 6,000 made less than $1,000, and about
8,300 made nothing from screen acting.
</P>
<P>
   Even excluding those who made no money, about 67 percent of the
17,000 working members did not make the $7,500 they need to qualify
for health insurance under the union plan. Trying to help these
people is one of Ms. Craig's priorities, she said; she would like
the union to explore creating a ``health fund bank'' to which
members could make voluntary contributions that could keep their
insurance going if they do not earn the annual minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Does she qualify for health insurance? ``I think I'll make it
this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She takes every acting-related job she can get, including stunt
work, dancing and serving as a stand-in. She models clothes and
appears in filmed commercials (New York Lotto) and print
advertisements. She acts in and produces plays in a small theater
on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Craig and Derwin describe themselves as principal
actors _ meaning those who speak lines _ who sometimes do
background work to survive. Such extras in and around New York get
paid $102 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of extras is highly emotional among union members, as
became clear during the original election last fall, when eight
independents ran. The winners were mostly incumbents, but one
challenger, Avis Boone, won; Ms. Craig and Derwin tied.
</P>
<P>
   During that campaign, fliers for the union-backed group branded
the independents as extras, who are the lowest in the acting caste
system. But it is not just snobbery that causes friction. Midrange
performers have seen their pay squeezed in the last few years, as
producers try to cut costs while paying stars millions of dollars.
They are outnumbered by the extras, and they worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like me, most years I break $50,000, but I haven't yet
gotten above $100,000,'' said Michael Arkin, who has played a
doorman on ``Law and Order'' and was a state trooper in the recent
movie ``Rounders.'' ``We're the bread and butter of the union. The
demands that some people in the background community are making,
they might be good, but they cost money.''
</P>
<P>
   Derwin is head of the committee that advises the guild on extra
performers, and he concedes that he has irked some colleagues by,
for example, working on a contract to equalize the pay that extras
get across the country (New Yorkers still get more than
Californians, but the rates will be the same in a couple of years).
He said producers had been avoiding New York because the extras
earned more here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Craig is careful not to criticize Derwin personally, but
some dissidents complain about his travel expenses, which topped
$26,000 over two years, according to documents the union files with
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Scarola, a dissident board member, blames Derwin for the
loss of thousands of jobs because, she says, he has approved
contracts that let producers hire fewer guild members or at reduced
wages, and approved contract waivers for producers who pleaded
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Derwin has the support of the union's staff; he conducted a
telephone interview from the guild office in Times Square. Ms.
Craig had to take the union to court, after it refused for three
months to set a date for the runoff election _ and continued to let
Derwin serve on the board. The union said at first that it wanted
to wait until after members had voted on a proposed merger with
another union, and then said it wanted to wait until the Federal
Labor Department ruled on challenges to the election.
</P>
<P>
   But last month a federal judge ruled that it was ``more than
probable'' that the union ``has not acted in good faith'' and
ordered the election be held no later than Monday, which is when
the ballots were mailed.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Z. Schwartz, a prominent labor lawyer who represented Ms.
Craig _ she says she may have to pay him by doing his office filing
_ said that Ms. Craig's case is typical. . ``I work a lot with
insurgent groups,'' he said, ``and nobody achieves any level of
success unless there is economic unhappiness among the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Craig and Derwin say they will continue to be active in
the union, even if they lose. Ms. Craig said she will continue to
try for her dream role in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lawyer or district attorney part would be right up my
alley,'' she said. ``Strong women roles, not victims.''

No stopwatch can record what Nguyen brings to a team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
On the surface, it seems nothing about Dat Nguyen is ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   He rode in his mother's womb on the boat ride that began a
journey from war-torn Vietnam to the United States, and 23{ years
later he is a college football All-American.
</P>
<P>
   And those are merely the bookends to his life thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Include his transformation from a somewhat rowdy preteen to a
model citizen and his rise from an unknown to an icon at Texas A&AMP;M,
and you recognize his is far from a typical tale.
</P>
<P>
   But as he prepares to add the next chapter to his story, Nguyen
finds himself placed in an unusual category _ ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   How ordinary?
</P>
<P>
   A dime a dozen, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strikes, free agency and inflation, that remains the
going rate in the NFL for linebacker wannabes who stand less than
6-foot tall, weigh less than 240 pounds and cannot finish a 40-yard
sprint in under 4.6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But if you listen to those who know him, if you latch on to Dat
Nguyen, you have yourself a bona fide football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to explain, but you don't have to know much about
football to know Dat is a very good football player,'' Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said. ``He has instincts that you can't teach. He
may not be as big or as fast on paper as you would like in a search
for the perfect linebacker, but he has never been too small or too
slow to get the job done. In fact, he gets the job done better than
most bigger and faster people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one guy you don't have to worry about when you put
together your game plan. You know he will take care of his
responsibilities; size and speed don't matter to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But it matters to others, including the non-licensed scientists
who help teams formulate NFL draft plans. When the NFL draft gets
under way Saturday, the bigger and faster linebackers are sure to
go ahead of Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   It is a numbers game, and many of Nguyen's numbers are not
impressive numbers like 5-11, 234 pounds and a best of 4.58 seconds
in the 40.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers mean little to Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of football is more of what happens while you're out
there playing,'' he said. ``I've seen throughout my career, guys
who run 4.4 (seconds in the 40-yard dash) but on the field runs
5-flat, and guys that run 5-flat go on the field and play 4.4. A
lot of people have football speed. You can have natural speed, but
no football speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot to do with instincts and just desire and effort.
I think that's the category I fit in. I am fortunate to have the
instincts that I have. Also, it's because the coaching staff gave
me great tendencies (to look for) during the week. My preparation
during the week gave me a good understanding of what the opponents
wanted to do, so when I went out there it was all reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes that for every action there is an equal and opposite
reaction. Not with Nguyen. His reaction may have been opposite to
an offense's action, but it was not equal. He usually got the
better of the deal because he got there first.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M's all-time leading tackler believes there is one way
for a player of his speed to get to a spot before those who are
faster _ preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to be over-prepared than under-prepared,'' Nguyen
said. ``If you are willing to put the extra time in to prepare
yourself and see what the opponent likes to do in different
situations, you'll end up being successful because you're a step
ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   When NFL scouts evaluate this year's linebacker pool, Nguyen is
not a step ahead of the class. He may even be a step behind. He is
rated by many, including former Dallas Cowboys player personnel
director Gil Brandt, to be about the 12th-best linebacker
available. Brandt rates A&AMP;M's Warrick Holdman as the sixth-best
linebacker eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Nguyen, tape measures, stopwatches and the
numbers they show are not the only criteria that go into measuring
football ability.
</P>
<P>
   It is the other components that make Nguyen something other than
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz, who has coached
successful NFL linebackers like Keena Turner, Chad Brown and Ted
Johnson, said what Nguyen brings to the table probably means more
than the numbers he posts in workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great competitor with great heart and the biggest
thing is he made plays,'' Hankwitz said. ``He was always so
productive. He was always around the football and to me that's the
key to being a football player _ making plays. Not only did he make
plays, he made big plays. What made him so unique is he did it so
consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen was the first Aggie to lead the team in tackles four
consecutive seasons, broke the Texas A&AMP;M career tackles mark by
more than 50 stops and averaged 10.7 tackles a game, bumping that
up by two extra stops a contest against Top 25 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed the Lombardi Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award and a long
list of Defensive Player of the Year honors this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can duplicate what he did in college on the next
level is now the question.
</P>
<P>
   If Nguyen were an NFL general manager, he would have no
reservations about taking the guy Slocum once described as ``the
little linebacker with the heart of a giant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give myself a shot,'' Nguyen said. ``I would take me
because you know you're getting a guy who's going to come out and
give you 110 percent every play. You know he's not going to give
you any trouble off the field. He's going to be one of those
players that helps you, helps the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have an opportunity to understand the system, I can play
it. I know it's going to be different, I know it's another level
and I know all the players there are great players. If not, they
wouldn't be there. So, it's going to be a challenge for me to go up
there and see where I stand. But I love the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you want is an opportunity to measure yourself. If you go
out there and don't do well you won't play, you don't deserve to
play. But you need the opportunity first.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a request that does not seem out of the ordinary.
Especially from a guy who has proven to be rather extraordinary to
this point.

LIVE-IN BABY SITTER, 54, WINS $197 MILLION LOTTERY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to attach five grafs at end about the Boston cabdriver who
was rumored to be the lottery winner. No other changes.) (mk) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was last Wednesday that Chris Gabrieli, a venture
capitalist, discovered that his live-in baby sitter was a
multimillionaire like him.
</P>
<P>
   The baby sitter, a 54-year-old Chilean immigrant named Maria
Grasso, told Gabrieli's wife, Hilary, who then told him, that she
had won the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the largest lottery
prize ever won by one person in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Gabrielis were among the few people who knew her secret
until Wednesday when, after a week of rumor and speculation about
who had bought the winning ticket at the Star supermarket in the
Fenway neighborhood last week, Mrs. Grasso, a modest, soft-spoken
mother of two, claimed her winnings at Massachusetts Lottery
headquarters in Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very down-to-earth person,'' Mrs. Grasso said at a news
conference, with the Gabrielis standing nearby, beaming. ``I work
hard in my entire life. I'm one of six children, and so I always
try to be low, down-key, and I'm going to continue that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso, who said she was an occasional lottery player,
chose an immediate lump sum payment of $104 million, instead of 26
annual payments that would have totaled $197 million, and collected
a check Wednesday for $70,244,814.02 after taxes. It was the
nation's second-largest jackpot. The largest, a $295 million
Powerball jackpot last July, was won by a group of 13 machinists in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso did not give details about her plans, other than to
say she would like to keep helping children, and she declined to
give any interviews beyond the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman, Raymond Howell, said Mrs. Grasso came to the United
States in 1971 and found work as a live-in baby sitter in New York
City. She earned a high school equivalency degree, attended
LaGuardia Community College and the College of Staten Island, both
in New York, and eventually got a job as a teaching assistant in
special education classes in the city's public schools. She also
worked part time for United Cerebral Palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Grasso, who is divorced, has two children, both in college.
She moved to Boston in 1996 and went to work for the Gabrielis.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli had only praise for the woman who became his former
employee last Thursday with what was apparently some reluctance on
her part. ``She's a very warm and caring person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's extremely family-oriented,'' Gabrieli said. ``She has
two children she's very proud of. She's got a large family in
Chile. When I talked to her, she said, `How can I make this a
blessing for them?'''
</P>
<P>
   Gabrieli said Mrs. Grasso was in her apartment in his home in
the Beacon Hill neighborhood watching the 11 p.m. news last Tuesday
when she saw the winning number flash across her television screen.
``It matched,'' Gabrieli said. ``She couldn't believe it could be
true. She confirmed it on the second go-round at 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a sleepless night, and the first thing in the morning,
she called up to our room on the intercom.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gabrieli already on his way to a meeting, Mrs. Grasso spoke
to Mrs. Gabrieli, a tax lawyer who is at home, raising the couple's
four children, ages 1 through 5. ``My wife's first thought was:
`Are you sure?'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gabrieli congratulated Mrs. Grasso, put her in touch with a
lawyer and then telephoned her husband in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same reaction as my wife: `Are you sure, darling?'''
Gabrieli said.
</P>
<P>
   The new multimillionaire, meanwhile, insisted on putting in a
full workday. ``She actually worked Thursday as well,'' Gabrieli
said. ``Her first reaction was, `I'll work until you get a
replacement.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `I think this is going to be something that will
take all your psychic time. We'll muddle through.''' And so on
Thursday night, Mrs. Grasso moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement put to rest persistent reports that the
lottery winner was a Boston cabdriver, Patrick Okusanya.
</P>
<P>
   A distraught Okusanya insisted he was not the winner, but even
his friends and family did not believe him, said John Ricci, a
lawyer Okusanya retained last Friday to help him deal with the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor seems to have begun with a group of cabdrivers, who
said Okusanya was the winner. Ricci said he was working free for
Okusanya, who drives his cab 60 to 70 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Okusanya was working Wednesday, and could not be reached for
comment. Ricci said Okusanya had stopped by his office to say he
was happy for Mrs. Grasso, and glad to be out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   All Okusanya wanted was a coat hanger, his lawyer said. The

 &HT;    Bill tries to ban execution of retarded criminals
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The emotional debate over Texas' frequent use of
the death penalty rekindled Wednesday before a Senate Committee, as
opponents and supporters squared off over a bill to ban executions
of mentally retarded criminals.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said his bill was designed
to spare convicts who ``don't have the mental capacity, the
cognitive ability, to understand what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not execute children in Texas, and I don't think we
ought to execute people who have the mental capacity of a child,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-hour hearing, numerous witnesses supported the
measure _ from mental health advocates to attorneys who have
represented mentally retarded criminals.
</P>
<P>
   William Allison, a court-appointed attorney, testified how his
client on death row _ a man who he said has the mental age of 7 _
seems unaware that he was found guilty of strangling an 8-year-old
San Marcos girl, Bertha Martinez, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never, ever even talked to me about his trial,'' Allison
said of Doil Edward Lane. ``His trial does not register with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison showed lawmakers several Crayola drawings Lane had sent
him, child-like drawings of houses and such.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the capacity to be remorseful.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Whittington, a former member of the Texas prison system's
governing board, was among those urging passage of the bill. ``This
state should set a higher moral course for justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors were just as adamant in opposing the bill. They
argued that passage of the bill could undermine Texas' death
penalty statute.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, they said, juries can review the specifics of
each case and determine whether a criminal should be executed.
Courts can also review whether they are competent for trial and
whether they are criminally insane.
</P>
<P>
   But under Ellis' proposal, they said, anyone who was mentally
retarded would be spared automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should go case by case. If you don't look at individuals,
you don't do justice,'' said Walker County Criminal District
Attorney David Weeks of Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   Brazos County District Attorney Bill Turner said he opposed the
bill because it ``would lump a group of human beings together and
says that because they are morally irresponsible they should not be
held liable for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says if you can't spell murder, if you don't know where the
state of Louisiana is, then you get a break on a capital murder
case,'' he said. ``Murder is not an intelligence exercise. Just
because you are intellectually challenged doesn't mean you can't
know the difference between right and wrong.''

JAZZ, CLIPPERS IN REMATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, it's personal.
</P>
<P>
   The last time, it was technical.
</P>
<P>
   That would be two technical fouls, and you're a goner. It's a
TKO, NBA-style.
</P>
<P>
   The date was March 27. The place was The Pond of Anaheim,
Pond-for-Pond the toughest arena in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   In the coffin corner was Utah Jazz power forward Karl Malone, at
6-foot-9 and 260 dangerous-looking pounds, with a reach that
usually extends to a referee's soul.
</P>
<P>
   In the hot corner, we had Clipper Maurice Taylor, also 6-9 and
260, with a reach he attempted to put around Malone's neck.
</P>
<P>
   To book this showdown, the last of several unsavory Malone elbow
maneuvers turned the typically riled-mannered Taylor into a
revved-up stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Order had to be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was issued his second (and disqualifying) technical foul
of the evening, while Taylor painted the canvas with colorful
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   After Malone was banished, the mighty Jazz were unable to alter
their dire predicament and finished the night with a 103-77 loss to
the Clippers. It was the Clips' third victory in 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, a rematch is scheduled for the Sports Arena. Utah is
29-8, having conquered the Kings while working OT on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, whose team whacked New Jersey that night in achieving
its first back-to-back this season, was asked if the return of
Malone will inspire a heightened sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom of slick verbal counter-punching Taylor said,
``Naw.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, then. No added motivation. Well, does he expect Malone to
arrive in a nasty, revenge-seeking mood?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Taylor said following Wednesday's workout at the
Sports Arena. ``It wouldn't be any fun if he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun? With a respectful nod to Ralph Lawler, voice of the
Clippers, fight and basketball fans may wish to shout ``Bingo!''
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 Footloose forward
</P>
<P>
   cp,8,8.2 In case you haven't noticed, Taylor has averaged eight
rebounds per game in the Clippers last four engagements. His season
average is five.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement is easy to trace: Foot work.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely, Taylor - whose Achilles-tendon problems discouraged
animated board work - visited his friendly chiropractor. The
chiropractor fixed him right up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got my feet aligned,'' Taylor said. ``I got my toes cracked,
my ankles. I'm moving a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   sub UF5 `Pike' peaking
</P>
<P>
   Guard Eric Piatkowski's 7-of-12 shooting performance in
Tuesday's victory over New Jersey was worth a few huzzahs, but his
teammates were more impressed with his two-handed dunk on a
first-quarter baseline drive.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chris Ford has been urging `Pike' to attack the basket
with more frequency, so the fifth-year Clipper obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I get a play called for me, I do my best to take
advantage of it,'' Piatkowski said. ``I was happy out there. With
all the losing we'd gone through, it starts to get embarrassing
after a while.''

 &HT;    Braves pound Byrd, Phillies
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Phillies were looking a lot more like, well, the
Phillies on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves needed four games to win two from the Phillies in the
season-opening series in Atlanta. But on this trip to Veterans
Stadium, the Braves have needed only two games to win two. For the
second game in a row, the Braves picked on Phillies pitchers. First
it was Carlton Loewer on Monday, this time it was Paul Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   Getting home runs off Byrd by Chipper Jones and Javy Lopez, an
insurance two-run shot by Gerald Williams and another eight hits in
between, the Braves blew away the Phillies 10-4.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's trouble started with its starter. After shutting
down the Braves offense down last week, Byrd was run off by his
former team this time out. He left with one out into the third
inning and his team down 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd helped shake Chipper Jones out of his first-week funk, as
he had an RBI double and a home run in his two at-bats against
Byrd, who wasted no time finding trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning he did a little bit of everything, allowing
a walk, two doubles, a single, a wild pitch and a hit batsman and
balked in a run. By the time it was over, all nine Brave batters
had taken turns at bat, four of whom scored for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got only two hits off Byrd in 7 1/3 innings on April
8. It took them three batters to get two on Wednesday. Otis Nixon
lead off the game with a walk, which was followed by a Bret Boone
single and a Chipper Jones double.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was facing an 0-2 count from Byrd when he worked it back
to 2-2 and sent the pitch off the right- field wall. On his next
at-bat and pitch, which came in the second inning, Jones fired his
second home run of the year to right center field.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had been 0 for his last 7 going back to Sunday's game
against the Diamondbacks. He opened the season hitting .241 in the
Braves' homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies charged back to make it 6-4 with four runs off
Kevin Millwood in the fourth and fifth innings. They reached him
over that stretch for six hits _ three on the infield _ and drew
two walks to make it a game again.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble started when Millwood loaded the bases on an infield hit
and two walks in the fourth inning. He struck out Ron Gant with a
high fastball for the second out but couldn't fool Bobby Abreu, who
singled to right to score two runs making it 6-2 Braves.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- When; where: 7:05; Veterans Stadium.

CRIMINAL INQUIRY INTO JUDGING OF HOLYFIELD-LEWIS MOVES FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ State Sen. Roy Goodman said Wednesday that he has
turned over evidence of a potentially criminal nature involving the
judging in the heavyweight championship fight between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis last month at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman gave the evidence to Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan
district attorney, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator turned up the evidence during his Senate
Investigation Committee inquiry into the fight, and Morgenthau is
conducting a criminal investigation into the bout's possible
corruption. The fight ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is the WBC champion and Holyfield holds the WBA and the
IBF titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned it over because the Manhattan district attorney has
the interstate power of subpoena,'' Goodman said by telephone from
his office in Albany Wednesday. ``Our powers would not apply to New
Jersey and we had certain witnesses there that refused to appear
before our committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman pointed out that the information he discovered was
potentially criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, a spokesperson with the Manhattan district
attorney's office, confirmed that they had received Goodman's
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very interesting,'' Thompson said of the information.
``We don't want to characterize it. But it's obviously something we
will look at as part of our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney has convened a grand jury to
look into possible wrongdoing in the Holyfield-Lewis bout, which
created a public outcry. The fight was declared a draw, even though
it appeared Lewis controlled most of the 12 rounds of the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Williams was the only judge to score the bout for
Holyfield. She was selected by the IBF and confirmed by the New
York State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Williams admitted during hearings before Goodman's committee
last month that she had filed for bankruptcy shortly before the
fight. There was also testimony that indicated Larry O'Connell, a
judge from England, had fallen behind on his mortgage payments.
O'Connell scored the fight a draw. Williams said she did not take
any bribes to score the fight for Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said he was dismayed that people with financial problems
who could be open to temptation from corrupting influences were
allowed to judge fights. He was also surprised at how much power
the sanctioning organizations had in regard to selecting judges.  &QL;

PERFECTION WELL WITHIN REACH FOR GRAND PRAIRIE'S GRAND PALACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ They got it right the first time. And
again the second time. Not bad for an initial track record. So
what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Tune an ear to the mid-cities Thursday night and you will hear
the rolling thunder of the thoroughbreds as Lone Star Park opens
its third season.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, it will be Real Quiet on Belt Line Road. The
Baffert Gang from California turns loose its stable stud at Grand
Prairie's grand palace.
</P>
<P>
   A Bob Baffert and a Real Quiet bring Lone Star continued
national recognition. Even more important is the local perception.
Real Quiet translates to big time. Big time sells around here.
</P>
<P>
   But the amazing Mr. Baffert, a staunch supporter of Lone Star
from Day One, wouldn't be coming back, particularly with Real
Quiet, if success hadn't been achieved here the first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the third step.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Lone Star needs to get it \Rexactly\S right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you ever reach perfection in this business, but
you never stop trying,'' said general manager Corey Johnsen.
</P>
<P>
   The doubters who once harpooned the Lone Star project are long
gone, and that includes financial institutions that five years ago
wouldn't touch the building of this track with a ten-dollar bill,
much less fifty-or-so million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same banks who once wouldn't allow us in their front door
now ask if they can fly us to New York for bond meetings,'' said a
laughing Charles England, the Grand Prairie mayor, and the No. 1
reason there is a Lone Star Park.
</P>
<P>
   Purses are bigger than ever. Attendance surges. Surveys of the
North Texas marketplace concerning Lone Star bounce higher than a
golf ball on concrete _ positive, positive, positive.
</P>
<P>
   But the quest for perfection goes on for Johnsen and his staff.
Negatives are there, and ironically, most of those come from within
the ranks of people who benefit the most from a strong Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   A certain segment of trainers have bad-mouthed the racing
surfaces _ both the dirt track and the grass course. If this sounds
familiar, yes, it's similar to what Texas Motor Speedway went
through with NASCAR drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers are like coaches, but trainers can work with one to 20
owners. When a horse doesn't perform well, owners ask why. Horse
trainers, by reputation, are the most notorious excuse makers in
the sports world. Give them a chance to blame anyone (jockeys), or
anything (the track surface), and they will.
</P>
<P>
   But Lone Star, to its credit, has had only two knocks against it
_ the heat and the track being too hard, making horses more
injury-prone. One noted trainer, Bobby Barnett, pulled his stable
out of Lone Star two years ago, blaming the track surface. Barnett
was also 2-for-38 in wins at the time. You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Heat is out of Johnsen's control. This, however, is the third
year of operation, and any and all kinks in the track should be
worked out. Accomplish that, and Lone Star removes the only nagging
negative, and shoves in front of a mirror those trainers looking
for an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen, however, is blunt in addressing this subject. ``The
surfaces are the foundation of what we are all about,'' he said.
``Our job is to listen to the horsemen and then make progress on
the surfaces, based on what they tell us. Whatever it takes _
money, man hours, whatever _ we will get this right.''
</P>
<P>
   Major changes costing more than $100,000 were made on the dirt
and grass courses for this season. At the moment, the trainers are
pleased. Then again, no trainer has lost a race yet.
</P>
<P>
   But from the most basic elements of thoroughbred racing _ dirt
and grass _ Lone Star has attracted ample and positive attention
for its philosophical approach to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is trying to mix the lifeblood of racing, as in wagering,
with a good-time concept based on entertainment. How much money
goes through the betting windows ultimately determines if a track
is successful, but...
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of people will come this weekend who maybe will not
bet more than 20 bucks for the whole day,'' said Johnsen. ``We
don't care. We welcome them. Did they have a fun time? Will they
come back? We hope so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people who return, the more they will start to
understand the sport, and somewhere down the road, the more they
will wager. That is our philosophy. It goes against the so-called
tradition of horse racing. Tradition is great, but tradition has
also damaged our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen points to Baffert and his main owner, the colorful Mike
Pegram. ``They became successful by bucking the tradition of horse
racing,'' he said. ``It's a balancing act for us. We want our
veteran fans to be happy, and to continue to support us with their
wagering. And we want the newcomers to get to know what we're all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. And starting tonight, Lone Star is off and
running in search of perfection.

TWO BROTHERS CHARGED WITH KILLING OF EIGHT-YEAR-OLD WITNESS AND HIS
MOTHER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two brothers were charged Wednesday in a Connecticut criminal
court with killing an 8-year-old boy and his mother, apparently to
prevent the boy from testifying against one of the brothers in a
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The murder charges against Russell Peeler, 27, and Adrian
Peeler, 22, capped a three-month investigation into one of the most
shocking crimes in the state in years.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the boy, Leroy Brown Jr., in his home in
Bridgeport provoked nationwide horror and outrage, prompting a
debate about the wisdom of having someone so young testify in a
criminal trial. And it led to measures, now before the state
legislature, to provide better protection for witnesses to violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were arraigned Wednesday in state Superior Court in
Bridgeport, each on two counts of capital felony, one count of
murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder, said the
state's attorney, Jonathan Benedict.
</P>
<P>
   The charges of capital felony allow prosecutors to seek the
death penalty if the Peelers are convicted. In addition, the
brothers were also indicted Wednesday on several federal narcotics
charges. Both had been in police custody on charges unrelated to
the killings of the boy and his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Clarke, who was called B.J., and his mother, Karen Clarke,
29, were found shot to death in their duplex apartment on Jan. 8,
five months after prosecutors had reluctantly given the boy's name
and address to Russell Peeler's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. had been scheduled to testify against Peeler, who had been
charged with the shooting death of Ms. Clarke's fiance, Rudolph
Snead Jr., last May. The boy was a passenger in Snead's car in
September 1997, when prosecutors say Russell Peeler pulled up in
another car and fired shots at Snead. Though Snead survived that
shooting, he was gunned down last May in a Bridgeport barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   Based in part on B.J.'s identification of a photograph of
Russell Peeler, the police charged Peeler with attempted murder. He
later posted bond.

NFL TEAMS CHANGES ITS MIND-SET ON BLACK QUARTERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, many blacks who played quarterback in college were
switched to another position in the pros. Blame it on circumstance
or plain old ignorance. But the bottom line is this: In the history
of the NFL, there have been more kickers (four) selected in the
first round of the draft than black quarterbacks (three).
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday night, that statistic will likely fade into history.
</P>
<P>
   The best quarterback class since 1983 features three black
athletes who are expected to go in the first round _ Oregon's Akili
Smith, Syracuse's Donovan McNabb and Central Florida's Daunte
Culpepper. Each has combined superior athletic ability with a
strong arm and the college experience to give them a chance in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Williams, who was the first black quarterback selected in
the first round of the NFL draft, has answered numerous calls from
the media about his history-making brethren. As the first-year head
coach at Grambling State last year, Williams did not watch many
college football games on television and admits to having little
knowledge about the talented trio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, it does not take a degree in human performance to
understand why Smith, McNabb and Culpepper are about to join
Williams, Andre Ware and Steve McNair as black quarterbacks taken
in the first round of the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were given a chance,'' Williams said. ``And now, these
kids have an opportunity that 20 years ago might not have been
there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Tampa Bay Buccaneers made history by taking Williams
with their first pick in the 1978 NFL draft, Pittsburgh's Joe
Gilliam and Chicago's Vince Evans were the only black quarterbacks
drafted in any round who'd made much of a splash in the NFL at the
position they played in college. (The Rams' James Harris was an
undrafted free agent).
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, blacks who wanted to play quarterback in the pros had
been undone by their own college system, or by pro general managers
who doubted whether a black player had the intelligence to play the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's Jamelle Holloway and J.C. Watts, who excelled at
running a wishbone offense, had little training as a drop-back
passer. Even black quarterbacks who succeeded in a pro-style
passing offense, like the University of Washington's Warren Moon,
were asked to switch positions. Moon had to prove himself as a
quarterback in the Canadian Football League before the NFL was
convinced he could play the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I had played was quarterback,'' Williams said. ``I
couldn't backpedal like a defensive back. Maybe they could have put
me at tight end. But that wasn't a position I'd played before, and
I wasn't looking to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance to play the only position he knew, Williams led
the Buccaneers to their only NFC Championship Game appearance in
1979. In the 1987 season, he became the only black quarterback to
start in the Super Bowl, leading the Washington Redskins over the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Williams retired after the 1989 season, several
others were making old-guard league owners rethink their positions
on the black quarterback. Moon was re-writing most of the Oilers'
passing records. And Randall Cunningham, with his ability to pass
and run with equal aplomb, was twice a runner-up to Joe Montana for
the league's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, with biases against black quarterbacks easing and
with blitzing defenses wrecking havoc, black quarterbacks are
growing in number. But progress hasn't come fast enough for
Williams. Of the league's 31 starters, only four _ Kordell Stewart
in Pittsburgh, Charlie Batch in Detroit, Cunningham in Minnesota,
and McNair in Tennessee _ are black.
</P>
<P>
   But with Smith, McNabb, and Culpepper on the horizon, that
number figures to change. Former Cowboys scouting director Gil
Brandt is sure of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, I think that more and more young African-American players
are realizing that they want to emulate quarterbacks rather than
running backs and wide receivers,'' Brandt said, ``and when you see
these kids in Pop Warner, you see more playing quarterback. Two,
college teams are getting away from the option offenses. Had a guy
like \Rformer Nebraska star\S Tommie Frazier grown up as a
drop-back passer, maybe we'd be talking about him in the National
Football League because he had a lot going for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Times are changing, indeed.

COACH-IN-WAITING IMMERSED IN MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After every Mavericks loss, there seems to be one
constant: Nobody takes those losses harder than assistant coach
Donnie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is so engrossed in his work that he looks dazed and
depressed after losses, and acts as though he just lost his best
friend. Can he maintain that high-strung frame of mind when he
replaces his father as the Mavericks' head coach in the 2000-01
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to die of a heart attack, because I'm young,''
Nelson, 36, said yesterday. ``But I can't tell you that I'm not
getting gray hairs and the losses don't wear on me, because they
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat myself up after every loss,'' Nelson said. ``I think
that's a sign of somebody that cares and somebody that wants to be
successful. Yes, it doesn't make for a great family life during the
season. Yes, I can be a pain to be around because I throw myself
into those situations, but that's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Nelson has worked as an assistant coach to or with
Danny Ainge, Cotton Fitzsimmons, Gregg Popovich, Paul Westphal,
Garry St. Jean and his father, Don Nelson, who is the Mavericks
coach and general manager. He believes those six men helped prepare
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are extremely bright minds who are in the game today,
and guys that I respect a ton,'' the younger Nelson said. ``I've
picked up different stuff from all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel like I've gotten a Harvard basketball
education, and now it's time to go out there and let 'er rip and
see what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Nelson has been a head coach in NBA summer leagues,
and has taken over NBA games at various times when the head coach
has been ejected. But 2000-01 will be a season like no other for
the younger Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like going to battle for the first time,'' he said.
``You jump out of that helicopter and you hit the ground, and it's
a sink-or-swim deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks players A.C. Green, Steve Nash, Michael Finley, John
``Hot Rod'' Williams and Cedric Ceballos were with the Suns during
parts of Nelson's tenure there, and believe he will be a solid NBA
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult for a rookie head coach who has no
experience, because they go through growing pains just like rookie
players,'' Nash said. ``But his work diligence and perseverance has
always been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously learned a lot of wisdom from his father and
other coaches he coached with.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson believes in paying attention to detail, a philosophy that
he tries to get across to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard-working, well-prepared guy, and certainly he's in
a good situation right now,'' said Westphal, who coaches the
Seattle SuperSonics. ``He's a good basketball guy who knows the
game and can do a fine job as a head coach. He established himself
enough in Phoenix through three different head coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams recalls, during his days with the Suns, when he and
Nelson would hop in a taxi and go to the arena 90 minutes before
the rest of the team so he could prepare for a game that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we did in Phoenix the last three years, Donnie's
the one who prepared us for the game, defensively and
offensively,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I came here is because I knew he was
going to be a good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has heard the cries of nepotism, but said he doesn't put
much stock into it. He just files it in his memory bank and moves
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the package that you do in accepting a job like this
is taking criticism. I don't mind taking criticism, as long as it's
warranted. But there isn't any critic out there that can be harsher
on me than I am on myself.''

LONE STAR'S TOP TWO TRAINERS RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Thoroughbreds begin racing again tonight
at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, whose 72-racing-day season gets
under way with a festive touch.
</P>
<P>
   Gates open at 4:30 p.m., and post time is 5:30 for the bands,
acrobats, sky divers, balloons and stilt-walkers. Four-legged
entertainment begins at 6:35 with the first of nine races.
</P>
<P>
   The training contest will start anew as well. The battle between
Dallas Keen and Jim Gaston for king of the Texas hill has been
raging for two years and sometimes gets more attention than the
horses. Keen won't have a starter tonight, and Gaston saddles only
one. But if recent history holds up, they will be frequent visitors
to the Lone Star winners circle over the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Keen was the track's top trainer in 1997, edging Gaston 41 wins
to 36. Last year, the friendly rivals tied with 36 winners each.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston won a race on the last day of the 1998 season to tie Keen
and nearly won another to take the title outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tie was better than second,'' Gaston said. ``But it was a
little bit stressful for us, coming down to the last day like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston was born in Dallas. Keen hails from Cameron. To both
native sons, recognition as Lone Star's leading trainer is the
local version of knighthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor because this is a very classy track,'' Keen
said. ``It's a track like the old days. Fans come out to the track
instead of watching races on TV at a pavilion somewhere. That makes
it fun for us. Because they're actually here, it makes horse racing
exciting, besides the gambling part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes us kind of like the racehorses. We get competitive.
Everybody wants to win, and winning races keeps you in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Keen won the Arkansas Derby with Valhol, a 30-1
long shot that had not previously won a race. Keen also trains
Allen's Oop, who finished a neck behind Real Quiet in the New
Orleans Handicap last month and tries 1998's 3-year-old champion
again Sunday in the $250,000 Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday is the $300,000 Lone Star Derby, which will be
televised live on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   And if two major stakes races, national television and the
presence of Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet aren't
enough to get the adrenaline pumping, Julie Krone is also scheduled
to make the last riding appearance of her legendary career Sunday
at Lone Star. She has mounts on Allen's Oop and Lone Star Derby
starter Desert Demon, after which she has said she will retire.
</P>
<P>
   It gets started tonight with the $75,000 Premiere Stakes for
older Texas-breds, the first race of the meeting. Desert Air, a
full brother to Desert Demon, will be the heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston's only starter tonight will be Meanest Rene, a longshot
3-year-old maiden who runs in the nightcap. Gaston has Meanest Rene
in one of his 18 stalls at his Lone Star barn, but he has access to
dozens more horses at his Benton, La., training center. He shuttles
horses back and forth from the farm, a four-hour van drive from the
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got quite a few horses just now starting to come
around,'' Gaston said. ``We ought to have a good meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen, who keeps all 36 of his horses at Lone Star, isn't
optimistic about repeating as leading trainer. However, it should
be noted he gave a gloomy forecast before last season, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as strong as last year and sure not as good as the
year before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keen will spend much of the next few weeks at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Ky., preparing Valhol for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year it's going to be like I've got a split stable,'' he
said. ``I won't be able to devote 100 percent of my attention here
because I'll be in Kentucky so much, and I don't like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to weigh it in my mind,'' Keen added with a
laugh. ``Do I want to be leading trainer again, or do I want to win
the Kentucky Derby?'' Real Quiet arrives At Lone Star Park, it's a
reversal of the norm: In with the old, out with the new.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, who came within an eyelash of sweeping the Triple
Crown last year, arrived at the track yesterday after a flight from
Louisville, Ky. The 4-year-old, owned by Mike Pegram and trained by
Bob Baffert, was bedded down in trainer Louie Roussel's Barn 14,
and is scheduled to run Sunday in the Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the trip in great shape,'' said assistant trainer Eoin
Harty, who accompanied Real Quiet. ``He's flown enough that he
knows something's up.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the plane was Black Mercury, another Baffert trainee
running in Sunday's co-featured Lone Star Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet is a proven superstar, but today, 3-year-old Valhol
heads in the opposite direction to try to stake his claim in racing
history. Fresh off his shocking upset in Saturday's Arkansas Derby,
Valhol is being flown from Lone Star to Churchill Downs for the May
1 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol belongs to James Jackson of Rockdale, who turned down two
$2.5 million offers for his horse earlier in the week. Jackson also
owns Allen's Oop, who will run in Sunday's Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's not about the money,'' explained Jackson,
saying if the offers get much higher, the money might become more
important. Briefly Vivace, the 6-year-old millionaire mare owned by
Jerry and Linda Minter of Pilot Point, is scheduled to make her
second Lone Star appearance Saturday in the $50,000 Irving Distaff
at 7 1/2 furlongs on grass. She won an allowance on May 2, 1997, in
Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't met the summer-heat test yet, but Lone Star's retooled
dirt surface is getting early approval from most horsemen. Workout
times have been fast, but observers standing on the outside rail
can barely hear the horses run past, a sign the track has ample
cushion. Another problem has been the hardness of the grass course
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score at home, Lone Star will be going up
against 1998 opening-night figures of 15,711 in attendance, and
betting on local races of $1.3 million on-track and $3.2 million
counting all sources.

POLICE THINK THEY HAVE WRONG MAN, LAWYERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Lawyers for the man charged with killing a
policewoman in Orange said Wednesday that actions by law
enforcement officials, including the disclosure that a recent
polygraph indicated that the suspect was innocent, were signs of a
growing belief among investigators that the man's arrest was a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Hamlin and Ronald Hunt, lawyers for the suspect,
Terrance Everett, 24, of East Orange, said the disclosure was just
the latest development since Everett's arrest Saturday to suggest
that investigators are having second thoughts. Results of the
polygraph test were first reported in Wednesday's issue of The
Star-Ledger of Newark, which attributed the information to
unidentified law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin said he and Hunt had yet to see the results of the
polygraph test, which was administered after Everett was arrested.
The lawyers have subpoenaed the office of Essex County Prosecutor
Patricia Hurt to obtain the results.
</P>
<P>
   Polygraph tests, while inadmissible as evidence in court, are
generally used as investigative tools by law enforcement agencies
to bolster their rationale for an arrest, not undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also noted that investigators had continued to
search for the killer of the officer, Joyce Anne Carnegie, even
after Everett had been arrested and charged. During that search,
investigators used a composite sketch of a robbery suspect who they
believed was involved in the shooting of Officer Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials close to the investigation said
investigators had witnesses only to two street robberies, not to
the shooting, which they believe occurred when Officer Carnegie
arrived to investigate one of the robberies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is interesting and significant that they did
this,'' said Hunt, referring to investigators' use of the sketch
more than 24 hours after Everett had been picked up.
</P>
<P>
   As for the release of Everett's polygraph results, Hunt said:
``There may be some damage control by them now rather than later.
If their investigation ultimately leads to his release, they may
want to show now that they had some misgivings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's office would not comment Wednesday on developments in
the investigation of the shooting of Officer Carnegie, 38, who
lived in North Plainfield. She was shot in the abdomen and head
Thursday on an Orange street.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ms. Hurt's office also continued to investigate the
death of Earl Faison, 27, while in police custody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's office has not responded to questions about why
Faison was stopped by Orange police officers Sunday night. But
according to police, he struggled with the officers and later
collapsed and died at Police Headquarters. Published reports have
suggested that Faison was stopped because he had matched the
description of the robbery suspect being sought in connection with
Officer Carnegie's death and because he had an illegal gun. The
police have not confirmed those reports, however.
</P>
<P>
   While preliminary autopsy findings ruled out blunt force as the
cause of death, Faison's father, Earl Williams, said the family had
retained a lawyer and was seeking an independent autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, James Coker, 29, of Newark, who was arrested in
Orange late Sunday as part of the investigation of Officer
Carnegie's death, remained in custody Wednesday, charged with
possession of crack and attempting to destroy evidence. He has not
been charged in connection with the killing or the robberies.
</P>
<P>
   FBI forensic experts have been made available to the local
agencies investigating Officer Carnegie's death. Monica Patton, a
spokeswoman for the FBI office in Newark, said the agency's
Evidence Response Team, which includes chemical, engineering and
DNA experts, was supporting the investigation, but she would not
say how.
</P>
<P>
   Everett is being held on $1 million bail. Hamlin said he
expected that Judge Betty Lester of state Superior Court in Newark,
who is presiding over the case, would schedule a bail-reduction
hearing within three days. He said he might present witnesses and
evidence at that time to show that his client could not have killed
Officer Carnegie.

EDITORIAL: JAIL TIME FOR DR. KEVORKIAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   That was a harsh sentence a Michigan judge imposed on Dr. Jack
Kevorkian this week for his murder conviction in the ``mercy
killing'' of a seriously ill patient. Some may think that a
sentence of 10 to 25 years in prison _ with the possibility of
parole after 6 years and 8 months _ is even too harsh, given that
Kevorkian is 70 years old and performing what, from his skewed
perspective, was an act of conscience. But quibbling over whether
the sentence should have been a few years lighter pales against the
important message sent by Judge Jessica Cooper's tough sentence and
blistering statement to Kevorkian. No one can openly flout the law
on murder and expect to get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Kevorkian moved from giving patients the means to
kill themselves to personally administering the lethal injection.
As part of his increasingly reckless campaign to promote assisted
suicide and euthanasia to end the suffering of desperately ill
patients, he provided CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' with a videotape in
which he ended the life of Thomas Youk, a victim of Lou Gehrig's
disease. Kevorkian virtually dared the legal system to try to stop
him _ and that is what has now happened.
</P>
<P>
   True, Youk and his family had sought Kevorkian's assistance as a
way to end the patient's suffering. That such patients feel they
must turn to Kevorkian is a glaring indictment of our society's
failure to allow assisted suicide in rigorously controlled medical
settings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian has helped bring the need for right-to-die reforms to
public attention. But his idiosyncratic crusade has actually begun
to hurt the cause he supports. He veered toward flamboyant
self-promotion by dealing death to patients when he had no
long-term knowledge of their cases and no corroboration of his
medical judgments. The virtue of the harsh sentence _ in a case
that Kevorkian intends to appeal _ is that it may put him out of
action and let leadership of the assisted-suicide movement pass to
people with sounder judgment. &QL;

EUROPEAN LEADERS OFFER KOSOVO PEACE PLAN; U.S. SEES LITTLE CHANCE
OF SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Joining in the search for a diplomatic
solution to the crisis in Kosovo, leaders of 15 European Union
countries presented a plan Wednesday under which the province would
be placed under temporary international European administration if
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces and
allowed hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials gave the European initiative, and a more detailed
one made public separately by Germany on Wednesday, little chance
of being accepted by Belgrade. NATO reiterated that it would
continue bombing in Yugoslavia until Milosevic withdrew all police
and military units from Kosovo and let the ethnic Albanian
population go back home.
</P>
<P>
   But the European proposal could break new ground by signaling to
Yugoslavia's leaders and to Russia that the United States and the
North Atlantic military alliance it dominates do not have to be the
only players if Milosevic is interested in any outcome in Kosovo
other than his own fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   The European leaders insisted that the United Nations, Russia
and the European Union _ a primarily economic grouping of West
European countries that does not deal with defense issues _ should
all play a role in diplomatic moves to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who attended the European
Union discussions Wednesday, welcomed support for his own efforts
from the Europeans and said that other members of the United
Nations Security Council would be consulted about their proposals.
``I have no plans for a trip to Belgrade,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also discussed some of the
ideas in the European plan in Oslo on Tuesday with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov, according to allied officials. There was no
indication that a broad agreement emerged from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   NATO continued attacking Serbian military targets Wednesday,
bombarding Belgrade with its heavy strikes, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Summarizing the discussions of the European leaders, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said Wednesday night that the goal of
both diplomacy and of NATO military action was to create a change
in Yugoslavia that would stop Serbian attacks on Albanian
population centers and insure safety for all two million people in
Kosovo. About 90 percent of them are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heads of state and government reiterate their
determination not to tolerate the killings and deportations in
Kosovo and believe that the use of the most severe measures,
including military measures, was both necessary and justified,''
Schroeder said, meaning NATO bombing to stop the Serbian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Europeans now considered that ``establishment
of an international interim administration which the European Union
could take over'' was an essential part of an eventual peace
settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of a settlement package that the leaders had
discussed, Schroeder said, included a police force that would
reflect the province's ethnic composition; elections, and
``deployment of international military forces that will guarantee
protection for the whole population of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making Kosovo a ``protectorate'' under international
security guarantees has been previously mooted by NATO, but all
discussions so far have supposed that Milosevic's forces would be
either withdrawn or neutralized before any international force was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Germany also floated its own diplomatic proposal earlier
Wednesday to take Kosovo away from Serbia as part of a peace
settlement, but it suggested putting the province under United
Nations administration.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said the idea of taking Kosovo under the
European Union's wing instead came from President Jacques Chirac.
Schroeder said the other leaders agreed to that proposal in
Wednesday night's discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Milosevic suddenly gives up and accepts these ideas,
the only way to impose them on him remains the bombing campaign,
now being carried out by about 1,000 U.S. British, French, Dutch
and German warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The original German proposal also suggested a 24-hour suspension
of the bombing if Milosevic actually began pulling forces out of
Kosovo by deadlines set by Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain is staunchly opposed to any letup of the bombing
until the Serbs end actions, their forces withdraw from Kosovo, an
international military force can go in and the refugees are allowed
to return to their homes in peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a halt to the NATO action until the
demands that we have set out, which are entirely reasonable,
humane, civilized demands, are met in full,'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to allow Milosevic to get away with the
policy of ethnic cleansing,'' Blair said. ``He will be defeated on
that policy and the military objectives that we have set at the
beginning of this campaign will be seen through in their entirety,
in their entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   These objectives, the European leaders agreed Wednesday night,
included ``deployment of international military forces that will
guarantee protection for the whole population of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies insist that any such force should be led and
commanded by the alliance, possibly under a mandate from the United
Nations, but Yugoslavia has so far refused to discuss any kind of
force.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council with veto power over its decisions, has said it would
approve such a force only if Milosevic was willing to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the original German plan, which Foreign Minister Joachim
Fischer discussed with the United States, Britain, France, Canada
and Italy at a NATO meeting in Brussels on Monday, the Security
Council would set firm deadlines for Milosevic to start and finish
a withdrawal of all Serbian and paramilitary forces from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   If he began withdrawing, according to the proposal, NATO forces
would break off air strikes for 24 hours. If the Serbian police and
army troops kept withdrawing, the 24-hour pause would be extended,
with peacekeepers moving in as the Serbian forces left.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and other allied officials reacted to the German plan
skeptically, but apparently agreed to see if the Russians would try
it out on Belgrade. ``Nobody thinks it will work,'' a U.S. official
said. ``First of all, Milosevic will never accept it. But at this
point, everybody is willing to try everything.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said in Washington, ``The
main point in the German plan that's relevant here is that this
would be done ideally by resolution of the Security Council, which
would be fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Fischer said Russia ``almost fully agreed'' to his
plan. But he said Russia still had concerns about the peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of a plan to surrender Kosovo to international
administration would mean, for the fiercely nationalist Milosevic,
giving up sovereignty over territory that was historically Serbian,
something not even the plan he refused in negotiations at
Rambouillet Castle in France this winter would have asked him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   His refusal to accept that plan's proposals to leave the
province under Serbian sovereignty but give its 1.8 million
Albanians political and legal autonomy set off the NATO bombing
that began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union also reaffirmed plans announced last week for
it to provide $160 million for refugee relief and $107 million to
Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro to help them provide for the
hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians who have fled to those
countries.

ALTA VISTA INVITES ADVERTISERS TO PAY FOR TOP RANKING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alta Vista, one of the leading services that search for
information on the World Wide Web, is inviting advertisers to pay
for the right to be listed atop its search results.
</P>
<P>
   Even though advertising, both explicit and hidden, permeates
most Web sites, the major search services have until now insisted
that the search rankings themselves are produced objectively
according to computer formulas and are not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as more and more Internet services, struggling to
increase revenue and justify their fantastic stock market
valuations, are selling advertising in forms that could well be
confused for objective information. For example, Amazon.Com, &UR;  &LR; the
bookstore, has started selling publishers the right to prominent
reviews by Amazon's editors.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista is owned by the Compaq Computer Corp., which wants to
build up its revenue quickly in order to sell a portion of Alta
Vista in an initial public stock offering later this year. In
February, Alta Vista was the 13th most popular site on the
Internet, according to Media Metrix, which measures Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Alta Vista search result program was reported Tuesday by
Wired News, an online news service. Doubleclick, the company that
sells advertising for Alta Vista, promoted the program in a recent
e-mail message to potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When users perform keyword searches on Alta Vista, what is the
first listing they see?'' the message said. ``Now it can be your
company's listing.'' The message said Alta Vista was auctioning off
the right to be listed in the first two positions to the highest
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Lozert, the general manager of Alta Vista's search service,
argues that when the program is unveiled it will not be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear that we haven't changed our core
index, but we want to offer additional ways for users to find some
results that are interesting,'' he said. ``We've tested a number of
concepts so it will be very clear to users this is not the index
results. These will be boxed, say, or there will be a red thing
that says this is an advertisement.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on online publishing say that the details of these
graphic devices will determine whether the program is in fact
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's largely a design issue of how they present the paid for
selections,'' said Larry Pryor, the director of the online
journalism program at the University of Southern California. ``If
they try to be subtle about it and slide it by so people can't
tell, it's a terrible problem.''
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of e-mail from customers criticizing its paid
placement of reviews, Amazon decided to identify which reviews are
subsidized, although this disclosure is not adjacent to the actual
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Vista's plan has also raised worries among small businesses
that have come to rely on free listing on search engines to bring
business to their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search engines are one of the great equalizers of the Web,''
said John Heard, the president of Beyond Engineering, a consulting
concern in Laharpe, Kan. ``It lets a mom-and-pop business selling
flowers compete with 1-800-Flowers. If everything is converted to
paid advertising, then all the business will go to those with the
deepest pockets.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alta Vista is partly copying the business model of Goto.com, an
Internet search site that consists entirely of paid listings. But
in Goto's search results, each listing is explicitly accompanied by
the amount that the advertiser will pay the site if a user clicks
on the link.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence that advertising adds value to results,
just like the yellow pages,'' Jeffrey Brewer, the company's chief
executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines are especially potent advertising vehicles
because so many people use them when they are researching products
to buy. But other than Goto, none of the sites have sold positions
in their search results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to get each of the search engines to alter their
search results to put my clients on top,'' said Michael Golden, the
head of the New York office of Organic Online, an agency that
represents many online stores. ``They won't do it, and frankly
that's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of them said they remained committed to that policy.
``We don't sell our search results _ never have, never will,'' said
Melissa Walia, public relations manager for Excite, another search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   What Excite and most of the other search services have done,
however, is to sell advertisements of all shapes and sizes that are
placed above and to the side of search results.
</P>
<P>
   Type ``Viagra'' into Lycos, for example, and the screen shows a
graphical advertisement for an online clinic that proscribes sells
Viagra. Below that is a text link, with the ambiguous marking
``Bull's eye'' that in fact is an ad for another clinic. And to the
side is an ad for a book on Viagra from Barnes &AMP; Noble. A user
would have to move to the second page of the results to find the
actual list of Web pages about Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The search services argue that all this advertising actually
benefits users, because it is often more likely to be relevant to
users than their other search results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you type in `computer,' are you looking to buy a computer,
fix a computer, or research the history of computers?'' said Celia
Francis, the director of search marketing for Alta Vista. The paid
placements, she argued, are more likely to be useful to users than
a list of pages on which the word ``computer'' appears.
</P>
<P>
   But Evan Thornley, the chief executive of LookSmart, a small
Internet search and directory service, contends that consumers are
starting to rebel against many of these ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short-term economics are in favor of flogging every piece
of real estate that you have,'' he said. ``But the long-term
economics say that you also want to have a business at the end of
the day.''

BILL WENDELL, ANNOUNCER ON DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Wendell, a radio and television announcer whose crisp
authoritative voice provided an ironic foil to entertainers from
Ernie Kovacs to David Letterman, died Wednesday at a hospice in
Boca Raton, Fla. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was complications from cancer, said one of
his daughters, Francette Nunziata.
</P>
<P>
   Until his retirement in 1995, Wenzel was most recently known for
the off-stage introduction of guests at the beginning of
Letterman's show at NBC and later CBS. The introductions typically
began with a municipal characterization like, ``From New York,
mountain fortress of the ancient Incas, it's `Late Night With David
Letterman . . .'''
</P>
<P>
   But Wendell also worked with Bob Hope, Dave Garroway, Jack Paar,
Merv Griffin, Gary Moore, Alan King, Tom Snyder, Billy Crystal and
Jerry Seinfeld. But what brought him the earliest and widest
attention was his work in the 1950s as the on-air sidekick for
Ernie Kovacs, Mrs. Nunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always playing practical jokes on each other,'' his
daughter recalled. ``One time Ernie was supposed to gulp a big
martini, but it was supposed to be filled with water, only it was
really filled with vodka. He spit it out and started coughing like
crazy on live national television. Dad and his cronies were
laughing their heads off.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell was born William Joseph Wenzel, Jr. on March 22, 1924,
in New York City to William J. Wenzel , a beverage distributor and
an owner of several Manhattan fruit stands, and Mildred S. Wenzel,
a housewife. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War
II, he worked in radio and early television. He had taken the
professional name of Wendell ``because he wanted to give his family
some privacy and maybe a German name at that time wasn't that
popular,'' Mrs. Nunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell then went on to work as a staff radio and television
announcer for NBC, on call for network promotions, special news
bulletins and network identifications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Mrs. Nunziata of Pelham Manor, N.Y.,
Wendell is survived by his wife, Anne Eustace Wenzel; two other
daughters, Anne Wenzel Markgraf of Burbank, California, and
Elizabeth Hansbury of White Plains; two sons, William J. Wenzel 3d
of Southport, Conn., and Richard Eustace Wenzel of Mount Vernon,
N.Y., and 14 grandchildren. &QL;

MISSOURI TOWN BRUSHES OFF COAL DUST, THANKFUL DERAILMENT WASN'T
WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAWNA A. HAMEL and BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARKVILLE, Mo. _ Parkville will continue cleaning up Thursday
from a spectacular train derailment that dumped 2,600 tons of coal
onto its Main Street late Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, what happened is a miracle,'' said Mike
Newburger of the Southern Platte Fire Protection District. ``Just
think if something like this would have happened at 11 p.m. on a
Saturday night. It could have been worse than the flood of 1993.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The derailment, which happened about 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, shook
the antebellum town of 2,700 that sits along the Missouri River
west of Kansas City. No one was injured. The derailment posed no
health hazards, but it paralyzed Parkville's downtown and most
likely will cost more than $2 million to clean up and repair the
damage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt if this happened at 5:30 in the evening it
would have killed people,'' said Parkville Mayor Bill Quitmeier,
``whether it was shop owners or families sitting at the crossing on
their way to soccer practice.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tracks rumble a few feet past century-old buildings on the
city's historic Main Street. On the other side of the tracks are
the city's park and a newer shopping district. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary review indicated that the derailment was caused by
a ball bearing that malfunctioned. Excess heat from that ball
bearing caused a wheel to lock, detach from its axle and slip from
the track, said Steve Forsberg, a spokesman for Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Railway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The locked wheel was about a third of the train's length from
the engine. Twenty-six cars of the 121-car train derailed and
crunched into the length of about two city blocks. It appeared that
part of the train dragged for up to three miles, Forsberg said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speed was not a factor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speed tapes show the train was traveling 31 mph, Forsberg said.
The maximum trains can travel through downtown Parkville is 45 mph,
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which could take several months, will include
a review of the train's speed tapes, and a look at the tracks and
cars for defects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg said he did not know when the train was last inspected.
Federal laws require trains to be inspected every 1,000 miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into the derailment by the National
Transportation Safety Board is not required because there were no
injuries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg called the derailment ``moderate.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Derailments like this don't happen too often,'' Forsberg said.
``There really are only a few incidents like this that occur every
million train miles. And if the derailment did result from a ball
bearing, well, it's like the tire on a car. Even when you make all
the normal and required checks, there are still instances where
something goes wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two buildings, one of which was built in 1885, were severely
damaged but can be salvaged, fire officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At One Main Street, closest to the tracks, Ronda Sulltrap of
Parkville and her five partners frequently had been working until
midnight or beyond to stock a gift shop they opened April 1. On
Tuesday night, they contemplated going to the store, but worked at
her house on paperwork instead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rail cars smashed most of one wall and filled the store with
coal in seconds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really just a fluke that we weren't there,'' Sulltrap
said. ``We think someone was looking out for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nearby trains, she said, have long rattled walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about train derailment, that it hasn't happened in
150 years, that it could never happen,'' Sulltrap said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five apartments also had to be evacuated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it was just a big rattle, then a bang, bang, bang,''
said Police Officer Steve Bagley, who lives in an apartment near
the tracks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was watching television and jumped back from his wall near
the tracks during the 20 to 30 seconds the cars were derailing.
When he opened a screen door to a deck on his second-story
apartment, he saw building insulation falling like snow, four
inches of coal on his upper deck and a mountain of coal and wrecked
cars in the parking lot below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bagley then heard another train whistle. Fearing another crash,
he rushed three other people from their apartments in the block,
away from the tracks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A power line was severed, but electricity in the downtown area
was restored by 2 p.m. Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A broken water main prompted an advisory to boil water through
Thursday for residents whose service was interrupted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Park College canceled classes Wednesday because of the lack of
water. Classes are expected to resume Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the downtown businesses are expected to be closed
through Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern will pay for the cleanup and the track
replacement, Forsberg said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He expects the company will pay for damage to buildings and
vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the responsible thing here...but I can't promise
that anyone who files any claims...will be reimbursed,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg said that other trains were rerouted and that other
operations were not affected. The derailed train was headed from
Lincoln, Neb., to Kansas City, Kan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The spilled coal is being taken to a landfill because companies
will not use coal contaminated with dirt, Forsberg said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg said two track side detectors near downtown Parkville
did not indicate any high temperatures radiating from the trains'
wheels. High temperatures generally are caused by ball-bearing
malfunctions, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trains using the railway winding through Parkville carry all
manner of materials; Newburger said a hazardous materials spill
there would have caused ``nothing less than a disaster.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have had a major evacuation situation,'' he said.
``Of all the hazardous materials that could have spilled, this is
really the best-case scenario for any of us. Coal is the least
life-threatening material, so there basically is no danger for the
public.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trains carrying coal generally run through Parkville twice a
day, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quitmeier said that although there were no injuries, the
``aftermath is more than enough for any of us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we were lucky because we dodged a bullet this time,'' he
said. ``But now, what do we do to make sure there aren't any more
risks in the future?'' &QL;

DUKE'S ELTON BRAND, PLAYER OF YEAR, ENTERS DRAFT TWO YEARS EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wave of underclassmen defections to the National Basketball
Association finally washed over Duke on Wednesday, when sophomore
center Elton Brand, the consensus player of the year, announced
that he would forego his final two years of eligibility to enter
this summer's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Brand, who is expected to be among the top three players
selected, is the first Duke star to leave the program early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a dream of mine to take care of my family,''
said Brand, whose mother, Daisy, worked to raise two sons alone
while living in a Peekskill, N.Y., housing project. ``Now I have
the means.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 8 inches and 260 pounds, Brand was the dominating
interior player _ he averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds _ who
helped propel the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record and the National
Collegiate Athletic Association championship game, which it lost to
Connecticut. Brand, who is likely to be a power forward in the NBA,
said he would finish this semester and attend summer school before
beginning his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will eventually finish, but just not in the four-year time
period,'' Brand said. ``I will always be a part of Duke, the
coaches and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand's announcement was the latest in a series by the game's
premier underclassmen who are shaping this year's draft while they
also reshape the landscape of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's decision follows by only one day that of his friend and
his Amateur Athletic Union teammate Ron Artest of St. John's to
enter the draft. Artest, who gave up two years of college
eligibility, has been projected by some scouts as a lottery pick _
among the first 13 players selected _ but his standing largely
depends on who else enters the draft. Maryland's spectacular junior
shooting guard Steve Francis has already announced that he will
enter the draft after only one year with the Terrapins, and the
junior forward Albert White of Missouri is also coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're recruiting great players, you almost have to look
at it as if you're recruiting junior college players,'' St. John's
coach Mike Jarvis said after Artest's announcement. ``You're only
going to have them one or two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose previous stars Grant Hill and
Christian Laettner stayed four years, said he backed Brand's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of how well he has done, the decision-making process
has been moved up,'' Krzyzewski, who is recovering at home from hip
surgery, said by telephone. ``Elton is making the right decision
for everyone involved. I am 100 percent in support of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski might not be so thrilled if several of Brand's
teammates follow him. Point guard William Avery is strongly
considering taking the leap, too. The Duke school newspaper
reported earlier this week that Avery, a sophomore, had decided to
leave. But after hearing the report, Avery's mother, Terry
Simonton, drove to Durham, N.C., from their family's home in
Augusta, Ga., to encourage him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Avery's father, William Sr., told The Augusta Chronicle
that the family was still weighing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Duke freshman forward Corey Maggette, an athletic sensation
with tremendous power and a sweet shot but only three collegiate
starts, also considered entering the draft _ he would likely have
been a top-five pick on potential alone _ but according to some
reports, has decided he should get one more year of experience. If
he remains healthy and averts a sophomore slump, Maggette would
almost certainly be the top pick in next year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 selection this year remains a good question. Rhode
Island's Lamar Odom, a 6-9, 215-pound guard-forward, could be the
first player taken, and would certainly be in the top three if he
decides to leave school. But Odom, who considered entering the
draft directly from high school, is sitting on the school's
selection committee for a new coach. If the job goes to assistant
coach Jerry DeGregorio, who is something of a father figure to Odom
after he coached him at a Connecticut high school and then ushered
him to Rhode Island (after which DeGregorio was hired by former
coach Jim Harrick), there is a slim chance Odom will stay.
</P>
<P>
   Among other premier players who are still undecided is the
Connecticut junior swingman Richard Hamilton. A first-team
all-American and two-time Big East player of the year, Hamilton is
expected to leave the Huskies after leading them to the national
championship this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was in the car when his teammate, point guard Khalid
El-Amin, was arrested Tuesday on a misdemeanor drug possession
charge in Hartford, Conn. El-Amin, a sophomore, had previously
announced that he would stay in school. Others left to decide by
the May 15 deadline: UCLA's Baron Davis, Michigan State's Mateen
Cleaves and Auburn's Chris Porter.  &QL;

HYMAN R. FAINE, LEADER OF PERFORMING-ARTISTS' UNION, DIES AT 88D  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Ill., Russia, Israel)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hyman R. Faine, a former executive of a union that represents
performing artists, died last Thursday at a hospice in Los Angeles.
He was 88, and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from pneumonia, said Tom Tugend, a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Faine, who spent much of his career in New York, was the
national executive secretary _ in effect, the chief executive _ of
the American Guild of Musical Artists from 1945 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   During his term, the union came to represent employees of the
Metropolitan Opera and of opera organizations in Chicago, Houston
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which had 2,000 members in 1950, now has more than
5,000. In opera, the union represents soloists, dancers, chorus
members, stage managers, stage directors and choreographers.
Outside of the opera world, it also represents dancers and
classical concert singers.
</P>
<P>
   After Faine moved to California, he also taught arts
administration. In 1970, while he was still working for the union,
he became a Regents' professor and acting chairman of the arts
administration program of the University of California in Los
Angeles. He remained a professor there for most of the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1989 about fund-raising for the arts, Faine,
who was then adjunct professor of arts management at UCLA, said,
``If the public has been sold the idea that they're getting
education when they pay for art, and then it doesn't work out that
way, they will resent it and won't listen to your next appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before moving to California, Faine's influence was such
that in 1953 he played a key role in salary negotiations between
the Metropolitan Opera and another union, Local 802 of the American
Federation of Musicians, representing members of the Met Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-day deadlock, a settlement was reached on a
two-year agreement giving the musicians a pay increase of 3 per
cent _ 1 per cent more than the Metropolitan had offered.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan's president, Lowell Wadmond, declared at the
time, ``The Metropolitan is grateful to John Brownlee, president,
and Hyman Faine, executive secretary of AGMA, whose efforts
contributed greatly to settlement of a dispute which threatened to
close the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Faine was born near Kiev in Ukraine, then part of Russia. He
came to the United States with his family when he was 10 and grew
up mainly on Manhattan's lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from City College in 1933 and in 1937 from Harvard
Law School, and practiced law until he entered the Army during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of almost 60 years, the former Ruth
Godes; two daughters, Robin Faine of Brooklyn and Judith Gold, who
lives on a kibbutz in Israel, and five grandchildren.

MAKERS OF DEFECTIVE WATER HEATERS TOLD TO FIX PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first government action against the makers of thousands _
perhaps millions _ of defective water heaters, Michigan's attorney
general on Wednesday said five companies must agree to fix the
problem or face a lawsuit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem, which involves a defective plastic pipe called a
dip tube, could affect virtually all 24 million water heaters
produced in North America from 1993 to 1996, said Jennifer M.
Granholm, the Michigan attorney general. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturers must stop burying their corporate heads in
the sand and own up to this problem,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Granholm's office on Wednesday filed a legal notice that gives
the companies 10 days to settle the matter before a lawsuit is
filed. Any settlement would include commitments to publicize the
problem and pay for repairs. Granholm said other state attorneys
general, including those in Missouri and Kansas, would be asked
next week to make it a multistate action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   National publicity for the problem has increased since a January
story in /{The Kansas City Star/} told about the defect. But the
companies themselves have not notified customers, waiting instead
until people ask for help with repairs. That has made it harder to
gauge the extent of the failures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand of the dip tubes have failed, disintegrating
into plastic pellets that can clog faucets, showers and appliances.
In addition, a water heater becomes much less efficient because the
dip tube is needed to circulate cold water properly in the heater's
tank. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Perfection Corp., which made the dip tubes, was named as a
defendant in the Michigan action, as were four water heater
manufacturers: American, Rheem, A.O. Smith and Bradford White.
Together, the four make most U.S. water heaters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Repairs often cost $100 to $400, but can be more if plumbing or
appliances are damaged. Granholm said the bill to fix the problem
would reach into the millions, and consumers shouldn't be the ones
to pay the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturers must be held accountable,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the manufacturers say they have been working to
take care of their customers, and Perfection says it is committed
to fixing the water heaters and paying the repair bills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a problem that Perfection has been running away
from, and it's not running away now,'' said William Mertens, an
attorney representing Perfection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Star article in January reported that many consumers were
puzzled when their heaters failed or plastic chips clogged their
plumbing. Since then, other newspapers and TV stations across the
country have printed or aired stories about the defective tubes.
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' aired a story on the problem
Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Michigan attorney general's action, private
class-action lawsuits have been filed in Kansas, Missouri and
Michigan seeking damages for consumers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Phalen, a lawyer with Humphrey, Farrington &AMP; McClain in
Independence, one of the law firms involved in the private
lawsuits, said talks were being held with the water-heater
manufacturers and Perfection over ways the litigation could be
settled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perfection's manufacturing process could have been defective for
up to 24 million dip tubes from 1993 to 1996 _ a time when at least
some of the tubes were not properly infused with chemicals needed
to keep them from decaying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At first, Perfection estimated that only 15,000 heaters would be
affected, a fraction of those made during the years in question.
That estimate was based on requests for repairs, and Mertens said
Perfection was re-evaluating how many might fail. He said about 16
million defective dip tubes might have been installed, but the
company still thought only a fraction of those would fail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence indicates that there are still plenty of
consumers just finding out about the defect. A Detroit TV station
aired a story on the problem Wednesday, causing hundreds of calls
to a Birmingham, Mich., law firm involved in one of the
class-action suits, said Tim Arnold, a lawyer for the firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, Marvalea Shoemake of Merriam said she
had been noticing how much longer it took to fill her coffee maker
from a kitchen faucet. So this week, her husband took off the
faucet's aerator screen and found it packed with plastic chips. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we've got it,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Peugeot, owner of Roger the Plumber in Johnson County,
said he had replaced or repaired 300 water heaters with
disintegrating dip tubes. In the last few days, he was called by a
customer whose home had weak water pressure. It turned out that the
water lines were clogged with plastic chips from a dip tube. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the craziest thing I've ever had to deal with,'' he
said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: WAR AND PEACE IN KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 15:
</P>
<P>
   Wars are easier to start than to stop, and the diplomatic
initiatives now in play on Kosovo are likely to mutate several
times before a political settlement draws within sight. But
Wednesday, for the first time since the combat began, the diplomats
were as active as the generals, with Germany leading the way. The
most difficult challenge for the United States and NATO is to blend
force and diplomacy to bring Slobodan Milosevic into negotiations
without sacrificing the alliance's objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is maneuvering furiously to divide NATO and induce it
to end the war on his terms. His offer Wednesday to accept unarmed
international monitors in Kosovo as part of a peace deal may sound
reasonable, but it would leave ethnic Albanians vulnerable to
Serbian repression. Nor should anyone be impressed by his talk of
building an alliance of Slavic nations to oppose NATO. His meeting
in Belgrade with the dictatorial president of impoverished Belarus,
Aleksandr Lukashenko, looked like a parody of a Warsaw Pact summit.
</P>
<P>
   For now, NATO must sustain and intensify the bombing. But damage
to Serbian military and industrial installations is mounting, and
at some point Milosevic may start to look more seriously at peace
possibilities. Germany's proposal would move too quickly to a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   But it broadly reflects NATO's goals and can serve as a useful
basis for diplomatic discussions. It calls for the withdrawal of
Serbian forces from Kosovo, the safe return of refugees and the
introduction of a robust international peacekeeping force to
prevent further ethnic conflict. The scheme would also require
ethnic Albanian guerrilla forces to cease hostilities and would
place Kosovo under U.N. administration while its status is
determined. The European Union offered a similar plan of its own
that would put Kosovo under European supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Cease-fire terms are critically important. The Germans suggest a
24-hour moratorium if Belgrade begins to pull out its troops, with
the bombing halt extended as long as the withdrawals continue to
meet a predetermined schedule. But more must be required of
Milosevic before the bombing stops, including his agreement in
principle to the core NATO conditions and an end to his assault on
Kosovo. Otherwise he could start withdrawals while using the
cease-fire to resupply his forces and continue the attacks against
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, in its own fashion, seems ready to help mediate.
Wednesday President Boris Yeltsin named his former prime minister,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, as a special envoy for the Balkan crisis.
Chernomyrdin is a pragmatic negotiator who appreciates the
importance of maintaining Russia's economic and political ties with
Europe and the United States. With Secretary General Kofi Annan of
the United Nations also prepared to serve as an intermediary,
Milosevic cannot complain about a shortage of potential
peacemakers.  &QL;

J.V. BLEVINS, WHO MADE POPCORN A PROFITABLE KINGDOM, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Ala.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Victor Blevins, who liked to be known as the Popcorn King
after he began to market his own version of the snack to movie and
grocery chains in the 1940s, died on Monday at his home in
Nashville. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Blevins was originally from Birmingham, Ala., and worked for the
Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.. He moved to Nashville to go into
business as a food broker.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that brokerage house that he realized how demand for
popcorn was surging along with movie audiences and that it was in
short supply. Seizing on the opportunity, he founded the Blevins
Popcorn Co. in Nashville in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to offer a fluffier, tastier hybrid corn that proved
highly successful, especially because concessionaires got more bulk
for every ounce of popping kernels.
</P>
<P>
   For a starter, Blevins signed on a Tennessee movie chain to
become its sole popcorn supplier. His enterprise branched out to
introduce its product beyond Tennessee and started selling it in
ready-to-pop packaging. He also concocted a buttery but low-fat
seasoning in the company kitchen. He introduced popcorn to the
baseball bleachers of Japan, a venture that he sold to Frito-Lay in
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that a good hype cannot hurt in business, he dubbed the
company's headquarters Popcorn Village and called himself variously
the mayor of Popcorn Village or, trumping that, the Popcorn King.
In 1948, he introduced a rather unscientific popcorn poll that
nonetheless shamed some professionals by predicting Harry S.
Truman's presidential victory in November. The poll accurately
called six presidential elections altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Blevins sold the business in 1961. It came to sell a wide
variety of supplies to concessionaires as it passed through several
ownerships as the Blevins Concession Supply Co.. It moved its base
to Tampa, Fla., and grew into the nation's biggest supplier of
movie-theater concessions.
</P>
<P>
   But by the early 1990s it was in financial straits after having
bought up a string of related companies. Overextended, it was
forced into bankruptcy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Blevins was inducted into the Popcorn Institute's Hall of Fame
in 1989. After selling most of his business to the Conwood Corp., a
diversifying tobacco company, in 1961, he continued to manage its
Blevins affiliate for several years, particularly its international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, he looked after his investments and a family
foundation that helps students get through college and advocates
tithing for charity. He kept an office and recently completed a
book, as yet unpublished, on the subject of tithing for the common
good.
</P>
<P>
   Blevins is survived by his wife of 66 years, Patty Hester
Blevins; a daughter, Betty B. Jensen of Atlanta; a son, Bill, of
Nashville; five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.

 JACK McDONALD, EX-CHIEF OF IMPERIAL, S.&AMP;L. COMPANY, DIES AT 88   By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack H. McDonald, a former chairman and chief executive of the
Imperial Corp. of America, a savings and loan company that long
after his retirement fell victim to the nation's savings and loan
crisis, died March 19 at Sharps Memorial Hospital in San Diego from
complications of Parkinson's disease, leukemia and pneumonia, his
wife, Loraine, said. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Imperial became one of the largest savings
and loan companies in the country, with about 125 offices
stretching from California's border with Mexico into the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   However, about 15 years after McDonald retired as chairman of
the company he had helped build, it was seized by federal
regulators, and its branches were sold.
</P>
<P>
   James Schmidt, former president of the San Diego Savings and
Loan Association and a longtime competitor of McDonald, said that
under McDonald's reign, Imperial ``was very successful.'' He added,
``They didn't have any asset problems when he was in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McDonald clearly felt the sting. ``A main part of
your life work, and you have nothing to show for it,'' he was
quoted as saying at the time. ``It's all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Before its demise, Imperial was known as an industry innovator.
It went public in the 1960s, before many other savings and loan
associations. It was also one of the first California savings and
loan associations with a statewide branch network and helped
establish San Diego as a banking center before it was overtaken by
San Francisco and Los Angeles. But straying from the savings
industry's staple of home morgtage loans, Imperial got into trouble
in the 1980s after its investments in high-yield junk bonds
collapsed, and its auto loans soured.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Pratt, Kan., who grew up in Orange County, Calif.,
McDonald graduated from the University of Kansas in 1933 with a
Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He began working for Home
Savings and Loan in Fredonia, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he was in the Navy from 1942 to 1945,
serving with amphibious forces in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and
southern France. He received two battle stars. After his discharge
with the rank of lieutenant commander, McDonald joined Investors
Savings and Loan, in Pasadena, Calif. Later, as president of
Investors, he converted the company from a mutual to a stock
company and became its chairman. When Investors was aquired by
Imperial Savings of San Diego in 1961, he became vice president of
Imperial. He became president in 1964, chief executive in 1965 and
chairman in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   At his retirement in 1975, Imperial was one of the largest
savings and loan corporations in the country and the first to trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, McDonald remained active in finance, as
well as in civic organizations. In 1976, he was named director of
the Central City Development Corp., a new development agency for
downtown San Diego, and served an eight-year term. He was also
director of the Children's Hospital, and a member of the board of
overseers of the University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is survived by his wife, the former Loraine Cameron;
four daughters, Sandra Jahiel of Brazil; Sara Pagoulatos of Fresno,
Calif.; Sally Bellerue of Westlake Village, Calif., and Lisa
Loraine Chappel of Los Angeles; a son, William, of Westport, Conn.;
13 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

WNBA AND PLAYERS SETTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Association and its players
union reached an agreement in principle Wednesday on a new
four-year contract, managing to negotiate differences that had once
threatened to delay the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified, the collective bargaining agreement will be the
first for the women's pro league and, according to league
officials, the first of its kind for women's team sports. The
league's 122 players are expected to vote on the proposal by April
22 for a season that runs from June to August.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary contract, reached late Wednesday evening through
a series of telephone calls, averted the cancellation of the
league's tryout camp, which is scheduled for this Friday and
Saturday in Chicago. A number of top college prospects and former
players from the defunct American Basketball League are expected to
be invited to participate in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to report that the WNBA and the Women's National
Basketball Players Association have reached an agreement,'' said
WNBA president Valerie Ackerman. ``This is, in fact, a preliminary
agreement. The agreement has not been written or signed and we have
a bit of work to do to finalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which expires in 2002, calls for an increase in
player salaries from last year's $15,000 minimum, to $25,000 for
rookies and $30,000 for veterans. Veterans' minimum salaries will
be raised $2,500 for each of the next two years, reaching $40,000
by 2002. Rookie minimum salaries will also increase, to $26,500
next year, $28,000 the following year and $30,000 in the fourth
year. Players will also be able to negotiate additional increases
based on merit.
</P>
<P>
   But money was only part of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The union was determined to secure the jobs of its members by
limiting each team to two ABL players. The league wanted free rein.
In the end, the two sides compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 12 WNBA teams will be allowed to add three ABL
players this year, except for the league's two expansion teams _
Orlando and Minnesota _ which will be allowed to add five.
</P>
<P>
   There will no limits on the number of ABL players in the 2000
season. The WNBA will expand by four teams that year, creating an
additional 44 jobs for women in the game. Ackerman said the league
hoped to name the sites of its expansion teams by June 10, the
start of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long process, but it was well worth it,'' said Pam
Wheeler, director of operations for the Women's National Basketball
Players Association and one of the union's chief negotiators.
``This is a milestone, not only for women's sports, but women's
basketball. This agreement is a significant step forward for the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority vote of the union members is needed to ratify the
contract. Wheeler said the executive committee, which included
player representatives like Coquese Washington, Rebecca Lobo and
Theresa Witherspoon, will recommend that the contract be approved.
Witherspoon plays for the Liberty, host team of the league's first
All-Star game, on July 14 at New York's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides acknowledged that the negotiations, which began
nearly two months ago, had at times been emotionally charged, they
characterized the talks as ``cordial and productive.'' In doing so,
it appeared that the women of the NBA wanted to distinguish their
negotiations from the contentious NBA labor dispute. The WNBA
players are represented by the NBA players association.
</P>
<P>
   The women's contract has a no-strike, no-lockout provision in
its fourth year. The contract can be renegotiated in its third
year.
</P>
<P>
   These are among some of the other key provisions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Royalties to players for all player-identified merchandise,
with a guaranteed minimum payment of $100,000 going to the union
for each year of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ A 401(k) plan with mandatory employer contributions and
matching amounts in the event players make their own contributions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guaranteed salaries for players who appear in at least half of
the 32-game season.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $100,000 life insurance policy for each player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Year-round health benefits, including maternity leave and a
dental plan.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the players were ecstatic about the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always considered ourselves partners with the WNBA and
happy they have stepped forward and told us through this agreement
that they consider us partners as well,'' she said. ``We will have
labor peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said there was never any animosity between WNBA
players and their rivals in the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are personal friends, people we played with
overseas or in college,'' Washington said. ``We have a history and
a relationship with these players.
</P>
<P>
   ``With them in the league, it makes our games that much more
exciting and competitive.'' &QL;

CARSON: NFL NOD TO COLISEUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League's expansion committee is still
scheduled to visit Carson and the Los Angeles Coliseum next Tuesday
to assess the two proposed locations for a 32nd NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Ovitz, Carson's partner heretofore in the NFL
expansion effort, told Carson officials Wednesday that the
expansion committee will likely select the New Coliseum group and
ask Ovitz to join its ownership team.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz also told Carson officials the league may ask the city to
keep its proposal on the table for 60-to-90 days should something
go amiss with the Coliseum project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way Carson is going to hang around while the NFL
and the Coliseum work on their issues,'' said Carson city
councilman Daryl Sweeney, the city's point man in the NFL expansion
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be used as leverage. We can read the tea leaves.
The league wants the Coliseum. The whole Dodger issue was NFL spin
to make the Coliseum proposal look more credible to those owners
who still do not feel the Coliseum is a viable site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine. But we have no intention of staying on hold while
they try to sell the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the NFL gave Los Angeles a conditional bid for a 32nd
franchise, giving interests here six months to formulate a stadium
plan and ownership group that would meet league standards.
Tuesday's visit by the committee is expected to produce a consensus
on the two stadium sites.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports Wednesday said that Ovitz was planning to
withdraw his Carson proposal and lend his support to the New
Coliseum group. Sweeney said Ovitz denied that in a telephone
conversation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement issued by Ovitz on Wednesday did not refute the
report. ``If it's not true,'' said Sweeney, ``then why didn't he
deny it in the statement?''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's statement says he met with Paul Tagliabue in March and
told the NFL commissioner that ``my partners and I were committed
to doing whatever was in the best interest of bringing NFL football
back to Los Angeles, even if that meant voluntarily withdrawing our
Carson stadium proposal. The NFL encouraged us to continue to
pursue our Carson proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Tuesday, we expect the NFL will select a stadium plan on
which to focus its efforts over the coming months ... We will
support the NFL in whatever decision is made ... (and) continue to
pursue our goal of owning and operating a NFL franchise in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Press-Telegram last month, Ovitz said
that while Carson had the most to offer, ``you can't force (the
NFL) to choose your site. They'll make the decision, and if they
tell me to play in a sandlot, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ovitz and New Coliseum representatives deny there have
been any meetings between the two sides, sources close to the two
groups say Ron Burkle, a key member of the Ovitz ownership group,
met with New Coliseum partner Eli Broad a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carson officials are both disappointed and angry over the way
things have progressed in the last few weeks. Since the NFL
meetings in Phoenix, officials have been wary of Ovitz shifting his
alliance. Sweeney, Mayor Peter Fajardo and other officials have for
weeks urged Ovitz to help coordinate a public show of support by
Carson citizens that would help convince the NFL that Carson was a
viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shot all of our ideas down,'' said Michael Padilla, a
member of Carson's economic development committee. ``He's St. Jude.
He sold us out.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be clear that the league favors the New Coliseum,
several issues still need to be addressed before anyone can claim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers: NFL sources floated a story this week that the
Dodgers may consider moving to a new stadium to be built next to
the Coliseum. Two NFL sources said the idea came out of league
discussions on how to make the Coliseum and Exposition Park look
more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger officials confirmed the league and L.A. civic officials
broached the idea, but they essentially pooh-poohed it. Despite the
denials, the NFL may try to keep the Dodger angle alive so as to
make the Coliseum proposal look better to rank-and-file owners wary
of returning to a stadium that lost two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Money: A source from one of the competing groups said expansion
committee chairman Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner,
is expected to drop this shoe before the committee arrives next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria keeps changing, but it's my understanding that
$150 million is the minimal amount an expansion city needs to
have,'' said the source. ``And how does the league say yes to the
Coliseum when it could get more from Carson?''
</P>
<P>
   Carson has signed off on a $180 million investment for its
stadium-and-mall complex. The Coliseum's proposal refers to more
than $300 million in public money, but only $40 million of it is
new money. Most of the Coliseum's public money is in the form of
land value and already completed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Strange bedfellows: The league may be overlooking how difficult
it will be for the various parties to work together. Ed Roski has
carried the Coliseum torch from the beginning, and it was Roski who
added Broad to the ownership team when the league said the Kings
owner was overextended.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz, meanwhile, his his own flotilla of part owners, including
actor Tom Cruise and the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Jerry West,
and it's hard to imagine the former Hollywood agent accepting a
role as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution may be the creation of a titular head of a
Coliseum ownership group, like former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley.
He is owed a debt by Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan for bowing
out of the NFL sweepstakes on behalf of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   League surveys: The league also has to deal with its own
internal surveys which indicate Los Angeles is not frothing for a
NFL franchise. Both proposals are based on a massive influx of
money from private seat licenses, $100 million at the Coliseum and
$70 million in Carson, but league studies say both are too
optimistic.

YUGOSLAVS STEP UP EXPULSIONS IN KOSOVO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Yugoslav forces in southeastern Kosovo are
stepping up a campaign of expelling ethnic Albanians from across
southeastern Kosovo, according to refugees crossing the border here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of Yugoslav attacks, growing food shortages and the
latest Yugoslav policy of allowing Albanians to freely cross the
border here has swollen the flood of refugees fleeing from Kosovo.
More than 3,000 disheveled and dispirited ethnic Albanians trudged
across the border here Wednesday clutching their life possessions
in tote bags and backpacks, triple the number who entered the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. refugee officials, while cautioning that their information
about what is happening inside Kosovo is limited, said a new exodus
of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo could be dawning. ``It could very
well be that very large numbers of people are coming,'' said Paula
Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
adding that the situation in Kosovo was ``probably deteriorating
very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees painted a stark picture of thousands of people trying
to flee southeastern Kosovo as the Yugoslav expulsion campaign
spreads outward from the town of Urosevac, the site of a Yugoslav
army barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, refugees said, Serbian paramilitaries
and Yugoslav soldiers have attacked ethnic Albanian villages in a
20-by-5-mile valley of rich farm land that hooks through
southeastern Kosovo. Villages along the Macedonian border are also
being attacked, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Expulsions that began last week in villages around the town of
Urosevac have now been extended to Albanian villages in three
different directions: those around Ljipljane, about five miles to
the north; Kacanik, 10 miles to the south, and Gnjilane, about 15
miles to the West, refugees said. Those who refuse to leave their
homes are killed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians remain trapped in small
pockets in the hills bordering the now nearly deserted valley, an
area that Western diplomats said was not a center of activity by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic- Albanian guerrilla group
that has been fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the villages from Gnjilane to the border here were
empty,'' said Hysen Hoti, a 57-year-old construction worker who
said Serb paramilitaries forced him out of the village of Kmetovic
on Wednesday. ``You could see no people, only domestic animals and
cows wandering.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who fled from their villages to Urosevac are so
desperate to leave Kosovo that they are overwhelming the region's
transportation system. Over the last two days, word that the border
was open has spread in Kosovo, refugees said. They said that
thousands of ethnic Albanians jammed the Urosevac train station
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials brought in an additional train and three
buses to expedite the ethnic Albanians' flight, but their
generosity apparently has its limits. Refugees who were there on
Tuesday said that each departing ethnic Albanian was forced to pay
$20 for a ride into exile.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers on the train from Urosevac said there were about 200
people at the station in Kacanik, a town on the way south toward
Macedonia, U.N. officials said. But the train was too full to let
them on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The refugees' problems do not end when they cross the border.
U.N. officials said that the Macedonian government, which was
initially criticized for callous treatment of the refugees, forced
1,000 Kosovo Albanians to wait in buses at the border for seven
hours before allowing them to go on to refugee camps. The officials
said another 1,000 to 1,500 people, presumably ethnic Albanians,
were waiting to cross from Yugoslavia into Macedonia near the town
of Kumanovo Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian police were holding the group in a no-man's land, Ms.
Ghedini said, because they do not consider the area an official
border crossing. Two weeks ago in a similar situation, the
Macedonians eventually allowed the refugees to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia's prime minister, Ljupco Georgievski, said on Tuesday
that he was unaware of delays at the border. Georgievski said his
government had at first been overwhelmed by the ``catastrophe''
that unfolded on its doorstep and was simply trying to keep the
situation under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``No state can allow the opening of its frontier, and that
anyone can enter uncontrolled,'' he said. ``There had to be some
kind of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships they have suffered since the NATO bombings
began on March 24, ethnic Albanians arriving here Wednesday voiced
strong support for the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   They conceded that the Yugoslav units now rolling through
southeastern Kosovo appeared undaunted by the NATO assault. But
they insisted that the bombing was slowing the Yugoslavs and that
the expulsions would have occurred whether or not NATO struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the same thing in the southwest of Kosovo even before
NATO bombed,'' said Skenderi Ifusi, who was forced from his village
near Urosevac six days before.
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees said they, too, supported the airstrikes but
added that it was a mistake for NATO not to have anticipated mass
expulsions. They called for NATO ground troops or the arming of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, and immediate air drops of food into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Faruk Sinani, who was expelled from a village near Urosevac last
week, said he believed that many of the Albanians remaining in
Kosovo were trapped. But he insisted that others were intentionally
staying behind, believing that their liberators may soon appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of them are waiting for NATO,'' he said. ``Nothing else.''

McNOWN'S STOCK RISES QUICKLY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the past three weeks, former UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown has been to Portland twice, Orlando, Miami, Chicago and
Kansas City. Before that, he spent six weeks at an elite training
center in Florida. He also took an FBI lie detector test, underwent
a battery of physical and psychological tests for NFL teams,
participated in the Senior Bowl and severed his controversial
relationship with a convicted mobster who got his start in the
concrete business.
</P>
<P>
   So, how was your winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hectic,'' McNown said. ``I've been racking up the
mileage, but at a cost. I haven't had a chance to get into a
workout regimen. But I'm excited about getting into some structure
as soon as I get drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and mobster Dominic Montemarano aside, McNown spent the
winter preparing for this weekend's NFL draft _ with seemingly
positive results. With a slew of quarterbacks available, McNown has
raised his value dramatically. Considered a second- or third-round
pick after the Rose Bowl, he could go as high as 12th or 15th
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question he's a first-round pick,'' said Larry
Kennan, executive director of the the NFL Coaches Association and a
former assistant coach who tutored McNown at the International
Performance Institute in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three or four months, he has solidified himself
as a first-round guy. He had a wonderful career at UCLA, but NFL
people were saying he was a little short and didn't have a real
strong arm. But as they've watched him work, they see he's tall
enough and has a strong enough arm. And everything else is there.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown, who led UCLA to 20 wins in his last two seasons, was the
anti-prospect. Whereas many first rounders have questionable
character and sensational talent, McNown oozed integrity but needed
to prove what NFL scouts call the ``measureables'' _ size, speed,
arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   He's not as fast, not as tall and can't throw as hard as
Syracuse's Donovan McNabb, Oregon's Akili Smith, Central Florida's
Daunte Culpepper and Kentucky's Tim Couch, which means he'll
probably be the fifth quarterback selected. His greatest attributes
_ his toughness, intelligence, knack for big plays and success _
simply aren't as important to NFL scouts as the measureables.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, McNown closely resembles another college
quarterback who was overlooked on draft day (second round, 42nd
selection) but has become one of the NFL's most exciting young
players, Arizona's Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny . . . all of a sudden you're a better prospect if
you throw one mile-an-hour faster,'' McNown said. ``A guy can
become a great passer and leader with a differential of one
mile-an-hour. It seems like they're missing the forest for the
trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McNown figured his game needed some landscaping.
After the Rose Bowl, he headed to the International Performance
Institute (IPI) to join a handful of prospects for six weeks of
training. He rose at 7:30 and spent half the day doing mobility
drills, strength exercises and speed workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cade's prescription was designed to address what people
thought were his limiting factors,'' said Mark Verstegen, IPI's
chief trainer. ``Every step he took, he got feedback.''
</P>
<P>
   After a mid-afternoon break, McNown executed a series of
position-specific drills. He worked on technique and accuracy and
emphasized the arm-strength throws NFL scouts wanted to see _ the
20-yard slants and 15-yard outs.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis in mid-February,
McNown stunned scouts with a 4.7-second 40-yard dash _
approximately 0.2 seconds faster than expected _ and executed every
throw asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPI really helped Cade,'' said Kennan, a former assistant
for the Raiders, Denver, Indianapolis, Seattle, New Orleans and New
England. ``It showed what kind of guy he is. A lot of guys wouldn't
have wanted to give up six or eight weeks to work eight hours each
day. They'd want to party. But Cade heard all the talk about not
having a strong enough arm or being fast enough, and he used that
as a motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McNown's relationship with a former mob boss made
headlines and prompted a brief inquiry by the FBI, he says it did
not derail his pre-draft routine. He had already gotten the
training he needed in Bradenton and impressed the scouts in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much to do about nothing,'' he said. ``I understood
what it could do if it continued in the NFL. But it's too bad for
the other guy. His name was smeared and nobody was doing anything
wrong. Everybody knows there was nothing to it. It was in and out
of the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown recently held a workout for scouts at UCLA and has spent
much of April interviewing with various teams. He has no idea where
he'll get picked, and if his detached approach to the Heisman
Trophy race was any indication, he doesn't much care. McNown always
was _ and is _ about proving himself.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, as a high school senior, he was UCLA's No. 2
quarterback recruit behind Brock Huard, who eventually chose
Washington. Now, Huard is behind McNown as an NFL prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pride thing for me, I don't care where I get
drafted,'' McNown said. ``Ultimately, if you play well for a few
years the money will come. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense I'm ideal for is a coach who's smart enough to
look at what he has. That's what UCLA did better than anything
else. They looked at what they had and figured the best way to
utilize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like McNown.

WIZARDS DEFLATE KNICKS BY WINNING 95-89 IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The New York Knicks cannot enjoy a good thing. They
came to the MCI Center floating on a three-game winning streak, and
left in disbelief after a dispirited Wizards team had more nerve
than the Knicks did in the end, taking a 95-89 victory in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards' Tracy Murray curled away from Allan Houston and
knocked down a 21-foot jumper with 1 minute 4 seconds left in
overtime to give the Wizards a 91-89 lead. After Latrell Sprewell
missed a leaner, and the tap-back escaped Marcus Camby and Larry
Johnson, the Wizards grabbed the rebound and Otis Thorpe scored on
an up-and-under move to give his team a 93-89 lead with 25 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 games left in the season, the Knicks (21-18) are hanging
onto seventh place in the Eastern Conference after suffering
Wednesday night's loss without the injured Patrick Ewing. But it
wasn't the big men like Camby and Johnson who failed coach Jeff Van
Gundy; it was the combined shooting effort of 9 for 33 by Houston
and Sprewell. Camby led the Knicks with 18 points off the bench,
while the Wizards (15-23) were led by Thorpe and Rod Strickland,
who both scored 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards broke an 81-81 tie in regulation when Murray was
left alone by Sprewell for a 3-pointer with 30 seconds left. Then,
after a miss from 3-point range by Sprewell, Charlie Ward grabbed
the rebound, stepped back on the wing, and hit a game-tying
3-pointer for New York with 18.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards had a chance to win the game in regulation when
Strickland drove and kicked the ball out to an open Jeff McInnis,
who missed a 19-foot jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   To gain an edge in overtime, Johnson, using a nifty reverse
layup against the contact of Ben Wallace, created a 3-point play to
give the Knicks a 89-86 lead with 2:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   After a free throw by Strickland and a driving layup from
Thorpe, the game was tied again with 1:38 left.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the scene was set for the Knicks to throw sand
in the face of the skinny kids on the beach, the Wizards. Already
thin at center and undersized at forward, the Wizards were missing
the starters Juwan Howard (ankle) and Terry Davis (shin). This is a
team on the skids. Their coach, Bernie Bickerstaff, was fired last
week and they had lost five of the six games before Wednesday
night's.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, meanwhile, were on a fast break to recovery. They
had won three straight, including their last two in blowouts.
Simmering with optimism, they faced the Wizards with an eye on
moving from seventh place to sixth, and possibly to fifth if
Detroit lost. One week ago, after a miserable loss to Charlotte,
the Knicks were in 10th place and had no thoughts of grabbing a
top-four spot in the Eastern Conference. They were gasping.
</P>
<P>
   ``From outhouse to home-court advantage,'' Van Gundy said before
Wednesday night's game. ``That's a big swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were thinking big. But first they had to get by the
Wizards, and they had to do it without Ewing. That proved to be a
problem as the game wore on. With Sprewell and Houston shooting
with a cold touch, the Knicks were left to lean on the offensively
challenged Chris Dudley to stay ahead through three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After the game was tied, 47-47, with eight minutes left in the
third quarter, Dudley scored on three consecutive possessions,
keeping New York even with the Wizards. The Knicks opened some
space after Johnson scored on a 3-point play and followed with an
encore that left the crowd in awe. Showing surprising spring,
Johnson exploded to the rim for a baseline dunk past a lethargic
Thorpe to give the Knicks a 62-59 lead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   This was a little tighter than the Knicks had expected. Ewing
was missed. After leaving the Knicks victory against Philadelphia
on Tuesday with a sore Achilles' tendon, Ewing told Van Gundy this
morning that he was not going to be able to go Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem critical since Dudley and Camby had been
playing so well. But the Knicks didn't count on their two pivotal
scorers, Sprewell and Houston, shooting a combined 5 for 17 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   After building a 10-point lead midway through the second
quarter, the Knicks went 1 for 10 and had three turnovers in the
final six minutes of the half. Strickland and Mitch Richmond took
advantage of the suddenly sluggish Knicks, and led the Wizards on a
11-2 run. Washington trailed by just 42-41 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   That was an uncomfortable position for the Knicks, who in
Ewing's absence could not take advantage of the small, piecemeal
front line the Wizards offered. Still, Ewing's absence has not been
their undoing in most cases this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to imagine the Knicks slipping past Indiana,
Orlando or Miami without Ewing, their offense has been more fluid
in his absence this season against the mediocre teams in the
league.

GORTON FACES CHALLENGE FROM WASHINGTON TRIBES  
PANEL WANTS MFUME TO RUN FOR BALTIMORE MAYOR IN FALL  
DAVIS FACES TOUGH CHOICE ON PROPOSITION 187 APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Calif., Md., Wash.)  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has been at odds with Native
Americans going all the way back to the 1970s when, as the state
attorney general, he tried to limit the amount of salmon tribes
could take from Washington waters.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as chairman of the Interior Appropriations
subcommittee, he has further antagonized tribes, not just in the
state but elsewhere, by advocating tighter tribal budgets and
tougher tribal laws.
</P>
<P>
   The senator argues that government policies too often elevate
the rights of Native Americans above the rights of other Americans.
Indian leaders counter that he has it all backward.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the ability of Native Americans to influence
Indian policy and those who make it, like Gorton, has always been
limited, not just because of the relatively small number of Native
Americans but because of a severe shortage of tribal money to pour
into political causes. But that is changing, and therein lies a new
threat to Gorton, who is up for re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of casino gambling on reservations, along with
the flow of natural gas and oil money, has left some tribes flush.
Mostly they have been using their new-found wealth to lobby for
more casinos and other needs, but increasingly they also are
beginning to dump money into political races.
</P>
<P>
   Indian money played no significant role in Gorton's 1994
re-election campaign. Two years later, the nation's 550-plus tribes
collectively spent less than $1.5 million on federal contests,
including the presidential race. But in 1998, Indian spending
jumped sharply, with at least one tribe spending some $400,000 on
congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Indian leaders say, are the 2000 elections.
Native American tribes plan to spend even more to elect candidates
friendly to their causes, with special attention toward defeating
Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Allen, the president of the National Congress of American
Indians, predicted recently that there would be a ``scramble'' by
tribes to pour big money into that contest if it appeared there was
a good chance to defeat ``the dean of the anti-Indian movement.''
But that is a big ``if,'' Allen concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Political pros say that the senator could be vulnerable, given
that he has displeased not only Native Americans but many of the
state's trial lawyers, labor bosses and environmentalists. Still,
they note, the Democrat with the best shot at defeating him, Gov.
Gary Locke, has said he will not run.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton is taking no chances. He says he needs to raise $7
million for his run and warns supporters in his latest fund-raising
letter that ``Indian tribes flush with gambling dollars'' are
willing to spend ``whatever it takes'' to beat him. &QL;

<P>
   Panel Wants Mfume to Run For Baltimore Mayor in Fall
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore announced last
December that he would not seek a fourth term, many top business
and political figures in the city and elsewhere in Maryland have
been casting about for a strong candidate to replace him in this
fall's election. Without the right candidate, they fear, the
impressive urban rebirth that Baltimore has enjoyed over the past
quarter of a century might falter.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the city's register of wills and three little-known
community activists, at least one member of the City Council is
talking about running, and a former member already is in the race.
But neither of the latter two strikes the search party of top
business and political leaders as having the right stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So a draft _ one with enticing come-ons _ is under way by the
search group, whose members include state Comptroller William
Donald Schaefer, a former mayor and governor; Peter G. Angelos, the
owner of the Baltimore Orioles; Otis Warren and William Adams, both
developers; Glenard S. Middleton, president of the Baltimore
Chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, and members of the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   For the right candidate, the group says, it has the clout to
change the rules of the game, to make election all but a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the draft effort is Kweisi Mfume, a native
Baltimorean who is president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, based in Baltimore, and who before
that served 10 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and seven
years on the Baltimore City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume says he is committed to getting the NAACP solidly back on
its feet after years of drift and has no time to run for mayor. But
the draft leaders note that he has yet to say ``no'' with
Shermanesque finality.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were they deterred when someone pointed out recently that
Mfume lives in the suburbs, not the city proper, and thus could not
meet the requirement that a mayoral candidate be a city resident
for a least a year.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded the state Legislature to rewrite the law. Under a
bill signed on Tuesday by Gov. Parris N. Glendening, only a
six-month residency is required _ meaning that Mfume still has time
to move in, and jump in, before the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   What about the cut in salary Mfume would have to take if
elected, given that he makes $220,000 annually, more than twice the
$95,000 paid to Baltimore mayors? No problem, the draft group says,
promising to persuade the City Council to raise the mayoral pay to
$150,000 annually. Beyond that, group members say, there are
speeches to be made for fat fees and boards to serve on for still
more fees, provided there are no conflicts interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume still insists he has no time to run for office, but he
recently bought a $300,000 condominium just a few blocks from City
Hall. &QL;

<P>
   Davis Faces Tough Choice On Proposition 187 Appeal
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California is in a political quandary.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat elected last fall with heavy Hispanic support, he
must decide within the next few days whether to appeal a federal
court decision that declared Proposition 187 unconstitutional. That
proposition, passed by voters in 1994 at the strong urging of Gov.
Pete Wilson, Davis' Republican predecessor, shut off benefits to
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In California, most illegal immigrants are Hispanic. They saw
the measure as unusually harsh _ as did most other Hispanics in the
state, not the least being those able to vote.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many Hispanics faithfully voted Republican. But in
last fall's election, they went heavily Democratic, contributing
significantly to the defeat of Dan Lungren, Davis' Republican
opponent. That vengeful switch has not been lost on Davis, who
knows as well as anyone that Hispanics make up more than a third of
California's population, with the percentage growing daily.
</P>
<P>
   But his quandary is even more complex. The other important
figure that he must keep in mind is that Proposition 187 did not
pass with just Republican backing. It also had heavy Democratic
support.
</P>
<P>
   Gray also must consider whether pressing an appeal might
seriously damage California's economic ties with Mexico. In recent
years, trade with Mexico has become a major factor in the state's
economic well being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the question of whether Davis, as California's
top official, is duty-bound to follow through with an appeal of a
court ruling that struck down a state law. If legal experts
conclude that he must, he just might find political refuge in that
conclusion. But thus far the experts can't agree on anything.

GLAUS STARTS FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND -- Troy Glaus is off to a hot start, so hot that he was
the Angels' cleanup hitter Wednesday. Upon seeing his name in the
No. 4 spot after his arrival to the visiting clubhouse at the
Oakland Coliseum, Glaus said he took it in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking the same thing I always think every day -- I'm
excited to be in the lineup, he said. ``It doesn't matter where you
hit. If you've got guys in scoring position, whether you're hitting
first, fourth or ninth, you're expected to drive them in.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who took a .452 (14 for 31) average into Wednesday's
game, replaced Tim Salmon as the cleanup hitter. Salmon hit third.
Glaus said he hit cleanup in one game last season at Chicago, but
never hit fourth at UCLA -- he always hit third.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins was asked before Wednesday's game
if there was a danger of putting too much pressure on a young
player like the 22-year-old Glaus by hitting him fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only if they think they've got to do more than when they were
hitting sixth, he said. ``He's going up there feeling good,
swinging good. Now might be the time to run him up there.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds was examined by Dr. Lewis Yocum Wednesday and
reported the center fielder's right shoulder is improving. However,
the shoulder -- which has a cyst in the muscle and wear and tear to
the labrum -- does not feel good enough for Edmonds to swing a bat
without pain.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, whose medication and physical therapy program have been
altered, won't be ready by the weekend for the Angels three-game
series against the Mariners at Edison Field. Instead, Edmonds will
be re-evaluated this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning of Tuesday's game against the A's, Orlando
Palmeiro mistakenly thought the hit-and-run sign had been put on
when it was actually the bunt sign. So Palmeiro broke from first
and was thrown out at second after the A's pitched out.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was upset about it after the game, and Wednesday he did
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to confuse guys with signs, so they'll be changed
today, Collins said. ``(The signs) are not real hard, but because
we've missed some, we're going to change 'em.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Terry Clark, who graduated from La Puente High and
attended Mt. San Antonio College, combined with two other pitchers
to throw a no-hitter for the A's triple-A team in Vancouver on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 38, started and went four innings, and was followed by
Bill King (four innings) and Anthony Chavez (one inning). Clark
began his professional career in 1979, and has included playing
parts of two seasons with the Angels (1988 and '89).
</P>
<P>
   According to an A's spokesman, the club will honor former
pitcher Catfish Hunter before their game against the Dodgers on
June 12 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and A's finish their series today (1:05) at the
Oakland Coliseum. Omar Olivares (1-0, 0.00 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Oakland's Gil Heredia (1-0, 3.55).

TEEN-AGER GETS 70 YEARS IN BOY'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ After his mother had been ordered out of
court for an angry outburst at prosecutors, a teen-ager who pleaded
guilty to strangling a boy selling candy door to door was sentenced
on Wednesday to 70 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Manzie, 17, was sentenced for the 1997 death of Edward
Werner, 11, a sixth grader who went to the Manzie home in Jackson
Township while selling candy and gift wrap for a school
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Manzie's comments about himself to psychologists and
psychiatrists after the murder, Judge Peter J. Giovine of New
Jersey Superior Court called the tall, gaunt teen-ager a homicidal
predator who was impulsive and unable to control his anger and who
``thought he was programmed to be a child molester.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inescapable he's a very real risk of committing another
crime,'' Giovine said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a New Jersey law passed several months ago, people
convicted of major felonies must serve 85 percent of their
sentences. That means Manzie must serve 59{ years, and would be
nearly 77 before he receives his first chance for release from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He is thought to be one of the youngest people sentenced under
the new law. Previously, convicted felons generally served a third
of their sentence before becoming eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Manzie sat quietly at the defense table, his wrists shackled to
a thick brown belt, as Giovine denounced him for a lifetime of
``aggressive and hostile behavior.'' It included, the judge said,
bringing a knife to a kindergarten class as a young boy and, in
later years, torturing his family's cats and dog, setting fire to
his room, and then strangling the Werner boy, who at 70 pounds was
half his size, with an electrical cord after he had ordered the boy
to strip and tried to commit an oral sex act on him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentencing, Manzie apologized for the murder and the
suffering he had caused the boy's parents, Edward and Valerie
Werner, and their two other children. He said he had pleaded guilty
last month to spare them a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a sheet of white paper, Manzie said: ``I realize
how terrible it must have been for all of them and therefore I
couldn't have gone to trial. I need to take responsibility for what
I did. Although pleading guilty won't make everything better, at
least it's ended this and it will prevent additional pain of going
to trial. I still can't figure out why I did what I did. But this
is the way things work out for whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Manzie's lawyer, Michael Critchley, appealed
for leniency, arguing that his client had been severely depressed
and mentally ill since puberty and was, in the months before the
murder, the victim of a twice-convicted, 43-year-old pedophile,
Stephen Simmons, from Long Island. Manzie, who was 15 at the time
of the murder, was undergoing psychiatric counseling as as
outpatient.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the murder, Critchley argued, Manzie was
under additional stress because he had agreed to help law
enforcement officers in neighboring Monmouth County obtain
incriminating evidence against Simmons in taped telephone
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was being twisted and he was being used,'' Critchley said.
``As a result, he snapped. He was suffering a load he could not
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Giovine did not seem swayed by Critchley's arguments about his
client's fragile mental state. He also showed little patience for
Manzie's mother, Dolores, when she angrily interrupted an assistant
Ocean County prosecutor, William Cunningham, as he began
criticizing her motives for wanting her son committed to a
long-term psychiatric care in the days before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham opened his argument for a long prison term by
contending that Mrs. Manzie wanted her son committed for her
benefit, not his.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother wanted to get rid of him,'' Cunningham said. He
quoted her as telling mental health workers, ``I don't want the kid
anymore. Basically I can't be around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's comments seemed to undercut Mrs. Manzie's appeal to
Giovine a few minutes earlier to show mercy for her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my only son,'' she said, her voice barely audible. Then
she recounted how she and her husband, Nicholas, had been rebuffed
in their efforts to obtain long-term psychiatric care for their son
in the days before the murder.

SOROS GIVING $15 MILLION FOR MEDICAL-ETHICS PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Soros, the billionaire financier, plans to
spend $15 million on a new program to de-emphasize profit in
medical care, develop altruistic service programs for young doctors
and encourage consumer groups to join with physicians to monitor
the quality of care better.
</P>
<P>
   Soros said the money would pay for research and lectures from
scholars on the role of professionalism and ethics in modern
medicine, and help develop programs for young doctors to learn how
to provide medical services to patients outside of the medical
mainstream, like new immigrants or the homeless. The program will
also solicit grant applications from groups hoping to form
physician-patient alliances to help define priorities in care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money we're committing is tiny compared to the
field,'' Soros said in an interview Tuesday. ``But we hope to make
a difference in the way health care is provided in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   He is announcing the program in a speech Thursday at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In his prepared
text, Soros, who made his fortune trading in currency markets,
said: ``Health care companies are not in business to heal people or
save lives; they provide health care to make profits. In effect, in
the necessary effort to control health care costs through the
market mechanism, power has shifted from physicians and patients to
insurance companies and other purchasers of services.''
</P>
<P>
   David J. Rothman, who teaches the history of medicine at
Columbia, will lead the program, which is called ``Medicine as a
Profession.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 20th century, Rothman said, medicine was not
very lucrative. ``It began to be in 1965 with Medicare,'' he said.
``Medicine was given a blank check: You order it and the government
will pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said he had assembled a variety of scholars and experts
for the program's advisory board. To address health care as an
economic and political system, he has recruited Eli Ginsberg, a
health economist; Marc A. Rodwin, author of the 1995 book
``Medicine, Money, and Morals: Physicians' Conflicts of Interest,''
and James R. Tallon Jr., a former New York state assemblyman who is
now head of a health-care philanthropic fund, the United Hospital
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   To look at health care in minority communities, Rothman has
recruited Susana Morales, an expert on minority patient care with
Cornell Internal Medicine Associates, and Gerald E. Thomson, a
senior associate dean of Columbia's medical school.
</P>
<P>
   And to address broad issues of medicine and society, Rothman has
recruited Norman Daniels, a bioethicist at Tufts; David Blumenthal,
a Harvard professor specializing in quality of care, and Jerome
Kassirer, the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.

MASS PROTEST AGAINST BUS TERMINAL'S USE OF NONUNION JANITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, it was a perfect
homecoming _ the New York janitors' union he long headed held one
of the city's most spirited labor demonstrations in years Wednesday
as 5,000 union members rallied at the Port Authority midtown bus
terminal to protest the use of nonunion janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in Bryant Park, thousands of union members, often
shouting and blowing whistles, marched two blocks west to the bus
terminal, where they denounced Laro Service Systems, the contractor
responsible for cleaning the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen members of Sweeney's old local, Local 32B-32J of
the Service Employees International Union, have been on strike
since 1996, when Laro won the contract to clean the terminal,
resisted having a union and refused to keep all the janitors who
were working there.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Balanoff, the trustee overseeing Local 32B-32J, said,
``We're demonstrating against the below-standard wages and benefits
that Laro is paying.''
</P>
<P>
   For the two decades that Local 32B-32J was headed by Gus Bevona,
whom the parent union forced out two months ago because of his high
salary and his penthouse at the local's headquarters, the local
never held large demonstrations. The 55,000-member local earned a
reputation as a slothful giant.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local 32B-32J is back,'' said Sweeney, who headed the local in
the 1970s. ``It should be obvious to the Port Authority and to Laro
Service Systems that we're back to stay. We're here today to
deliver a message to the Port Authority and every office building
and every residential building that we are first-class workers and
we will not allow you to treat us like second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   In a show of solidarity, there were hundreds of protests from
the hotel workers, laborers, operating engineers and needle trades
unions. Dozens of demonstrators held printed signs that said,
``Shame on Port Authority, Shame on Laro.''
</P>
<P>
   Laro chairman Robert Bertuglia said in an interview that all of
the union's sound and fury was unwarranted. He said he was ready to
sign a contract with Local 32B-32J and that Laro paid its workers
well and provided health insurance and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how some of these things get said,'' Bertuglia
said. ``These people are being paid everything their union brothers
and sisters are getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many protest signs called on Laro to pay a ``living wage,'' but
Bertuglia noted that the Port Authority required his company to pay
the prevailing janitor's wage of $15.09 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bertuglia said it was wrong for the union leaders to accuse Laro
of being antiunion because his company, which employees nearly 200
workers at the bus terminal, had contracts with numerous unions at
other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible that they think we're antiunion,''
Bertuglia said. ``I'll be more than happy to make peace. I don't
need all the publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ira Sturm, a lawyer for Local 32B-32J, said Laro has fought for
years against having a union represent the bus terminal's janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Balanoff, the local's trustee, said that before Laro signed a
union contract, the local wanted Laro to restore seniority to the
bus terminal janitors who worked there before Laro arrived. The
janitors Laro kept on lost their seniority when Laro hired them.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Gilmore, who has cleaned toilets at the bus terminal for
10 years, said she lost her seniority when Laro became the cleaning
company. As a result, she said, her vacation time dropped to one
week a year from three weeks. She also complained that Laro heaped
on far more work than its predecessor and that Laro's health plan
was not as good as 32B-32J's because it did not pay for her
diabetes medication.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gilmore said she felt glorious that thousands of workers
were marching in support of her cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not fighting for welfare, you're fighting for fair
share,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of the speakers at the
rally. ``If you can fight for human rights and dignity in Kosovo,
then you can fight for it in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Morrison, a Port Authority spokesman, said the dispute was
between the union local and Laro and not between the union local
and the authority. He said Laro won the contract three years ago
