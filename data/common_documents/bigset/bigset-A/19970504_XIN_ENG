<HEADLINE> Saive Chopped Down in Men's Singles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 3 (Xinhua) -- World No. 8 Jean-Michael
Saive of Belgium, whose mediocre game against defensive player has
cost him dearly, bowed out to Japanese chopper Hiroshi Shibutani
at the men's singles third round at the World Table Tennis
Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saive, whose singles run at the last world championships was
ended by Chinese chopper-and-attacker Ding Song, lost to the
tenacious Japanese 18-21, 21-16, 21-12, 19-21, 12-21.
</P>
<P>
The seventh-ranked Ding moved into the fourth game after
beating German Steffan Fetzner 21-12, 21-10, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
World No. 4 Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus, tipped as a title
hopeful here, routed Chinese teenager Ma Lin 21-16, 21-9, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, 21, will take on Chinese Wang Liqin, who moved into
the last 16 with a four-set victory over Carl Prean of England.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 18, dashed England's last hope in the third round,
beating Prean 21-18, 21-14, 15-21, 21-10. England now has no
player left in either men's or women's singles contention.
</P>
<P>
Wang, from Shanghai, had upset Belgian Jean-Philippe Saive and
former world champion Jorgen Persson in the previous rounds, while
Prean reached the second round with a giant-killing victory over
South Korea's 1988 Olympic champion Yoo Nam Kyu.
</P>
<P>
China's reigning world champion Kong Linghui sailed into the
fourth round with a 21-10, 22-20, 21-13 triumph over Liu Song of
Argentina. He will play against Austrian Werner Schlager for a
quarter-final berth.
</P>
<P>
Schlager had nipped Kong 2-1 in the Qatar Open in February.
</P>
<P>
Chinese veteran Ma Wenge also advanced as he outlasted
Kalinikos Kreanga of Greece 21-19, 19-21, 24-26, 25-23, 21-17.

Macao athletes who are heading for the 2nd East Asian Games in
Pusan, South Korea, between May 10 and 19.
</P>
<P>
Li-Ning donated a total of 170,000 yuan (about 19,540 US

<HEADLINE> Irish Gov't Urges New Bid for Ulster Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick
Spring has pledged that the Irish government is looking forward to
working "immediately" with Britain's new Labor government to give
a fresh impetus to the stalled Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview today, Spring said, "We
have got to use this opportunity to get to grips with the Northern
Ireland problems. If we meet Tony Blair (Britain's new prime
minister) next week, we want to work with him immediately to get
to grips with these (problems)."
</P>
<P>
Spring, who is also Irish foreign minister, urged Sinn Fein,
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and other
political forces in Northern Ireland to press for an immediate IRA
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"The first requirement for everybody now is to have a
cease-fire and to allow everybody into (the all-party peace)
talks," Spring said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have
achieved the political party's biggest victory in more than 40
years by taking two British parliamentary seats in the just-ended
British general election.
</P>
<P>
The British government has ruled out the possibility of Sinn
Fein taking part in the Northern Ireland peace talks if the IRA,
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland, refuses to call
a cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Arrives in Iraq to Review Oil-for-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. official arrived here
this afternoon for a six-day visit to review the outcome of the
implementation of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food deal signed on May
20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yasushi Akashi, U.N. Assistant Secretary General for
Humanitarian Affairs, told reporters that his visit aimed at
resolving difficulties in the distribution of food in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to speed up the distribution of food and other goods
bought by Iraq under the oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six month period
to buy food and medicine for its people.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis have been suffering under U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the slow distribution of food and other
necessities imported by Iraq to some "political, bureaucratic,
operational and technical" difficulties. But he didn't give
further details.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the United states of deliberately hampering
the approval of food and medicine contracts it signed with foreign
companies in line with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Akashi asked the Iraqis to be patient and said he is determined
to make the distribution more efficient.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Akashi will hold talks with Iraqi and
U.N. officials here and visit northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Postpones Visit to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat postponed his meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak here until tomorrow, Palestinian
Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi Qadra said today.
</P>
<P>
Calling Egypt "the real sponsor of the peace process," Qadra
said the meeting between the two Arab leaders comes within the
framework of continuous coordination and consultation on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
intensified its diplomatic drive to rescue the peace talks
stranded since Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu sent
bulldozers on March 18 to build a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will be the fourth Arab leader Mubarak meets in a week,
following his talks with Kuwaiti, Saudi and Syrian presidents.
</P>
<P>
The visit would precede another swing in the region by
U.S. Mideast Peace Envoy Dennis Ross starting on Monday since his
last mission two weeks ago led to no tangible U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
The American effort has been focused to date on what they call
security for Israel, or zero terrorism, according to observers.
</P>
<P>
Ross carries with him several "new American proposals to break
the stalemate in the peace march especially on the
Israeli-Palestinian track, said a U.S. State Department today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Washington, in fact, had proposed those
ideas to Israeli, Palestinian and Egyptian leaders during their
visits to the U.S. last month.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of renewed U.S. diplomatic shuttling in the Mideast,
Arafat, in a message to Clinton, outlined the principles through
which peace process could be brought back on track, Palestinian
Local Administration Minister Saeb Erekat told Amman Radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat demanded Israel to halt unilateral activities related to
settlement policy in Palestinian areas and to suspend the
construction of the Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) settlement in East
Jerusalem and confiscation of Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The message also stressed that signed agreements between the
Palestinians and the Israelis should be respected, Erekat said.

AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali left here today for Doha for a two-day official visit to
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit, Majali will have talks with Qatari
leaders on ways of boosting bilateral relations in all
fields and on a number of Arab and regional issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
This was the first visit by Majali to an Arab country since he
formed his current government in March.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Majali, accompanied by a delegation made up of
ministers of energy and labor, minister of state for media affairs
and other Jordanian senior officials, came at a time when the
Middle East peace process was brought to a standstill due to
Israel's construction of 6,500 Jewish housing units in Har Homa in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Qatar are for the continuation of the Middle East peace
process opposing Israel's settlement policy and reject the
Israeli government's moves which has brought the peace process
to a deadlock.

Britain's Lonropet Company has conducted aero-magnetic

The Mozambican government is revising its oil investment law

said Mabote.

"We are drafting a package of special regulations because we

The whole monitoring system in the hydrocarbon sector in

<HEADLINE> Cairo's Slum Hill Awaiting Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zeinhum, a rough-and-tumble
neighborhood in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, has waited out its
time for a face-lifting to the rugged looks of a "haunted city."
</P>
<P>
According to an official plan available, local government is to
demolish and rebuild the blighted neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Governorate has recently put a team of urban planners
there as part of a pilot plan to turn the 50 feddans (21 hectares)
or so of Zeinhum's shacks into a scene of apartment buildings,
parks and public amenities, the recent edition of the weekly
Al-Ahram said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, involving a plan to rehouse Zeinhum's 20,000
inhabitants in 130 apartment buildings, will improve the lives of
the nearly 4,000 families, but is costly.
</P>
<P>
The urban renewal plan has been on the table for three years
until the German Bank for Reconstruction agreed to donate 17.7
million U.S. dollars last year to help the project and several
international groups have promised more aid.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1960s, Zeinhum mounds and parts of the adjoining
Qalaat el-Kabsh were gradually transformed into a ramshackle
expanse of do-it-yourself bungalows housing thousands of Cairo's
poor and immigrants from the Suez Canal region following the 1967
Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The casual atmosphere in the neighborhood's unpaved streets
masks a darker reality.
</P>
<P>
Situated between Salah el-Din's Citadel and the busy streets of
el-Sayeda Zeinab, Zeinhum, with its haphazard layout and leafy
coffee houses, has been a haven for drug users and dealers.
</P>
<P>
Urban planners promise that the amenities are coming and
Zeinhum will soon be stepping into a semblance of middle-class
respectability, leaving behind 30 years of dangerous living.
</P>
<P>
As the planners strolled up the narrow and winding roads with
maps and surveying equipment, the locals, mostly manual workers
with modest wages, feel differently about the promised changes.
</P>
<P>
While some are worried about the hike rents with the promised
new housing, some simply fret about the idea of dealing with
problems of sharing the same roof of an apartment building with
others.
</P>
<P>
But some inhabitants, particularly those who live in the
better-off section of Qalaat el-Kabsh, are pleased with the
prospective changes.
</P>
<P>
Osama Darwish, a 29-year-old plumber, bemoans the rough image
that the seedy huts, unlicensed coffee houses and drugs impart to
the area.
</P>
<P>
He said that women and children are simply afraid of going out
unescorted.
</P>
<P>
Samir Dimirdash, an accountant also from the up-market section,
views the shanty town with sympathy.
</P>
<P>
He said the neighborhood should use more public amenities, a
fire brigade and a post office, for example.

<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Iran announced here
today that the two countries would make various efforts to
expand bilateral trade and cooperation in fields of economy,
sciences and technology.
</P>
<P>
The joint stance was adopted at the 9th Session of the
Sino-Iran Joint Commission on Economy, Trade, Science and
Technology, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Iranian Vice-President
Mohemmad Hashemi co-chaired the first round of the session.
The two sides are expected to have another round of talks on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government is satisfied with Sino-
Iran economic cooperation. However, there are much potentiality
for further development. It is of great significance to
enhance cooperation in field of oil since Iran has rich oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, Iranian crude oil contains high percentage
of sulphur. Therefore, China has accepted Iranian proposal of
transforming an oil refinery in China in order to buy more
Iranian oil.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also explored ways to expand cooperation in
trade, oil and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian vice-president expressed warm welcome to the
visit of the Chinese delegation headed by Li Lanqing. He said
that Iran has set priority in its foreign policy and will
boost its relations with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his hope that the joint session would
help develop bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing arrived here this afternoon and
is to proceed to Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, Chile and Argentina
after his two-day stay in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Police, Opposition Supporters Clash in Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were seriously
injured during clashes between Kenyan riot police and thousands
of opposition youth wingers at the Kamukunji Grounds in eastern
Nairobi today.
</P>
<P>
Three injured police officers were immediately rushed to War
Memorial Hospital by a police vehicle while the injured civilian
was ferried by a private car.
</P>
<P>
In nearby streets dozens of vehicles including one from the
Africa Regional Bureau of Xinhua News Agency had their
windows smashed by the opposition youth wingers.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties of Kenya today intended to hold an
unlicenced mass rally for constitutional reforms at the historic
Kamukunji Grounds.
</P>
<P>
However, Nairobi Provincial Commissioner Zachary Ogongo on Friday
issued a statement declaring the much publicized rally illegal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kenyan government was taking a very serious
view of the matter and would not sit back and allow any person or
group to violate the law with immpunity.
</P>
<P>
The government today sent hundreds of riot police to the
ground and tried to persuade the organizers of the meeting to
leave the venue in peace.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders including Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic
Party and Martin Shikuku of Ford-Asili vowed the meeting would go
ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki said that they had gone to Kamukunji Grounds to protest
against the Public Order Act, which stipulates that any person
wishing to hold a public meeting shall first make an application
for a permit.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader noted that even if the government
stopped them from holding the rally, they will go ahead and
organize many others until the government heeds their call for
change.
</P>
<P>
After failure to persuade the opposition leaders, Kenyan
police shot into the air and used tear-gas grenades and batons to
disperse thousands of opposition supporters, leading to fierce
fighting between them.
</P>
<P>
Some people told reporters that the unlicenced rally was a
plot by the opposition leaders to first cause chaos and then
blame the government in a bid to seek sympathy votes.

<HEADLINE> Pharaoh Statue Finds New Home in Birth Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- After months of emotional debate and
scientific research, Egyptians finally decided on a resting place
for the damaged granite figure of Ramsis II, one of the greatest
kings of ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
An archaeological sub-committee has decided in favor of a
proposal to restore the ancient Egyptian pharaoh to its original
home village in Rahina, Giza, or the ancient Egyptian capital of
Menf where the rosy granite statue was found in 1888, the Egyptian
MENA new agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ramsis, a king associated with awe among his own people, has
graced for 43 years a Cairo square notorious for the highest
pollution rate in Egypt and one of the world's most crowded.
</P>
<P>
Selecting a royal home for the 125-tonne, 11.4-meter-tall
statue has been the core of a nation-wide controversy. Caireens,
blamed for their neglect of the city's artistic and archeological
landmarks, had considered two other serious options, besides
Rahina.
</P>
<P>
But restoring the monument to its home appears to be the best
choice possible to spare the damage by erosion, traffic pollution
and the vibrations caused by the daily trips of the underground
metro in the city.
</P>
<P>
Ramsis II, ruling Pharaonic Egypt for 67 years in a golden era
3,500 years ago, lived for 95 years. He had eight wives, 52 sons
and 48 daughters.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks to Improve Ties with Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- In another step to further
improve its relationship with the Gulf states, Jordanian King
Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali today began their
visits to Oman and Qatar respectively.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is expected to stay in Oman for two days while Majali
will be in Qatar for three days, reported Qatar's Gulf News
Agency from Muscat, the capital of Oman.
</P>
<P>
During the visits, the king and the prime minister are
expected to hold talks with leaders of the two Gulf
states on the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process and bilateral relationship, the new agency said.
</P>
<P>
Majali will also discuss with Qatari leaders economic
cooperation between the two countries, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Details of the visits are not yet available, but political
experts said the visits would be likely aimed at further
improving Jordan's ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states, which include Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE.)
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with the GCC countries have been strained
during the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when Jordan stood by
the Iraqi side. This greatly angered the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has tried to improve its relations with the Gulf
states after the 1991 Gulf War and King Hussein has visited the
GCC states except Kuwait several times in the past years.

<P>
ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day European seminar ended here
today after participants discussed ways of redefining Europe's
security structure.
</P>
<P>
The seminar focused on the Western European Union's future role
in the new expanded security environment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing session of the seminar today, Greek
Defense Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis said that at present,
there was no longer a specific political-military threat on a
world level, but there were threats stemming from "situations such
as developments in the Balkans, the rise of nationalism,
terrorism, uncontrolled migration from the southern Mediterranean
region and eastern Europe, as well as from the international drug
trade."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece had tried to give the WEU the
characteristics of a dynamically developing defense organization
which would become more and more active in the future.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently holds the rotating presidency of the Western
European Union (WEU).
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers from the WEU will meet in Washington next

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Tour to Liberia Said Helpful to Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The recent assessment tour to Liberia
by a delegation from a west African organization would
help overcome doubts about the prospects for the country's
post-war elections billed for the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The fears being expressed by some politicians on security and
logistics for the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential
elections have been unjustified, said Tom Ikimi, the chief of the
delegation which paid a week-long visit to Liberia last week.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was sent by Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha, also chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), to Liberia to assess preparations
for the elections.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, Ikimi has
reminded those obsessed with the rescheduling of the two-day
elections of its consequences on the integrity of the 11-month
peace process which would culminate in the swearing-in of an
elected government in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's Independent Electoral Commission was earlier
reportedly submitted a detailed estimated cost of 12 million U.S.
Dollars for the poll to Abacha, noting Liberia would not be able
to source the funds necessary for the elections.
</P>
<P>
This has been observed as one of the factors for the advocate
for the delay of the scheduled elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Ikimi said such a "crucial and fundamental decision"
could only be made by ECOWAS heads of state.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the tour, Ikimi announced the budget for the
elections had been "drastically pruned down to realistic and
realizable cost".
</P>
<P>
He did not say how much the elections would now cost.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the delegation received Liberia's electoral
package which was produced by the seven-member electoral
commission.
</P>
<P>
The package, which will be passed on to Abacha, comprises the
code of conduct, schedule of elections and budget, the official
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Details of the package have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the commander of the ECOWAS peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG, Major General Victor Malu, called on
Liberian politicians to extend their political campaign to the
hinterland of the country.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that ECOMOG, which has been deployed to all the towns
throughout that country, will ensure the security of politicians
carrying out political activities outside the capital of
Monrovia.

</P>
<P>
While holding talks here today with the visiting President of

<P>
Jiang said that China places great importance on increasing
relations with African countries, and that Sino-African ties have
been a fine example for sincere, equal, friendly and cooperative
relations among developing countries, and have also stood the test
of time in the changing international situation.
</P>
<P>
Developing Sino-African long-term and stable relations and
all-round cooperation toward the 21st century constitutes an
important part to China's independent foreign policy of peace,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Bedie said that his country fully agrees to the five-point
suggestion of principle on the development of Sino-African ties
put forth by President Jiang during his African trip in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained China's views on the international situation to
the visitors, saying that the international scene has been
experiencing profound changes, which has been relaxing in general,
and that the multi-polar trend has grown rapidly as the power and
position of developing nations improve.
</P>
<P>
But power politics and hegemonism still linger on, Jiang noted,
and the unjust, irrational global political and economic order has
not basically changed.
</P>
<P>
"China has always held that every country should have equal
membership in the international community, and have the right to
participate in international affairs, no matter how big or small,
rich or poor, strong or weak." Jiang said, pointing out that
both China and Cote d'Ivoire are developing countries, and for
developing countries, peace and stability are prerequisites for
improving the economy, and that economic growth helps peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Bedie said that a major issue on the African continent is
development and that regional conflicts should be solved by
peaceful means. In pointing to the two countries' identical views
on international issues, he said that they have devoted themselves
to setting up a new political and economic order in the world.
</P>
<P>
Cote d'Ivoire opposes certain powers' practice of deciding
international issues on their own, Bedie said, and that his
country proposes the establishment of a multi-polar world, and
would like to see China play a greater role in international
affairs in order to benefit global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed China's domestic situation and its policies
toward the issue of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two presidents attended a signing ceremony
of four documents on China providing loans to Cote d'Ivoire, on
economic and technical cooperation between the two governments, on
loans from the Chinese government to Cote d'Ivoire government, and
on earthquake information in the coastal area of Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the talks were Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, Chairman of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and Vice-Minister of Agriculture Wan Baorui, and Bedie's
entourage.

MACAO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Three men were shot dead this
afternoon in downtown Macao, to become new victims of
triad-related struggle.
</P>
<P>
The three men, all in their 30s, were shot in the chest by
gunmen on motorcycles when they were traveling in a car at about
17:15 today. They were confirmed dead after being rushed to a
nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
Local television reported that gangsters fired six to seven
shots amid heavy rains. The attack was believed to be a case of
revenge between rival triad gangs in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Police launched a massive action immediately.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of crimes has claimed 14 lives so far this year,
as against 21 for the whole year of 1996.

<P>
The Macao government has vowed to step up measures to curb the
spreading of the wave of organized crimes, following the killing

<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The French duo of
Jean-Philippe Gatien and Damien Eloi ousted the Chinese pair of
Wang Liqin and Yan Sen in the men's doubles quarter-finals of the
World Table Tennis Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gatien, who has boosted his confidence after edging out China's
world No. 6 Wang Tao in the men's singles on Saturday, played a
very aggressive game while Eloi's spinning serves provided him a
chance to make a kill.
</P>
<P>
The French pair won 21-10, 21-10, 12-20, 22-20.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wang Tao will for the first time head home without an
individual title since 1991 as he and Ma Lin lost in the men's
doubles quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Japanese duo of Koji Matsushita and Hiroshi Shibutani routed
the third-seeded Chinese pair 21-15, 21-19, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has won five doubles titles since the 1991
championships in Chiba, Japan, has been combining with Ma Lin
since his Olympic champion partner Lu Lin retired last year.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester Worlds will be the last championships for the
29-year-old Wang, who had lost his singles fourth round game to
Frenchman Jean-Philippe Gatien.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who pairs with Hong Kong top women player Chai Po Wa
since his partner Liu Wei retired from national service last year,
also lost in the second round of the mixed doubles event.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita and Shibutani, a combination of defensive players
who snatched the Qatar Open title in Feburary, used their
consistent chopping play to beat the Chinese rivals as Ma Lin
looked nervous and Wang Tao appeared slow on the court.
</P>
<P>
"Ma Lin is no match with Lu Lin and Wang Tao has been
struggling in finding his form," lamented Chinese coach Li
Xiaodong.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's second seeds Jan-Ove Waldner and Jorgen Persson
defeated the Austrian duo of Werner Schlager and Karl Jindrak
21-19, 19-21, 27-25, 21-16, booking their semi-final spot.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Olympic champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang took a
sweet revenge with a four-set victory over Jorg Rosskopf of
Germany and Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese came from one set down to clinch a 17-21, 21-12,
21-13, 21-10 victory over the pair of different nationalities, who
had upset the world top duo in the Pro-Tour Finals in December
last year.
</P>
<P>
In the men's semi-finals on Monday, Kong/Liu play Gatien/Eloi
and Waldner/Persson meet Matsushita/Shibutani.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Briefs Students on Hong Kong Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Chinese college
students were present at a speech given by Zhou Nan, director of
the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, on the Hong Kong issue
today at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Today is "May 4", Youth Day for the Chinese, and the State
Education Commission and Communist Youth League of China invited
Zhou Nan to speak on Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhou talked about the origins of the Hong Kong issue and the
process of solving it, focusing on the significance of reunifying
the motherland, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's "one country,
two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the major task is now to ensure the smooth
transition, with only 58 days until the Chinese government resumes
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. He noted that the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (SAR) must be
implemented to the letter, and that the Chief Executive of the SAR
and its government have the support of the Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the implementation of the "one country, two
systems" policy must be guaranteed along with Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability, and that, "We should create conditions
for smooth solutions to the Macao and Taiwan issues."
</P>
<P>
Zhou encouraged students to continue the patriotism of the "May
4" Movement, which was begun in 1919 by Beijing University
students to introduce social progress and Marxism to China, which
at that time was a semi-feudal society that had been invaded by
foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
He also asked students to make the country more prosperous and
to reunifying the whole country. As July 1 approaches, more people
are becoming interested in Hong Kong, and some provinces and
cities and universities are promoting education in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations of Hong Kong's bright future were held yesterday
at People's University in Beijing. Nearly 20,000 teachers and
students watched quizzes about Hong Kong's history and customs,
and a documentary about Hong Kong.

"There are many points of contact between the economies of our

The Hong Kong students said, "Let us become society's
successors and love the country, shoulder social responsibility,

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The young people of China should
hold high the great banner of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping
and continue his great cause of socialist reform, opening up, and
modernization, President Jiang Zemin told a group of young people
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, made the instruction when he and Hu

Politburo, met with youngsters who received "Chinese Youth May 4th
Awards" given by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth
League of China (CYLC) and the All-China Youth Federation.
</P>
<P>
The two CPC leaders asked the younger generation to follow the
glorious, patriotic traditions of the "May 4th Movement" and to
work for great achievements. "May 4th" refers to May 4, 1919, when
students in major cities took to the streets to warn the then
Chinese government not to sign treaties that would sell out its
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zairean Peace Talks Began Amid Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between Zaire's ailing
President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila began
today amid rebel threat to attack capital Kinshasa if Mobutu
refused to step down.
</P>
<P>
The talks started 11:00 gmt aboard a South African ice-breaker
SAS Outenique off west African coast immediately after Mobutu
boarded. Kabila had boarded late Saturday night, according to a
report from aboard the ship.
</P>
<P>
The talks, successfully brokered by South African President
Nelson Mandela after many delays, were aimed at seeking a
peaceful solution to the Zairean civil war which had started last
October in eastern part of the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the peace talks, Kabila issued a statement
demanding the immediate resignation of President Mobutu and
assuming that Mobutu was preparing to comply.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader, whose armed forces have taken over
three-quarters of Zaire's territory during the seven-month civil
war and are posted in the fronts beyond the town of Kenge and
were within 150 km of Kinshasa, claimed if Mobutu refused to step
down, he would order his troops to launch their military attacks
against Kinshasa hosting five millions of civilian population.
</P>
<P>
"I have told South African President Nelson Mandela that
Mobutu would have to resign immediately our talks start otherwise
my forces are under instructions to move into Kinshasa should he
refuse," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have made it clear that there will be no other item on the
agenda other than Mobutu's unconditional resignation. I hope he
cooperates otherwise I will leave for home and my forces will
move into Kinshasa without delay on Sunday night," he threatened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a South African official aboard the ship said
earlier today that international mediators have brokered "an
agreement in principle" for Mobutu to resign.
</P>
<P>
"There is an agreement in principle for Mobutu's resignation
and the launching of a transitional process," said the South
African official who, aboard the ship, refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
However, Mobutu himself has so far not made any public
statement that he would hand over power to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of Kabila's Alliance of the Democratic Forces for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire said they would delayed the final
push on Kinshasa until it assembled between 10,000 and 12,000
troops near the capital.
</P>
<P>
Still, observers expected that a peaceful solution might come
out of the Mobutu-Kabila talks, which were also attended by
envoys from the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia to Export Carbon Dioxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Tunisia will shortly export carbon
dioxide extracted from a well recently discovered in the Otic
area, northern Tunisia, Tunisian newspaper Al-Shrouq reported
today.
</P>
<P>
This task will be undertaken by the Tunisia Industrial Gas
Company, which has recently signed a 30-million-dollar
partnership agreement with a giant Norwegian company.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Mohammed Al-Sahrawi, director of the Tunisia
Industrial Gas Company, as saying that the Norwegian company has
investments in France, Denmark, India, Sri Lanka, Italy and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Tunisian carbon dioxide will be highly competitive and will be
capable of getting to the world markets in view of the fact that
its product will cost less than its counterparts in several other
countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Promising Information Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- To deal with the challenges of the
new technology revolution and to improve its economy, China is
pushing the development of its information industry.
</P>
<P>
Sales in China's computer business were 92 billion yuan (11.1
billion US dollars) in 1996, an increase of 49.6 percent over the
previous year, and that extends to the hardware, software,
maintenance, and information service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, said recently that the electronics and information
industry will be a booming part of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
During its Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), it began
benefitting from information technology, and invested 8.4 billion
yuan to produce some 8,000 items of computer technology that were
put to use, bringing about 40 billion yuan in returns.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government views the information industry as part
of its strategic plan, making it part of the long-term economic
development program at the Fourth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, China's top legislative body, last March.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing, and
Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces mapped out plans to develop the
information industry, and a leading group of officials from 18
central government departments was organized last May, headed by
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that the information industry will to a
great extent make China's economy more efficient and closer tied
to the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Three projects begun in 1993 are elementary steps in expanding
the industry. The "golden bridge" is for establishing a public
economic information network; the "golden card" is for an
electronic currency system, and the "golden customs" project will
be a foreign trade network for paperless trading.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial, industrial, educational and medical
fields are also building their own information networks. A recent
national conference in Shenzhen City in Guangdong Province showed
that information is playing an unprecedented role in China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale state information network is planned for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, a senior official with the Ministry of Electronics
Industry, says that "China's information industry has a long way
to go, but, at the same time it has promising opportunities."
</P>
<P>
In the next several years, China's computer business will grow
more than 30 percent each year, and by 2000, sales may exceed 250
billion yuan, Zhang says.

<HEADLINE> Weizman, Arafat to Meet Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat are to
meet at the Erez Crossing point between Israel and the Gaza
Strip Tuesday, in an effort to resume peace talks between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report today, the meeting was
decided at an encounter this morning in Jerusalem between Arye
Shumer, Weizman's director-general, and Arafat's political advisor
Ahmed Tibi.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
broke down two months ago, following the start of settlement
construction in Har Homa on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israel Radio quoted a PA official as saying
that Weizman asked for the meeting, while Shumer stressed that
it was the PA that had requested the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There are contacts on this issue and we are in contact
with the prime minister's office and the PA in light of
the request of the PA," Shumer said.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has tried in the past to smooth relations between
Israel and the PA that have been rocky since Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu took office last June.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president played a key role in mediating between
the two sides last October when he invited Arafat to his home for
a meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cook Promises New Era of British Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Robin Cook, foreign secretary in
Britain's new government, today promised to open a radical new era
of British foreign policy, making Britain a leading player in
Europe and making trade and economic cooperation the chief concern
of British embassies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Observer newspaper, Cook said, "We
want to take Britain out of a position of isolationism, out of
inward-looking chauvinism and into being a leading member of an
international community."
</P>
<P>
"The foreign policy of the Foreign Office is not a rather
pompous, grey and mildly tedious job of pouring oil on troubled
waters. Foreign relations are central to our political project,"
he stated.
</P>
<P>
Cook promised Britain will take its rightful place as one of
Europe's "Big Three" within the European Union. He said that
ministers, rather than civil servants, will attend all future
talks on European integration and Britain would sign the Social
Chapter on workers' rights within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
But he repeated the Labor view it was unlikely Britain would
join a European single currency in the first wave, due to begin in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Cook also promised Britain would immediately implement a ban on
British sales of landmines and would publish an annual report on
British strategic exports, including defense equipment.

<HEADLINE> Wang Tao's Last Hope Dashed in Table Tennis Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Wang Tao will
for the first time head home without an individual title since
1991 as he and Ma Lin lost in the men's doubles quarter-finals of
the World Table Tennis Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese duo of Koji Matsushita and Hiroshi Shibutani routed
the third-seeded Chinese pair 21-15, 21-19, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has won five doubles titles since the 1991
championships in Chiba, Japan, has been combining with Ma Lin
since his Olympic champion partner Lu Lin retired last year.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester Worlds will be the last championships for the
29-year-old Wang, who had lost his singles fourth round game to
Frenchman Jean-Philippe Gatien on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who pairs with Hong Kong top women player Chai Po Wa
since his partner Liu Wei retired from national service last year,
also lost in the second round of the mixed doubles event.
</P>
<P>
Matsushita and Shibutani, a combination of defensive players
who snatched the Qatar Open title in Feburary, used their
consistent chopping play to beat the Chinese rivals as Ma Lin
looked nervous and Wang Tao appeared slow on the court.
</P>
<P>
"Ma Lin is no match with Lu Lin and Wang Tao has been
struggling in finding his form," lamented Chinese coach Li
Xiaodong.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's second seeds Jan-Ove Waldner and Jorgen Persson
defeated Austrian duo of Werner Schlager and Karl Jindrak 21-19,
19-21, 27-25, 21-16, booking their semi-final spot.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Olympic champions Kong Linghui and Liu Guoliang took a
sweet revenge with a four-set victory over Jorg Rosskopf of
Germany and Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese came from one set down to clinch a 17-21, 21-12,
21-13, 21-10 victory over the pair of different nationalities, who
had upset the world top duo in the Pro-Tour Finals in December
last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Foreign Debt to Exceed 7.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's foreign debt is expected to
excceed 7.5 billion U.S. dollars in the coming two years,
according to the latest reports published by the Economic and
Social Commission for Western Africa (ESCWA).
</P>
<P>
Jordanian newspaper Al-Rai quoted the reports as saying that
this is due to loan obligations, which amount to 1.5 billion
dollars a year to some Western creditors and a number of
multilateral organizations.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Jordan's foreign debt stood at 6 billion
dollars last year and 6.6 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The reports show that Jordan's foreign debt declined last year
because of the rescheduling or writing off part of the debt.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government promulgated in 1996 a law forbidding
non-Jordanians to take up 15 professions and occupations, with
the aim of creating more job opportunities for Jordanians, since
the unemployment rate in Jordan reached 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reports expect Jordan's gross domestic product to rise by
6.2 percent in 1997, saying that Jordan has benefited from the
improvement of its relations with some Gulf countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian expatriates remitted as much as 1.54 billion dollars
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> British, Australian Runners Win Tsing Ma Bridge Marathon in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- With almost every overseas runner
worrying about a possibly hot and humid day, it was the pouring
rain that posed as the biggest challenge to the runners at the
Tsing Ma Bridge Marathon Race here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bashir Hussain of Britain won the men's open category while it
was a 50-year-old, Bev Lucas from Australia, who took women's open
title today.
</P>
<P>
The heavy downfall obviously prevented the participants from
improving their own performance.
</P>
<P>
Hussain, 32, clocked a title-winning time of two hours 25
minutes 34 seconds for his second "serious" marathon. The was
time was far short of his personal best of 2:23:32, set last year
in a Manchester race, where he finished third.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite Peter De Vocht, 36, from Belgium, was second
in 2:25:49, almost 11 minutes slower than his personal best.
</P>
<P>
New Zealander Christ Dagg finished third in 2:26:30, against
his personal best performance of 2:22:00 set last year in Auckland
where he finished third.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to win the race. It was a great competition,"
said Hussain. This was the first time for him to run in Asia and
in monsoon.
</P>
<P>
"I just ran my pace and I think they (his opponents) worked too
hard to catch me. We once ran together for a while and then I
just broke out," said Hussain, who had run marathon for only one
and a half years.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he preferred rain rather than higher
temperature and humidity. "I enjoyed it (rain) and it was
beautiful. It would have been much worse if it was 25 degrees
centigrade," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"It (the rain) made you feel relaxed and comfortable," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult and it was very windy during the race,"
said Peter De Vocht.
</P>
<P>
He said he ran in the same weather in an international race
five years ago in Singapore, where he finished third.
</P>
<P>
"It was really good when I saw it began raining this morning,"
said New Zealander Dagg. He admitted he had worried of a very hot
day for his third ever marathon today.
</P>
<P>
"The rain was really very heavy when we crossed the finish
line. It is great to run on this bridge as I know that there
would be no more any marathon here in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a mother of five, took the women's title with a time of
2:52:07, followed by Jackie Newton of Britain in 2:53:12 and
Terri-Lee Farr from New Zealand was third in 2:57:01
</P>
<P>
Lucas said the life back in southern Australia was quite
different as she could run together with her family on their farm.
</P>
<P>
"I like to see the natural environment here, the mountains and
hills," she said. "I like to run on the small hills near my
hometown," she added.
</P>
<P>
She had started training for marathon "very late in life" as
she had to spend her most time on raising the family, Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Abhay Singh, who finished sixth in the men's open event,
was the fastest Asian in the group while the fastest Asian woman
runner today was Ng Lai Chu from Hong Kong, who finished fourth in
the open category.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM expresses Confidence Over Smooth Macao Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, meeting with Almeida Samtos, President of
the Portuguese Parliament in Beijing today, said he is confident
about the smooth return of Macao to the motheland.
</P>
<P>
In less than two months China will resume exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and, with the concerted efforts of
China and Portugal, it will mean that the transition of Macao will
go smoothly, Qian said. He noted that the Macao issue is a key one
in Sino-Portuguese relations and that its proper handling will
help bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian spoke highly of Sino-Portuguese relations and said that
frequent contacts between the two countries' leaders in recent
years have promoted bilateral relations and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The idea of "One country, two systems" is a good example for
dealing with issues left over from the past and a reflection of
the wisdom of the Chinese people, Santos said.
</P>
<P>
Portugal is now preparing for the hand-over of Macao, he said,
and expressed the conviction that concerted efforts by both
governments will ensure a smooth transition, and that this will
mean a reinforcement of Portuguese-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
Portugal follows the "One China" policy and hopes that China
will settle the Taiwan issue at an early date for the
reunification of the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> Visiting Chinese Premier Meets Seychelles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VICTORIA, SEYCHELLES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
Premier Li Peng said here today that China attaches importance to
developing its friendly relations with Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
And China wishes to join its efforts with the West Indian
islands to consolidate and advance such ties, said Li at a
meeting with Seychelles Vice-President James Michel who also
holds the posts of ministers of finance, communications and
defense.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Saturday on a working visit to the island
country, the first leg of his seven-nation African trip, which
will also bring him to Zambia, Mozambique, Gabon, Cameroun,
Nigeria and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Michel, on behalf of President France Albert Rene and the
Seychelles government, extended welcome to the Chinese premier,
saying that the Seychelles government and people were honored to
have the Chinese premier in the country.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng's presence here was once again "an evidence of
the friendly relations" between the two countries, said Michel.
</P>
<P>
The Seychelles vice-president said his country sincerely
thanks China for its aid over the past 21 years since the two
countries established diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
During the past dozens of years, the two countries have been
cooperating effectively and Seychelles would continue to be
devoted to developing its friendly and cooperative relations with
China, Michel stated.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president also said that the Seychelles government
fully supports the Chinese government's policy of reunifying the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng thanked the Seychelles government and people for their
warm hospitality and considerate arrangements, saying he was
pleased to have the chance to visit the beautiful island country.
</P>
<P>
"Upon arrival at the picturesque land, my wife and I myself as
well as other members of the Chinese delegation have been
saturated in an atmosphere of friendship," said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
China holds that all countries, big or small, should be equal
members of the international community and all countries can
develop quickly so long as they formulate correct development
strategies in line with their specific conditions, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
And China is happy to notice that the Seychelles government
and people have scored gladdening achievements in bringing about
national harmony and maintaining social stability and
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said China also appreciates Seychelles'
foreign policy of keeping neutral, non-alignment and
good-neighborliness, its efforts to actively involve itself in
regional cooperation which is expected to make Seychelles a
bridge linking southern Africa and other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted that China and Seychelles have been conducting
effective cooperation in various areas on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence since the two countries
forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches importance to developing its
friendly relations with Seychelles and wishes to join its efforts
with Seychelles to further consolidate and develop such a
relationship," Li Peng stressed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was followed by the signing of a document on China
providing aid to Seychelles and a banquet hosted by
Vice-President Michel in honor of the Chinese premier.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Supply Medicines to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A British pharmaceutical company has
signed with the Iraqi Health Ministry contracts valuing 5 million
U.S. dollars for supplying Iraq with badly needed medicines, the
local daily Al-Jomhuriya reported today.
</P>
<P>
The contracts come within the framework of an oil-for-food deal
concluded last year by Iraq with the U.N, which allows Baghdad to
sell 1.2 billion dollars worth oil over six months for food and
medicine, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
They will take effect soon after the Sanctions Committee of the
U.N Security Council gives the green line.
</P>
<P>
The contracts followed recent visits to Iraq by some British
delegations. Baghdad and London have had no diplomatic relations
since since 1991 when the Gulf war against Iraq broke out.
</P>
<P>
According to the official newspaper, the Iraqi Health Ministry
has also concluded similar contracts with a Jordian company on
medicine supply.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Jordanian deal was 2 million dollars worth.
</P>
<P>
Medicines expected to arrive soon in Iraq will include those
for chronic diseases, the paper quoted a Jordanian executive as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mahdi Saleh said last February
that Jordan comes only next to France in terms of contracts signed
with Iraq for food and medicine supplies.
</P>
<P>
Out of the revenues from its oil sales, Iraq has to devote 210
million dollars to the purchase of medicines, 705 million dollars
to the import of food and the remainder to the purchase of other
essential goods, according to the U.N.-Iraqi deal reached about
one year ago.

<HEADLINE> Economy of Chinese Border Areas Grows Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- China's border areas, which are
usually inhabited by ethnic minorities, have gained economic
strength through opening up to the outside world, according to a
recent conference held here.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Gross Domestic Product of open cities in
border areas has grown with an annual rate of 15 percent. In 1995,
the volume of border trade totalled 3.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's land borders stretch across more than 20,000 km, with
15 neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
China's border areas include 135 county-level areas, of which
107 are managed by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic minorities are usually the same origin of the people
living in the neighboring countries. In the past, the areas were
economically underdeveloped due to the China's strict restrictions
on trade with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated reform and opening-up policies in 1979,
the border areas have become the country's vanguard in conducting
economic and technological exchanges with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's province of Yunnan, which borders Myanmar,
Laos, Viet Nam, has convenient conditions for border trade because
it shares a boundary of 4,061 km with these countries.
</P>
<P>
The province focused its border trade with southeast Asian
countries by taking advantage of Lancang-Mekong River. It has set
up 19 ports of entry in frontier prefectures and has opened more
than 100 roads for foreign trade and cross-border tourism.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the imports and exports volume generated from border
trade in the province had reached three billion yuan (about 365
million US dollars), maintaining an annual growth rate of 30
percent for 11 consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Border trade has spurred the economic development of border
areas. By the end of 1995, industrial and agricultural output
value of the country's border counties totalled 78.4 billion
yuan.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- A German company specialized in security cards

is designed to produce 10 million pieces per year.
</P>
<P>
Horst Rudiger, Director of the International German now on a

</P>
<P>
The contracts would be submitted to the U.N. Sanctions

<HEADLINE> Unity of Ethnic Groups Promotes Development of "Red City" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ulan Hot, the birthplace of regional
autonomy by ethnic groups in China, will become a mid-sized city
focusing on livestock and metallurgy by the year 2010, said its
mayor, Bao Manduhu, a Mongolian who grew up in the city.
</P>
<P>
50 years ago, the regional government of Inner Mongolia,
China's first regional government managed by ethnic minority
groups, was founded on May 1 in the city, meaning "red city" in
Mongolian.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, it has undergone fundamental changes,
thanks to the unity of various ethnic groups and social stability,
Bao noted, recalling, "Fifty years ago, there were few buildings
and not even a decent street in the city."
</P>
<P>
Local people used to ridicule the town, calling it "Ulan Big
Village" because it only produced basic products like hoes and
horseshoes. But, with state support and the joint efforts of
different ethnic groups, the city has already set up more than 30
industries for metallurgy, machine building, processing
non-ferrous metals, cigarettes, chemicals, textiles, leather, and
food.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the city was given a Class-A open city rating by the
State Council, China's highest governing body, and it has
attracted investment from the Republic of Korea, Japan, and
Taiwan. It has set up department stores and markets and 7,700
commercial outlets, making itself a major distribution center for
the eastern part of Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, the city had only 10,000 hectares of
cultivated land. Now it has ten times that size, thanks to a
reservoir built with state help. Animal husbandry bases have also
been established.
</P>
<P>
The living standard of the local people has improved
remarkably, especially since 1980, Bao said. In 1996, per capita
annual income was 3,061 yuan, more than ten times 1980's figure.
</P>
<P>
The city's GDP was 1.18 billion yuan, 5.7 times the 1980
figure. Hundreds of new buildings have changed the city's
appearance, Bao said. In 50 years of work, illiteracy has
generally disappeared among the young and middle-aged of the
city's 500,000 people, and the nine-year compulsory education
system is at work almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The city has two colleges, 22 secondary schools, and 73 primary
schools, many of which are for Mongolian and Korean ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"The system of regional autonomy for ethnic groups has provided
legal backing for various ethnic groups' equal rights and
freedoms," Bao pointed out.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 2,000 officials from minority ethnic
groups, about 30 percent of the total. "In the government,
officials respect and cooperate with each other no matter which
ethnic group they are from," the mayor concluded.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and German Psychologists Conduct Training Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and German psychologists
have recently launched a cooperative program in Kunming, capital
city of southwest China's Yunnan Province, to help train Chinese
psychiatric workers.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 experienced psychologists and psychiatrists from
Germany and a dozen Chinese experts are giving lessons to 97
trainees from across the country who all hold Master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
The trainees will learn psychoanalysis, hypnotherapy, and
systematic out-patient care.
</P>
<P>
With the funding from a public research institute in Germany,
German experts will work together with their Chinese counterparts
from local medical universities or colleges to push forward the
program.
</P>
<P>
Following the training class in Kunming, more will be held in
the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Psychological treatment is being given more attention in China
as people's lives move at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 60 million Chinese need
psychological help each year.
</P>
<P>
But the title of psychologist has been rarely heard in
China. And only a few cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu,
and Kunming, have established specific psychological institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and German experts estimate that hundreds of
psychologists who have received professional training will be
serving the public by the year 2000.

<P>
WUHAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are speeding up
their study of the creatures in the Yangtze River as the
construction of the Three Gorges Dam is well under way.
</P>
<P>
The water level, temperature, and flow of the upper and middle
reaches of the Yangtze River will change markedly when the dam
project is completed, experts predict. The changes will
significantly affect the environment of the creatures living in
the river.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Aquatic Creatures has organized some 40
experts to study the rare species in the river to prepare for
taking protective measures.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 112 species of aquatic creatures specific
to the river, including white-flag dolphins, Chinese paddlefish,
and Yangtze alligators.
</P>
<P>
China's research of the impact of the dam project on the
aquatic creatures in the Yangtze River started in the mid-1980s,
drawing more than one million yuan of research funds annually.
</P>
<P>
The survey is near the end. An experimental station will be set
up to study the feasibility of the establishment of reserves for
the rare species, artificial cultivation methods, and relocation
of rare species to other suitable environments.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province is
trying to expand its grain production area to nearly 6.7 million
ha. this year, to ensure 28.5 million tons of grain output.
</P>
<P>
Though some local areas suffered from the biggest flood in a
half century last year, the province reaped a bumper grain
harvest, with annual average income for each local peasant hitting
a record 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
More than 65 percent of net income of the provincial peasants
is brought in from agriculture. In some counties with traditional
agricultural production, peasants have looked upon agriculture as
a means to becoming well-off instead of merely providing necessary
food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter the province has launched large-scale
construction of water conservancy works, using more than 200
million workdays and spending nearly 1.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This year the province will attach more importance to
restructuring the local agricultural setup, to encourage peasants
to grow out-of-season vegetables by expanding seeded areas in
green houses to more than 170,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
The province will apply technological advances in agricultural
production. More than 70,000 agricultural technicians helped
promote 30 advanced techniques this year, 10 of which are key
techniques covering strain breedings, facilities, machinery, and
agronomy.

TAIYUAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural development has raised
the living standards of local farmers in north China's Shanxi
Province, as their annual average net income last year rose nearly
29 percent over the previous year to 1,557 yuan, and the growing
speed for this year is even faster.
</P>

Encouraged by state preferential policies, the local farmers
took greater initiative to grow grain. The province reaped a
record harvest of more than 10 billion kg of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
Though grain price edged down last year, the sale of grain is
still a major source of income for local peasants.
</P>
<P>
The province has now planted 900,000 ha. of cash forest, which
helped the local farmers increase an average of 100 yuan in income
last year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, US Researchers Challenge AIDS Infection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli-American research
team has challenged an influential U.S. AIDS researcher and
proposed a provocative new scenario of T-cell activity in HIV
infection, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The new analysis was proposed by Zvi Grossman, a senior
lecturer in physiology and pharmacology at the Tel Aviv
University and an adjunct professor of biostatistics at the
University of Pittsburgh, and Ronald Herberman of the University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, which could suggest new methods of treatment for
AIDS, stresses several novel aspects of HIV infection, including
a distinct adaptive response to the virus of the body's immune
system, which makes many CD4 T lymphocytes, the most vulnerable
target, variably resistant to HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
Grossman and Herberman also suggest that cell types other
than CD4 cells play a major role in sustaining the infection,
not only as additional HIV reservoirs but as part of the primary
mechanism of HIV transmission among cells.
</P>
<P>
The two scientists challenge the "falling homeostasis" model
proposed by David Ho, who was Time magazine's "Man of the Year"
for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ho's theory was developed in 1995, when antiviral drugs were
effectively used to block continued HIV infection of cells in
patients.
</P>
<P>
Ho explained the subsequent rise of CD4 cells as existing
before the treatment and that after treatment, it exceeded cell
loss.
</P>
<P>
Based on this interpretation, scientists estimated a rapid
turnover rate of CD4 cells before treatment.
</P>
<P>
However, Grossman and Herberman claim the reasoning behind
"falling homeostasis" is unsound, in that the turnover of CD4
cells need not be considered unusual.
</P>
<P>
This reflects an adaptive response, they wrote, rather than
simply being the result of cell depletion.

ROME -- The Italian Post Office is raising the price of sending
a normal letter from 750 lire (about 0.49 U.S. dollars) to 800
lire (about 0.52 dollars) from May 5 this year as part of a
package of tariff increases designed to compensate the recently
announced cuts in government spending.
</P>
<P>
The postage rates increase, the first since 1989, came in the
wake of the government's recent mini-budget which aims to reduce
public spending in the Posts sector by 500 billion lire (about
0.31 billion dollars) in 1997, 600 billion lire (about 0.39
billion dollars) in 1998 and 700 billion lire (about 0.46 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President, Arafat Agree to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
have agreed to meet, but a date has yet to be set, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A PNA official, who confirmed the report, said that Weizman
asked for the meeting, adding that "no date has been set
for the meeting."
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect the meeting to take place before the end of
the week," he said, while declined to elaborate on the purpose of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arye Shumer, Weizman's director-general, told Israel
Radio that it was the PNA that had requested the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"There are contacts on this issue and we are in contact
with the prime minister's office and the PNA in light of
the request of the PNA," Shumer said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior PNA official as saying that
the meeting had been delayed for technical reasons but could
take place this week.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has tried in the past to smooth relations between
Israel and the PNA that have been rocky since Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu took office last June.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president played a key role in mediating the
last major breakdown between the two sides when he invited
Arafat to his home for a meeting last October.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Suns' Kevin Johnson to Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Johnson, who helped lead
the Phoenix Suns into the NBA Finals in 1993, has decided to
retire.
</P>
<P>
"If God changes my heart, I'll change my mind," the 31-year-old
point guard said Saturday after the Suns were eliminated from the
playoffs by the Seattle SuperSonics. "But I don't see that
happening.
</P>
<P>
"God gave me 10 great years. I have no regrets, only
highlights," Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
In his 10 seasons in Phoenix, Johnson helped the Suns get into
the playoffs nine times. The highlight came in '93 when the Suns
lost to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in six games.
</P>
<P>
Johnson averaged 16 points, but shot just 29 percent in the
Seattle series after averaging 20.1 points and shooting 50 percent
in 70 regular-season games. He was named NBA Player of the Month
in April when he averaged 23.2 points.
</P>
<P>
In a game against Seattle March 26, Johnson hit a career-high
six 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored 12,611 regular-season points in 679 games and
1,942 points in 92 playoff games. He was a three-time All-Star and
one of six players to surpass 11,500 points, 6,000 assists, 2,000
rebounds and 1,000 steals.
</P>
<P>
Johnson was hampered by injuries during the last half of his
career. He missed the first 11 games of the season while
recovering from hernia surgery, but was relatively healthy after
that, giving the Suns hope that he would change his mind and
return in 1997-98.

NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the East Africa
Media Institute (EAMI) were urged to strengthen regional
cooperation in training and personnel exchange to improve the
their performance.
</P>
<P>
A two-day media seminar, held to mark the World Press Day on
Saturday, also called for networking media organizations at
regional, continental and international levels.
</P>
<P>
EAMI Secretariat reaffirmed its commitment to the promotion of

</P>
<P>
Delegates said media practitioners should be trained in new
technologies, such as the Internet, to enable them to operate
competitively in a changing world.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of the Internet in Third World countries would
give the South a chance to speak to the North as opposed to the
previous trend where most of information was relayed from North
to South, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Media organizations should invest in new technologies which
have the potential of improving the media performance, they said.
</P>
<P>
They called on governments in the region to comply with
related international agreements on free import of educational
and cultural materials and equipment such as computers,
typewriters and cameras to improve the media performance.

<HEADLINE> Levy, EU Envoy to Discuss Resuming Israeli-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy is to hold talks today with European Union peace envoy
Miguel Moratinos on the possibility of breaking the
Israeli-Syrian deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos returned from Syrian capital Damascus Saturday night
where he held discussions with Syrian leaders on ways of resuming
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which were suspended early last
year.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Levy and Moratinos will focus on finding a
bridging formula, based on the model of Madrid Conference, that
would enable the two sides to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Israel interprets the Madrid model as setting no precondition
on either side for holding peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Eitan Bentsur, director-general of Israeli Foreign Ministry,
told Israel Radio Saturday that Israel had rejected a recent
Syrian offer to renew peace talks, because it set a precondition
on Israel's agreement to return the whole Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal was one of the three formulas put forward
by Syria and were relayed to Israel by Moratinos, who has been
active in mediating between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel rejected all the Syrian proposals simply
because they all contained a demand on Israel's full withdrawal
from the occupied Golan Heights, Bentsur said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the final communique of the recent Malta
Conference included a call for the resumption of negotiations
between Israel and Syria on the basis of Madrid Conference. The
announcement was formulated with the consensus of all the states at
the conference, including Syria.
</P>
<P>
Saying the announcement was in line with a proposal Levy made
three months ago, Bentsur indicated that this might provide an
opening for a bridging formula that would enable the negotiations
to resume.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous Labor government, Israel and Syria appeared
on the verge of reaching a Golan-for-peace deal, but it was not
finalized.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli government led by the hardline Likud party,
which came to power last June, opposes a full return of the Golan
Heights.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
allocated Nungwi Peninsular to the Zanzibar Investment Company
(ZICO) to develop an exclusive global financial and resort
center, which would include off-shore banking.
</P>
<P>
Local press said today that the 12-square kilometer land,
located on the island of Zanzibar, would exclusively be owned by
ZICO under a long-term lease, according to an official lease
letter.
</P>
<P>
Investors said the areas were ideal for off-shore banking and
resort activities because it was uninhabited, hence providing
most restrictive and private atmosphere required for the global
financial center.
</P>
<P>
The area is unique because it has deep sea, natural clean
beach and is not affected by high or low tides, hence ideal for
resort and tourism activities, particularly cruising.
</P>
<P>
They said the global financial center and resort will consist
of many banks, five star hotels and a 18 hole golf course. It
will also have modern communication facilities, a private air
strip, cruising facilities and water sports.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reacts Against Norway's Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry has
reacted angrily against Norwegian foreign minister's statement,
warning that Tehran will take the similar stance toward Norway.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that Iran
is not interested in maintaining close ties with Norway because
of its pro-Israel and anti-Islamic policies.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the spokesman was on the air by the
state-run Tehran Radio this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Norway is strongly under the influence of international
Zionism and the United States and that is why it has always
pursued stance similar to them vis-a-vis Iran," Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement in response to the remarks
by Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal, who said that
Norway will reduce trade and economic ties with Iran in a
protest against the involvement of top Iranian leaders in the
Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
A Berlin court investigating the assassination of four Kurdish
opposition leaders in Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in September
1992 has accused Iranian leaders of ordering the assassination.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that it was Norway's unindependent and hostile
policy toward Iran that the Iranian Foreign Ministry recalled
its ambassador from Norway in 1994 and severed its trade and
economic ties with that country.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Norwegian banking delegation came to Tehran
last month and offered credit facilities to Iran, but Iran
turned down the offer on account of Norway's anti-Iranian
policies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Norway's recent vote at a U.N. General Assembly
meeting in New York was in favor of expanding Israeli settlements
in the occupied Palestinian territories and that is indicative
of their dependence on the Zionist state.

LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has endorsed a four-year national drug control plan which
included enhancing an anti-money laundering bill and setting up
of a cabinet committee on drugs chaired by the president.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Saturday, Chiluba said drug trafficking,
especially its related money laundering activities, is a
universal threat to the political, social and economic
development of his country.
</P>
<P>
The president pledged that his government is committed to

</P>
<P>
"The most dangerous aspect of drug trafficking is money
laundering," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
"The drug cartels and the trafficking groups are organized and
structured to function effectively in a business manner within
the liberalized economic environment. This situation must be
fought vigorously and eliminated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has, for some time, making efforts to curb drug
trafficking and drug abuse. Offices of the National Drug
Enforcement Commission worked round the clock to deal with cases
of suspected crimes in drug trafficking and abuse.

KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Beggars in Kuwait will soon
face an imprisonment of a maximum six months and a fine of up to
500 Kuwait dinars (1,650 U.S. dollars) if a draft law presented
to Kuwait National Assembly is approved, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the draft law was submitted by Kuwaiti
government to the parliament Saturday and the punishment could
be doubled in case the crime is repeated within two years from
the date of the verdict on the first case.
</P>
<P>
The government bill calls for adding a new clause to the
country's Penal Code to specifically stipulate begging as a
crime.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides a clear definition for begging and
calls for penalizing those who organize begging and encourage
beggars, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
An explanatory note for the bill stressed that a legal
punishment became necessary after this ugly feature began
spreading in Kuwait, adding that begging was a new phenomenon to
the Kuwaiti society, which negatively affects the country and
tarnishes Kuwait's image as a civilized state.
</P>
<P>
Some beggars, especially women beggars, are often seen
begging at public places, citizens' residences or work places.
</P>
<P>
The beggars exploit a real or artificial disability or injury
or illness to draw the sympathy of the people for money or any
other benefit.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that persons who lure others including
minors into begging would receive the same penalty as beggars.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese newspaper
frontpage editorial said that too many Japanese cartoon books are
on the Chinese market, some of which are not good for Chinese
young readers.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Youth Daily" said that some of the books have
carried violent and pornographic images which might have a
negative influence on youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The books focus on sexual harassment, lesbian activities, and
abnormal psychology "without a stitch of clothing," the paper
said, citing a number of examples. The books have been translated
into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Some books try to glorify militarism, and others distort
Chinese history, added the article, titled "Japanese Cartoon Is
Harassing Us."
</P>
<P>
"Every right-thinking Chinese should be fully aware of the
situation," the newspaper said, calling on Chinese artists to pen
more "healthy picture books" that can meet the young people's
tastes.
</P>
<P>
Experts have attributed the "invasion" of Japanese cartoons to
a lack of creativity in the Chinese publishing industry.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the leading country of cartoon publications in the
world.

said Chinese Premier Li Peng's forthcoming visit to Zambia will
strengthen friendly, cooperative ties between Zambia and China.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks in a recent interview with Chinese
journalists on the eve of Li's visit.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing relations between Zambia and China, Chiluba said
they "are not only strong but are growing stronger" in political,
economic and other areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Zambia has always supported the One-China
Policy, said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
On economic cooperation between Zambia and China, Chiluba
said: "We are more grateful that it is not only a matter of
government to government, but one of people to people.
Businessmen and women are coming from China to try to invest in
Zambia."
</P>
<P>
He hoped more Chinese would come to invest in Zambia in the
process of the country's privatization. In addition to copper
mining, they can do business in agriculture, gemstones and other
fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Chinese aid to Zambia, Chiluba said that the chinese
people "are not providing charity. They are coming to provide aid to
us. They want us to stand on our own feet."

TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran today extended a goodwill
olive branch to Egypt by announcing the visit of its foreign
minister to Cairo Monday.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio aired the announcement made by
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi this morning,
indicating somewhat change in Iran's policy toward Egypt.

international isolation by the United States, Velayati has so
far visited more than 10 countries and submitted Rafsanjani's
invitation message to the leaders of these countries.

<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- To ease shortage of funds for
construction of residences in urban areas, north China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region aims to attract investments both from home
and abroad, China Land News has reported.
</P>
<P>
From 1997 to 2010, the region plans to use 20 billion yuan
(about 2.4 billion US dollars) of domestic and foreign funds for
the construction of residences covering a floor space of 31.5
million square meters, the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the region still had 16,000 families living
in houses that provided each person a living space of less than
four square meters, while 700,000 square meters of rundown houses
still await renovation.
</P>
<P>
And the urban population grows by 50,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
The region plans to enable each of its residents to have an
average living space of 11 square meters by 2010.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cairn-Shell Alliance for Joint Oil Exploration in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Cairn Energy has formed alliance with
oil and gas major Shell Exploration for comprehensive joint
operations in Bangladesh, competent sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cairn, the United Kingdom-based oil and gas explorers, and
Shell Company recently reached an agreement, a key aspect of which
is that both companies would bid on a 50/50 basis in new acreage
applications in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The equal-share alliance would also extend to the exploration
and development of hydrocarbon reserves in Bangladesh. Cairn would
take on the role of exploration operator and Shell development
operator.
</P>
<P>
Cairn Energy last year struck a gas reserve in the Sangu
gasfield in the Bay of Bengal, 45 kilometers off the port city of
Chittagong, which sharpened the international focus on
Bangladesh's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is yet to be ascertained, but experts assume that
the reserve could be as high as six trillion cubic feet (TCF) only
in this one filed. The country's current recoverable reserve is
estimated at 12 TCF.
</P>
<P>
As many as 60 international oil companies, including the Shell,
have expressed their keen interest in developing Bangladesh's
energy sector and attended two pre-bid meetings in London and
Houston last month.
</P>
<P>
The companies are likely to participate in a bidding for gas
and oil exploration in 15 blocks of Bangladesh, a country now
believed sitting on as much natural gas as in places in the Gulf
area.
</P>
<P>
The bidding will be closed on July 15 and the winners would be
allowed to explore gas and oil under a model production-sharing
contract (PSC), hopefully at the end of the current calendar year.
</P>
<P>
Shell had an old presence in Bangladesh and discovered many of
the country's gasfields. However, it left this political turbulent
country in late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Chinese Military Doctors Perform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Together with his family members,
carrying fresh vegerables and fruits produced in his own farm,
W. K. Mayondi was going out of the way to visit Chinese military
doctor Zhou Wenxue working in Maina Soko Military Hospital in
the Zambian capital Lusaka to express his heartfelt gratitude
to Zhou for the successful treatment of his brain thrombus.
</P>
<P>
Another Zambian, Chiselebwei Jobu, was also expressing his
thanks to a Chinese military doctor, Tang Zhengcai, repeatedly
saying: "It is you who have saved my life. Good, good, Chinese
doctors."
</P>
<P>
Years ago, Jobu suffered from period paralysis and could not
stand up. He had seen several doctors in some other hospitals in
the country, still he could not walk. However, after five days of
treatment by doctor Tang, Jobu stood up surprisingly.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 years ago, China started to dispatch its military
doctors to the military hospital as part of its assistance to
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The sixth group of Chinese military doctors arrived at the
hospital two years ago and they have since taken in more
than 400 inpatients and over 20,000 outpatients, performed 800
surgeries and given first aid to an large number of other
patients. Among them were President Frederick Chiluba,
government ministers and ordinary Zambians as well.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese doctors just arrived in the hospital, most of
them knew little English. They did their work through two Chinese
interpreters. To serve Zambians better, the doctors began to
study English with the two interpreters as their teachers. The
doctors whose English is better taught their colleagues. Now most
of them can understand what their patients say and treat them
without a interpreter.

LUSAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Acupuncture specialist Zhou Wenxue
has cured 6,000 patients with acupuncture. Many came to see Zhou
in wheeled chairs or with a walking stick. However, thanks to
Zhou's treatment, most left without any help. They turned up
their thumbs repeatedly praising the acupuncutre as "magic
oriental needles".
</P>
<P>
Due to desperate shortages of sisters in the hospital, the
Chinese doctors often do as both a doctor and a sister, going up
and down, treating and tending patients, injecting and
distributing medicines.
</P>
<P>
A lot of patients have been infected with Hiv/Aids and the
Chinese doctors' fingers are sometimes cut while performing a
surgery, risking possibile infections.
</P>
<P>
The hospital lacks basic equipment, instruments and medicines.
Facing such poor conditions, the Chinese doctors have made every
efforts to cure the patients with whatever available. Due to a lack
of disinfectants, gynaecologists Duan Xiaoqiong and Tang Xiaoli
sometimes resort to tincture of iodine when practising
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
Surgeries need several kinds of sutures, but there is only one
in the hospital. With the very suture variety, the two doctors have
performed many surgeries carefully, seriously and successfully.
</P>
<P>
Further more, after treatment by the two doctors, more than 30
sterile women gave birth to children. In Zambia, a sterile woman
has no position in her family and even is divoced by her husband.
</P>
<P>
Surgeon Wu Hong has become famous in the capital by
successfully curing a patient of serious lower jawbone fracture.
The treatment was difficult, because the patient was having a
high fever, the wound was in oral cavity and infections were
possible. What made things worse was that there was no
antibiotic in the hospital. However, Doctor Wu bathed the wound
with salt solution at least twice a day, and miraculously the
patient recovered quickly.
</P>
<P>
Specialist Hu Shican revived an imported medical instrument
which had been idle for three years. He also taught Zambians how
to operate it. Now, the instrument plays a very important role in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Before the sixth group of Chinese military doctors are going
to return to their home country, Administrator of the hospital
G. Musond spoke highly of them, saying the Chinese doctors are hard
working, skillful and cooperative.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Launch Strike in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) has announced a dawn-to-dusk strike on May 6 in 11
districts of Chittagong division to protest the alleged killing,
repression and harassment of opposition leaders by the government.
</P>
<P>
While declaring the strike program on Saturday, BNP leader
Khaleda Zia accused the government of conspiring to make
Bangladesh a vassal state and of destroying its economy, education
and industry, and jeopardizing its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"They are resorting to killing, repression, harassment, arrest
and false cases against the opposition party to remain in power,"
she told a grand rally in Chittagong Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The BNP chairperson said the killing of opposition leader Nasir
and Tushar in Feni town, Mozammel in Patia and Moslem in Mirsarai
proved that the government was patronizing the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"After the two killings in Feni, we had given one month's time
to the government, but they failed to arrest the killers," the
opposition leader said defending the strike call.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khaleda Zia also alleged that the government during
its 10-month rule destroyed this country's economy. "Bangladesh
will once again be a bottomless basket like that of the 1972-75
regime," said the leader of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
She mentioned that rising poverty, price-hike of essentials,
widespread unemployment and recession in trade and industry were
the manifestations of mismanagement and corruption by the present
government.
</P>
<P>
The former Prime Minister said that while in opposition, the
Awami (people's) League had crippled the economy by calling 170
days of strike, and now in government, it is doing everything to
totally destroy the economy.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also reiterated the BNP demand for
resignation of the Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena, saying a
free and fair election is not possible under him and "that's why
we want him to resign."
</P>
<P>
The BNP will go for tough agitation program if the government
did not meet the demands raised by her party, she warned.

<HEADLINE> Divorce Rate on Rise in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, may 4 (xinhua) -- The divorce rate in Vietnam has been
increasing in recent years, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Vietnam's courts across the country have tried
170,829 divorce cases, reconciling only about 9,800.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many couples who lived in harmony during hard times
have sought a divorce now that they have become better off in the
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The problem for these couples is that one partner has found an
opportunity to prosper in business. He or she is inclined to think
that he or she "deserves better," and seeks a divorce.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that people in rural areas have long married
off their children before the minimum age. Many brides are just 16
or 17 but are required by law to be at least 18. For men, the
required age is 20.
</P>
<P>
In the countryside, girls in their early 20's are already
unwanted. A recent survey of Hai Phong's rural districts showed
there were 3-4 married juvenile couples in almost every commune.
</P>
<P>
These teen couples have to bear the burden of family life when
they are really still children. Many such couples end in divorce
after only a few years.
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, children are the ones to bear the full
brunt of a broken marriage. Many of the street children are known
to have come from broken families.

<HEADLINE> Italian Post Office Raises Normal Letter Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Post Office is raising the
price of sending a normal letter from 750 lire (about 0.49
U.S. dollars) to 800 lire (about 0.52 dollars) from May 5
this year as part of a package of tariff increases designed to
compensate the recently announced cuts in government spending.
</P>
<P>
The new tariffs, which will be effective from Monday, were
announced officially today in the government's Gazzatta
Ufficiale. It is the first time postage rates have gone up since
1989.
</P>
<P>
The price increases come in the wake of the government's recent
mini-budget which aims to reduce public spending in the Posts
sector by 500 billion lire (about 0.31 billion dollars) in
1997, 600 billion lire (about 0.39 billion dollars) in 1998
and 700 billion lire (about 0.46 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In order to make up the revenue loss, the mini-budget provided
for a 10 percent rise in the global cost of postal services. The
increase in the price of a normal letter puts Italy in line with
rates in the rest of Europe, where the average price is 797 lire
(about 0.52 dollars), the Post Office noted in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Other price increases include a 600 lire (about 0.39
U.S. dollars) respectively, a 1,000 lire (about 0.66 U.S. dollars)
rise for 10-word telegrams, which will now cost 6,000 lire (about
3.9 dollars) and a 200 lire (about 0.13 dollars) rise on Post
Office current account stamps, which will cost 1,200 lire (about
0.79 dollars).

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Argentine experts succeeded in
implanting fertilized eggs that had remained frozen for two years
into the womb of a 46-year-old woman and started development of a
fetus, scientists said today.
</P>
<P>
The success is the first of its kind in Latin America and the
third time in the world, only after Australia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ester Polak, director of the Cer Institute and of the team
which applied the Intraplasmatic Insemination (ICSI) technique,
said her group has been working for 10 years in the program.
</P>
<P>
The researcher said this program started "when many women
wanted to keep their eggs alive and protect their ova for later
procreation though they had to submit to chemotherapy or
radiation" for their diseases.
</P>
<P>
"This interest led us to think that men can maintain their
sperms alive, but women cannot keep their eggs viable for a
deferred procreation," said Polak.
</P>
<P>
The expert said the success of the experience on Marta de
D'Agostino, now two months pregnant, "opens big expectations for
women with leukemia or the Hodkin's disease (ganglion cancer), or
with precocious menopause."

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Open Border Passes with Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh said the Thai government would open border passes
between Thailand and Cambodia permanently in the near future to
help develop Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit made this remark when he visited Aranyaprathet
district in Sa Kaew province, eastern Thailand, Saturday to look
into the possibility of opening the border, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the Thai government would open border passes
permanently soon, beginning with the Klong Luek pass in Sa Kaew
province in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
The Chong Jom pass in Surin province and Klong Yai pass in Trat
province would also be opened permanently and governors of the
provinces where the passes were situated would be empowered to
make decisions on border trade management without having to seek
approval from the government, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
These border passes have been closed since 1975 and aviation is
now the only legal and permanent method of traveling.
</P>
<P>
"After the border passes were reopened, Thailand would play a
more important role in accelerating development in Cambodia,"
Chavalit said.

<HEADLINE> More Migrant Families Entering Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- More than one quarter of migrant
workers in Shanghai have moved with families, a sign of more
migrant families moving to China's largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Shanghai-based Fudan
University, among Shanghai's 2.6 million people from elsewhere in
China, there are at least 100,000 families with 320,000 population.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the increase of migrant families is not
good for the city's development although migrant workers have made
significant contributions to Shanghai's urban construction and
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Migrant workers are commonly poorly educated, and can only
take simple jobs, so their income is at the bottom of society," an
expert said. "Many migrant families have members that are too old
or too young to be employed. So the bulk of the families are
comparatively poor."
</P>
<P>
Such a situation burdens the city's poverty relief work, and
affects the employment market. As the number of migrant children
grows, the city must increase its education spending and its
teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the major reason for the increase of
migrant families is the gap between urban and rural areas. And
therefore measures must be taken to control the situation.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (61-62) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (61-62) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What taxation policy will apply in the Hong Kong
SAR? Will it pay taxes to the central government?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Low tax rates, a simple taxation system and stable tax
items are the basic features of Hong Kong's existing taxation
policy. According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR will have an
independent taxation system.
</P>
<P>
It will, on its own and in the light of Hong Kong's previous
low taxation policies, enact laws governing tax types, tax rates,
tax reductions and exemptions, and other taxation
matters. Features of Hong Kong's existing taxation system will
remain unchanged after 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the Hong Kong SAR will have
independent finances. It will use all its financial revenues for
local needs and will not hand over any of them to the central
government. The central government will not levy taxes in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
There was an interesting episode on this question. When the
Basic Law was being drafted, someone suggested that Hong Kong be
required to pay taxes to the central government so as to reflect
national sovereignty and local obligations.
</P>
<P>
The same suggestion proposed, however, that Hong Kong pay a
nominal tax of one yuan per year out of concern for Hong Kong's
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The majority of people drafting the law were against the
proposal, saying that, since the Basic Law is a legal document in
the nature of a constitution, it would be quite improper to have a
provision about "shall pay one yuan per year in taxes."
</P>
<P>
Since such a tax is only nominal, it would be much better to
have a pay-no-tax clause in the Basic Law, they argues. Their
views were accepted.
</P>
<P>
Question: What principle will the Hong Kong SAR government
follow when it drafts its financial budget?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong has long followed the financial principle of
keeping expenditures within the limits of revenues to achieve a
fiscal balance, with a little surplus preferably.
</P>
<P>
Results of the implementation of budget plans show that fiscal
public expenditures usually do not exceed 18 percent of the local
GDP and that, in most years, Hong Kong has a fiscal surplus. This
has provided a favourable environment for a stable economic
development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Fully assimilating the strong points of Hong Kong's traditional
financial principle, the Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong SAR
follow the principle of keeping expenditure within the limits of
revenues in drawing up its budget, and strive to achieve a fiscal
balance, avoid deficits and keep the budget commensurate with the
growth rate of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Adherence to this principle on the part of Hong Kong SAR will
be conducive to the retention of the low taxation system in Hong
Kong, maintaining its international competitiveness and ensuring
its long-term prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Encourage Use of Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Public Health Ministry of
Thailand will promote the use of traditional herbal medicine to
reduce spending on imported ones.
</P>
<P>
Records show that 6.7 billion baht (268 million US dollars) was
spent on imported medicine in 1987, and the figure increased to 14
billion baht (560 million dollars) in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that imported medicine will cost 23 billion baht
(920 million dollars) by the year 2000, according to Public Health
Minister Montri Pongpanich.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the popularity of traditional medicine has risen
during the past three years, with sales registering a 25 percent
share in the pharmaceutical market, and the figure is expected to
rise to 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
To promote Thai traditional herbal medicine, the ministry plans
to hold a festival of traditional Thai medicine later this month.

<HEADLINE> Number of Urban Workers Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The total number of China's workers in
urban areas dropped to a little more than 147 million in the first
quarter of this year, 391,000 fewer than in the same period of
last year, and over 1.4 million fewer than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in many years that the number of workers
has decreased, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers in the state-owned sector, the bureau
says, decreased by 804,000 compared to that of last year, and
those in the collective sector were 1.24 million fewer, while
workers in other economic sectors like cooperative and
overseas-funded enterprises increased by 865,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers in east China decreased by 406,000;
66,000 in China's central part, while the number in west China
increased by 81,000, a sign of faster economic growth in that
area. The major decreases were seen in the manufacturing field,
with nearly 950,000 affected.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the number of employees in government
organizations and institutions is growing, with an increase of
more than 1.26 million. "This is incompatible with China's ongoing
economic restructuring and management system reform," experts
said.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Takes Advantage into Playoff Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sweden moved into the playoff round
of the World Ice Hockey Championships with a perfect unbeaten
record and a big advantage after posting a 3-1 victory over the
United States in their final round-robin match in Group A on
Saturday in Turku, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the United States, Canada, Finland and the defending
champions Czech Republic also qualified but because of a format
that allows teams to carry points over, Sweden will already be at
least one win up on the others when the playoff round begins in
Helsinki on Monday. Olympic Champion Sweden go through with a
record of four wins and one tie.
</P>
<P>
The United States won three games in Group B but will arrive
in Helsinki with no points, as none of victories came against
teams that advanced to the playoff round. Though easily advanced,
the U.S. chances of claiming the title was slim after their loss
to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Top three teams of the group qualified for the next round.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Finland were faced with the same fate until they
struck five unanswered goals to steal a 7-4 win against
previously unbeaten Russia, sending both teams into the next
round with two points.
</P>
<P>
Canada secured their place in the next round with a 6-0 win
over Italy.

MEXICO CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the United States
will sign an agreement of cooperation in fighting against money
laundering, which will enable Mexican banks to control suspicious
financial operations, Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria
said.
</P>
<P>
Gurria said the agreement will be signed here Monday during the
14th session of the bi-national commission before the official
visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton on May 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, banking institutions of the two countries
will share information with their respective governments about
transactions of over 10,000 U.S. dollars or its equivalent,
whenever doubt is raised over the origin of the assets, said
Gurria.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico's capability to identify and prevent money laundering
will be improved as we advance along the different stages foreseen
in the agreement," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the war against drugs, another topic to be
discussed by the commission, Gurria said that Washington proposed
to increase the number of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) agents in the Mexican territory.
</P>
<P>
Mexico in turn demanded a similar presence of Mexican officials
in the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Mexican press reported, there are now 52 DEA men in Mexico,
including agents, technicians and administrative officials, who
are attached to the U.S. embassy and consulates under the

<P>
KIEV, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Romania initialed a
good-neighborly agreement here today, ending the territorial
disputes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement of Good Neighbor, Friendship and Cooperation,
signed by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko and his
Romanian counterpart Adrian Severin, obliged both sides to keep
their present borders and never raise territorial requirements
against each other.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine and Romania have held drawn-out negotiations over the
agreement. The negotiations had been deadlocked for a period of
time due to rows over the status of Zmeinyy, a small island in the
Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Zmeinyy, claimed by both countries, is currently controlled by
Ukraine. Experts believe that the continental shelf around it
bears rich oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said at a press conference today that
the ownership of Zmeinyy will be decided through negotiations in
the following two years. As Romania asks, Ukraine will not deploy
offensive weapons on the island.

<P>
Ukraine and Romania also agreed not to conduct unilateral
commercial activities on the tiny island to avoid disputes.

<HEADLINE> Hamed Retains WBO and IBF Crowns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Prince Naseem Hamed used just 93
seconds to defeat challenger Billy Hardy inside the first round of
a WBO and IBF featherweight title fight on Saturday in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
Hamed retained his unified World Boxing Organisation (WBO) and
International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles when the referee
stopped the fight after one minute and 33 seconds in which the
champion twice knocked Hardy to the canvas.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old European champion got to his feet the first
time but he could not afford the furious attack from Hamed
and fell again.
</P>
<P>
It was the 26th straight victory in Hamed's career. Hamed is
now likely to face a much tougher bout against World Boxing
Association (WBA) champion Wilfredo Vasquez of Puerto Rico in the
United States later this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, American Ronald Wright retained his WBO
light-middleweight title when he stopped Britain's Steve Foster
in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
Wright was always in control and floored his opponent with
two successive body blows.
</P>
<P>
Foster, 32, who had fought 35 professional fights in his
16-year career, announced his retirement immediately after his
defeat.

<HEADLINE> US Leading Economic Indicators Edge Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The leading indicators of the U.S.
economy edged 0.1 percent higher in March to 103.6, the highest
ever, according to preliminary estimates by the Conference Board
here.
</P>
<P>
The major index prepared by the noted research group in New
York has been used by economists as a key note for forecasting the
direction of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The index increased 0.5 percent in February and increased 0.3
percent in January, the research group said. Over the six months
from September 1996 to March 1997, the index increased 1.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
But the latest index indicated that the economic growth of the
month was not that strong as many analysts had thought. The
calculations show that only five of the 10 leading economic
indicators rose in March.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts still believe the U.S. economy will continue
to move higher for the next six months or more, since the leading
indicator has kept on increasing for the past 13 months.

<HEADLINE> Samsonov Ends Giant-killing Run by Chinese Teenager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANCHESTER, England, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Belarus' world No. 4
Vladimir Samsonov ended the giant-killing spree by Chinese
teenager Wang Liqin in a fight for a men's quarter-final berth at
the World Table Tennis Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, 21, the most improved player since the last Worlds,
used rich experience and consistent rally to beat the 18-year-old
Chinese 16-21, 21-10, 24-22, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
The first set had been a seesaw game until Samsonov released
strong topspin forehands and lightening backhand flatshots to pull
away from 15-all.
</P>
<P>
Wang, whose giant-killing run had toppled Belgian Jean-Philippe
Saive, Sweden's former world champion Jorgen Persson and English
top player Carl Prean, won the second set easily as Samsonov lost
concentration and made many errors in attacking.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who won his first major title in the European Masters
last year, rallied from 10-17 down to even the score 18-all. He
then lost two points to face the set point.
</P>
<P>
Wang had a poor return to Samsonov's serve and made an off-end
topspin attack to let the score tie at 20-all. A few brilliant
rallies had been seen until Samsonov forced Wang to make two
errors to take the third set.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who enjoys much fame in China because of an excellent
record against world No. 1 Kong Linghui in domestic competitions,
shot to a 10-5 lead as he forced Samsonov to make wayward shots.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov had leveled 12-12 before he trailed again at 12-18.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian showed composure beyond his years as he came
back strongly to put it 19-all. A netted return and an off-end
attack by Wang sent Samsonov into the last eight.
</P>
<P>
"Wang lost to Samsonov in experience," said Chinese head coach
Cai Zhenhua, "Technically, they are on the equal footing."

ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
today urged Turkey to respect international law and treaties
concerned in order to improve the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an event at the Halkis infantry school here this
morning, Stephanopoulos stressed that while Athens wanted improved
relations with Ankara, under no circumstances would it abandon its
sovereign rights or make any concessions on that issue.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos reaffirmed that Greece would support an improvement
in Turkey's ties with the European Union (EU) unless Turkey
accepted international law, respected the existing borders and
contributed to the resolution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over disputed
islands in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The recent months have witnessed the thawing of the relations

<HEADLINE> Former UK Deputy PM Not to Stand for Party Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Former British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine, who is in hospital after suffering angina
pains, today ruled himself out of the defeated Conservative
Party's leadership race.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, 64, one of the most powerful figures in the party
and having been widely considered a front-runner to replace John
Major as the party leader, is having tests at a hospital and his
condition is described as comfortable.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Central Office said in a statement that
Heseltine "would like to confirm that he will not be a candidate
in the leadership campaign for the Conservative Party."
</P>
<P>
"He has not had a heart attack and hopes to be home in a few
days," the office added. He suffered a mild heart attack in 1993
while on holiday in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the decision of the former deputy prime
minister, who had long had the ambitions to lead the party and had
once helped topple former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meant
the end of his career at the top of British politics.
</P>
<P>
So far, former Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and
ex-Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley have declared themselves
as candidates for the party leadership.
