<HEADLINE> Mormons Cut E-Mail From Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Mormon church has banned e-mail and  
faxes as ways for its missionaries to communicate with families and 
friends back home. 
</P>
<P>
	Don LeFevre, church spokesman, said there are exceptions to the  
new policy announced in early December, such as missionaries living 
in areas where postal service is poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Communication between missionaries and their families has always  
been tightly controlled by the church in an effort to keep 
missionaries, typically between 19 and 22 years old, focused on 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Missionaries are allowed to phone home only twice a year, on  
Christmas and Mother's Day, and are not supposed to write more than 
once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	LeFevre said that given the convenience of e-mail, ``some  
missionaries may be communicating more than once a week and that 
would detract from missionary work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bonnie Carter of Orem called the change ``a cruel move'' at  
a time when several missionaries have been injured or killed in 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's son, Andrew Carter, is on a two-year mission for the  
church in Sweden. For a number of months, Andrew Carter has been 
sending his family a weekly e-mail from a nearby library. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said there have been occasions when she and her husband  
needed to communicate with their son about urgent matters like 
insurance or wiring money. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time he's written us and we've written him, 20 days  
have passed,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> $1M in Drugs Seized at NY Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four women were arrested at La Guardia Airport  
on Saturday after they picked up 13 suitcases filled with an 
estimated $1 million worth of marijuana, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Port Authority police made the arrests after being tipped off  
that the 400 pounds of drugs were being brought to New York on an 
American Airlines flight from Los Angeles, said Lt. James Smythe, a 
police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The four, all from Los Angeles, were charged with criminal  
possession of drugs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not immediately release the names of the suspects or  
any further details.

<HEADLINE> Cold-Weather Engine Checks Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have ordered operators of  
120 U.S. commercial and business jets to perform cold-weather 
engine tests. The move comes after the government received reports 
of three in-flight engine shutdowns during this week's cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected engines, Allison 3007A and 3007C models, are on  
Embraer 145 and Cessna 750 series aircraft. The Embraer is a 
commuter airliner flown by Continental Express, American Eagle and 
Trans States airlines. The Cessna is a corporate jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration learned that starting the  
engines in below-freezing weather can cause the starter shaft 
O-ring seal to allow oil to leak from the engine's accessory gear 
box. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of oil can lead to an engine shutdown.  
</P>
<P>
	Effective immediately, the aircraft operators must perform  
engine checks when the oil temperature falls below 32 degrees. The 
Embraer operators must run the engines for three minutes and then 
check for leaks, and the Cessna operators must run the engine at 
maximum continuous power for 10 minutes and then check for leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	If an airplane fails the tests, it cannot be flown, the FAA said  
in its emergency airworthiness directive Friday.

<HEADLINE> No Bail in Forced-Marriage Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Two men accused of kidnapping a woman and  
trying to smuggle her across the border in the trunk of a car were 
denied bail, as authorities tried to sort out the woman's claim she 
was being forced into an arranged marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Afghanistan natives Jamal Nasser Aziz, 37, who is the woman's  
uncle, and Wahid Nader, 29, of San Francisco, are a danger to the 
victim, U.S. Magistrate Judge Carol Heckman ruled Friday in denying 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mine Betoor, a scarf in her mouth and another taped around her  
head, was discovered by immigration agents in the trunk of a car at 
Niagara Falls on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto woman told authorities she was trying to avoid an  
arranged marriage to Nader. She said the men knocked her 
unconscious and held her more than two days in the basement of her 
uncle's home in Etobicoke, Ontario, before being put in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives, however, claim she is lying.  
</P>
<P>
	Aziz's brother, Abdul Aziz, said Ms. Betoor and Nader had been  
married since 1994. They produced a document which appeared to be a 
marriage certificate from Pakistan, and family photos which they 
said showed Ms. Betoor and Nader together. 
</P>
<P>
	But whether the two really are married is irrelevant to the  
federal kidnapping charges against Aziz and Nader, said Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Trini Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	``A spouse has no authority to kidnap another spouse,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Giving Son AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) -- Brian Stewart sat quietly in court,  
hands crossed before him, as his former girlfriend spoke of the 
horrors of their son's AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, Stewart remained silent, staring straight ahead,  
as the judge sentenced him to life in prison for injecting the boy 
with HIV-tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe when God finally calls you, you are going to burn in  
hell from here to eternity,'' Judge Ellsworth Cundiff told Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 32, of Columbia, Ill., was convicted last month of  
first-degree assault. Prosecutors said the hospital technician 
injected the blood in his son so he could avoid paying child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to sentencing, the child's mother, identified only as  
Jennifer to protect the boy's anonymity, sobbed as she read a 
statement from her son, now 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel mad ... Why did he do such a bad thing to me,'' she  
quoted the boy as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer said the life sentence was little consolation for what  
Stewart has forced her and her family to endure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who really has been given a life sentence?'' she asked. ``We  
are prisoners without cells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart declined to make a statement. His attorney, Joseph  
Murphy, said his client is innocent and that an appeal has been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and Jennifer dated in the early 1990s. He denied he was  
the father of the boy, though tests later indicated he was. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the child, then 11 months old, was hospitalized in St.  
Charles County. At the time, Stewart worked at a St. Louis hospital 
as a phlebotomist -- a person who draws blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Stewart snuck a syringe filled with HIV-tainted  
blood under a lab coat into the boy's hospital room, then waited 
until they were alone and injected the blood into the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	The child was diagnosed with AIDS in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Ask Tiger Woods a loaded question, expect  
to get a loaded answer. 
</P>
<P>
	After Woods opened with a 4-under 69 in the Mercedes  
Championships, he was asked what he would like to accomplish in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Win every tournament,'' he said before cracking a wide smile.  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe he should have said, ``Win ANY tournament.'' Woods won  
only two times last year, the BellSouth Classic in Duluth, Ga., and 
the Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand by coming from eight strokes 
down on Sunday to beat Ernie Els in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Woods continues to believe that he's much better off than  
he was in 1997 when he won four times, including the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned how to play,'' he said. ``This year is not going to  
be as mechanical a year. I didn't like the way I played in '97, 
even though I won a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has been preaching consistency over the past year and  
notes that he had 13 finishes in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, I'd like to give myself a lot of chances, and  
hopefully the putts will fall at the right time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His new season didn't get off to the best start -- he  
three-putted from 20 feet on the first hole and missed an 8-foot 
eagle putt on the final hole. As the sun set over Maui, he was on 
the putting green with coach Butch Harmon at his side. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *EURO FOR EUROPE:* The euro is the new currency of the PGA  
European Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Schofield, executive director of the European tour, said  
Friday that prize money would be quoted in the new European 
currency instead of British pounds when the tour starts next week 
with the South African PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro, launched Jan. 1 as the new currency of 11 European  
countries, will operate for the next three years as a banking and 
accounting device. Notes and coins -- replacing liras, guilders, 
pesetas, etc. -- will begin appearing in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an historic day on the eve of our 28th season,''  
Schofield said. ``We believe the decision to adopt the euro 
compliments the fact that we are by title, the European Tour, and 
as a pan-European organization we are aware of our responsibility 
to embrace the new political era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading Friday, one euro was worth about 70.6  
British pence and $1.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the PGA European Tour is based in Britain, Britain is  
one of four European Union countries not participating in the 
first-wave conversion to the new currency. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FITNESS CRAZE:* Billy Andrade never will be compared to Craig  
Stadler when it comes to physique, but that didn't stop him from 
taking on a regimented workout schedule during the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been out of shape,'' he said. ``I just felt like  
once the season was over, I wanted to get fired up for this year, 
so I decided to just get in better shape. I did it for a better 
life than better golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He got both in the first round of the Mercedes Championships  
after his 6-under 67 left him one stroke out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``A golf course like this, it helps you,'' Andrade said of the  
hilly Plantation course at Kapalua Resort. ``I just think over the 
course of a year or a career, it can't do anything but help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrade, whose victory in the 1998 Canadian Open was his first  
since 1991, certainly has good examples of what kind of rewards can 
be reaped from working out. David Duval lost about 40 pounds a 
couple of years ago and has seven victories since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only going to help down the road,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PATE ON THE PEAK:* Steve Pate believes the increased  
competition on the PGA Tour, particularly with more players doing 
so well so young, will lead to shorter peak times for the top 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate, 37, won for the first time last year since the 1992 Buick  
Invitational at San Diego. When he joined the PGA Tour in 1985, he 
always figured the peak years were between 30 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you see guys having 10-year peaks any more,''  
Pate said. ``Part of it is because we're getting better athletes 
playing. Guys come out of college prepared to play, tournament 
tough by the time they get out here. I don't think they're lasting 
as long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval, for one, isn't about to buy into that theory.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval was an All-America at Georgia Tech, failed to make the  
tour on his first try but has never finished worse than 11th on the 
money list since his rookie season. His seven victories over the 
past 14 months are more than anyone on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says your real late 20s up to 35 or 36 is when  
everybody hits their prime,'' Duval said. ``I sure hope so. That 
would be a lot of fun.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Defensive End Doleman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- San Francisco defensive end Chris Doleman wrapped  
up one of his best seasons Saturday and also closed the book on his 
illustrious career. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the 49ers' 20-18 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, the  
37-year-old Doleman formally announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is it,'' said Doleman, who still faces surgery to repair  
a torn left pectoral muscle he played with for last six weeks. 
``You'll miss it but it's time to move on. It's time to do 
different things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman finished the regular season with 15 sacks, the  
second-highest total in his 14-year career. He had 21 in 1989 while 
with Minnesota, where he spent the first nine years of his career. 
He also played for Atlanta, where he resides, before coming to San 
Francisco three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Doleman, who has said he plans to buy and operate a car  
dealership, finished with 142.5 sacks to rank fourth all-time in 
NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 14 years, they went by in a blur, really,'' Doleman said.  
``The only thing I wish would have happened a little differently is 
that I would have won a ring along the way but I have no regrets.''

	Clinton Lawyers Promise 'Vigorous' Defense  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for President Clinton are promising a  
``vigorous'' defense in an attempt to quickly convince senators 
that Clinton should remain in office. The Senate has given the 
White House a total of 24 hours to present that defense. House 
prosecutors get the same amount of time. Senators yesterday issued 
a summons seeking a response to perjury and obstruction charges 
against Clinton. The lead prosecutor, House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he was ready to present a 
``compelling case'' for conviction and added that he hoped the 
Senate would agree to his request for witnesses.

	Renewed Fighting in Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- International mediators negotiated  
today for the release of Yugoslav soldiers held by Kosovo Albanian 
guerrillas, but reports of fighting indicated they had failed to 
prevent a new outburst of violence. A Yugoslav army artillery 
attack was reported by both Serb and Albanian sources, even before 
a deadline issued by the army for the release of the eight 
soldiers. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
has been trying to persuade the rebels to release the soldiers, 
fearing the escalating violence will destroy the shaky cease-fire 
reached Oct. 12 that ended seven months of fighting. 

</P>

	Palestinians Demand Troop Pullback

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leaders today demanded that Israel  
proceed with a troop pullback from the West Bank that was to have 
taken place last month under the Wye River peace accord. Israel 
called off the promised withdrawal, citing what it said were 
Palestinian violations of the accord. The Palestinians deny 
violating the agreement, and say they will not meet new terms 
demanded by Israel. In Hebron, meanwhile, several dozen Palestinian 
teen-agers threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli troops 
enforcing a curfew on the downtown.

today around one of the city's main military bases while rebels 
battled government soldiers and their allies for the city. It 
remained unclear how much of the city rebels control, but residents 
said that one of the city's main military bases, the Wilberforce 
Barracks, was under attack today. The latest fighting comes a day 
after a top rebel commander rejected a proclaimed cease-fire. The 
insurgency began when President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was restored to 
power 10 months ago.

	Snow Again for Nation's Eastern Half

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Less than a week after storms pummeled the  
nation's eastern half, the region was again pelted with snow and 
ice that kept many indoors and made travel treacherous. 
Schoolchildren in several states got an early start on their 
weekends as snow, sleet and freezing rain blanketed much of the 
Midwest and Northeast, slowing travel and undoing the recent work 
of busy road crews. Several airports were reporting delays and 
cancellations, including Detroit, where even President Clinton's 
flight was delayed by the weather.

to break up the crowds in Karawang, on the main island of Java, but 
hundreds of people regrouped in several places as soon as the 
officers moved on. Authorities, meanwhile, questioned dozens of 
people detained during more widespread rioting and looting 
yesterday that left two people dead and at least a dozen injured.

The Falcons, who compiled a franchise-best 14-2 record this season,

<HEADLINE> Boxer Jerry Quarry Remembered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHAFTER, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry Quarry, a heavyweight who fought  
Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson and Joe Frazier in the 1960s and 
'70s, was remembered Saturday for the heart he showed in the ring 
and for the way he touched others' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry, who suffered from severe brain damage caused by repeated  
blows to the head, died last Sunday after his family decided to 
remove life support systems. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry was hospitalized with pneumonia Dec. 28 and then suffered  
cardiac arrest. He never regained consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few years he wasn't himself,'' Quarry's younger  
brother, Bobby Quarry, told the Bakersfield Californian. ``But now 
I see him looking down and watching us as his normal self and he 
knows what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry was remembered at a funeral in his native Bakersfield and  
then buried at nearby Shafter Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main judge of a man's character is his heart,'' Bobby  
Quarry said. ``There might be guys equal to him out there, but he 
had intestinal fortitude beyond comparison.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry earned $2.1 million in purses as a top contender in the  
1960s and '70s, but later lost it all through drug and alcohol use 
and three marriages. By age 38, he had been diagnosed with early 
signs of dementia and lived on Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners were former boxers Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini,  
Joey Orbillo, Mac Foster and Alex Ramos. Actor Mickey Rourke, who 
has fought professionally, also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry's legacy is that he gave 100 percent of himself in all  
of his fights,'' Mancini said. ``As a boxer, you leave pieces of 
yourself in every fight and after so many fights, how much of you 
is left? It's unfortunate that the sport wasn't as gracious to him 
as he was to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry had a 53-9-4 pro record after fighting more than 200  
bouts as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his two fights with Ali, who suffers from  
Parkinson's disease, Quarry's career highlights also included two 
fights against Patterson, the former heavyweight champion who now 
has significant memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the bouts against Patterson ended in a draw and Quarry  
won the second on a controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry's brother, Mike, also a fighter, said Jerry possessed a  
rare sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is an uphill battle against the wind,'' Mike Quarry said.  
``People, I think, instinctively abuse each other, but Jerry was a 
person who could overcome that and have a relationship with others, 
even though they fought each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarry loved to sing and write poetry. Some of his poems were  
read by his children at the funeral. He sometimes sang the ``Star 
Spangled Banner'' at fights. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his parents, Jack and Arwanda Quarry; sons  
Jerry Lyn and Jonathan; daughter Keri; brothers Jim, Bobby and 
Mike; sisters Brenda, Dianna, Wilma Pearson and Janet Stassi; and 
five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Team Benched Over Poor Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) -- The Richmond High School gym is a lonely  
place these days. Gone is the cheer of the crowd, the bounce of the 
basketball, the swoosh of a perfectly executed 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not because the high school's basketball team can't play.  
To the contrary, the Oilers have a perfect 13-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
	It's because of poor grades.  
</P>
<P>
	Richmond High coach Ken Carter on Friday said he ordered his  
team out of the gym and into the library because he wants them to 
succeed in all arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not running an NBA training ground,'' the coach said. ``I  
wanted to show our kids that basketball is just one part of their 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, who reviews his players' academic performance every  
Monday, benched the team this week after discovering that 15 of the 
45 varsity and junior varsity members weren't performing up to 
speed. The offenders were committing such infractions as turning in 
homework late or being late to class. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny, they're never tardy to basketball,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Carter canceled practice for the week along with a Friday night  
game and the popular alumni game tonight in which graduates return 
to challenge current players. 
</P>
<P>
	The players with problems aren't failing -- they have the 2.0  
grade average required by the district to participate in sports. 
But they're not making the 2.3 average team players agreed to 
achieve, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Players have been spending the two hours they usually devote to  
practice in the library, getting tutored by librarians, teachers 
and other students. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter says he'll decide Monday whether players have improved  
enough to warrant lifting the embargo and allowing a Tuesday night 
league game to go ahead. Games canceled so far were non-league, so 
the team could yet hold on to their perfect record. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Carter said it looks like the team is going to meet  
their academic goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was calling kids last night. We had kids on conference calls  
working with one another and using their faxes (to help complete 
assignments).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players who are making the grade weren't too happy at first when  
they found out they would have to sit out because of their 
teammates' lagging class performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's killing me,'' Chris Dixon, 17, said at a news conference  
called to discuss the benching. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dixon, a point guard on the varsity team, said it's better  
to deal with problem grades now than later. He said the Richmond 
High football team recently made it to the playoffs, then lost 
because five players didn't have good enough grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a school full of athletes but they can't play because  
of grades,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said the benching affected his son, Damien, who is a  
point guard and has a 3.7 GPA. But the coach said it's important 
for the team to face the grade problem together. Academic skills 
are important for everyone, he points out, both those who will be 
in the job market soon and those who hope to get scholarships to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter knows what's ahead for his students in this working class  
city on the east shore of the San Francisco Bay. He is a 1977 
Richmond High graduate -- he still holds the school basketball 
scoring record -- and in addition to coaching runs a barber shop, 
hair salon and sporting goods store. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to do the best for our kids,'' he said. ``We  
want everybody to make it. We want to win as a team.''

<HEADLINE> Washington Hires Colorado Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Rick Neuheisel, who led Colorado to three  
bowl wins in four seasons, left the school Saturday to become one 
of the nation's highest-paid football coaches at the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel will replace Jim Lambright, fired after the Huskies'  
first non-winning season in 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rick is an extremely bright, innovative, creative and talented  
coach and we are fortunate to welcome him to our program,'' 
Washington athletic director Barbara Hedges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel, 37, will be formally introduced by Washington at a  
news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington offered Neuheisel a seven-year deal worth about $1.5  
million a year, KCNC-TV in Denver reported. Neuheisel was making 
$650,000 a season at Colorado, and was limited to a one-year 
contract as a state employee. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also given an $850,000 home at Colorado, but there was a  
provision he would have to pay the remainder of the mortgage if he 
left before five years. KCNC reported that Washington will pay the 
rest of his mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Steve Spurrier is the nation's highest-paid coach at  
$2 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hastily arranged press conference Saturday night, Colorado  
athletic director Dick Tharp said he was contacted by Hedges a week 
ago asking for permission to talk to Neuheisel. At the time, 
Neuheisel said he was not interested in the position. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Saturday morning, Tharp said, Neuheisel phoned him to  
advise he was now considering an offer from Washington ``that he 
felt he might be compelled to accept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several discussions with Colorado officials, Neuheisel had  
a meeting with his coaching staff to discuss recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 7 p.m., he called me back to inform me he had decided to  
accept this offer,'' Tharp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel's departure comes at a critical time for college  
recruiting. In fact, the Buffaloes were entertaining 11 prospects 
on campus this weekend. National letter-of-intent signing day is 
Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not one given to anger, but I was genuinely disappointed  
given the history of my conversations and the numerous commitments 
that had been made,'' Tharp said. ``On the other hand, I am a 
realist, so I began the process today of identifying a search 
committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how soon the school might start contacting coaching  
candidates, president John Buechner said, ``We're probably going to 
start in about an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel reportedly recommended three current members of his  
staff to be his successor: defensive coordinator A.J. Christoff, 
offensive coordinator Karl Dorrell and defensive ends coach Jon 
Embree. 
</P>
<P>
	Tharp said the search would include both current Colorado  
assistants and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he was able and willing to offer the new coach a Steve  
Spurrier-type package, Tharp said, ``Both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel was 33-14 in four years with the Buffs. Colorado was  
8-4 last season and beat No. 21 Oregon 51-43 in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Right after the Aloha Bowl, as part of a doubleheader,  
Washington lost to Air Force 45-25 in the Oahu Bowl. Lambright was 
fired shortly after that loss left the Huskies 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Texas coach John Mackovic removed himself from the  
running for the Washington job on Friday. Among the other top 
candidates were Toledo's Gary Pinkel and Idaho's Chris Tormey, both 
former Washington assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel was hired in November 1994 as a controversial  
successor to longtime Colorado coach Bill McCartney, who had 
recommended the job go to assistant Bob Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming that Colorado favored the first-time head coach  
Neuheisel, who is white, over Simmons, who is black, the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition openly protested Neuheisel's 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado officials insisted race played no role in their  
decision; Simmons was later hired by Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rocky introduction, Neuheisel enjoyed tremendous  
success in his first two seasons, going 10-2 in 1995 and matching 
that record in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buffs culminated the 1995 season with a 38-6 rout of Oregon  
in the Cotton Bowl and ended the 1996 season with a 33-21 win over 
Neuheisel's new team, Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel experienced his most frustrating year in 1997 as  
Colorado went 5-6 for its first losing record since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappointing finish subjected Neuheisel to criticism about  
his easy-going attitude with his players -- the Buffs enjoyed ski 
trips and inner-tube outings together. He endured added scrutiny 
when the Buffs forfeited their five wins because of an ineligible 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado rebounded this past season, overcoming injuries and  
inexpeience.

<HEADLINE> New Postal Rates Take Effect Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Postal rates increase Sunday for the first  
time in four years, raising the cost of the basic first-class 
letter a penny -- to 33 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite four straight profitable years, the post office says it  
needs added cash to buy equipment, cover rising costs and reduce 
outstanding debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally, the rate increase had been expected to take effect  
last summer, but it was postponed at the urging of the Postal Rate 
Commission and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The first 33-cent stamps went on sale last Tuesday, with  
first-day ceremonies in Los Angeles. In addition, there are 
millions of undenominated ``H'' rate stamps available at post 
offices to cover the 33-cent rate, as well as 1-cent stamps that 
can be added to leftover 32-cent steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail without enough postage will be delivered postage due. If  
the recipient declines to pay the extra postage, the item will be 
returned to the sender. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. stamp price goes up for the basic one-ounce  
letter, there is a one-cent reduction -- to 22 cents -- in the charge 
for each additional ounce. 
</P>
<P>
	That means someone sending a two-ounce letter would pay 55  
cents, the same as at present. A three-ounce letter now costs 77 
cents, a penny less than the old rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rates cover most types of mail. In other typical price  
changes a priority mail package will rise from $3 to $3.20; sending 
a local newspaper will cost 15.7 cents, up from 14.5 cents; the 
price to mail a national magazine will rise from 27.1 cents to 29.1 
cents and a basic parcel post package that cost $2.42 to send will 
rise to $2.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase does not affect international mail.

<HEADLINE> Carefree Cardinals Can Make History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals want nothing more than  
to forget about their sad past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing I've heard since coming into the NFL,'' said  
center Aaron Graham, ``was the first thing I heard our coach say in 
our first team meeting, and that was that he's sick of all the 
historians around here. He wanted some pioneers, and that's what 
we're trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Make history.  
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, that's exactly what the mighty Minnesota Vikings are  
out to accomplish, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	They're 0-4 in Super Bowls and believe this is their year to do  
what the Denver Broncos did last year, finally hold high that 
elusive Lombardi Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only are the Cardinals 15 1/2-point underdogs and playing the  
highest-scoring team in NFL history, but they will face a team 
carrying nearly four decades of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Cards are putting up a brave front.  
</P>
<P>
	They've already exceeded expectations by making the playoffs for  
the first time in 17 seasons and by winning their first postseason 
game in 51 years, a stunning 20-7 upset at Dallas last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they're preparing -- praying? -- for one of the colossal  
upsets of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe it or not, we're still not satisfied with where we  
are,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, the Cardiac Cards can talk a good game.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are expecting us to show up this week.  
That's how touted these guys are,'' safety Tommy Bennett said. 
``And it really doesn't matter to us. We're out here ready to play 
and expecting to win this football game. I mean, they're not 
perfect; it's not like they haven't been defeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OK, they lost once, and even then they scored the first four  
times they had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals coach Vince Tobin knows what he's up against, and  
that's the deepest, most talented team in football, one with tons 
of talent and no glaring defects. 
</P>
<P>
	Name their weakness.  
</P>
<P>
	You can't.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just quantity, it's quality,'' Tobin said.  
</P>
<P>
	Especially on offense.  
</P>
<P>
	If Minnesota quarterback Randall Cunningham gets going, Arizona  
had better bring ear plugs to the earsplitting Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The minute you give them a reason to stand up and start  
cheering, that's going to be rough,'' said Arizona tackle Lomas 
Brown. ``So, hopefully, we can get out there and not fall behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's as much an admonition to themselves as a rallying cry.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we go in there in awe of these guys, in awe of their record  
and the things they've accomplished this year, then we're going to 
put ourselves in a hole,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he figures the Vikings might be rusty.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about being off is you're not at that level you need  
to be at, meaning you haven't been going to meetings, you've been 
kind of lax, sitting back and watching other people play,'' Brown 
said. ``So you haven't had to get your motor going and revved up to 
get ready for this, and it might take them a couple of series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Aneas Williams will face one of the more difficult  
tasks of his career, slowing down Minnesota's receiving corps of 
Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the exciting thing about life,'' Williams said. ``We  
get a chance to live today and change the course of history.''

<HEADLINE> Gubicza Could Return to Royals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Mark Gubicza might be in the mood for a  
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Kansas City 20-game winner, who sat out last season  
because of a shoulder injury, is thinking about pitching again for 
the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox recently gave Gubicza a tryout.  
</P>
<P>
	``It surprised me,'' Gubicza said. ``I thought if somebody shows  
interest, why not? What have you got to lose?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox do not need a starter as badly as the Royals, who  
lost Tim Belcher to free agency. Belcher has consistently turned in 
more than 200 innings a year in his career, and his departure 
leaves a big hole on the Kansas City staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting the itch to come back,'' said the 36-year-old  
Gubicza. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals had offered Gubicza a job as a minor league pitching  
instructor, but may be tempted to take another look at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't really aware he was interested in playing,'' general  
manager Herk Robinson said. ``We haven't really discussed it. We'll 
have to discuss it. I've always had a tremendous amount of respect 
for Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gubicza has a 132-136 career record with a 3.96 earned run  
average. He had been traded by the Royals to the Anaheim Angels 
after the 1996 season for Chili Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	If he has sufficiently recovered from the shoulder injury, he  
could give another option to the Royals, who are unsure about the 
extent of the recovery of Kevin Appier. Appier missed nearly all of 
last season with various injuries, and apparently has not regained 
all of his velocity. 
</P>
<P>
	Gubicza said he has been throwing for about a month and has been  
working himself into shape for several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know he's in shape,'' said Royals bench coach Jamie Quirk.  
``Whether he can still pitch, that will be what spring training is 
all about. I hope he pursues it and has his people call Herk. I'd 
love to see (him) try it one more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I started there, and it would be nice to come back and finish  
there,'' Gubicza said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals also said they were considering the return of Jim  
Eisenreich as a left-handed pinch hitter. Eisenreich, 39, batted 
.215 in 105 games last season for Los Angeles and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenreich is a career .290 hitter in 15 big-league seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to his agent a couple of times,'' Robinson said.  
``I don't want to sign Jim Eisenreich unless we can almost assure 
him that he's going to be on the club. I think that's the proper 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would be fair to bring him in as a non-roster  
player, let him got through the whole spring and not take him with 
us. You know what you're getting with Jim. it's not a case of 
evaluating him in spring training.''

	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon was  
released from the hospital Saturday after having coronary artery 
bypass surgery earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors at St. John's Hospital said they expect Simon to recover

<HEADLINE> OSU's Katzenmoyer Opts for Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Academic eligibility will not be a problem  
for Ohio State's Andy Katzenmoyer next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Butkus-award winning linebacker, whose status was in  
question until he passed three summer school courses only days 
before last season's opener, is leaving school a year early for the 
NFL draft, Ohio State announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``After much consultation with his parents about this decision,  
he has decided to forego his senior season and will enter the NFL 
draft,'' Ohio State defensive coordinator Fred Pagac said. ``He 
simply felt that at this time it is in his best interests to move 
on and declare for the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was the deadline for underclassmen to declare their  
intentions of being included in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, a 6-foot-4, 255-pounder known for his jarring hits,  
was the first Ohio State linebacker to start as a freshman. He's 
the second Buckeye this week to jump to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Ohio State's record-setting wide receiver, David  
Boston, announced he would give up his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
	The decisions by Katzenmoyer and Boston raised to 12 the number  
of underclassmen who have given up at least one year of eligibility 
to enter the NFL draft since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State's athletics department confirmed Katzenmoyer's  
decision with a release Friday night and said he was not available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer has complained of media coverage and has not spoken  
to reporters for months. A telephone number for him could not be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer, dubbed ``The Big Kat,'' became one of the most  
recognizable Buckeyes after he was selected as the first defensive 
player to earn Associated Press Mr. Football honors as a senior at 
suburban Westerville South High School. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked for and received jersey No. 45. No Buckeye player had  
worn that number since Archie Griffin wore it and became the only 
two-time Heisman Trophy winner in 1974 and 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer started all 12 games as a freshman for the Buckeyes,  
recording 23 tackles for negative yardage, including 12 sacks. He 
also intercepted four passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his numbers fell off somewhat the next two seasons, he  
was still a first-team All-America selection in 1997 and became the 
first sophomore to receive the Butkus Award, given annually to the 
nation's top linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
	As a junior this past fall, he was dropped to second-team  
All-Big Ten by the conference coaches behind teammate Na'il Diggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagac said Katzenmoyer will be tough to replace.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great football player. He's a great young man,'' Pagac  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer also has been a lightning rod for critics.  
</P>
<P>
	He was charged and convicted of underage drinking after a  
policeman saw him with a beer at a bar on his official Ohio State 
recruiting visit. He paid a $193 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Last winter, he was arrested on charges of speeding and drunken  
driving and pleaded no contest. He paid a $300 fine, his license 
was suspended for 180 days and he attended three days of alcohol 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Ohio State's first game last September, he was able  
to maintain his eligibility only after passing three summer-session 
courses: AIDS awareness, music and golf.

<HEADLINE> Africa's AIDS Orphans Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- At a brightly decorated orphanage,  
feverish infants with runny noses peer through crib bars, while 
healthier children swoop down slides outside in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	They are part of the world's fastest growing population of  
orphans and among the most unwanted -- children who have lost their 
parents to the AIDS epidemic sweeping sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 8 million African children have been orphaned by AIDS,  
and at least 1 million children are infected with the AIDS virus, 
the United Nations says. 
</P>
<P>
	Few African children are adopted by foreigners, largely because  
extended families have traditionally taken in orphans. But AIDS has 
changed that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	With many more orphans -- and fewer working-age adults to support  
them -- relatives have become emotionally and financially 
overburdened. Often, AIDS-infected children are abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these children end up at Nyumbani Hospice, a cheerful,  
53-bed residence in Karen, a Nairobi suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca Maisha Friedlander, now 3, is one of the lucky ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Given up at birth by her AIDS-infected mother, Rebecca was  
adopted by a Kenyan family. But when she was 3 months old, she 
developed bronchial pneumonia and tested positive for the AIDS 
virus. Her adoptive family left her at Nyumbani. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Americans Eric Goldscheider and Debbi  
Friedlander, temporarily living in Kenya, visited Nyumbani and 
spotted Rebecca and her radiant grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took her for the weekend, and that was it. There was a  
definite spark, a definite connection,'' Goldscheider said from his 
home in Amherst, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Assured Rebecca no longer tested positive for the AIDS virus as  
she shed her mother's antibodies, the couple decided to adopt her. 
</P>
<P>
	Then new tests gave a positive virus reading. Still, the couple  
chose to go ahead, even if it meant ``having to grieve the early 
death of a loved child,'' Goldscheider said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family received a U.S. visa to take Rebecca home. Best of  
all, later tests showed she was free of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebecca's parents gave her a new middle name of Maisha, which  
means ``life'' in Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is what we call her now,'' Goldscheider said. ``Most people  
who meet her would agree that she is certainly full of life.''

<HEADLINE> Denver's Terrell Davis Wins NFL MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Already honored as the NFL's best offensive  
player and the only unanimous All-Pro selection, Denver running 
back Terrell Davis was selected Saturday as the league's Most 
Valuable Player by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the game's biggest stars at the age of 26, Davis became  
the fourth player to rush for 2,000 yards in a season when he 
gained 2,008. He also ran for 21 touchdowns and was instrumental in 
the Super Bowl champions posting a 14-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's cool,'' Davis said. ``I'm overwhelmed. That's wild.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos clearly now are as much Davis' team as they are John  
Elway's. 
</P>
<P>
	Who says?  
</P>
<P>
	Says Elway, the only other Broncos player to win the award  
(1987). 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at what he did, especially when everything was on the  
line, and he had a great year,'' Elway said. ``It's not to take 
anything away from Randall Cunningham or those types of people, but 
we're definitely not where we are without Terrell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis received 25 of the 47 votes from a nationwide panel of  
sports writers and broadcasters. Minnesota quarterback Cunningham, 
the league's top-rated passer, was second with 14 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings receiver Randy Moss, the Offensive Rookie of the Year,  
and Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson were next with four votes 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	For Davis, the postseason has been as good as the regular  
season. He won his second Offensive Player of the Year -- the other 
was in 1996 -- and led everyone in the All-Pro balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that you think would never happen,'' Davis said  
of succeeding Brett Favre and Barry Sanders, who tied for most 
valuable player last season. ``I've won a few awards, but I don't 
think anything comes close to winning MVP of the entire league. 
I've won offensive player, but this is defensive players and all 
players included. 
</P>
<P>
	``First of all, I want to thank my teammates and the people who  
made it possible: my linemen, who did a great job of blocking all 
year and came through for me each game; Howard (fullback Howard 
Griffith), and the receivers blocking downfield. So with me, any 
time I win something like this, it's more of a team accomplishment. 
It's like our team received the MVP award.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who helped Denver score 501 points, the most in the AFC,  
also had two touchdowns on receptions. His yards rushing and TDs 
led the league. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 13th time a running back won the award, as Davis  
joined Jim Brown, Earl Campbell, Walter Payton, Marcus Allen and 
Sanders as runners who were selected MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is very good company,'' he said. ``I seem to find myself  
in a lot of good company lately. I really appreciate it.''

</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Allyn, a television and movie  
producer whose successful films include ``Cousins'' and ``Rich and 
Famous,'' died Sunday from complications of heart disease. He was 
71. 
</P>
<P>
	Allyn began his career as a stage actor. His first role was as a  
teen-ager on Broadway with Marlon Brando in ``A Flag Is Born.'' He 
also was in ``Ring Around the Moon'' and toured in ``I Am a 
Camera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allyn then spent many years producing shows for television,  
including about 350 episodes of ``Peyton Place'' and such TV movies 
as ``And No One Could Save Her'' and ``The Last Child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the big screen, Allyn specialized in remakes. His first major  
hit was the 1981 ``Rich and Famous,'' a remake of the 1943 drama 
``Old Acquaintance.'' In 1988, he produced the love story 
``Cousins,'' which reprised the 1975 French film ``Cousin, 
Cousine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently had been working on a remake of the 1937 film  
``Stage Door.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Zalman Bernstein, a securities maverick who  
founded one of the world's largest independent investment 
companies, died Wednesday from complications of lymphoma. He was 
72. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein sent shockwaves through Wall Street in the late 1960s  
when he announced his firm would seek nothing but accounts for 
which brokers would make all investment decisions without input 
from clients. 
</P>
<P>
	His brokerage, Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Company, eventually  
managed more than $80 billion in securities for 25,000 private and 
institutional clients. 
</P>
<P>
	When he converted to Orthodox Judaism, Bernstein replaced his  
name with the Hebrew equivalent of Sanford and became Zalman 
Bernstein.

<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Archbishop Emeritus Bartolome Carrasco  
Briseno, an advocate for the poor in the 17 years he led the Roman 
Catholic archdiocese of Oaxaca, died Thursday of kidney failure. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrasco Briseno, the archbishop of Oaxaca from 1976 to 1993,  
was an advocate of liberation theology, which sees the church's 
mission as lifting people out of oppression and poverty. Oaxaca, in 
the southwest, is one of Mexico's poorest states. 
</P>
<P>
	He was ordained as a priest in 1945. Before becoming archbishop  
of Oaxaca, he served as bishop in the cities of Huejutla and 
Tapachula.

	LORAIN, Ohio (AP) -- Jim Mahony, a journalist who spent 63 years  
at The Morning Call and wrote a popular daily lighthearted column, 
died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, he started writing ``Mahony's Memos,'' which  
became a custodian of Lorain's memories and folklore. Although he 
retired in 1988, he continued to write his column for 10 more years 
and stopped writing it less than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahony was 17 when he started at the paper as a sportswriter the  
day after he graduated from high school in 1935. He became sports 
editor three years later. Eventually, he became city editor, then 
news editor. 
</P>
<P>

13 grandchildren and a sister.

</P>
<P>
	In addition to publishing the weekly newspaper, McGaughey served  
as a Holbrook selectman for 19 years and was town administrator for

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Henrietta Moraes, a nude model whose life was  
marked by extreme indulgence that included a brief career as a 
burglar, died Wednesday, according to obituaries published Friday 
in The Times and The Guardian newspapers. She was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Moraes inspired painter Francis Bacon, who painted her more than  
a dozen times, once as a nude pinned to a bed by a hypodermic 
needle, titled ``Lying Girl with Hypodermic Syringe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the publication of her 1994 autobiography,  
``Henrietta,'' she was lionized in the media as a lonely survivor 
of wilder times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some models inspire painters by their looks, others by their  
personality,'' Tim Hilton wrote in The Guardian. ``Henrietta was 
foul-mouthed, amoral, a thief, a violent drunkard and a drug 
addict. Yet she was witty, wonderfully warm and lovable. Her 
presence in any room immediately told you that life is more 
thrilling than we dull folk imagine.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Professor George Joseph Popjak, an  
internationally recognized scientist known for his research into 
cholesterol, died Dec. 30. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Popjak began his study of lipid metabolism after he moved to  
England from Hungary in 1939. In 1968, he accepted an offer of 
professorships in both biological chemistry and psychiatry at the 
University of California at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He published more than 230 scientific papers and several books  
and remained an active researcher after he retired in 1984, 
focusing on atherosclerosis.

</P>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Norman Reyes, a Filipino-American  
radio broadcaster who was the voice of the resistance on Bataan 
peninsula during one of bloodiest battles of World War II, died 
Thursday from complications of a stroke. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes was one of two men who operated a guerrilla radio station  
in Bataan, west of Manila, to rally Filipino and American defenders 
of the peninsula against Japanese invaders. His voice was heard by 
Filipinos and American soldiers that announced the fall of Bataan 
on April 9, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines, then a U.S. colony, was among the first targets  
of Japanese invasion after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Overwhelmed 
by the onslaught, American commanders in the Manila area decided to 
retreat to Bataan, believing that U.S. reinforcements would soon 
land on its shores. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. fleet never came, and the peninsula instead turned  
into a trap from which the starving American and Filipino troops 
could not escape. 
</P>
<P>
	After their surrender on Bataan, about 70,000 U.S. and Filipino  
prisoners of war were forced by Japanese soldiers to make the 
nearly 100-mile ``Death March'' to a prison camp in Capas. About 
54,000 made it. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes was captured and taken to Tokyo, where he worked with the  
infamous ``Tokyo Rose,'' doing propaganda broadcasts at Radio 
Tokyo. He was tried in the United States on suspicion of being a 
Japanese spy, but was later cleared of the charges.

<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Harold E. Scott, who from 1979 to 1989 served  
as executive presbyter of the Pittsburgh Presbytery, died Wednesday 
of cancer. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	During his tenure as presbyter, Scott presided over what was  
then the country's largest presbytery, which had nearly 200 
churches and about 93,000 members. An organizer and consensus 
builder, he was pivotal in reorganizing the presbytery's mission 
focus and committee structure. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a pastor for 12 years, serving in Richmond, Kan., Des  
Moines, Iowa, and Santa Ana, Calif.

<HEADLINE> INS Deports Record Number in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A record 171,154 illegal immigrants were  
expelled from the United States in the 1998 fiscal year, a 50 
percent jump from the 114,386 deported a year earlier, the 
government reports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Removals play a crucial role in our effort to restore (the)  
credibility of our nation's immigration laws,'' Doris Meissner, 
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in 
releasing the statistics Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not include the estimated 1.5 million cases of  
illegal immigrants apprehended at the U.S. borders last year, most 
in the Southwest, and immediately turned back. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third of those deported, 56,011 people, were ousted because  
of their criminal records. Nearly half of the criminal aliens had 
drug convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican nationals accounted for 81 percent of the overall  
removals and 78 percent of the criminal removals last year, the INS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Removals have increased in each of the last five years as the  
agency has enjoyed major funding increases from Congress and the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the House Judiciary immigration subcommittee  
also cited a tough 1996 immigration law for the increased 
deportations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new INS deportation numbers are further proof that the  
1996 immigration reform law has untied immigration agents' hands to 
promptly return illegal aliens and is having a tremendous impact,'' 
said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``It is securing America's borders, 
reducing crime, protecting jobs and saving taxpayers billions of 
dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even as deportations are increasing, the number of illegal  
immigrants living in the United States continues to grow. The 
illegal alien population is estimated at more than 5 million people 
and growing by 275,000 annually.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Continues Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- If Gov. Gray Davis' education reform  
ideas seem to have a familiar ring, it's because many of them were 
already proposed or started under his predecessor Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	From teacher accountability to statewide testing, Davis is  
moving forward with the policies of his Republican predecessor, the 
Legislature and education reformers before him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything in this proposal that you could  
characterize fairly as a radical departure from what has gone on in 
the past, and I think that's good,'' said Jerry Hayward, 
co-director of Policy Analysis for California Education, a 
think-tank based at the University of California, Berkeley, and 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see us on this road,'' Hayward said, noting that  
education reforms take a long time to implement. It's better for 
Davis to build on recent changes than to switch to a drastic new 
approach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Davis also has a leg up on Wilson thanks to the  
Democratic takeover of Sacramento, the recent health of 
California's economy and a close working relationship with the 
California Teachers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson and Republican-appointed Board of Education members often  
battled Democratic Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine 
Eastin and the CTA, which has been a loyal contributor to the 
California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Eastin, Davis' Education Secretary Gary Hart, the teachers'  
union and eventually the state school board will be working in 
relative unison, providing a new momentum for reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, education is being given priority. That means a  
lot,'' said Esther Pereira, superintendent for about 160 students 
in Gorman, a small town in the Tehachapi mountains north of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	For Davis' part, the new governor has not characterized his  
ideas as original and openly admits he will borrow liberally from 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said in his inauguration speech, he didn't care if an idea  
came from the Republicans or the Democrats,'' said Lois Tinson, 
president of the California Teachers Association. ``As long as it 
was a good idea, he'd work with it.''

<HEADLINE> Satirist Sentenced in Beating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- An author who says his pro-violence books  
and articles are merely satirical has been sentenced to three years 
for beating his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	James T. Goad avoided a possible 7 1/2-year sentence in agreeing to  
plead guilty Friday to attempted kidnapping and assault charges, 
Multnomah County prosecutor Rod Underhill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came last May, when his former girlfriend suffered  
two broken bones in her face during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Goad, 37, is the publisher of Answer Me, a magazine that has  
devoted an issue to rape with articles entitled ``Let's Hear it for 
Violence Toward Women'' and ``Rape is Love.'' Other issues include 
drawings by serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote ``The Redneck Manifesto,'' a book which contends  
that poor whites have been systematically victimized and used as 
scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
	Goad repeatedly has claimed his work is satirical.

<HEADLINE> Wolf Not Saying Who Might Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf knows exactly the type of  
person he wants as successor to Mike Holmgren as coach of the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said he's looking for someone of championship caliber,  
``someone who's been there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are enormous shoes to fill, make no mistake about  
that,'' Wolf said Friday after Holmgren was hired by the Seattle 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf denied having someone in mind or even a list of finalists.  
</P>
<P>
	The prospective list drafted by news media includes three former  
Packers assistants: Ray Rhodes, Dick Jauron and Steve Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhodes, 58, a former Philadelphia Eagles coach who had been  
defensive coordinator for the Packers and San Francisco 49ers, was 
expected in Green Bay this weekend for interviews, Milwaukee 
television station WITI said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Philadelphia television station WTXF late Friday he had  
no job invitation from the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid reports there could be an announcement by Tuesday, Wolf  
denied he had a timetable for naming a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't going to be like one of these little high school  
prom things where you are picking the best looking or the most 
compatible,'' Wolf said. ``This is a situation where you have to 
get somebody that is of championship caliber and championship 
quality, and that is what we are going to try and do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly don't have a list of names. I have some names running  
around in my head,'' he said. ``Some of the best coaches happen to 
be in college football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Holmgren assistant coaches would probably be replaced, Wolf  
said, adding some might be considered as Holmgren's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent among them are quarterback coach Andy Reid, who was  
interviewed earlier in the week by the Eagles, and offensive 
coordinator Sherman Lewis, who has shopped for more than a year for 
a coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	Packers tight end Tyrone Davis said Holmgren's departure will  
affect the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody on that team would love to follow Mike wherever he  
went. We all love to play for him,'' Davis said. ``He is such a 
good coach that I am sure he will have an effect on some of the 
free agents this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but get a little nervous,'' Davis said. ``Your  
head coach leaves. You know he is going to take people with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Jacksonville's Jauron and San Francisco's Mariucci, the  
news media list included Atlanta Falcons offensive line coach Art 
Shell, New York Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, Denver 
Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and Minnesota Vikings 
offensive coordinator Brian Billick. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Mariucci, Wolf said: ``He is the coach at San  
Francisco. He is under contract to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Pro tight end Mark Chmura insisted it matters little who  
replaces Holmgren as long as Green Bay has quarterback Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you step on that field with Brett Favre, you can go  
all the way,'' Chmura said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very good football team. It is a veteran football  
team. It is a team that needs jarring. It needs a little electrical 
shock,'' Wolf said. ``The nucleus is here. Anytime you start with 
Brett Favre, you got an edge up on just about everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre agent Bus Cook said Holmgren's leaving ends a Packers era.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brett came in with Mike. I am sure Brett hates to see him go  
and at the same time is proud and happy for Mike,'' Cook said. 
``Brett will continue to work hard, whoever is the coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Favre was en route from Green Bay to Mississippi when Holmgren  
announced he was leaving the Packers, Cook said.

<HEADLINE> Sir Bear Wins at Gulfstream Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla (AP) -- Sir Bear, who won the $100,000 Grade 3  
Broward Handicap at odds of 26-1 last year, repeated the victory at 
Gulfstream Park on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	This time the 6-year-old Florida bred horse was a 7-5 favorite.  
Sir Bear prevailed by three-quarters of a length, after a 
stretch-long battle with Behrens. 
</P>
<P>
	Longshot J. Hanarsaan was third in a field of eight going a a  
mile and one-sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broward is a prep for the $500,000 Grade 1 Donn Handicap on  
Jan. 30, a race that is expected to draw Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey, Sir Bear was timed in at 1:43 3-5 and  
paid $4.40, $3.30 and $2.40. Behrens paid $6.40 and $4.60. 
Hanarsaan paid $5 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Bred and owned by Al and Barbara Smollin, Sir Bear earned  
$202,684 in his first 28 races. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the son of Sir Leon won $725,000 in 11 starts. He won  
four, including the Grade 1 Cigar Mile at Aqueduct. He was out of 
the money only once. His earnings now total $988,660.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Interim President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Larry Thrailkill, hired to oversee the San  
Francisco 49ers after Carmen Policy's abrupt departure as club 
president, resigned Saturday, saying he had completed his caretaker 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of Thrailkill, the chief operating officer for the  
DeBartolo Corp. and a Nashville-based corporate lawyer, had been 
anticipated. He did not attend the team's final two regular season 
games or last week's playoff victory over Green Bay and was seldom 
at the team's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated when he assumed the team presidency in July that he  
had no interest in working permanently for the club. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thrailkill stated in his written resignation that he had  
fulfilled his duties to the team and the Edward J. DeBartolo 
Corp.,'' the team said in a statement released before Saturday's 
divisional playoff game against Atlanta. ``Additionally, Thrailkill 
expressed a strong desire to return to his family, home and law 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John McVay, the team's interim general manager, is the team's  
highest remaining front-office executive and will oversee club 
operations pending the appointment of a permanent replacement for 
club president. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh, who led the 49ers to three Super  
Bowls wins during the 1980s, is widely expected to rejoin the team 
in a yet to be determined front-office capacity. Walsh could be 
hired as early as next week, a team source told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrailkill's departure also could mean the return of Eddie  
DeBartolo as the active club owner. DeBartolo ceded control of the 
team to his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, in December 1997, when 
he was targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McVay said work was continuing on a proposal to  
extend coach Steve Mariucci's contract and he expected to wrap it 
up shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what I understand, we're very close, Mariucci said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci is finishing the second year of a five-year deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The contract extension for head coach Steve Mariucci will be  
finalized by John McVay,'' the team added in the statement. 
``Denise DeBartolo York and Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. will be advised 
on all matters pertaining to the Mariucci deal. John McVay, 49ers 
interim assistant to the president, will assume all other duties 
previously held by Thrailkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McVay, the team's chief football administrator under former  
coaches Walsh and George Seifert, was brought out of retirement two 
months ago when it became apparent that Dwight Clark would leave as 
general manager to join Policy as an executive with the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. Clark left the 49ers in late November and now 
works with Policy, who resigned as 49ers president July 22 after a 
falling out with DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony crime  
last October, was fined $2 million and placed on probation. He also 
must testify in the case of former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who 
allegedly accepted $400,000 from DeBartolo in an influence-peddling 
scheme involving riverboat casino permits. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo has asked to be reinstated as active owner. NFL  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue is reviewing the case. A ruling is 
expected by next month.

<HEADLINE> More Snow for Nation's Eastern Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Less than a week after storms pummeled the  
nation's eastern half, the region was again pelted -- this time with 
a gentler dose of snow and ice that nonetheless kept many indoors 
and made travel treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, the stormy weather Friday wreaked temporary havoc on  
a state pastime: 90 high school basketball games were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got basically a blanket of ice,'' Indiana State Trooper  
Jackie Taylor said. ``We're really bad right now. All our roads are 
completely covered with snow and ice and it's just really 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolchildren in several states got an early start on their  
weekends as snow, sleet and freezing rain pelted much of the 
Midwest and Northeast, slowing travel and undoing the recent work 
of busy road crews. 
</P>
<P>
	Many areas were getting their third blast of snowfall in less  
than a week, including last weekend's monster storm that paralyzed 
parts of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as 8 inches fell in western Maryland. With schools shut  
down across the state, conditions were just right for Brandon 
Hinson, 15, to take his inner tube down a hill at City Park in 
Hagerstown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's soft, it's not just packing together,'' he said. ``You  
slide right on top of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flights were delayed at several airports, including  
Baltimore-Washington International, where two main runways had to 
be plowed. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of incoming flights were canceled at Detroit  
Metropolitan Airport, where even Air Force One was delayed by the 
weather. President Clinton, who had toured an auto show, left for 
Washington about 30 minutes late because of the slush, muck and 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
	In West Virginia, schools closed in 54 of the state's 55  
counties because of the snow. A falling tree limb killed a woman 
driving with her husband in Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
	The snow made road conditions hazardous in many areas; a driver  
was killed in Cleveland when her car slid half under the side of a 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Ohio, basketball games and concerts were postponed  
and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum said a symposium on 
Elvis Presley scheduled for this weekend was canceled because the 
weather was preventing speakers from making it to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Icy roads, bridges and overpasses also made a mess in Kentucky  
and Arkansas, and led to dangerous conditions in Oklahoma, where 
three people died in accidents.

<HEADLINE> Senate Agrees on Trial Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Approving ground rules aimed at substituting  
judicial decorum for partisanship, the Senate is giving itself the 
feel of a courtroom as President Clinton's impeachment trial begins 
in earnest next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators voted 100-0 Friday to move the trial forward in a  
bipartisan spirit and quickly delivered a summons to the White 
House seeking a response to perjury and obstruction of justice 
charges against Clinton returned by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting on the second day of the first presidential impeachment  
trial since 1868, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, 
the Senate adopted the script for the courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
	Following consideration of any motions Wednesday, House  
prosecutors will present their opening arguments Thursday. 
Twenty-four hours will be allotted for their statements, to be 
followed by 24 hours for the president's attorneys. The time could 
be used, for example, in three eight-hour days. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement sets procedures for the Senate to decide later in  
the trial whether the case should be dismissed or whether witnesses 
should be heard before votes on the two articles of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that anybody will forget that on the first vote  
of the first (presidential) impeachment in 130 years that we cast a 
unanimous, nonpartisan vote. Nobody can take that back,'' said Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who helped forge the unanimous agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who labored with  
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota to find common 
ground, hailed the agreement today in the weekly Republican radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were faced with a solemn and difficult task: arranging the  
trial of a president of the United States,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All week, we had seemed hopelessly divided. But after  
listening to one another, speaking face-to-face, we came together 
in the last 15 minutes of our meeting. It was a moment none of us 
will ever forget,'' he continued. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that, when this is all over, no matter what the  
outcome, you will be proud of your Senate -- and prouder still that 
our system of government is able to handle even this momentous 
matter with civility, order and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, fairness.''  
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, it appeared like the trial would share the same  
partisan rancor that characterizes many legislative issues in the 
Senate. But Friday morning, in the Old Senate Chamber where great 
debates were held before the Civil War, the senators held a 
private, informal session. They reminded themselves of great 
historical moments and the need to separate the trial from everyday 
political struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's resident historian, Democrat Robert Byrd of West  
Virginia, asked his colleagues ``to step back from the brink of 
political gamesmanship. I ask everyone here who might harbor such 
feelings to abandon any thought of mean-spirited, destructive, 
vengeful, partisan warfare.'' His remarks were released after the 
closed session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate took his advice, and that of others who exhorted the  
lawmakers to settle their differences while still in the historic 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, special counsel Gregory Craig pledged a  
``vigorous, successful and complete defense. ... We are optimistic 
that senators, once they see and hear this defense ... will 
conclude the articles do not justify or warrant conviction or 
removal from office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lead prosecutor, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry  
Hyde, R-Ill., said he was ready to present a ``compelling case'' 
and added that he hoped the Senate would agree to his request for 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is accused of committing perjury and obstruction of  
justice in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual 
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the timetable approved Friday, it will likely be the last  
week in January before presentations are concluded and the Senate 
takes its first substantive votes on Clinton's fate -- deciding 
whether to adjourn the trial or proceed further with witnesses. It 
takes a two-thirds vote to convict a president and remove him from 
office. But a simple majority is sufficient for all other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate agrees to allow witnesses, they would be  
questioned in closed session and senators would then decide who 
would be permitted to testify.

<HEADLINE> ABL Demise Could Change WNBA Makeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Keri Chaconas wanted to get married in the spring to avoid a  
conflict with the Washington Mystics' training camp. Now, she'll be 
worried about keeping her job when she returns from her honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaconas, a 3-point specialist for the WNBA's Mystics who  
started just one game last season, is uncertain about her future 
after the collapse of the rival American Basketball League three 
days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many marginal WNBA players, Chaconas fears an influx of the  
ABL's best players will push her off the roster of a team that went 
3-27 last year and is desperate for more talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of players out there to choose from,'' she  
said. ``It's going to be much tougher to land a spot on a team. The 
WNBA is the only option now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Rizzotti is one of those ABL stars who plan to seek  
work in the WNBA. The point guard for the New England Blizzard 
talked with the league last season before signing a three-year 
contract extension with the Blizzard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know from talking with the WNBA that it's certainly not a  
bad option, and I definitely want to be part of it,'' said 
Rizzotti, who's also getting married but may have to postpone the 
wedding, planned for July. ``Everyone around women's basketball has 
always said the best thing is one league. Hopefully, we can have 
one that's very successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL, a fall-winter league that debuted in 1996 about eight  
months before the WNBA, went bankrupt Dec. 22 and suspended the 
rest of its 1998-99 season. Players on its nine teams were told to 
expect only part of their December paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing, being a woman and an athlete,'' Chaconas  
said. ``That was a great opportunity, there were two leagues for 
women to show their skills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA, which plays from June to August, already had planned  
to expand to 12 teams, with new franchises in Minnesota and 
Orlando, Fla., this year. WNBA officials say it's too early to 
speculate on whether the ABL's demise will lead to more expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown of the ABL came during the NBA lockout. So,  
officials at the WNBA and at the NBA Players' Association, which 
also represents WNBA players, have not had much time to fully 
consider how the ABL's demise will affect them. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions that may have to be considered are whether  
the WNBA should hold a supplemental draft of ABL players, and 
whether the WNBA will limit the number of ABL players on its 
rosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still premature to have definitive answers in regard to  
the ABL players and their assimilation into the WNBA,'' said WNBA 
spokesman Mark Pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Brian Agler, who is moving from the ABL's Columbus Quest  
to the WNBA's team in Minnesota, said he has talked to his former 
players about their future and could reunite with some of them on 
his new team. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie Smith, the Quest's most popular player, has said she will  
look into joining the WNBA after playing with the U.S. national 
team this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how the WNBA is going to plan formation of its  
expansion teams, so it would be premature to speculate too much,'' 
Agler said. ``With a flood of players available, I don't know how 
they will be disbursed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Layden, coach of the Utah Starzz, said the disappearance  
of the ABL will lead to changes in the surviving league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, it will mean that the caliber of player is better  
and that it will be tougher to make a WNBA team. Training camps 
will be very competitive, no doubt about it,'' he said. ``But the 
WNBA appears to be adding a couple of new teams each year, so 
eventually there will be more professional jobs playing basketball 
for women in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Layden would like to see another league form, perhaps a notch  
below the WNBA in talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more opportunities the women have to play, the better the  
talent will be,'' he said. ``That's why I hope there can be a 
CBA-type league formed for women who aren't ready for the WNBA. It 
would give players more opportunities to develop their skills as 
professionals.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Norway Gets More World Cup Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOVE MESTO NA MORAVE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Bjorn Dahelie and  
Bente Martinsen gave Norway victories in World Cup cross-country 
skiing events today, claiming the men's 15-kilometer and the 
women's 10-kilometer classical races. 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie, owner of a record eight Winter Olympic gold medals and  
five World Cup titles, led comfortably from start to finish, coming 
home in 42 minutes, 27.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Erling Jevne and Espen Bjervig showed Norway's domination in the  
15-kilometer race, finishing second and third respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Fabio May was fourth, followed by Sweden's Per Olofsson.  
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 10-kilometer race, Martinsen crossed the finish  
line in 30 minutes, 57.4 seconds, beating home-crowd favorite 
Katerina Neumannova by 3.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Neumannova had a 20-second lead over Martinsen until the eighth  
kilometer, but the Norwegian classical style specialist managed to 
clinch her third World Cup victory of the season after a stunning 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last meters of the race, I had to overtake a Ukrainian  
skier. That might have been those three seconds,'' Neumannova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Svetlana Nagejkina finished third, edging Stefania  
Belmondo of Italy and another Russian, Nina Gavriljuk.

<HEADLINE> Dan Reeves Calm After Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Less than a month after undergoing heart bypass  
surgery, a somewhat subdued Dan Reeves was back pacing the Atlanta 
sideline for Saturday's NFC playoff game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel a lot better. I feel excited about where we are,''  
Reeves said following the Falcons' 20-18 victory over the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing he couldn't really do was scream at the  
officials, even when he had good cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yell? I can't. My chest is not strong enough, which is good,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for one controversial call that led to San Francisco's  
first touchdown, Reeves remained calm throughout, primarily walking 
along the sideline and often staying some 30-35 yards away from the 
line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	The exception came with 1:57 left in the first half, when San  
Francisco's Steve Young's backward pass was picked up by the 49ers' 
Terry Kirby, whose apparent fumble was returned for a touchdown by 
Atlanta's Chuck Smith. Officials first ruled no TD, but awarded the 
ball to Atlanta on the San Francisco 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves took off his headset and appeared to be upset, but when  
the officials reversed the call and gave the ball to San Francisco, 
Reeves was obviously upset. He spoke loudly to the officials and 
kept pointing to the huge television screen behind the end zone 
showing replays of the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``The officials called it the way they saw it. I saw it  
different. But it was a bam-bam play and it didn't look like he 
(Kirby) ever had possession,'' Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Jerry Markbreit said of the play:  
</P>
<P>
	``The play was a backward pass. It was recovered on the ground  
by San Francisco No. 41, Kirby, and he was touched on the ground 
when he had possession. The rule is down by contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers eventually scored on a 17-yard pass from Young to  
Jerry Rice with 1:10 left in the second quarter, and San Francisco 
added a 36-yard field goal by Wade Richey as time ran out in the 
half, cutting Atlanta's lead to 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons got second-half field goals from Morten Andersen of  
29 and 32 yards. San Francisco's second-half score came on an 
8-yard run by Young and a 2-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' appearance in the thick of things was almost as  
surprising as the Falcons making it to the postseason, winning the 
NFC West (14-2) and playing host to the 49ers (12-4) at the Georgia 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons, 7-9 a year ago, reached the NFC final for the first  
time in the history of the 33-year-old franchise. It was only their 
eighth playoff game and their third postseason victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons will play the winner of Sunday's Minnesota-Arizona  
game next weekend for the right to go to the Super Bowl in Miami on 
Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really and truly beyond my wildest dreams,'' said  
Reeves, who is in his second year with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, 54, wearing his typical game attire -- white tennis  
shoes, black pants and black sweater over his Falcons shirt, was on 
the field an hour before the game, giving interviews. He was right 
in the middle of the team's pregame practice. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jamal Anderson scored Atlanta's first touchdown, a 2-yard  
run in the first quarter, Reeves clapped softly. 
</P>
<P>
	When Anderson broke loose on a 34-yard TD run in the second  
quarter for a 14-0 Falcons lead, Reeves, was about 30 yards away on 
the sideline, again clapping softly, then greeting three Falcons, 
including Anderson, with a brief handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves, who had quadruple bypass surgery on Dec. 14 and was  
hospitalized again for several days with an accelerated heartbeat, 
was given a clean bill of health on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He had some protection during the game. Dr. Charlie Harrison,  
who diagnosed the blockages in Reeves' heart, was always nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was perfectly normal. He was his usual self, just a  
little reserved,'' Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to have him back,'' Falcons center Robbie Tobeck  
said. ``You could see the fire back in his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During kickoffs and punt returns, Reeves stood about 15 yards  
back from the sideline. During certain plays, he was as far away as

<HEADLINE> Popeye Weds Olive -- Sort Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After 70 years, Popeye is finally tying the knot  
with Olive Oyl. Just not real tight. 
</P>
<P>
	``This story is a one-shot fantasy,'' Claudia Smith of King  
Features Syndicate said of ``The Wedding of Popeye &AMP; Olive.'' The 
special-edition comic book is now in production at Ocean Comics, an 
independent company under contract to King. 
</P>
<P>
	In the official comic strip, the spinach-munching sailor remains  
``part of an eternal triangle, forever,'' said Ms. Smith, referring 
to Popeye, Olive and Popeye's longtime nemesis, Bluto. 
</P>
<P>
	The eternal bachelor will keep his catch-phrase ``I yam what I  
yam,'' and he'll keep cackling his longtime line, ``Next time I'm 
in port, we'll get married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popeye first met the stick-thin Olive in 1929, when he  
discovered the stowaway aboard his ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Comics publisher Bob Palin will be shipping thousands of  
the new Popeye comic books to wholesalers next month, to be 
distributed to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	What inspired him to spin new life into an old tale?  
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line is -- the bottom line.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really liked the character. And I thought I could sell some  
copies if we did a wedding,'' said Palin. Plus, ``I think marriage 
is good for him.''

<HEADLINE> Dust Rings Bring Hint of Planets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Powerful new evidence for the presence of  
planets outside the solar system has been found in the first 
pictures ever taken of dust rings around distant stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope clearly show dust  
rings around two stars and astronomers said such rings probably 
formed because the stars have planets. The discovery was announced 
Friday at the national meeting of the American Astronomical 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars, identified as HR 4796A and HD 141569, are both about  
300 light years from Earth. Each is twice the size of the sun, but 
much brighter and much younger, at about 10 million years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding each star like immense hula hoops are disks of dust  
that appear to have been shaped by planets in the same way that the 
moons of Saturn sculpt the rings about that planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring around one of the stars, HD 141569, has a dark gap that  
may have been cut by the gravitational influence of a planet, said 
Alycia Weinberger of the University of California, Los Angeles, a 
member of the astronomy team that made the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most obvious way to form a gap in a disk is with a  
planet,'' Weinberger said at a news conference. ``The disk is under 
the gravitational influence of some other body. This means that we 
have the circumstantial evidence of a planet about this star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of such rings has been suggested in earlier  
studies, but the Hubble images are the first actual pictures, said 
Bradford A. Smith of the University of Hawaii, another team member. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, everything had been inferred,'' said Smith.  
``This is the first time we have actually seen a circumstellar 
disk. It came as a really big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw it, we said, 'Wow, that looks like Saturn,''' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The formation of such rings is part of the process that builds a  
structure like our solar system. The process starts when dust and 
gas come together to begin forming a star. Some of the material 
also clumps together to form planets. 
</P>
<P>
	When the star gets big enough, its nuclear fires are ignited.  
The outflow from the star blows away the remaining dust and gas, 
leaving behind the planets and some orbiting boulders called 
plantisimals. 
</P>
<P>
	The boulders collide and grind each other up, creating the dust.  
If no planets are orbiting the star, the dust will disperse. But 
the presence of planets gives the dust a gravitational kick that 
shapes it into a disk. 
</P>
<P>
	In the solar system, which is about 4 billion years old, only a  
faint dust ring remains. 
</P>
<P>
	Around HD 141569, the disk is 75 billion miles across, ringing  
an area much larger than the entire solar system. The gap in the 
disk is prominent, occupying about 5 percent of the entire ring. 
The ring is about 21 billion miles from the star. 
</P>
<P>
	The ring around HR 4796A is about 1.5 billion miles from its  
star. The ring is about 13 billion miles in diameter and about 1.6 
billion miles thick. 
</P>
<P>
	Images of the rings were captured by a special camera on Hubble  
that allows photos of the area around a star while blocking the 
bright, obscuring light from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the rings are extremely faint: Detecting them is like  
trying to look at a dime from 4 miles away.

<HEADLINE> Two Chicago Cops Shot, One Fatally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A police officer was fatally shot in the head and  
then his partner was wounded Saturday in an exchange of gunfire 
with two men who had crashed their car after trying to flee from 
the officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspected gunman was wounded during the shootout and was in  
custody, said police Sgt. Bill Owens. The second person remained at 
large late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tactical Officer John Knight, 38, and his partner, James Butler,  
35, had slowed their car to investigate a parked auto in which two 
men were slumped, according to police spokeswoman Pat Camden. The 
men sped off and then crashed into another vehicle, Camden said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the officers approached the suspect car following the crash,  
the driver jumped out and began firing, hitting Knight in the head, 
Camden said. Butler was struck in the hip during the exchange of 
shots with the gunman, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The wounded suspect, who was not identified, was hospitalized in  
fair condition with chest injuries. Butler was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, a nine-year veteran, was married and the father of three  
children.

<HEADLINE> Rodman's Agent Talks With Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's agent has already spoken with the  
Chicago Bulls about the seven-time rebounding champion returning, 
but -- like everything else -- it could hinge on Michael Jordan's 
decision to play another year or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Chicago is Dennis' first choice,'' Dwight Manley  
said Saturday, adding that Rodman was ``in his annual retirement 
stage right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For five years in a row he said he's retiring. Then he sees  
everybody else going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agents are allowed to speak with teams as lawyers work on the  
specifics of the lockout agreement. However, teams can't sign or 
talk to players until the opening of training camp Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	```We've talked,'' Manley said of Bulls. ``Bringing everybody  
back is their first choice. We don't know because Michael Jordan 
has such an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who's made plenty of news during the lockout with his  
marriage to actress Carmen Electra, is ``in training camp shape,'' 
Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's in game shape.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who will be 38 in May, has been a crowd favorite in  
Chicago with his tattoos, stunning hairdos and body piercings. He's 
played a key role on the Bulls' last three championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said he has no predictions on what will happen with the  
Bulls or what Jordan will do. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would be reading somebody's mind. I don't know what to  
say,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's agent David Falk told the Chicago Sun-Times that  
Jordan's announcement could come as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still out of the country with his family enjoying some  
vacation,'' Falk said in Saturday's paper. ``I expect Michael will 
come back home early next week and then we'll sit down and talk 
some more and move from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll make an announcement as soon as he's comfortable. ...  
And we have no real timetable on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk said he still doesn't know what Jordan will do.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear his views and sort of bounce some ideas around  
and play a little devil's advocate on some things,'' Falk said. 
``At this point, Michael's 35 years old and he's a very 
sophisticated businessman.''

	Iraq Gov't Questions Kuwait Border  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi legislators urged the government  
today to rescind its recognition of neighboring Kuwait. Legislator 
Usama Mahmoud said that Iraq's border with Kuwait was illegal. 
``Why do we recognize the borders? Why do we recognize Kuwait 
itself?'' Lawmakers also called on Saddam to defy the no-fly zones 
in northern and southern Iraq and to sever ties with the United 
Nations. ``The no-fly zones are a crime,'' said lawmaker Naiba 
Toshi. ``We have the right to fire at any aircraft violating our 
airspace.'' Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sparked the 1991 Persian Gulf 
War.

	Fighting Escalates in Kosovo

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- New fighting erupted in Kosovo today  
as negotiators worked past an afternoon deadline to gain the 
release of eight Yugoslav soldiers held by ethnic Albanian 
guerrillas. Clashes between Yugoslav army forces and the rebel 
Kosovo Liberation Army were reported by both Serb and Albanian 
sources. The soldiers were captured yesterday after they took a 
wrong turn into rebel territory. The violence has increased fears 
that the three-month cease-fire between Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke may be on the verge of 
falling apart.

arrest and drove his car directly at French soldiers in the 
NATO-led Bosnian peace force in the eastern town of Foca, a NATO 
spokeswoman said. After the shooting, unrest rocked Foca and two 
U.N. police vehicles were demolished, residents said. Two U.N.

	Amnesty Denied for S. Africa Cop  
</P>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A South African policeman has  
been denied amnesty in the beating death of black liberation leader 
Steve Biko, a lawyer and an official said today. Former Detective 
Sgt. Gideon Nieuwoudt and four other officers testified last year 
that Biko tried to attack one of his interrogators while in 
custody. The officers said they accidentally slammed Biko's head 
against a wall. He was then taken to prison, where he died of brain 
injuries on Sept. 12, 1977. For many supporters, Biko's death made 
him a martyr in the struggle against apartheid, sparking an outcry 
at home and abroad and spurring activism that contributed to the 
end of white-minority rule.

accused terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, a newspaper reported 
today. Gazeta Shqiptare said the man was arrested last night in 
Tirana on suspicion of shadowing U.S. diplomats in the Albanian

Tanzania, which killed more than 100 people.

Islamic group that kidnapped 16 Westerners on Dec. 28, four of whom 
died in a rescue attempt by the Yemeni army a day later. The 
official Yemen News Agency said the men were being questioned and 
that they ``and the others from the terrorist gang ... that 
kidnapped and killed the Western tourists will be tried soon.'' The 
men are believed to be of Pakistani, Algerian and Yemeni origin.

<HEADLINE> Rios Concerned by Hamstring Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Second-ranked Marcelo Rios admits  
he is concerned about a lingering hamstring injury as he puts the 
final touches on his Australian Open preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios defends his Auckland Open title beginning Monday before  
heading to Melbourne, where he will likely be the top seed 
following the withdrawal of Pete Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios lost the Australian Open title match last year by Petr  
Korda, but admits his right hamstring, injured in training 10 days 
ago, might hold the key to his hopes for a first Grand Slam 
tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty bad last week,'' Rios said Sunday. ``I was  
trying to practice as well as take some days off, but it is much 
better now. I'm having it treated twice a day until I play on 
Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, who won seven tournaments in 1998, starting with the  
Auckland title, said he didn't care about his Australian Open 
seeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there is much difference between being No. 1 or  
No. 2 at the Australian Open because all the players there are 
pretty good,'' Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios takes on Romanian Andre Pavel in his first-round match on  
Tuesday at the Auckland Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a strong player, he will be tough and he has been playing  
well,'' Rios said.

<HEADLINE> Questions Remain for Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- From the governor on down, officials hope  
the departure of two top Salt Lake Olympics executives amid a 
growing bribery scandal will help refocus attention on preparing 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest scandal in Olympic history that prompted  
Friday's resignations by Salt Lake Organizing Committee president 
Frank Joklik and vice president David Johnson has raised a 
worrisome set of questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Who will replace Joklik and Johnson? How should future Olympics  
be awarded? How will the scandal affect sponsorship of the 2002 
Olympics? Who will foot the bill if sponsor money dries up? 
</P>
<P>
	State officials and Olympic organizers agree that the sooner  
those questions are answered, the better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call upon the Olympic family to form an agenda of reform and  
carry it out with deliberation and speed,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt said. 
``This corner of Olympic corruption did not begin in Salt Lake 
City. But let it end here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his resignation, Joklik described a number of  
misdeeds, including cash payments to IOC members; payments for 
housing, travel, and education expenses for IOC member relatives; 
expensive gifts and free health care to IOC members and their 
families; and assistance in making a Utah land deal that left an 
influential IOC member from Africa with a $60,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Leavitt's spokeswoman, Vicki Varela, acknowledged  
the SLOC ethics panel is looking into possible use of bid committee 
credit cards to pay for female escorts for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik, 70, said he knew nothing of gifts and payments to IOC  
members while he was volunteer chairman of the bid panel, but was 
stepping down from the SLOC post because ``changes must be made for 
the games to proceed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The retired copper-company executive will stay on the job until  
a replacement is found. Johnson's resignation from the No. 2 job 
came at Joklik's request and was effective immediately. As a bid 
committee official, Johnson was the point man in wooing the votes 
of IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, senior vice president of marketing and legal  
affairs Kelly Flint and licensing director Rod Hamson were placed 
on paid leave pending the outcome of four separate investigations 
into the scandal. And the organizing committee will stop paying a 
$10,000-a-month consulting fee to Tom Welch, who resigned as SLOC 
president in 1997 in the wake of spouse-abuse allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC said it planned an international search for a new leader.  
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt, Utah House Speaker Marty Stephens, SLOC board members  
Ken Bullock and Nolan Karras, as well as the U.S. Olympic Committee 
want to keep the job in the hands of a Utah resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank Joklik's successor should come from the state of Utah,''  
USOC President Bill Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, several names have come up, including Roger Jackson,  
who helped run the successful 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, 
Alberta; Leavitt's former chief of staff Charlie Johnson; Jon 
Huntsman Jr., a former U.S. ambassador and son of Utah 
industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr.; and Dave Checketts, the former Utah 
Jazz executive who runs Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area organizers likely will have to address scandal is  
funding. USOC executive director Dick Schultz said he did not 
expect the 2002 Games to lose sponsors, but the scandal would make 
it hard for organizers to recruit additional sponsors it needs to 
adequately fund the games. That could lead to budget cuts, Schultz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic sponsor U S West already has delayed sending a $5  
million payment to SLOC. Company spokesman Michael Frandsen said 
the phone company is worried about the diminishing value of its $50 
million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt also acknowledged Friday that the 17-page contract  
signed between state and Salt Lake City officials in 1991 to 
protect the city from Olympic debt violates Utah's Constitution, 
which prohibits the state from guaranteeing any public or private 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt has promised the city will not be left with debt, but  
city council members are asking Leavitt and legislative leaders to 
explain how the contract avoids constitutional questions. If that 
doesn't work, they may ask the Utah Supreme Court to clear up the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Salt Lake City has financial responsibility for a disaster,  
I would like to know that in 1999, not in 2002,'' City Council 
Chairman Keith Christensen told The Salt Lake Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how the scandal will affect Olympic operations also will  
have to be sorted out. IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said he 
was confident Salt Lake will be able to stage a successful games. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bullock called on Samaranch to resign because apparent  
bribery occurred ``on his watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound, who is heading the IOC  
investigation of the Salt Lake scandal, said he expects some 
members to resign when all the facts are known. The IOC also plans 
to reform how it selects host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that 12 of the 115 IOC  
members likely will be implicated in wrongdoing. Sergio Santander, 
an IOC member and president of the Chilean Olympic Committee, is 
among those suspected of violating rules on gifts from bid cities, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he expected to have his investigation finished in  
time to report to the IOC executive board Jan. 24. The SLOC ethics 
board, the USOC and the Justice Deaprtment also are investigating 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune on Saturday quoted Johnson as saying the  
gifts given by Olympic organizers were not bribes because no votes 
were guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time was there a quid pro quo,'' he said. ``So it was  
not a bribe. It was a secret ballot. Even if an IOC member said he 
was going to vote for you, you never knew if he would. Salt Lake 
City won on its merits.''

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Offered Help to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advising Chinese leaders that the Soviets were  
determined to amass enough nuclear weapons to destroy their 
country, Henry Kissinger secretly offered China U.S. satellite 
information and a hot line long before the communist government 
gained American diplomatic recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be prepared, at your request, through whatever  
sources you wish, to give you whatever information we have about 
the disposition of Soviet forces,'' Kissinger told Huang Hua, the 
Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The specific reference was to Soviet forces deployed during the  
war that year between India and Pakistan. But Kissinger offered a 
web of intelligence sharing in meetings with Chinese leaders 
including Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier Chou En-lai in November 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no secrets with (you about) the Soviet Union,''  
Kissinger told Mao. ``There is nothing we are doing with the Soviet 
Union that you do not know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to transcripts of top-secret talks Kissinger held as  
U.S. national security adviser and as secretary of state during the 
Nixon and Ford administrations in the 1970s, he played China 
against Russia with inventive triangular diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The transcripts of secret conversations that may have changed  
history are being published by the National Security Archive of 
George Washington University, for release Sunday. They were 
obtained through freedom-of-information requests and other means, 
the private group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger's office said he was traveling and not available for  
comment on the disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Interspersed in the documents are flashes of Kissinger's  
celebrated wit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chou told him, for instance, that China was giving only limited  
support to revolutions in Latin America, and ``We are still 
learning.'' Kissinger quipped: ``I hope you don't learn too fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tough remarks also are attributed to him.  
</P>
<P>
	He told British Foreign Secretary James Callaghan in 1974: ``As  
everyone knows, the Soviet leaders belong to the most unpleasant 
group one can deal with. Their capacity to lie on matters of common 
knowledge is stupendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A document from 1976 quotes Kissinger as saying to President  
Ford about the Chinese leadership: ``They are cold, pragmatic 
bastards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1970s, President Nixon was pursuing a policy of  
detente with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. The aim was to lessen 
tensions in various areas of the world, while competing actively in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Nixon was preparing for U.S. diplomatic  
recognition of China, which eventually happened under President 
Carter in 1979. A secret Kissinger trip to Beijing in 1971, then 
Nixon's highly publicized visit in 1972 set the course for the 
historic change. 
</P>
<P>
	Briefing Chou on the Soviets on Nov. 10, 1973, in the Great Hall  
of the People, Kissinger said it was in the interests of the United 
States to prevent a Soviet nuclear attack on China. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to accept the desirability of destroying China's  
nuclear capability,'' Kissinger said, according to a transcript of 
the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he offered China secret military cooperation with the  
United States, including ``ideas on how to lessen the vulnerability 
of your forces and how to increase the warning time'' before a 
Soviet attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later, Kissinger told the premier, according to a  
transcript: 
</P>
<P>
	``Any help we would give you in our mutual interest should be in  
a form that is not easily recognizable. With respect to missile 
launches, we have a very good system of satellites, which give us 
early warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is to get that to you rapidly. We would be  
prepared to establish a hot line between our satellites and Beijing 
by which we could transmit information to you in a matter of 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chou asked: ``Through the satellites?''  
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger explained the information would go to Washington and  
then to Beijing in ways that ``would not attract attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Chou was interested in the proposal and met with Kissinger  
several times to discuss a hot line to provide China with strategic 
U.S. intelligence information, the Chinese did not respond to the 
offer, wrote William Burr in a commentary on the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	And it was not until 1998 that China signed a hot line agreement  
with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Trade Potvin to Isles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Goaltender Felix Potvin, who had left the Toronto  
Maple Leafs Dec. 2 awaiting a trade, finally got his wish Saturday 
when he was dealt to the New York Islanders for defenseman Bryan 
Berard. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams also swapped sixth-round picks in the 1999 NHL Entry  
Draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin, who had been at home in Montreal waiting for a deal,  
immediately joined the Islanders and was a backup to Marcel 
Cousineau in Montreal on Saturday. The Canadiens won 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real happy, it's a relief to finally be able to wear  
another uniform and I'm really looking forward to playing,'' Potvin 
told TSN. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly real happy to go there,'' he said. ``It's been  
very hard for six months but you know, today is like a second start 
to my career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin was Toronto's No. 1 goalie for five seasons, twice  
helping the Maple Leafs to the Western Conference finals, but was 
bumped to a backup role when Curtis Joseph signed a four-year, 
$24-million contract in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin started only five of the Maple Leafs' first 25 games this  
season, posting a 3-2 record with a goals-against average of 3.81. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toronto is a great city and I enjoyed six years of my career  
and I have great memories,'' Potvin said. ``It's too bad that this 
year gave me a sour taste in my mouth but I'd rather remember the 
first six years and all the fun I had there and all the great 
teammates I had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berard, who won the Calder Trophy as the league's top rookie in  
1996-97, has four goals and 11 assists in 31 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His skill on the blue line should help Toronto's power play.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited to go to a team like Toronto with a great  
tradition and they are playing great,'' Berard said in Montreal. 
``I'm really looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offensively gifted defenseman's style of play didn't mix  
well with the defense-oriented Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good young player and there were certain things that  
we saw and certain flaws that we tried to address and correct,'' 
Islanders general manager Mike Milbury said. ``Some we had success 
with and others we didn't. Perhaps Toronto will have more success 
with Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did come a long way defensively maybe at the expense of his  
offense. Maybe they'll find the right blend in Toronto,'' Milbury 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard was taken first overall in the 1995 draft by Ottawa but  
never signed with the Senators. In January 1996, the Islanders 
acquired him in a three-team deal involving Ottawa and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Berard, who has been sidelined recently with a groin injury, was  
to fly into Toronto on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping it's only four or five more days,'' Berard said.  
``I'm scheduled to play Wednesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Potvin, the Islanders hope they have solved their goaltending  
woes. Salo has been inconsistent and the Islanders will look for 
Potvin to provide stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to have Felix jumpstart our team to a  
winning record like we had in the beginning of the season,'' 
Islanders assistant coach Wayne Fleming said.

<HEADLINE> Winners and Losers in NBA Lockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Stern's NBA had always enjoyed a  
reputation as a charmed league, never losing a game to a labor 
dispute in its 52-year history and earning billions from TV and 
sponsorship deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the league and Stern face the difficult task of rebuilding  
that image after a bitter six-month lockout cost them almost half 
the season and the good will of many fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern was a lightning rod for criticism during the lockout and  
his public image was sullied, but he should emerge as a winner in 
the years ahead. The new labor agreement gives him much greater 
control over financial matters and player discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout affected the reputations, futures and wallets of  
many others. Among the winners and losers: 
</P>
<P>
 *WINNERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	The owners: They put their collective trust in David Stern's  
hands and allowed the commissioner to strike a deal that will save 
them from themselves. Under the old labor agreement, Glen Taylor of 
Minnesota could set the market price by giving Kevin Garnett $126 
million. George Shinn of Charlotte did it a few years earlier by 
paying Larry Johnson $72 million. Now, however, there's a 
negotiated limit -- the maximum salaries agreed to by the union that 
are based upon years of service. Stern also held out against the 
union's luxury tax, thereby keeping multimillionaires like Paul 
Allen of Portland from being able to buy a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Granik: He was the ``designated bad guy,'' Stern said, and  
also could have been the fall guy if the owners actually had 
canceled the season. Instead, Granik passed his final test and 
showed himself worthy of succeeding Stern as commissioner someday 
in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
	The locked-up members of the Draft Class of '95: Garnett ($126  
million for six years), Rasheed Wallace ($80 million for six 
years), Bryant Reeves ($66 million for six years) and Michael 
Finley ($48 million for five years) chose long-term security over 
quick free agency. Not one of them had to sweat during the lockout 
or have his market value artificially limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Thorn: The owners gave Thorn, the league's discipline czar,  
a much larger hammer. They increased penalties for everything from 
on-court behavior to missing practices to skipping media sessions 
to missing the rookie orientation program. Washington Wizards owner 
Abe Pollin said gaining more control over such matters was as 
important to him as gaining cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Hunter: The union director gave up a lot. But he also  
achieved his goals of preventing a hard salary cap, maintaining a 
strong Larry Bird exception and taking care of the middle-class and 
minimum salaried players. 
</P>
<P>
 *LOSERS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing: He took a public relations beating by repeatedly  
putting his size 16s in his mouth, being seen as a hindrance to a 
deal and David Falk's puppet. Some of the criticism was unfair, and 
Ewing was a galvanizing force among the players. Unfortunately, the 
public never got to see that side. 
</P>
<P>
	Class of '96 draft picks: No one will lose more money than the  
likes of Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray 
Allen and Antoine Walker. They can still get extensions worth $73 
million, but all five would have been looking at contracts that 
would have approached or surpassed Garnett's. Abdur-Rahim's deal 
with Vancouver, according to one agent, would have approached $200 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Class of '95 draft picks: Antonio McDyess and Damon Stoudamire  
also will end up with less money than they could have gotten under 
the old system, and in McDyess' case the loss is about $50 million 
over six years. The biggest loser of all from this class is Joe 
Smith, who reportedly turned down $80 million from Golden State 
before the Warriors traded him. He'll be lucky to get a third of 
that now. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloon payees: A handful of players were due to get balloon  
payments this season. Charles Oakley was rewarded for all his hard 
work for the Knicks with a $10 balloon payment, of which he'll lose 
more than $3.9 million. Terrell Brandon was due $7 million, of 
which he'll lose $2.73 million. Will Purdue loses $1.7 of his $4.4 
million and Muggsy Bogues loses $1.1 million of his $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Washouts: Lionel Simmons, the former La Salle star who was a  
bust with the Sacramento Kings, was due $4.2 million. He'll lose 
$1.6 million. Bobby Hurley, who was to get $4.03 million from 
Vancouver, also will lose $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Olowokandi and the Los Angeles Clippers: The No. 1 draft  
pick made a last-minute decision to sign in Europe, and he can't 
join the Clippers until Feb. 15 at the earliest. He'll miss his 
first training camp and the first two weeks of the season, then 
have to play catchup the rest of the season. The Clippers, 
meanwhile, won't have a legitimate starting center until Olowokandi 
arrives because they'll probably lose Ike Austin to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents: The big shots like Falk and Arn Tellem signed most of  
their clients to megabuck contracts under the old system, so they 
won't be hurt quite as badly as some have suggested. Other 
up-and-coming agents will be affected by the limitations on 
high-end salaries, and some of the best players won't need to pay 
an agent 4 percent if they can get a lawyer to negotiate their 
contracts for an hourly rate.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Defense Shuts Down Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos defense, the scapegoat for the  
team's two late-season losses, set the tone for a rout in the first 
minute of Saturday's AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We blitzed them the first three plays of the game,''  
linebacker Bill Romanowski said after Denver's 38-3 romp of the 
Miami Dolphins. ``We were like, `You're not going to do to us what 
you did the last time on Monday night. We're going to be 
aggressive, we're going to go after you, and we're going to make 
you earn everything you get.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami quarterback Dan Marino shredded Denver in a 31-21 regular  
season victory 19 days ago, throwing for 355 yards and four 
touchdowns. Lamar Thomas had three TD catches as the Miami 
receivers had their way with Denver's secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not going to let it happen again,'' cornerback Ray  
Crockett said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Dolphins' opening series on Saturday, O.J. McDuffie  
dropped a short pass on first down, Bernie Parmalee ran for 3 yards 
and Stanley Pritchett dropped another pass, forcing a punt with 
only 1:09 expired. The Broncos responded with the first of their 
three straight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him (McDuffie) he was scared,'' Romanowski said. ``I  
told him if he caught that ball, he was going to get hit and he was 
going to get hit hard. It seemed like, overall, it worked a little 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romanowski had six tackles and an interception. He also was  
responsible for dumping Marino hard just after the Miami 
quarterback released a pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker Glenn Cadrez said the strategy was to ``make sure  
they heard the sounds of our pads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos held the Dolphins to 252 total yards and a  
second-quarter field goal. Marino completed 26 of 37 passes for 243 
yards, but most were in the 5- to 10-yard range. The Dolphins had 
only 14 yards rushing on 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had seen a more dominant defensive effort in a game  
of this magnitude, Crockett said, ``No, not at all. I've never seen 
a defensive unit come out and dominate the way we did today, 
especially against a team and a quarterback like Marino is. And we 
didn't let up, not in the third quarter or the fourth quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said his defense ``did a great job  
of keeping Marino off balance. Any time you can do that to a 
quarterback of his caliber, you know that you've played a complete 
football game on defense. To hold Miami and Dan to three points is 
really a credit to our defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Backup cornerback Darrius Johnson, who led the Broncos in  
tackles with nine, said the victory was sweet redemption for a 
defense -- and secondary -- that was the target of scorn in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a lot of talk about our secondary being real  
soft,'' Johnson said. ``I guess when you lose a couple of games, 
you always have to have somebody to point your finger at. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew it was either have a bad game and go home, or put it  
all on the line. And we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Crockett, ``We took a lot of heat in the past four or five  
weeks. A lot of it stemmed from that last Miami game. We had been 
counted out by everybody, by the media, by the NFL, by ESPN. We 
kept reiterating all week that if we wanted to go to the 
championship game, to the Super Bowl, the defense had to step up. 
This was our time to shine.''

<HEADLINE> Andrew Cuomo Won't Run for Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- U.S. Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo has  
decided against running for the Democratic nomination for the 
Senate seat being given up next year by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Friday by the eldest son of former New York  
Gov. Mario Cuomo is certain to increase interest in whether Hillary 
Clinton might run for the New York Senate seat. She has not ruled 
out such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo plans to remain at the federal Department of Housing and  
Urban Development where he is expected to help Vice President Al 
Gore mount his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo, 41, said that as much as he would like to occupy the  
Senate seat once held by ``one of my heroes'' -- his wife's father, 
Robert F. Kennedy -- ``I believe I should complete my current job 
before seeking a new one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former state Democratic Party Chairman John Marino said Cuomo's  
decision was not related to the first lady's possible interest in 
the Senate seat. Marino said Cuomo had not been pressured by 
Clinton forces to stay out of the race to clear the way for Mrs. 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, New York Magazine, in an article prepared for  
publication Monday, reported that President Clinton did urge Cuomo 
in a recent conversation to remain at HUD and help Gore's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cuomo said he was disappointed by his son's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``He'd make a great candidate, a great candidate,'' the elder  
Cuomo said. ``Listen, his education is the best you could have, 
watching me make mistakes for 12 years. If he is not the 
best-prepared candidate in America, I don't know who is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is considering  
seeking the GOP nomination for Moynihan's seat.

<HEADLINE> Women's Giant Slalom Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERCHTESGADEN, Germany (AP) -- The women's giant slalom World Cup  
event was canceled today after heavy snow fell on the new 
Berchtesgaden slope overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers said the race would not be held at  
Berchtesgaden, but they would make a decision Monday if the event 
will be moved somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said pushing the event back would conflict with the  
FIS Snowboarding World Championships that start Monday and run 
until Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh snow, which fell steadily after Friday's night slalom,  
will have to be pushed away from the prepared snow on the slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabine Egger won Friday's slalom, the first World Cup race held  
at Berchtesgaden in 12 years, as an Austrian woman won the 
discipline for the first time since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Pernilla Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion, continued  
her dramatic comeback from two years of injuries, finishing third 
in 1:46.93. Wiberg retained her lead in the slalom standings with 
365 points to Egger's 351. 
</P>
<P>
	The Berchtesgaden course had been rebuilt in recent years at a  
cost of $3.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Cape Canaveral Wins at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Cape Canaveral, a 3-year-old colt trained  
by D. Wayne Lukas who won his racing debut two weeks ago, passed 
his first test in a stakes race Saturday when he won the $102,508 
San Miguel Stakes by one length over Aristotle at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores and carrying high weight of 118 pounds,  
Cape Canaveral covered six furlongs in 1:09 and paid $2.40 and 
$2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Aristotle returned $2.10, while Actin Time was another 7 1/2  
lengths back in third. There was no show wagering because of the 
four-horse field. Danzig Commander was last. 
</P>
<P>
	Cape Canaveral won his debut Dec. 26, going 1:15 3-5 over 6 1/2  
furlongs. Saturday's victory, worth $62,760, increased his career 
earnings to $89,760 for the Kentucky-bred son of Mr. Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one concern I had going into the race was coming back in  
two weeks,'' Lukas said. ``Everybody always speculates on a Mr. 
Prospector, and if they run 1:09, they think they're a sprinter. I 
always say people have opinions, horses have facts. He's got a 
great efficiency of motion, and he's got a good mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flores won three races on the program, including the eighth with  
Excite, who paid $96 to win. 
</P>
<P>
	In a co-feature for 3-year-old fillies, Hollywood Picture beat  
Exbourne Free by two lengths in the $108,100 Santa Ysabel Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by 42-year-old Octavio Vergara, Hollywood Picture, a  
daughter of Holy Bull, covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:43 2-5. The winner 
paid $13.60, $6 and $4.60. Exbourne Free returned $7.20 and $5.60, 
while Gleefully was another 3 1/2 lengths back in third and paid $5.20 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood Picture earned $64,860 for her third victory in eight  
starts, increasing her career winnings to $134,194.

<HEADLINE> Kings Fete Robitaille for 500th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Two nights after becoming the 27th  
player and sixth left wing to score 500 NHL goals, Luc Robitaille 
was honored in style by the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The brief ceremony was held between the first two periods of  
Saturday night's game with the Edmonton Oilers. The Kings, who have 
been the beneficiary of 430 of Robitaille's goals during his two 
stints with the franchise, flew his parents, Claude and Madeleine, 
from Montreal to Los Angeles for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Another VIP who was furnished with a plane ticket by the Kings  
was Hall of Famer Marcel Dionne, who made the presentation of a 
Tiffany crystal star trophy on behalf of the NHL. Dionne, the 
league's third all-time leading goal scorer, roomed with Robitaille 
during the latter's rookie season of 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14,936 fans, given commemorative posters as they entered the  
Forum, cheered when a one-minute video tribute showed the milestone 
goal Robitaille scored against Buffalo goaltender Dwayne Roloson in 
Thursday night's 4-2 victory over the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been nervous the whole period beause I knew I had to  
speak,'' said Robitaille, who was flanked by his wife and two sons 
as the Kings presented him with a new sport utility vehicle. ``I 
want to thank my parents, who had to wake up at 6:30 to take me to 
practices. The greatest thing to happen to me was coming back to 
the Kings organization. Let's go all the way and bring a 
championship to this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Master of Ceremonies Bob Miller, the Kings' longtime television  
play-by-play announcer, read congratulatory letters from two other 
members of the 500-goal club -- Hall of Famers Maurice Richard and 
Mario Lemieux.

<HEADLINE> Report: Tripp Seeks Legal Fee Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp is passing the hat to raise  
money for her legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, whose recordings of conversations with White House  
intern Monica Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, is 
sending about 20,000 fund-raising letters ``urgently'' asking for 
contributions to her defense fund, The Washington Post reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her legal bills are already more than $325,000 and ``growing  
every day,'' Mrs. Tripp said in the 12-page letter. 
</P>
<P>
	She describes herself as ``David up against Goliath'' in fending  
off the attacks of Clinton's ``disciples'' and ``henchmen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, who lives in Columbia, is being investigated by a  
Maryland grand jury for taping her phone conversations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. Maryland law forbids taping another person without their 
knowledge and consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp earns $90,767 a year in her Pentagon public affairs  
job, according to The Post.

<HEADLINE> Who Gets Blame in Olympic Bribery? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Let the finger pointing begin.  
</P>
<P>
	As top executives resigned from Salt Lake's Olympic organizing  
committee amid investigations into how far city boosters stooped to 
win the 2002 Winter Games, blame for the misdeeds was being fixed 
on two men: Tom Welch and David Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	But where was the board they reported to?  
</P>
<P>
	That's the question on the minds of many in this city reeling  
from the stain of scandal and braced for what yet could be revealed 
by four separate sets of investigators working from Salt Lake, 
Colorado Springs, Washington and Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the senior vice president for the committee organizing  
the games and the point man in wooing International Olympic 
Committee members during the bid, was forced to resign on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch, who resigned in 1997 after spousal abuse charges, has  
been stripped of his $10,000-a-month consulting contract and 
$500,000 pension. He was at the helm of Salt Lake's quest for the 
games for a decade, including the years leading up to the winning 
IOC vote in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	His successor as chief executive of the organizing committee,  
Frank Joklik, resigned Friday, revealing that investigators had 
found boosters gave IOC members cash payments ranging from $5,000 
to more than $70,000 and expensive gifts; paid educational, travel, 
housing and medical costs of IOC members and their families; and 
lent help to an IOC member in making a profitable land investment. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility that prostitutes were hired for IOC members also  
is under investigation, Gov. Mike Leavitt said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joklik said he was dismayed by the revelations and knew nothing  
of the corruption, and his departure was cast by the governor as a 
self-sacrifice so the games can have a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet where was Joklik -- the volunteer chairman of the bid  
committee while he was the chief executive of Kennecott Copper Co. 
-- and Utah's other business leaders who served on the bid committee 
board? 
</P>
<P>
	In the dark, claims the governor.  
</P>
<P>
	``No one on this board knew what was going on,'' Leavitt said  
Friday. They were victims of a ``systematic cover-up'' orchestrated 
by a small group handling the cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were deceived. We were lied to,'' said banker Spencer  
Eccles, the chairman of First Security Corp., who raised millions 
for the bid and is a key member of SLOC's executive committee. 
``I'm sick at heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verl Topham, senior vice president of PacifiCorp and a longtime  
board member for both the bid and organizing efforts, said he is 
``personally devastated'' by the revelations. ``We had taken strong 
positions as a board that we would not engage in activities of this 
nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board members knew all about the wining and dining of visiting  
IOC members and the gifts of cowboy hats and quilts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understood that. We were part of that,'' said Topham. ``But  
that's a far thing from direct cash payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan Karras, who is the governor's stand-in on the organizing  
committee and was involved in the bid before 1991, says the board 
could be blamed if it had not set up systems and policies to 
prevent such payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The board required checks of any significant amount to have two  
signatures, and had outside auditors scrutinize both the soundness 
of the safeguards and the propriety of the spending, said Karras, a 
CPA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the auditors don't tell you and the audit committee doesn't  
tell you and the management doesn't tell you, how would you know?'' 
he asks. ``I'm quite confident the auditors need to be asked where 
in hell they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime critic of the Salt Lake Olympics, Stephen C. Pace,  
doesn't buy that bid board members were victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board has acted like a room full of cockroaches when you  
snap on the light. They have just run for cover,'' Pace said. ``The 
board's only defense to being charged with being corrupt is, `No, 
we're not corrupt, we're incompetent.' Given that that's their best 
answer, I think they've all gotta go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That does not appear likely.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Garff, chairman of the organizing committee, said the  
future of some board members ``will be part of the discussion'' 
once SLOC's outside ethics panel finishes its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics panel, led by a former Utah Supreme Court Justice and  
including a former U.S. attorney, is scrambling to finish its 
report by Thursday's organizing committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Garff, a car dealer and former Utah House speaker, stressed it  
is now the IOC's turn to take its medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC expects to wrap up its own bribery probe by Jan. 23. The  
U.S. Olympic Committee's investigative report is due by Feb. 28. 
The Justice Department has not said how long it might take to 
determine if criminal charges are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake and USOC organizers want to finish their  
investigations quickly so they can assure skittish sponsors they've 
dealt with the corruption. The Salt Lake organizers need to raise 
$250 million more from sponsors to meet the $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Karras said he's confident Salt Lake organizers, guided by a  
resilient, can-do Mormon ethic, can redeem themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no better place to be able to say, `We're willing to  
own up.' We understand the principle of repentance,'' Karras said. 
``We're going to have to be really, really careful we don't have 
one more misstep. If we don't have one more lapse of ethics, I 
still think we can pull this off.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While the world awaits word from Michael Jordan as to whether  
he'll retire or return, one other obstacle to a reunion of the 
Chicago Bulls suddenly seems surmountable. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottie Pippen, whose relationship with the Bulls' front office  
was so bad that many expected him to leave as a free agent, is 
willing to re-sign with the defending world champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scottie Pippen will be theirs to lose at this point,'' said  
his agent, Jimmy Sexton. ``Scottie loves Chicago, loves the team, 
and so if we can work a deal out that works for Scottie, I think he 
would like to stay there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Pippen is still considered one of the top free agents  
available, some teams might shy away from him because of the back 
surgery he had this summer. But Pippen's back is fine, Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last six weeks, he's been playing in Chicago, playing  
full-court, full-speed and has been cleared by the doctors to 
play,'' Sexton said. ``So he's ready to play a game tonight if he 
has to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, meanwhile, remained out of the country.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Michael makes a decision he's comfortable with,'' agent  
David Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the gag order lifted and the start of training camps more  
than a week away, the previously muzzled masses -- also known as 
coaches and general managers -- started talking Friday about the 
upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	There were rumors floating around, jokes being told about the  
most out-of-shape players and ruminations on what it's like to sit 
around for six months with basically nothing to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy recalled his toughest decision each  
day: 
</P>
<P>
	``Chocolate chip or vanilla wafers,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The decisions will be more important in the coming days as teams  
begin setting their game plans for going into an abbreviated 
50-game season that could start Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The lockout will not officially end until the agreement reached  
Wednesday is put into writing, and training camps are not expected 
to open until Jan. 18. All trades and free agent signings are on 
hold until then, too. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the league agreed Friday to permit teams to negotiate  
with player agents immediately, the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	While the decision allows nearly 200 players to negotiate  
through their agents, no new contracts can be signed until the new 
agreement is in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, the league sent memorandums to the  
29 teams about 5 p.m. Friday advising them that negotiations could 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the league and the union worked at putting their  
interpretations of Wednesday's agreement into writing, and the 
sides planned to exchange those documents today. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll have the weekend to compare notes, and a conference  
among all parties -- lawyers for the league, the union, and from 
both of their outside firms -- is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today is Day 1 of them being holed up around the clock, trying  
to get to hammer this out,'' NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all league employees were forbidden from speaking about  
their players or the details of the work stoppage during the 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been awful. It's been the worst time of my life,''  
Indiana Pacers president Donnie Walsh said. ``I was all right until 
the games started getting missed, and then I was coming in and I 
was worried, because usually at that time of the year I am worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I realized I didn't have anything to worry about because  
I didn't have any games. That was a very confusing time in my life. 
I had holidays that were supposed to be joyous, and I wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh has the advantage of bringing almost his entire team back,  
meaning he won't have to scramble to fill a roster the way some 
teams will. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls, Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets have only four  
players apiece under contract, while the Phoenix Suns have five. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're behind the eight-ball in about every way we can be,''  
Hawks president Stan Kasten said. ``Let's face it, the rest of the 
year is going to be rough.''	   Another concern is conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing, who as union president spent the summer, fall and  
early part of winter locked inside office buildings because of the 
lockout, is at least 20 pounds overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Kemp of the Cleveland Cavaliers was the butt of endless  
jokes in Atlantic City last month when he showed up for an 
exhibition game carrying at least 20 extra pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	One coach who is not worried is Miami's Pat Riley.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard from people in Miami that our guys are working  
out. Our guys are in a culture of conditioning,'' he said. ``If our 
guys walk through that door today without me, they could probably 
run through 70 to 80 percent of our stuff.''

<HEADLINE> Wellstone Won't Run for White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Sen. Paul Wellstone announced Saturday he  
will not run for president in 2000, removing a liberal threat to 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said: `Look, if I can do this presidential race  
and I can also do a good job for people of Minnesota, I'm going to 
do it both,''' the Minnesota Democrat said at a news conference at 
the state Capitol. ``I will admit to you, I don't think I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone said he decided in the last couple of weeks that he  
couldn't take the rigors of a presidential campaign because of 
chronic back pain from a ruptured disk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly always been manageable for Minnesota work. But  
traveling all over the country, constantly in planes and constantly 
in cars and going seven days a week, I don't think I can do that 
and represent Minnesota well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a month ago Wellstone hinted strongly that, after more than  
a year of positioning himself for a White House bid, he was ready 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone also said he would not back off of an early pledge not  
to run for a third Senate term. He was first elected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the most outspoken liberals in Congress and a critic  
of the Clinton administration's centrist philosophy, he had been 
positioning himself as an alternative to Gore, the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey have formed  
exploratory campaign committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., announced last month he would not run,  
and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has not decided 
whether he will seek the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone's advisers dismissed any suggestion that Gore's  
fund-raising and organizational strength intimidated the 
Minnesotan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone's decision ``will take the wind out of the left wing  
of the Democratic Party because Paul was very much their standard 
bearer,'' said Steven Schier, head of the political science 
department at Carleton College in Northfield, where Wellstone 
taught before his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone started laying the groundwork for a presidential  
campaign soon after he won election to a second Senate term in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1997 his national profile began to grow when he  
undertook a six-state ``poverty tour'' that retraced the steps of 
Robert F. Kennedy when he was a presidential contender 30 years 
ago. He also made stops in the early presidential battleground 
states of New Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, he offered bills for a public jobs program and an  
expansion of federal child-care assistance that stood little chance 
of passing in the Republican Congress. But the bills served as an 
appealing campaign platform to fellow liberals.

<HEADLINE> Couch, Claiborne Look to the NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Couch of Kentucky, Chris Claiborne of USC  
and Kris Farris of UCLA were among at least 23 players who have 
decided to pass up their remaining college eligibility and take a 
shot at the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The league will announce the complete list Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who passed for 4,275 yards and 36 TD's in the 1998  
season, was expected to be selected No. 1 by the expansion 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want them to know that's where I want to be,'' Couch said  
about playing in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiborne won the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker  
while Farris was voted the Outland Trophy as the top lineman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little bit of unfinished business at SC, but I'm  
ready for a new challenge,'' Claiborne said. ``I did everything I 
could for this university. I'm ready to step up to a new level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two players from Ohio State, wide receiver David Boston and  
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, announced they will leave early. Both 
were expected to be taken in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston was the Buckeyes career receiving leader with 2,855 yards  
while Katzenmoyer became the first sophomore to win the Butkus 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Florida Gators, linebacker Jevon Kearse and defensive  
tackle Reggie McGrew, also said they are coming out early. 
</P>
<P>
	Running backs Edgerrin James of Miami, Amos Zereoue of West  
Virginia and Leroy Collins of Louisville were among the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins' departure was a surprise -- even to his coach.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let him leave,'' Louisville coach John L. Smith said after  
hearing of Collins' intent. ``Where does he think he's going to 
go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have declared include defensive back Champ Bailey of  
Georgia, offensive lineman John Tait of Brigham Young and 
linebacker Rahim Abdullah of Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the stars thought the time was right to come out.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida State standout wide receiver Peter Warrick and Alabama  
running back Shaun Alexander were among those who opted to stay in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing I wanted to do is be happy wherever I am,''  
said Alexander, who was Alabama's leading rusher. ``If I go to the 
NFL, I've got to be a grownup.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Head Happy With BCS System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- NCAA president Cedric Dempsey says no  
specific group is pushing for a Division I-A football playoff -- 
except the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``You either have athletic directors, presidents, coaches and  
faculty representatives advancing a particular issue,'' Dempsey 
said during a luncheon with reporters Saturday as the NCAA began 
its 93rd annual convention. ``But right now there is not one group 
out there advocating a football playoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey said he was pleased with the Bowl Championships Series,  
which produced the matchup of No. 1 Tennessee and No. 2 Florida 
State last week in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl for the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee won 23-16, but the debate continued over the need for  
a playoff system. NCAA Division I-A football is the only sport that 
does not crown a champion with a playoff system or tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some very positive things to come out of it,''  
Dempsey said of the BCS. ``The last couple of weeks (before the 
pairings were announced) we had as much interest in college 
football that there has been in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other business, the NCAA Division I Management Council  
approved a 12th football game in years in which there are 14 
Saturdays from the start of the season until the last weekend in 
November. That will occur in the years 2002 and 2003 and happen six 
times over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means the end of such preseason games as the Kickoff  
and Pigskin Classics beginning with the 2003 season, although they 
will take place in 2002 because of contractual obligations for 
television, committee chairman Robert A. Bowlsby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding a 12th game will give all teams an equal chance for extra  
play, not just a select few, Bowlsby said. 
</P>
<P>
	The management council also approved a proposal that will allow  
student-athletes with diagnosed learning disabilities -- who fail to 
qualify academically -- to receive a fourth year of eligibility if 
they have completed 75 percent of their degree work in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The action was part of the NCAA's consent degree with the  
Department of Justice after the department found the NCAA in 
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act in October 1997. 
The NCAA disputed the allegations but said it would examine its 
policies to serve athletes with learning disabilities better. 
</P>
<P>
	The Management Council will continue its meeting Monday and  
could amend Saturday's action before it adjourns. Final approval 
will go to the Division I Board of Directors on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Louisville's Collins Going Pro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Louisville running back Leroy Collins is  
leaving the school after only one season and making a try for the 
NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, a 6-foot-2, 200-pound junior, ran for 1,228 yards and  
scored a school-record 22 touchdowns last season as the Cardinals 
finished 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent two years at Alfred State in New York and was a junior  
college All America honorable mention after gaining 964 yards on 
136 carries as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said after Louisville's 48-29 loss to Marshall last  
month in the Motor City Bowl that he had the ``heart'' to be a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Cardinals coach John L. Smith scoffed at the notion  
of Collins turning pro. ``Let him leave,'' he said. ``... Where 
does he think he's going to go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through a spokesman on Friday, Smith said that he wished Collins  
the best and had no further comment on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Shania Twain Story Has Happy Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shania Twain's life could be a country song --  
with a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-nominated singer was raised in a small town 500 miles  
north of Toronto in a family so poor that she and her sister 
sometimes ate mustard sandwiches ``just to have something between 
the bread,'' she says Cosmopolitan magazine's February issue. 
</P>
<P>
	When she was 21, Twain put her career on hold when her parents  
were killed in a car accident. She stopped touring and got a steady 
job so she could raise her sister and two younger brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	After her youngest brother graduated high school, she  
immediately got to work on a demo tape. That self-titled CD was 
released in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, her third album, ``Come on Over,'' was a smash  
hit. Last week, it was nominated for six Grammy awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going to war and coming back,'' Twain said. ``Every  
once in a while, someone has to slap you on the back and say, `Hey! 
The war is over!'''

<HEADLINE> Marino Ends Another No-Ring Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Dan Marino stood stiffly, arms folded, frowning in  
the face of defeat. With the last minute ticking off the clock, he 
watched helplessly from the sideline, where he'll spend the final 
few weeks of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Again.  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Dolphins' season ended Saturday like so many others in  
the Marino era: no running game, no defense, no Super Bowl. The 
most prolific passer in NFL history completed his 16th season 
without a championship ring when Miami lost 38-3 to the Denver 
Broncos in the second round of the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the most lopsided postseason loss in the Dolphins'  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of late-season injuries contributed to a collapse by  
their young defense and left Marino as his team's only hope for an 
upset. On an unexpectedly pleasant 50-degree afternoon, the 
37-year-old quarterback didn't look cold, and he didn't look old. 
He just looked outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
	With Miami's front four depleted by injuries, Terrell Davis  
shredded the Dolphins for 199 yards rushing. With tackle Richmond 
Webb and tight end Troy Drayton sidelined and running back Karim 
Abdul-Jabbar hobbled, Miami was unable to generate a ground game. 
</P>
<P>
	That was too much for Marino to overcome. His first pass was  
dropped. His second pass was also dropped. By the time he threw for 
a first down, the Dolphins trailed 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
	From that point, the situation deteriorated.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really challenge,'' Marino said. ``There's not a  
whole lot to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino completed six of seven passes to set up a field goal that  
cut the score to 14-3, but Miami didn't threaten again until late 
in the third quarter, and Bill Romanowski's interception ended that 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino finished a respectable 26-for-37 for 243 yards with two  
interceptions. It wasn't his fault that Miami failed to score a 
touchdown, as coach Jimmy Johnson noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a matter of us not being able to run the ball,''  
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos outgained Miami on the ground 250-14. They also  
taunted Marino -- during the game, and afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't ask me about Marino, because I don't talk about  
losers,'' tight end Shannon Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver coach Mike Shanahan was more diplomatic when talking  
about Marino. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a great job of keeping him off balance,'' Shanahan  
said. ``Any time you can do that to a quarterback of his caliber, 
you know that you've played a complete game on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino lost to John Elway for the first time in their three  
career meetings. Marino threw four touchdown passes in a 31-21 
victory over Denver just last month, but that was in Miami when the 
Dolphins were relatively healthy and the Broncos had little 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway will likely retire after this season, and Marino will  
likely be back in 1999 for another try. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino noted the Dolphins' progress this season, including their  
first playoff victory since 1994. But he said the challenge of 
reaching the Super Bowl as a wild-card team was too daunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to find a way to win more games during the  
regular season,'' he said. ``Home-field advantage makes such a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino wanted to end this season at home -- in the Super Bowl at  
Miami on Jan. 31. Instead it ended on the road, in a rout, three 
wins shy of the NFL title Marino has never won.

<HEADLINE> Cavs' Owner Sees Intense Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The front-office of the Cleveland Cavaliers  
expects the post-lockout season to be intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the shortened season, all the games will have more  
intensity than normal,'' Cavs owner Gordon Gund said Friday in 
sizing up the upcoming season. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA commissioner David Stern has said the league hopes to start  
the season Feb. 5, with each team playing 50 games. Each team will 
play two exhibition games -- one home and one away. 
</P>
<P>
	Players can start using team facilities beginning Monday,  
although coaches will be prohibited from working with them until a 
collective bargaining agreement is put into writing and signed by 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Fratello said teams with a lot of players who know  
their coaches and system should have the advantage early in the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we haven't really seen them now for all these months,  
it's hard to say what type of condition the team will come back in. 
We hope they've paid attention to their bodies along the way and 
will come back in shape and ready to go,'' Fratello said. ``We have 
to determine how many practices we are cut short before the first 
regular game in order to determine how far behind we're going to 
be.''

<HEADLINE> Pork Farmer Publicize Plight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITCHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- A hog hunt that was supposed to draw  
attention to low pork prices turned into a slaughter Saturday after 
animal rights activists objected. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Finnegan said he and other hog farmers originally had  
planned to let people hunt domestic pigs at a shooting range as a 
way of publicizing the plight of hog farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals protested  
to local and state authorities, and Finnegan said Meeker County 
Sheriff Mike Hirman advised him that it was illegal to hunt 
domestic animals. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of the hunt, Finnegan said the farmers conducted a  
slaughtering operation, selling the butchered hogs for $100 each, 
less than consumers would pay for the meat at a store. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers across the nation have been getting as little as $20  
a head for animals that cost them as much as $100 each to raise. 
</P>
<P>
	A pig shoot planned in Iowa was canceled last month because of  
safety concerns after the organizer was swamped with responses from 
hunters.

<HEADLINE> Holmgren Has High Hopes in Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) -- What do the Seattle Seahawks expect from  
Mike Holmgren? A Super Bowl, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	That's his specialty, isn't it?  
</P>
<P>
	With owner Paul Allen's billions behind him, Holmgren, the coach  
who took the Green Bay Packers to the past two Super Bowls, will 
now try to do the same as coach and general manager of the 
Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	He's not inheriting a bad team; but it's a team that was a major  
underachiever last season, going 8-8 for the third time in Dennis 
Erickson's four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren said he didn't know much about Seattle's personnel  
because his main focus was trying -- albeit unsuccessfully -- to get 
the Packers back to the Super Bowl. But he promised to be a quick 
learner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have a lot of questions answered yet about the  
Seahawks, but I'm going to get 'em in a hurry,'' Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Holmgren wanted out of Green Bay after seven  
seasons for a chance to become general manager as well as coach 
with a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long. On Monday, the Seahawks contacted the  
Packers and got permission to talk to Holmgren. On Friday, he was 
being introduced as the new coach in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``By him coming here, people will expect us to be good right  
away,'' running back Ricky Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This automatically gives credibility to this organization as a  
Super Bowl contender,'' quarterback Jon Kitna said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he's the best coach in the game,'' said Randy Mueller,  
vice president of football operations. ``I want to win and this 
gives us a great chance to win. It puts us right at the top around 
the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren's hiring was a public relations coup for Allen, who has  
been trying to turn around a franchise that was 2-14 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., became owner of the  
Seahawks on June 30, 1997, after Washington voters approved 
Referendum 48, which allowed the building of a new outdoor stadium 
with grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite spending $55 million in the past two seasons on free  
agents such as Watters and linebacker Chad Brown, Allen and 
Whitsitt still were on the outside looking in at the playoff 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks haven't been to the playoffs since 1988, haven't  
won a playoff game since 1984 and haven't had a winning season 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they expect that to change.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitsitt was willing to give it a try although it meant changing  
his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said a year ago when I was looking for a GM and not a head  
coach my preference was to have two people in two roles,'' Whitsitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you look around now, some of the more successful  
organizations are doing very well that have that setup. You can 
look at the (New York) Jets (Parcells), you can look at Atlanta 
(Dan Reeves), you can look at Miami (Mike Shanahan), you can look 
at Jacksonville (Tom Coughlin).'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coming to Seattle, Holmgren received an eight-year contract  
that is thought to be worth $32 million -- $4 million a season -- 
that makes him the highest paid coach in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks players have heard Holmgren is a lot more demanding  
than Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't had to yell at me yet, so that's good,'' Kitna said.

<HEADLINE> Lawn-Boy Power Mowers Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Operators of Lawn-Boy power mowers should  
check if their model is one of the 78,000 being recalled by Toro 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission says the lower blade of  
the power mowers can break off and possibly injure the operator. 
</P>
<P>
	The mowers have a mulching fan that sits on top of the blade.  
Because there is nothing to hold the fan and blade together, the 
fan creates vibrations that can cause the lower blade to crack and 
break off, the commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toro, based in Bloomington, Minn., has received one report of a  
consumer who suffered a bruised tendon when struck on the ankle by 
a piece of a broken blade while operating the mower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lawn-Boy Silver Series, Four Cycle, walk-behind, 21-inch  
power mowers were sold at Lawn-Boy dealers and retail outlets, 
including Sears, Lowe's and the Home Depot. The mowers were sold 
from January 1997 through November 1998 for $280 to $400. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall includes: power mowers with model numbers 10200,  
10202, 10212, 10236, 10302, 10307 and serial numbers ranging from 
7900001-7999999; power mowers with model numbers 10313, 10321 and 
serial numbers ranging from 7900001-8999999; and powers mowers with 
the model number 10249 and serial numbers ranging from 
8900001-8999999. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers should stop using the recalled mowers immediately. The  
company is mailing out free repair kits. Purchasers who sent in 
their registration card will automatically receive a kit. They can 
have the repair performed for free at a local Lawn-Boy service 
dealer after receiving the kit. 
</P>
<P>
	To contact the nearest Lawn-Boy service dealer, consumers should  
call Lawn-Boy at 1-800-444-8676 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST 
Monday through Friday.

Friday at age 81, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Baghdadi was hospitalized Friday for complications from his  
two-year struggle with liver cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the closest supporters of the late President Gamal

<HEADLINE> Tours Celebrate American Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Smithsonian Institution exhibits  
celebrating more than a century of innovative American music opened 
this week, beginning tours that will take the shows to dozens of 
cities over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Red, Hot and Blue'' goes back to 1870 for a look at how the  
American musical developed from the Mozart operetta, Italian grand 
opera, Irish clog dance, African rhythms and Sir Arthur Sullivan's 
musical satire. The title comes from a Cole Porter hit of 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	The traveling version of the show opened this week in Washington  
at the new Ronald Reagan Building. 
</P>
<P>
	The other exhibit, ``The Jazz Age in Paris 1914-1940,'' features  
Josephine Baker, a teen-age dancer from St. Louis who popularized 
``le jazz hot'' in France. Her way was paved by the bands of the 
36th Infantry and the 350th Field Artillery that served there in 
World War I. She died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian presented its original version of the exhibit at

<HEADLINE> Service Agencies Scramble Over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Big business and government may be well on their  
way toward fixing the so-called Y2K computer bug. But it's likely 
to be a bumpier ride for cash-strapped nonprofit agencies -- which 
provide everything from food for needy children to shelter for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no extra money to give to this,'' said Marian Heard,  
president of the United Way of Massachusetts Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they usually operate on far smaller budgets,  
nonprofits face many of the same technological obstacles that large 
banks and insurance companies do: If their computers fail, they 
lose their ability to pay staff and keep track of clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the Y2K bug -- a software glitch that threatens to crash  
some computers at the dawn of the year 2000 -- is especially 
daunting for smaller nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, their computer systems were purchased years ago  
on a shoestring budget. Short on funds, they now don't have the 
luxury of hiring a technology specialist to see if their outdated 
system is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worry about putting this whole Y2K issue of compliance on  
top of an already stressed system,'' said Dan McDougal, director of 
the Southeastern Michigan Information Center, an arm of the Detroit 
area United Way. ``Most nonprofits are overworked already serving 
the people they have to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has already hosted three workshops for area nonprofits  
on Y2K, and produced a brochure with help from Ford Motor Co. to 
distribute to social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, nonprofit administrators ``just keep hearing  
about this Y2K thing and they're not quite sure what it is,'' said 
John Halpin, who coordinates technology issues for the United Way 
of the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is the same in Massachusetts, where a recent United  
Way survey of 100 nonprofits found that 87 of them have not yet 
readied their computers for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	As agencies begin confronting the problem, it's possible there  
could be a ripple effect in services as money that could have gone 
toward staff raises is funneled into technology, said Christopher 
O'Keefe, director of community investments for the United Way of 
Massachusetts Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	But O'Keefe added that most nonprofits are fiercely unwilling to  
reduce services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our organizations will cut off their arm before they  
cut their programs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Pilot Charged in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Air Force Capt. Joseph A. Belli's life has  
been ruined simply because he fell in love, his attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, a 12-year veteran who flew Defense Secretary William  
Cohen's entourage to the Mideast last spring, faces 20 years in 
prison if convicted of fraternization and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything he holds dear is essentially gone,'' said lawyer  
John Hodson. ``I don't know that you have a lot of control over who 
you fall in love with in life. But it's a hell of a price to pay, 
isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formal charges were filed last week against the Travis Air Force  
Base captain and father of five. An Article 32 hearing, the 
military version of a grand jury proceeding, is expected to begin 
within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli was charged with fraternization and conspiracy, and he is  
also accused of disobeying a direct order to end the relationship 
with Airman Susan Redo. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, a member of the 6th Air Refueling Squadron, allegedly  
began the affair when he was stationed at Diego Garcia Air Base in 
the Indian Ocean in November 1997, several months after his wife 
requested a divorce.

	Belli, 35, told his estranged wife about the affair when he  
returned to Travis last year, military officials said. She became 
angry and notified his commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt very much if that lady had any inkling of the ton of  
bricks she was about to bring down on her children's father,'' 
Hodson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials have accused Belli of asking his wife and  
Ms. Redo, who is in her early 20s, to lie about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Redo will not be prosecuted because the military assumes an  
officer is in control in such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel became a  
national issue in 1997 when Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 
bomber pilot, was charged with adultery for having an affair with 
the husband of a female airman in North Dakota. She eventually was 
allowed to resign and was not prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> No Retrial in New Orleans Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Prosecutors have decided not to retry the  
youngest person ever sent to Louisiana's death row on charges he 
murdered a man in a holdup outside a French Quarter restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney's office on Friday dropped the case  
against Shareef Cousin, who was sent to death row at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisiana Supreme Court last year ordered a new trial on the  
grounds that prosecutors improperly used hearsay evidence that 
Cousin admitted to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney Harry Connick said prosecutors do not have  
enough evidence to pursue the case a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he did it and our opinion has not changed,'' Connick  
said. But ``the court left us with very little to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connick's decision does not mean Cousin will be released from  
jail. He is currently serving a 20-year sentence for four unrelated 
armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cousin was convicted of the 1995 murder of Alfred Michael  
Gerardi, 25. His death sentence prompted an outcry by Amnesty 
International and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cousin maintained he was at a city recreation department  
basketball game at the time, and his coach testified that he 
dropped him off at home about 20 minutes after the slaying.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Boosting Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, concerned at the damaging  
effects of Asia's economic crisis on U.S. manufacturers, today 
proposed a $108 million, three-part plan to boost American exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``With millions of American jobs depending on foreign exports,  
we must help manufacturers find new markets and attract new 
customers for our goods overseas,'' Clinton said in his weekly 
radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	He recorded it Friday at United Auto Workers headquarters in  
Detroit after announcing at the Economic Club of Detroit that the 
nation's economic expansion is now the longest in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said his $108 million plan would result in nearly  
$2 billion of additional U.S. exports, which would sustain or 
create 16,000 high-wage manufacturing jobs. The plan will be part 
of his proposed 2000 budget, which he is due to present to Congress 
in early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton described a three-pronged approach:  
</P>
<P>
	--Boost support for the Import-Export Bank, the federal agency  
that provides loans and loan guarantees to help U.S. companies sell 
abroad. Clinton said the bank, which currently finances 10 percent 
of all U.S. exports of capital equipment, can use expanded credit 
to foster billions of dollars in exports that might other have been 
canceled or delayed due to the financial turmoil in Asia. He 
provided no other details, including how much he would expand the 
bank's resources. 
</P>
<P>
	--Expand the Commerce Department's efforts to help small U.S.  
exporters sell their goods in emerging markets such as China, Latin 
America and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	--Help developing countries establish a legal and regulatory  
system that would make it easier for U.S. companies to sell there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan, not likely to generate Republican opposition,  
is designed to head off protectionist moves in the GOP-controlled 
Congress. The administration is coming under increasing fire for a 
U.S. trade deficit that is running at a record $167 billion annual 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports have been hurt particularly by the financial crisis  
that struck East Asia in 1997 and persisted through last year -- a 
crunch that has caused Japan and other major U.S. markets to reduce 
imports of American goods and to increase their exports to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, Clinton singled  
out Japan for criticism of its increased steel exports to the 
United States, which has taken a heavy toll on U.S. steelmakers. He 
took steps earlier this week to extend tax relief to the steel 
industry, but not the stronger steps that industry leaders have 
lobbied hard for. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has accounted for nearly half the surge in U.S. steel  
imports. Clinton warned on Friday that unless those shipments begin 
dropping dramatically, his administration would begin ``forceful 
action'' under American trade law to impose stiff penalty tariffs 
on Japanese steel. 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address today, the president also said his proposed  
2000 budget would include $25 million to create a new arm of the 
International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations, 
to help developing nations put in place basic protections for 
workers, including the right to organize. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must ensure that the new global economy works for working  
people,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> New York Triplets Saved by Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Doctors, nurses and paramedics rushed into  
action to save triplets who suddenly stopped breathing at their 
doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	David and Nicole Martin, of Mount Vernon, brought their  
5-week-old triplets to Dr. Debra Etelson's office in suburban New 
York City on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The babies, who range in weight from 7 to 8 pounds, were having  
trouble fighting off colds that had settled in their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Etelson was arranging to hospitalize the boys when a nurse  
informed her that the biggest of the boys, John, had stopped 
breathing. The nurse and doctor began working on the baby, and were 
soon helped by an arriving team of paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
	News then came that Ciaran, the middle-sized baby, had stopped  
breathing. Minutes later, the third baby, Adrian, also stopped 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was holding Ciaran when another nurse who was holding Adrian  
saw Ciaran turning blue,'' David Martin said. ``I knew they were 
already working on John. I couldn't believe what was happening. 
Words can't describe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Etelson said dealing with one infant in an emergency is hard  
enough, ``but with three in sequence, it became really quite 
frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The triplets were stabilized and taken to the Westchester  
Medical Center, where they were in critical but stable condition.

<HEADLINE> Maier Wins 3rd Consecutive Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHLADMING, Austria (AP) -- Austrian Hermann Maier demonstrated  
again today why he is the most feared skier on the World Cup 
circuit, blazing down the icy super-G course to clinch his third 
consecutive victory in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the Olympic super-G champion, tore down the bumpy slope  
to post the day's best time of 1 minute, 16.54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bad race last week so I had trouble getting into the  
rhythm today,'' Maier said. ``But then I picked up speed and 
powered down the piste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old, who worked as a bricklayer before joining the  
World Cup circuit, is known as the ``the Herminator'' for his 
powerful build. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier finished nearly six tenths of a second ahead of countryman  
Rainer Salzgeber. Hans Knauss, the hometown favorite, claimed third 
for an Austrian sweep of the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Maier picked up the World Cup title as well as two  
Olympic golds, in super-G and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	He holds a comfortable lead in the World Cup standings again  
this season. Lasse Kjus of Norway, who held the No. 2 spot in 
overall standings prior to today's race, fell in the super-G and 
failed to pick up points. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Maier's 15th career and fifth this season. He  
won three of the four super-Gs this season and finished second in 
the other.

<HEADLINE> Kerr Says Michael Jordan Won't Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Count Steve Kerr among those who doesn't  
think Michael Jordan will return to the NBA. And that would mean 
Kerr won't be staying in Chicago, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, who Saturday became only the second basketball player to  
have his number retired by the University of Arizona, bases his 
suspicion on the fact that Jordan has always been so prepared when 
play begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He prepares for a season as well as anybody, and from all I  
hear he's been playing golf and going to the Bahamas,'' Kerr said. 
``Unless he's working out in a hidden gym somewhere down in the 
Bahamas, I don't think he's really preparing to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr, a free agent, doesn't expect to re-sign with the Bulls if  
Jordan retires. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Michael decides to retire, I would guess the Bulls would go  
young and start fresh, and they probably should, because without 
Michael the Bulls aren't going to win a championship,'' Kerr said. 
``If that's the case, I'll probably move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long-ago Arizona chant of ``Steeeve Kerrrrrr'' echoed  
through McKale Center once again Saturday at the ceremony where his 
No. 25 was raised to the rafters after Arizona's 88-86 victory over 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr was at Arizona from 1984 to 1988 and was a member of Lute  
Olson's first Wildcat Final Four team in 1988. Kerr's teammate and 
the only other Arizona player to have his number retired, Sean 
Elliott, was on hand for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sean was probably more responsible for me being in the NBA  
than anybody because of what he did for the program because he took 
us over the top, and I just fed off of him,'' Kerr said. 
``Practically every 3-pointer they showed on the highlight film, 
Sean was throwing it to me. I owe Sean a great deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In accepting the honor, Kerr joked to the crowd that he was a  
very bad player when he arrived at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone would have told me then that my uniform would  
someday be hanging from the rafters, I'd be kind of frightened 
because I'd figure my body would still be in it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr said he finds it amazing that he succeeded so well in  
college, then had a 10-year NBA career that included three 
championship seasons with the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell people that sometimes I feel like Forrest Gump,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elliott said Kerr's success is a testimony to hard work and  
desire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says a lot,'' Elliott said. ``I've seen a whole lot of guys  
with a ton of talent, but they didn't have the know-how, they just 
didn't have the will, to get it done like he has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And don't be surprised if someday it's coach Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought that someday I'd enjoy coaching,'' he said at  
a news conference after the ceremony. ``I'm not sure at what level. 
I always thought maybe college coaching. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe at Arizona?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to come back here and coach under coach Olson  
someday,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> CBS Says NFL Deal Broke Even </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- CBS broke even in the first year of its  
expensive contract to broadcast NFL football and expects to turn a 
profit next year, the network's chief executive said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS executives insisted they would make money over the eight  
years of the contract when they took it away from NBC by agreeing 
last January to pay the NFL $4 billion to show American Football 
Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
	Being able to promote CBS shows during football games is one of  
the reasons the network has taken the lead over NBC in this 
season's prime-time ratings, said Leslie Moonves, president and CEO 
of CBS Television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think it's brilliant programming, but I don't  
think it's any coincidence that we're up and NBC is down,'' Moonves 
told television writers at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewership of NFL games on CBS was 1 percent lower this past  
season than it was on NBC in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the young male audience is up this season on 11 of  
CBS's prime-time shows, Moonves said. That makes the network more 
attractive to advertisers, and was a chief goal when the network 
agreed to the contract's steep price. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's ratings ascension this season still hasn't won the network  
the respect of advertisers, because its audience is still far older 
than its rivals. A survey of national advertisers and ad agencies 
released this week in a trade publication, the Myers Report, ranked 
CBS fifth in its appeal to advertisers behind NBC, Fox, the WB and 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS executives argue that with the aging of the baby boomers, an  
older audience is increasing in value. 
</P>
<P>
	Moonves poked fun at the network's demographic profile in  
explaining why CBS has avoided the reality shows with car crashes 
and attacking animals that have boosted Fox's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to do `World's Scariest Grandmothers,' but we  
didn't think that it would work,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Warn Dissidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police briefly detained or questioned ten  
dissidents to warn them against joining a fast to protest the 
jailing of a would-be opposition group's leaders, a human rights 
organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The series of rotating fasts by 214 dissidents was announced  
after China handed 13-, 12- and 11-year prison terms to Xu Wenli, 
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The three veteran political critics were convicted of subversion  
for trying to form the China Democracy Party to challenge Communist 
Party rule. Their sentences were among the harshest given to 
dissidents this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the northeastern city of Changchun questioned two  
party members, Li Wei and An Fuxing, for four hours Wednesday and 
told them not to join the fast or contact other dissidents, the 
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven other dissidents were questioned Thursday in the northeast  
cities of Changchun, Jilin, Shuangliao and Harbin, the rights group 
said. Another dissident, Jiang Shenghan, was taken in by police in 
Changchun for three hours Friday and warned not to join the fast, 
the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lu Siqing, who runs the group, said all but two of the ten were  
known to be members of the China Democracy Party. Most were taken 
to police stations for questioning, although at least one was 
interrogated at home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Friday, 28 dissidents had taken part in the fast and  
activists in the northeast were scheduled to fast next week, the 
group said. It also said 23 reporters, writers and artists joined 
the protest on Jan. 1.

<HEADLINE> Plummer Gives Cardinals a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Bill Walsh calls him the next Joe Montana.  
Deion Sanders says he's a young Fran Tarkenton. The Arizona 
Cardinals see him as their savior. 
</P>
<P>
	No rocket arm. No imposing physique. Absolutely no flamboyant  
personality. Yet no young quarterback comes close to the 
heart-thumping excitement Jake Plummer has created in just two NFL 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can be a great quarterback in this league for years to  
come,'' fullback Larry Centers said. ``Kind of like Larry Bird used 
to do, he makes everybody a part of the situation and elevates our 
level of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer, 24, has led the Cardinals into the playoffs for the  
first time in 16 years and to their first playoff victory in more 
than a half-century. Suddenly, a desert metropolis is enjoying 
Cardinal-mania after dismissing the team as a loser for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just that Plummer helped put the Cardinals into the NFC  
semifinals against the mighty Minnesota Vikings Sunday, it's the 
way he did it. Nine times in his 26 starts -- seven times this 
season -- Plummer brought Arizona back from a tie or deficit in the 
fourth quarter to win. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals had to win their final three games of the regular  
season to make the playoffs, and they won all three on last-second 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it has anything to do with magic. I don't have a  
wand out there with me or anything,'' said Plummer, who also was a 
star at Arizona State. ``I'm just out there trying to win a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals expect to win plenty in the future.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard for us to screw this up,'' said Bob  
Ferguson, vice president for player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona has eight picks in this year's draft, and probably will  
have a couple more as compensation for players who move elsewhere. 
Two of them are in the first round, Nos. 8 and 21, thanks to the 
trade with San Diego last season that gave the Chargers Ryan Leaf 
and left Arizona with Andre Wadsworth and a pile of draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals must sign new contracts with linebacker Jamir  
Miller and wide receiver Rob Moore. But considering the four-year, 
$29.7 million deal Plummer got recently, including an NFL record 
$15 million signing bonus, money no longer seems to be a problem 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Bill Bidwill, long considered a grumpy tightwad, now is a  
lovable, ice cream-eating eccentric. He has even been spotted 
smiling on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	And the undisputed star of it all is the guy Ferguson calls  
``the skinny kid from Idaho who played at Arizona State.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer shrugs it all off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be a laid-back guy who has fun out here, who  
acts like a kid who's 24 years old but has a pretty important 
position,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have placed their future on 6-foot-2, 197-pound  
Plummer, and not just on the field. The team's success this season 
could have a big impact on the vote, tentatively set for May, on 
whether to build a domed stadium in suburban Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did Joe Montana mean to the San Francisco franchise when  
they were turning it around in the early '80s?'' Ferguson said. 
``What's Brett Favre meant for Green Bay?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Plummer fades into the background.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wears jeans and T-shirts and has a backpack,'' Ferguson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But his easygoing personality masks a confidence that has  
infected everyone around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quiet, soft-spoken,'' coach Vince Tobin said, ``but you  
can feel an inner strength within him that he knows he's capable of 
making plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer was a hero in Arizona long before he put on a Cardinals  
uniform. He was the star quarterback for an Arizona State team that 
went 11-0 before losing to Ohio State in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals took him in the second round of the 1997 draft.  
</P>
<P>
	``People questioned his arm strength. I did, too, at one time,''  
Ferguson said. ``He's just so skinny. But I loved the way he played 
-- the flair, the heart, things you can't measure. There was a 
special quality about him. What he has as a quarterback is 
something only the great ones have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer didn't play until seven games into his rookie season.  
With the Cardinals at their 2-yard line at Philadelphia, he trotted 
into the huddle and told his teammates they were going to score. 
Then he took them 98 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer started the final nine games in 1997, and big things  
were predicted for his sophomore year. His teammates even elected 
him captain. 
</P>
<P>
	But he struggled with the West Coast offense installed by Marc  
Trestman, the new offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	After Plummer had two interceptions returned for touchdowns in a  
blowout loss in Seattle, then had three picked off in a home loss 
to Oakland, columnists and callers to radio talk shows wanted him 
benched. At 3-4, the Cardinals had a welcome week off. 
</P>
<P>
	When they resumed play, Jake the Snake was his old scrambling  
self, especially thriving when the Cardinals went to a no-huddle 
offense that created the kind of football anarchy that brings out 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned to just go out and play,'' he said. ``It was just a  
matter of staying patient and not getting uptight and not getting 
down, going through the little growing pains I had to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team finished 9-7, then pulled off the stunning playoff win  
in Dallas last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In leading the Cardinals to their first winning season since  
they moved from St. Louis in 1988, Plummer threw for 3,737 yards, 
more than Favre, Troy Aikman, John Elway and, yes, Montana, in 
their second NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummer threw 17 touchdown passes but was intercepted 20 times,  
often on passes when he should have thrown it away or taken a sack. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still 24 years old in the second year of his career and  
the first year of a new offense,'' Trestman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he marvels at how his quarterback affects everybody around  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very special guy,'' Trestman said. ``I'm very lucky to  
be around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Cardinals agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure he's surprising a lot of guys and surprising his  
teammates and his fans, but he has the potential to be all-world,'' 
wide receiver Frank Sanders said. ``Jake's hungry, and he's 
receiving good instruction at a young age, so the sky's the 
limit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Three homeless men died Saturday in an  
early-morning fire in an abandoned building. 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters were treated and released for minor injuries  
after they were struck by ceiling plaster, said Fire Chief Rusty 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were apparently overtaken by heat and smoke while  
sleeping, Thomas said. Two were identified as Dennis Murray, 29, 
and Howard Holton Jr., 47. Coroner Susan Chewning said both died of 
smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy firefighters chopped through boarded-up windows and took  
more than an hour to control the blaze, which gutted the building. 
Investigators did not immediately know what caused the fire.

<HEADLINE> Elway Finally Gets Best of Marino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway's ``Things to do before I retire'' list  
got a little bit shorter Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After finally winning the Super Bowl last year, Elway got his  
first victory over Dan Marino in what is likely the last on-field 
meeting between future Hall of Fame quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, expected to retire following the season, had lost two  
regular season games to Marino before Denver's 38-3 rout of Miami 
in the AFC divisional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had nothing to do with me beating Dan,'' Elway said.  
``There's always a rivalry built up around the two quarterbacks. I 
think the key thing about it is it's a playoff game. This is what 
we've worked for all year, so it was nice to go out and played like 
we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Elway-Marino duel seemed anticlimactic as Broncos running  
back Terrell Davis stole the spotlight with 199 yards rushing and 
Denver ran away from the Dolphins in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Davis, voted the NFL's Most Valuable Player, has taken  
the lead role in the Denver offense, he still takes his cue from 
the 16-year veteran Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think No. 7, he's probably the biggest person I can look  
at,'' Davis said. ``I can touch him and every day I ask him 
questions. I just try to follow the things he does. It's been 
working so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elway finished the game 14-of-23 for 182 yards and a touchdown.  
Marino was 26-of-37 for 243 yards and two interceptions, including 
one at the Denver 21-yard line to end a Dolphins drive in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	As much as it dogs them, Elway and Marino will be forever  
linked. They came into the league together in 1983 and they are the 
only two players to throw for more than 50,000 career yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither had won a Super Bowl in four tries -- Marino's only  
appearance came in January 1985 -- before Elway helped Denver to a 
31-24 victory over Green Bay last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With home-field advantage, the Broncos could be on their way to  
a second straight title-game appearance, which would land them in 
Miami -- site of the Super Bowl on Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told (the Dolphins), `How does it feel to have the Super  
Bowl at your house, and you're not invited?,''' Broncos tight end 
Shannon Sharpe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is if you want to go to Miami in late January,  
you've got to have a five-hour layover in Denver. I don't care if 
it's mechanical problems or you missed your flight, you've got to 
stop off in Denver. They don't have to stop anymore. They can 
leave.''

<HEADLINE> US Doomsday Cult Members Deported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOD, Israel (AP) -- Members of an American doomsday cult  
suspected of plotting attacks in Jerusalem to hasten the return of 
Jesus Christ were expelled from Israel early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police said security agents were accompanying the 14  
cultists, including six children, on the flight, which is headed to 
Toronto with a connection to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	As they were shuttled in unmarked police vehicles into Ben  
Gurion airport in Lod, a suburb of Tel Aviv, two of the cult 
members covered their heads with coats when they spotted TV 
cameras. One bearded man looked straight ahead, his face grim. None 
responded to questions shouted by reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	There is growing concern in Israel that the Denver-based group,  
the Concerned Christians, could be a forerunner of hundreds of 
fanatics who will be drawn to Israel at the close of the millennium 
for what they expect to be the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say such extremists could turn violent if their hopes  
are not met, and some predict mass suicides at holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has created a police task force to cope with the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	The Concerned Christians arrived in Israel in September, settled  
in two homes in the wooded Jerusalem suburbs of Mevasseret Zion and 
Moza and were eventually placed under police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	The homes were raided earlier this week and the 14 were  
detained. Three cult members were questioned by police about 
alleged plots to carry out violence at holy sites in Jerusalem in 
an attempt to hasten the return of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	The cult members denied wrongdoing and no charges were filed,  
but they were ordered deported. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, prayer leader Hayan al  
Idrisi referred to the cult in his sermon to more than 250,000 
worshipers. ``We think this is a dangerous group,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one scenario cited by millennium researchers,  
Christian extremists might try to damage Al Aqsa, Islam's third 
holiest shrine, to pave the way for rebuilding the Jewish Temple -- 
considered by some Christians a necessary step before the return of 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Idrisi claimed the cultists plotted to destroy Al Aqsa.  
</P>
<P>
	Police have never made such an accusation. An Israeli police  
source said that it was only a possible location for violence by 
Christian fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli lawyer who briefly represented three group members --  
Terry Smith, John Bayles and Eric Malesic -- said he was never shown 
the alleged evidence against his clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Eran Avital also said the three did not want to return home  
because they feared the United States would be destroyed soon.

<HEADLINE>  Norway Gets More World Cup Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NOVE MESTO NA MORAVE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Bjorn Dahelie and  
Bente Martinsen gave Norway victories in World Cup cross-country 
skiing events today, claiming the men's 15-kilometer and the 
women's 10-kilometer classical races. 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie, owner of a record eight Winter Olympic gold medals and  
five World Cup titles, led comfortably from start to finish, coming 
home in 42 minutes, 27.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Erling Jevne and Espen Bjervig showed Norway's domination in the  
15-kilometer race, finishing second and third respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Fabio May was fourth, followed by Sweden's Per Olofsson.  
</P>
<P>
	In the women's 10-kilometer race, Martinsen crossed the finish  
line in 30 minutes, 57.4 seconds, beating home-crowd favorite 
Katerina Neumannova by 3.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Neumannova had a 20-second lead over Martinsen until the eighth  
kilometer, but the Norwegian classical style specialist managed to 
clinch her third World Cup victory of the season after a stunning 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last meters of the race, I had to overtake a Ukrainian  
skier. That might have been those three seconds,'' Neumannova said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Svetlana Nagejkina finished third, edging Stefania  
Belmondo of Italy and another Russian, Nina Gavriljuk.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Hints Baseball Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Yankees no! Orioles? Why not?  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba on Friday denounced U.S. measures to ease sanctions against  
the socialist island as efforts to buy traitors, but hinted it may 
approve the first visit by a major league baseball team in half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Parliament Speaker Ricardo Alarcon, delivering Cuba's formal  
response to President Clinton's Jan. 5 announcement, called it ``a 
new phase in the war against Cuba'' that insulted Cuban Christians 
by portraying them as agents of subversion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alarcon seemed to show sympathy for the Baltimore Orioles'  
plan to play exhibition games against the Cuban national baseball 
team, a game U.S. officials said they would now authorize after 
blocking it for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not give definite approval, but indicated talks would  
deal with the type of bats -- wood or aluminum -- to be used and 
suggested proceeds go to aid Central American victims of Hurricane 
Mitch rather than to Cuban charities, as U.S. officials proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Alarcon said U.S. officials ``have been trying to sabotage this  
legitimate activity'' and called the Orioles ``champions in waiting 
for a bureaucratic license -- three years'' to arrange the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles, he said, ``are interested in practicing sport. They  
know that Cuba is a baseball power. It is a challenge and it is an 
honor for any team to compete with the Cubans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said the Orioles would like to play one game in  
Cuba and to play host to the Cubans at Camden Yards, probably 
during spring training this year. The Cubans will be finishing 
their national winter league season at the time.

<HEADLINE> Hermann Maier Wins Third Super G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCHLADMING, Austria (AP) -- At home, ``The Herminator'' is  
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hermann Maier again demonstrated Saturday why he is the most  
dominant skier on the World Cup circuit, blazing down the icy 
super-G course for his third consecutive victory in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, the Olympic super-G champion, showed no fear as he tore  
down the bumpy course in 1 minute, 16.54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a bad race last week, so I had trouble getting into the  
rhythm today,'' Maier said. ``But then I picked up speed and 
powered down the steep and icy section. That's where I won the 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian, who worked as a bricklayer before joining the  
World Cup last season, is known as the ``Herminator'' for his 
powerful build. 
</P>
<P>
	After a disappointing 20th place in a giant slalom Tuesday at  
Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, Maier had promised to be in top shape for 
the races in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very motivated to remain unbeaten here,'' said Maier,  
who won two super-G's in Schladming last season. ``I felt great 
support from the spectators, many of whom I heard came from my 
hometown of Flachau.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maier has won every World Cup race he has in which he has  
competed in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's super-G, he left his rivals far behind, finishing  
nearly .6 seconds ahead of runner-up Rainer Salzgeber of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzgeber lost control after crossing the finish line, fell,  
then slid hard under the protective barriers, before being pulled 
out by race officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Knauss, the hometown favorite, was third at 1:17.31, giving  
Austria a sweep of the medals. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15,000 spectators lined the course, cheering wildly each  
time an Austrian came down. 
</P>
<P>
	Austrian super-G specialist Stephan Eberharter fell when he  
tried to take a corner too tight. Minutes after the race, 
Eberharter said he already was thinking about Sunday's giant slalom 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to steal the show from Maier in Flachau,''  
Eberharter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrians hold the top five spots in the super-G standings.  
Maier leads, with Eberharter second. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Maier won the World Cup title, plus two Olympic  
golds, in super-G and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	He leads the World Cup standings this season by 159 points.  
Lasse Kjus of Norway, second in the overall standings prior to 
Saturday's race, fell and failed to pick up points. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's triumph was Maier's 15th career win and fifth this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The super-G was the last before the World Championships, which  
begin Jan. 31 at Vail, Colo.

<HEADLINE> Service Agencies Scramble Over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Big business and government may be well on their  
way toward fixing the so-called Y2K computer bug. But it's likely 
to be a bumpier ride for cash-strapped nonprofit agencies -- which 
provide everything from food for needy children to shelter for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no extra money to give to this,'' said Marian Heard,  
president of the United Way of Massachusetts Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they usually operate on far smaller budgets,  
nonprofits face many of the same technological obstacles that large 
banks and insurance companies do: If their computers fail, they 
lose their ability to pay staff and keep track of clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing the Y2K bug -- a software glitch that threatens to crash  
some computers at the dawn of the year 2000 -- is especially 
daunting for smaller nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases, their computer systems were purchased years ago  
on a shoestring budget. Short on funds, they now don't have the 
luxury of hiring a technology specialist to see if their outdated 
system is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``They worry about putting this whole Y2K issue of compliance on  
top of an already stressed system,'' said Dan McDougal, director of 
the Southeastern Michigan Information Center, an arm of the Detroit 
area United Way. ``Most nonprofits are overworked already serving 
the people they have to serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit has already hosted three workshops for area nonprofits  
on Y2K, and produced a brochure with help from Ford Motor Co. to 
distribute to social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Francisco, nonprofit administrators ``just keep hearing  
about this Y2K thing and they're not quite sure what it is,'' said 
John Halpin, who coordinates technology issues for the United Way 
of the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
	The story is the same in Massachusetts, where a recent United  
Way survey of 100 nonprofits found that 87 of them have not yet 
readied their computers for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	As agencies begin confronting the problem, it's possible there  
could be a ripple effect in services as money that could have gone 
toward staff raises is funneled into technology, said Christopher 
O'Keefe, director of community investments for the United Way of 
Massachusetts Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	But O'Keefe added that most nonprofits are fiercely unwilling to  
reduce services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our organizations will cut off their arm before they  
cut their programs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Pilot Charged in Sex Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Air Force Capt. Joseph A. Belli's life has  
been ruined simply because he fell in love, his attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, a 12-year veteran who flew Defense Secretary William  
Cohen's entourage to the Mideast last spring, faces 20 years in 
prison if convicted of fraternization and other charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything he holds dear is essentially gone,'' said lawyer  
John Hodson. ``I don't know that you have a lot of control over who 
you fall in love with in life. But it's a hell of a price to pay, 
isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Formal charges were filed last week against the Travis Air Force  
Base captain and father of five. An Article 32 hearing, the 
military version of a grand jury proceeding, is expected to begin 
within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli was charged with fraternization and conspiracy, and he is  
also accused of disobeying a direct order to end the relationship 
with Airman Susan Redo. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, a member of the 6th Air Refueling Squadron, allegedly  
began the affair when he was stationed at Diego Garcia Air Base in 
the Indian Ocean in November 1997, several months after his wife 
requested a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	Belli, 35, told his estranged wife about the affair when he  
returned to Travis last year, military officials said. She became 
angry and notified his commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt very much if that lady had any inkling of the ton of  
bricks she was about to bring down on her children's father,'' 
Hodson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force officials have accused Belli of asking his wife and  
Ms. Redo, who is in her early 20s, to lie about the affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Redo will not be prosecuted because the military assumes an  
officer is in control in such a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel became a  
national issue in 1997 when Lt. Kelly Flinn, the first female B-52 
bomber pilot, was charged with adultery for having an affair with 
the husband of a female airman in North Dakota. She eventually was 
allowed to resign and was not prosecuted.

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Padres To Open in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Big league baseball is going south of the  
border again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies will play the defending NL champion San  
Diego Padres in the season opener on Sunday night, April 4, in 
Monterrey, Mexico. It will be the first time two major league teams 
have opened a season outside the United States or Canada, and 
likely won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, to be played at 26,000-seat Estadio Monterrey, will be  
called the ``Apertura Internacional'' -- the International Opener. 
It will be shown on ESPN in the United States, and officials say it 
will be televised to 200 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very significant step for baseball, a very symbolic  
step for baseball, and the name is not an accident,'' Padres 
president Larry Lucchino said during a news conference Friday. 
``This is the first international opener. I suppose the NFL would 
put a Roman numeral I next to it. Maybe we should do that as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're seeing what I hope will be a perhaps annually,  
maybe periodically, series of international openers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres and New York Mets played a three-game series at  
Estadio Monterrey in August 1996, the first regular-season games 
outside the United States or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Valenzuela started and won the opener of that series,  
which was moved in part because of a potential scheduling conflict 
with the GOP convention, and because the Padres were expanding 
their marketing into Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Caminiti, weakened by food poisoning and dehydrated by the  
brutal heat, became a folk hero when he took two bags of 
intravenous fluid just before the final game, then hit two home 
runs as the Padres won two of three. 
</P>
<P>
	Making the 1,000-mile trip for a ``home'' series was necessary  
because Estadio Monterrey is considered the best ballpark in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres might try to get Valenzuela, who's playing in the  
Mexican leagues, to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	When baseball's international committee suggested the Monterrey  
opener, these two teams were the natural choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres are one of the trend setters in international  
marketing, and definitely the leader in exotic road trips -- they 
also moved a series to Honolulu in 1997. The Rockies have Vinny 
Castilla, one of the most popular ballplayers to come from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the invitation came to us, we grabbed at it,'' Lucchino  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game will be good for baseball and very good for both  
Colorado and Mexico,'' Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris said in a 
statement. ``We are proud to have Vinny Castilla, one of the most 
popular and successful players in Mexico's history, on our team and 
look forward to a great game versus the Padres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla hit 46 homers last year, and should like the bandbox  
Estadio Monterrey. During the 1996 series, the Padres hit eight 
homers and the Mets one. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla was playing in Mexico and wasn't available for comment,  
a Rockies spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will return to San Diego for the Padres' home opener  
on Tuesday, April 6, then finish the series the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucchino said it's possible that future international openers  
will be played in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Georgia teens romance ends in violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARROLLTON, Ga. (AP) -- A high school where an apparent  
double-suicide attempt left a teen-age girl dead and her boyfriend 
seriously wounded invited grief counselors to campus today to help 
their shocked classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in a Central High School bathroom Friday killed  
15-year-old Andrea Garrett and wounded Jeff Miller, 17. Parents and 
fellow students were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said all the color went out of me; I got weak in the  
knees,'' said Joani Osteen, a parent who rushed to the school after 
word of the violence spread through the west Georgia town of 
17,000. ``You see it on TV all the time, but not here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow students said the young couple had been having problems,  
and that Ms. Garrett was under pressure from her parents to end the 
romance. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller recently had said that he ``wouldn't be here much  
longer,'' said Tiffany Osteen, 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it was just all talk,'' said Ms. Smith, who was in  
the marching band with Andrea. ``Young love, you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But shortly after school started Friday, a janitor found the  
couple shot in a girls' bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Garrett died at Tanner Medical Center. Miller was airlifted  
in critical condition to Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, about 
40 miles to the east. At the family's request, hospital officials 
declined to give updates on the boy's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This apparently was something that was agreed upon by the two  
kids,'' said Carroll County Sheriff Tony Reeves. ``They chose to do 
this for whatever reason at the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon was a .22-caliber pistol that was taken from a locked  
safe belonging to the girl's parents. Investigators were trying to 
determine who fired the shots.

<HEADLINE> Anger Flares at Riverside Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- A young woman shot 12 times by police  
as she sat in her car with a gun was remembered Saturday as a 
churchgoer and loving friend whose killers deserve criminal 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 500 people packed New Joy Baptist Church for the funeral  
of 19-year-old Tyisha Miller, who was killed early Dec. 28 by four 
police officers as she sat in her car. The shooting has sparked 
protests by blacks and others in this city 60 miles east of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-hour ceremony, clergymen delivered fiery  
eulogies demanding the prosecution of the four officers involved in 
Ms. Miller's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing in front of her casket piled high with pink flowers,  
the Rev. Paul Munford called on the congregation to demand justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want it to happen again,'' Munford said. ``We are  
tired! We are tired!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some have claimed the shooting was racially motivated. Three of  
the officers are white and one is Hispanic; Ms. Miller was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her only crime was sleeping while black,'' added the Rev.  
DeWayne Butler, a cousin of Ms. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler also mocked the Riverside Police Department for changing  
its story about the shooting. Investigators initially said Ms. 
Miller fired at officers, but later said she grabbed at a gun in 
her lap after an officer broke a window to help her. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were responding to a call that she was locked in a car at  
a gas station, unresponsive to relatives who banged on the window. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have changed their story too many times in the past  
week,'' Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members have claimed Ms. Miller was unconscious when she  
was killed. The four officers and a white sergeant who were at the 
scene have been placed on paid leave during an internal department 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI is conducting an inquiry into the shooting. Ms. Miller's  
family has retained former O.J. Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran 
Jr. for its lawsuit against the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	A Riverside County coroner's report concluded Ms. Miller was  
shot a dozen times at close range, including four times in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	Coroner's officials on Thursday said Ms. Miller had a blood  
alcohol level of 0.13 percent. In California, the legal blood 
alcohol limit for driving is 0.08 percent. Traces of marijuana and 
cannabinoids, a marijuana byproduct, were also in her system when 
she died, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives arranged for a second autopsy to be conducted Thursday  
by Dr. Michael Baden, New York City's former chief medical 
examiner. Results from that autopsy were not expected for several 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Lost on Stalled Running Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Garrison Hearst crumpled to the turf on the first  
play. Terry Kirby limped off the field moments later. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco 49ers had lost their legs.  
</P>
<P>
	With their running game mangled and going nowhere, and Steve  
Young pressured into throwing three interceptions, the 49ers lost 
to the Atlanta Falcons 20-18 in a divisional playoff Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearst, San Francisco's leading rusher, broke a bone in his left  
leg at the end of a 7-yard run. He was pulled down awkwardly, his 
leg bent beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking,'' San Francisco guard Ray Brown said. ``At  
first, I didn't think it was serious. But when they brought the 
cart out to take him off the field, I knew it was bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a big blow. But I like the way the guys battled back  
and we almost got it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirby bruised a bone in his left leg when he was kicked while  
covering San Francisco's first punt. Unlike Hearst, who came out on 
crutches to watch the second half from the bench, Kirby had his leg 
injected with a pain-killer and returned late in the second 
quarter. But he was still playing hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our running game took a couple of hits,'' San Francisco coach  
Steve Mariucci said. ``Terry Kirby came back but he wasn't quite 
full speed. A lot of the responsibility was placed on Steve Young's 
shoulders and our passing game. You try to be balanced, but we just 
weren't balanced from early in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, which came in with the league's top rushing  
attack, didn't get a rushing first down until the fourth quarter. 
Kirby had just 22 yards on nine carries and Hearst was the 49ers' 
leading rusher at halftime with his 7-yard run making up most of 
the team's nine-yard total. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected to come in and establish the running game,'' said  
Jerry Rice, who caught a 17-yard touchdown pass from Young in the 
second quarter for San Francisco's first score after trailing 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Garrison went down and Terry was hurt, we had to pass and  
I think they knew that,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young completed 23 of 37 passes for 289 yards but was  
intercepted three times. San Francisco was on the brink of another 
score, with the ball on the Atlanta 25, when Young overthrew J.J. 
Stokes near the goal line and Eugene Robinson intercepted, 
returning it 77 yards to set up a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter, tight end Greg Clark broke one way  
and Young threw the other way, leading to an interception by 
William White. White also picked off a desperation pass as time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to play perfectly and I made too many mistakes,''  
Young said. ``Once Garrison and Terry were hurt, we had to throw. 
We loaded up and tried to get it done that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to take some chances, which I did. Some of them,  
I got away with. You just tried to minimize the risks the best you 
can. You just hoped to make more plays, but in the end we were one 
or two plays short.''

<HEADLINE> Denver Tramples Dolphins' Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Miami Dolphins came into the game riddled by  
injuries. Then they were riddled by Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after being named the NFL's most valuable player  
Saturday, Davis shredded the Dolphins' depleted front four for 199 
yards rushing and two touchdowns to lead the Denver Broncos to a 
38-3 victory in the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a stunning collapse by a Miami defense that allowed the  
fewest points in the league during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you come this far and get beat this bad, it's  
embarrassing,'' defensive lineman Shane Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro Bowl tackle Tim Bowens and end Jason Taylor missed the game  
with injuries, and their absences were clearly felt. Both played in 
Miami's 31-21 victory over Denver last month, when the Dolphins 
limited Davis to a season-low 29 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He surpassed that total on the Broncos' first possession  
Saturday. By the second quarter he reached the 100-yard mark -- just 
the second player to achieve the milestone against Miami this 
season. And he kept running after that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins couldn't stop Davis, and they barely slowed him  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was injuries,'' cornerback Sam Madison said. ``If we'd had  
people healthy, it would have been another hard-fought game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran over people all year, but I never thought he'd have  
that many yards on us,'' All-Pro middle linebacker Zach Thomas 
said. ``They dominated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver rushed for 250 yards, the first time a Miami opponent  
topped 200 this season. The Dolphins gave up three rushing 
touchdowns after allowing just six during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denver blocked us as well as anybody has all year,'' Miami  
coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``We didn't get any charge or push.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't stop them,'' Burton said. ``They were flying  
around, whooping and hollering and patting everyone on the back. 
They got after us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis repeatedly hurt Miami with cutbacks, most notably on a  
dazzling 20-yard touchdown run when he juked past Calvin Jackson 
and Sam Madison, sending them sprawling as he danced into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many other times, there was no one in Davis' way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our backside pursuit hurt us,'' linebacker Derrick Rodgers  
said. ``They did a good job of walling everybody in and making us 
pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos' first three possessions resulted in touchdown  
drives of 92, 66 and 87 yards. By then the score was 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you can't control the line of scrimmage,'' cornerback  
Terrell Buckley said with a sigh, ``you're in for a long day,''
