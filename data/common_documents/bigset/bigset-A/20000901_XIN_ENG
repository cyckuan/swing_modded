DHAKA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 42 fishermen were still
missing and feared dead as seven fishing boats sank in the bay on
Wednesday following rain storm and high tide in the Bay of Bengal,
official sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kabir Ahmed Sowdagar, president of the Cox's Bazar Fishing
Boat Owners Association told newsmen that seven boats sank on
Wednesday in the Bay near Cox's Bazar, about 420 kilometers
southeast of Dhaka, and several other boats could not still return
from the sea.

"Twenty-two fishermen of seven boats were still missing. There
were 20 more fishermen in the boats that were in the deep sea,"
said Kabir.

<P>
One boy was killed, two people were injured in a mud slide and
more than 15,000 were evacuated after an unusually high tide and
rain battered Islands and coastal areas, Disaster Management

<P>
The tidal surge swept a seven-year-old boy away in Cox's Bazar
district, where officials said about 100,000 people were marooned.

More than 15,000 people were evacuated from their flooded homes
in Sandwip Island.

<HEADLINE> FIDE Tries to Gain Olympic Berth for Chess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Chess
Federation (FIDE) will hold two high-profile exhibition matches
during the Sydney Games in a bid to show that the sport deserves
to enter the Olympic family.
</P>
<P>
Those two matches, which will be held at the Olympic Athletes
Village in Sydney, "are aimed to speed up the process of chess
being incorporated into the Olympic Games," FIDE President Kirsan
Ilyumzhinov told the Xinhua here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ilyumzhinov said the first match will feature a cross-sex
battle between men's world champion Alexander Khalifman and women'
s world champion Xie Jun, who will take the showdown through the
Internet, while the second will be played between world number
three Viswanathan Anand of India and world number four Alexei
Shirov.
</P>
<P>
The FIDE president, who came to China for the opening ceremony
of the first chess World Cup, said the dispute about the chess's
status as a sport has been the biggest hurdle for the sport to
enter the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
But Ilyumzhinov was confident that chess will grow into a sport
with the biggest number of population as playing chess on the
Internet is becoming a fashion.
</P>
<P>
"More than 700 million people can play chess in the world. Now
more and more people are playing chess on the Internet, which will
redouble the number of the chess players.
</P>
<P>
"You can play chess on the Internet but you can not do the same
thing with basketball and football," joked the president.

<HEADLINE> October 23 Sets as Deadline for Bids to Host WADA Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- The newly-established World Anti-
Doping Agency (WADA) has set October 23 as the deadline for the
return of the bids so the body could select the site in time to
start its operations January 2002, WADA said in a press release
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Until that time, WADA will continue working out of its
temporary offices in the Lausanne-based International Olympic
Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
Following the site selection procedure determined earlier this
year, WADA distributed the bidding documents related to hosting
its headquarters to all National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and
their related sports ministries on August 29.
</P>
<P>
The NOCs and sports ministries have until October 23 to submit
their bids to host WADA's permanent headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WADA said that it signed agreements last week with
the last two International Olympic Summer Sports Federations (IFs)
that had yet to sign, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG)
and the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB). This means
WADA is now conducting doping controls in all 28 Olympic Summer
sports prior to the opening of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
WADA is on schedule to conduct more than 2,000 unannounced, out-
of-competition doping control tests before the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"The International Olympic Summer Sports Federations should be
congratulated for doing whatever necessary in such a short time to
clear the way for an additional, external testing program," WADA
Chairman Richard W. Pound said. "They all did so, despite the
difficulties of amending their own policies, to enhance their anti-
doping commitments and to support the clean athletes in their
sports."
</P>
<P>
"WADA and the Summer IFs have broken new ground to lay a solid
foundation for an intensified fight against doping in sport. The
continued cooperation between the Olympic Movement and the public
authorities will prove to be a formidable force on the side of the
clean, ethical athlete," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government to Reconsider Position on Embargo Against North If Peace Talks Make Headway: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will
consider changing its position on the embargo against the breakaway
northern area of the island if the peace talks make headway and a
final Cyprus solution emerges, government spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Michalis Papapetrou said
the
economic embargo against the illegal Turkish Cypriot regime has an
international dimension as international organizations do not
accept certificates of export issued by the northern regime.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman's comments came after Turkish Cypriot businessmen
asked Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to lift restrictions on
imports and exports from the north.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has declared all ports in northern Cyprus
as illegal ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus unilaterally declared in
1983 a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara, against the
internationally acknowledged Republic of Cyprus dominated by the
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot under any circumstances and does not
intend to change its position on this matter as this would be
tantamount to recognition, albeit indirect or direct, of the self-
styled Turkish Cypriot regime," Papapetrou said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would only consent to reconsider its
position "if the peace talks move ahead in a substantive manner and
we see a solution emerging on the basis of U.N. decisions,
providing for a bicommunal, bizonal federation."
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides and a fourth round is
scheduled to start on September 12 in New York, aiming at paving
the way for substantive negotiations leading to a comprehensive
settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We would wish to see the Turkish Cypriots cooperate for a
solution
and then and only then we could reconsider our position,"
Papapetrou stressed, noting that as long as Turkey continues to
occupy part of Cyprus and moves outside U.N. decisions, there is no
chance for the government to change its policy.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM to Attend U.N. Millennium Summit in Place of Mubarak </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa will lead his country's delegation to the United Nations
millennium summit in New York, Egypt's official Middle East News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who will be in place of President Hosni Mubarak, will

</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister will deliver a speech to the
summit, which will focus on Egypt's vision of the 21st century and
the role that the U.N. can play in the new era, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Due to busy schedules at home, the Egyptian president has
canceled a plan to take part in the millennium summit along with
leaders of more than 100 countries, reports have said.
</P>

Moussa is also expected to address the U.N. General Assembly on

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Starts New York Journey for Millennium summit, Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said Friday that many moves have been made in view of the
fourth round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on the Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at south coast Larnaca airport, on his departure for
New York to attend the U.N. millennium summit and the fourth round
of proximity talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Clerides
said, "We do not know what the result of these moves will be."
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the other side remained intransigent, then
further
action would be decided by the National Council, advisory body to
the president, comprising parliamentary parties.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after an abortive coup
in Nicosia seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Three rounds of proximity talks, separate meetings of the U.N.
with President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,
have been held in an effort to pave the way for substantive
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus, but
failed to make any headway.
</P>
<P>
A fourth round is scheduled to start on September 12 in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fourth round of talks, Clerides said it is
difficult to speak about prospects, adding that "if the Turkish
Cypriot side maintains the same tactics, then this dialogue will
have no result."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Denktash insists on his bid for recognition
of his pseudo-state in northern Cyprus, before he enters
negotiations to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, Clerides will stop over in London and
will proceed to new York on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He is due to meet Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis on
September 8 to discuss the strategy at the Cyprus talks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the Americans in particular want to see
progress in the fourth round of the talks before the U.S.
presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Main Opposition Party Elects New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Renowned jurist Noeman Gomma was
elected on Friday as president of the New Wafd Party, Egypt's main
opposition party, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Gomma, who has been the party's first vice president since the
early 1990s, succeeds Fouad Seragedin, a long-time leader who died
on August 9.
</P>
<P>
He was backed by 500 of the 843 members of the party general
assembly, with Seragedin's grandson, Fouad Badrawi, assistant
secretary general of the party, taking the second place with 129
votes to lead two other candidates, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Gomma joined the party in 1952 and was a member of its committee
at the University of Cairo's law faculty, of which he eventually
became dean and from which he retired six years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly column in the party's newspaper, Al-Wafd, Gomma is a
frequent critic of the government.
</P>
<P>
The original Wafd party, in power from 1919 to 1952, led the
revolt against the British protectorate in Egypt. Along with all
other parties, it was banned after the revolution that overthrew
the monarchy in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Under the name New Wafd, the party re-emerged in 1978 when the
late president, Anwar Sadat, reinstated multi-party politics. Only
four months later, the party withdrew from active politics to
protest measures Sadat imposed which it considered undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
The party returned once again to the political scene in 1984.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak named outgoing
Deputy Chief of General Staff Uzi Dayan as new head of National
Security Council, or Israel's diplomatic planning unit, late
Thursday night.

<P>
Local analysts said that the move boosted Dayan's chances to be
chosen as successor of the current Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz, who is scheduled to step down
next July, Israel's Jerusalem Post and Ha'aretz daily both
reportedFriday.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Friday that
he did not know any evidence of imminent missiles attacks from
Iraq, but Israel is always ready for the possibility.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a U.S. Army Patriot anti-missile
battery in Germany was on alert for possible raid against Israel,
because Iraq, as the U.S. officials said, wanted to launch attacks
against the Jewish state during the political vacuum in Washington
in the next few weeks for presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak, quoted by Israel Radio, said during a tour to
schools in central Israel, "I am not sure any more that we must
truly be worried and I don't know whether this Patriot battery must
truly be worried." (Israel-Iraq-Potential Attack)

<HEADLINE> Congo Still Rejects Former Botswanan President as Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC) Friday reaffirmed its refusal to take former
Botswanan President Ketumile Masire as mediator for the inter-
Congolese political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Masire is incompetent. He doesn't understand the history of
the DRC," Ambassador of the DRC to Tanzania Theodore Mugalu said
at a news conference here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugalu said language barrier is another reason that the country
refuses Masire as facilitator in the negotiations aimed at
restoring peace in Africa's third largest country.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Masire of being biased, saying that "he had
shown clearly that he was favoring Tutsis in Rwanda and he was a
member of the genocide committee. That's why we didn't accept him.
"
</P>
<P>
Masire is not the only wise man in the world to mediate in the
DRC political negotiations, said Mugalu, adding: "Since we don't
accept Masire, the only option will be to pick another facilitator.
"
</P>
<P>
During the recent second summit on the DRC held in Namibia,
heads of states from the Southern African Development Community
and Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organization of
African Unity, had pleaded with DRC President Laurent Kabila to
accept Masire as the facilitator of the inter-Congolese political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the DRC broke out in August 1998 when rebels,
backed by Rwanda and Uganda, accused Kabila of corruption and
harboring Hutu militiamen who fled Rwanda after committing
genocide there in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Port Tries Best to Become Regional Port Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DJIBOUTI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The port of Djibouti, built
in the early 1950s, is on its way to become a port giant in the
Horn of Africa after privatization, Luc Deruyver, director general
of the port said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The port of Djibouti, the biggest of its kind in the region,
has become a branch of the Dubai International Port of the United
Arab Emirates," Deruyver told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Instead of remaining an enterprise under the administration of
the Djibouti government, the Port of Djibouti is striving to meet
its commercial target, he said, adding that six senior staff
members from the Port of Dubai will involve in the management of
the Djibouti port.
</P>
<P>
According to the director general, the port aims to competing
against the Port of Sudan and the Mombassa Port of Kenya, both of
which are international class ports in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The government of Djibouti signed early this year a contract
with the Port of Dubai authority to invite the latter to implement
commercial management over the Port of Djibouti in a bid to
promote the capacity of the port.
</P>
<P>
The contract, effective as of June 1, 2000, will last for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
To expand the handling capacity, the government of Djibouti
imported from China two 50-ton gantry cranes at a cost of 15
million U.S. dollars early this year.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Djibouti, which was constructed by the French as a
base of military supply in early years, has become an important
outlet of Ethiopia, which became a land-locked country when its
northern state of Eritrea declared independence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Djibouti became the sole outlet of Ethiopia's
import and export goods when a two-year-old border conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's cargoes currently account for more than 70 percent
of the total cargoes that the port handles, said Saad Omar Guelleh,
technical manager of the port.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Quits Regional Economic Bloc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's membership in
the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) ceased
Friday, according to a foreign ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Chokalla, director of Information, Policy and Planning
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,
said that the move followed the maturity of the government's one-
year notice of intention to pull out of the regional economic bloc,
which was tabled in Lusaka, Zambia one year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Chokalla said, although Tanzania ceased to be a member
of COMESA, it would honor all its pending obligations including
payments of annual contributions which were in arrears.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the government decided to pull out of the group
following a study conducted to find out how much Tanzania
benefited from COMESA.
</P>
<P>
Iddi Simba, minister for Industries and Trade, said early that
Tanzania decided to quit COMESA purely on economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
He said the aims of COMESA are similar to those of the East
African Community (EAC) and Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC), which Tanzania enjoys membership, therefore it is
uneconomical for its government to pay annual fees totaling tens
of millions of Tanzanian shillings.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had not benefited from the COMESA trade arrangements
with other member states whose economies were stronger, explained
Simba, adding that Tanzania's exports to COMESA member states had
been considerably low over the years.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, which was formed in 1994 to replace the Preferential
Trade Area (PTA), together with the EAC and SADC, all aim at
strengthening the market and economic cooperation in the eastern
and southern Africa region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expected to Grant Visa to Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
expected to grant visa to Cuban President Fidel Castro to attend
the U.N. Millennium Summit next week in New York, State Department
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The State Department earlier confirmed that they received a
visa application for Castro, who would make a speech at the U.N.
Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
The State Department officials said it is "a matter of process,
" not a matter of decision, to grant the visa to Castro, who would
make his first trip to the United States since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement between the United States and the United
Nations, Washington must grant visas to foreign officials wanting
to attend U.N. events unless their presence would "prejudice" U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the United States would comply with its
commitments "under the host nation agreement."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States refused to issue visas to Cuba's
National Assembly Speaker Ricardo Alarcon and Foreign Minister
Felipe Perez Roque and an unspecified number of other Cuban
officials to attend an international conference of lawmakers in
New York, which Washington argued was not a part of the U.N. event.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Signs Decree to Form State Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin Friday signed a decree "On the Russian State Council" to
improve the coordination between the central authorities and
territorial leaders and to strengthen the Kremlin's control over
federal districts.
</P>
<P>
The decree, coming into force on the day of signing, provides
for setting up the Russian State Council and adopts the
regulations for its activity, said the Russian presidential press
service.
</P>
<P>
The council's regulations affirmed by the decree stipulate that
the new State Council is to be chaired by the president of the
Russian Federation and will consist of the territorial leaders of
the Russian Federation, who will work there without pay.
</P>
<P>
For the speedy solution of current issues, the State Council
will form a presidium of seven members appointed by the president,
who are subject to rotation twice a year. The presidium will meet
as the need arises, but as a rule at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the State Council will appoint the time and
place of meetings, as well as of the presidium. In addition, he
will chair the meetings and set the plans for its work and the
agenda for the next meeting upon consultations with the members of
the presidium. He will give certain assignments to the members of
the State Council and its secretary.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, the president will appoint a
deputy head within his presidential administration as the
secretary of the council, working without pay. The secretary, who
is not one of the members of the State Council, will prepare the
plans for work, the agenda, the materials for the sessions, and
draft resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Putin signed another decree to appoint deputy
chief of the presidential staff Alexander Abramov as acting
secretary of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The council members will offer the presidium proposals on its
work, agenda, and the order of discussions. They will take part in
preparing the materials for the sessions or the draft resolutions.
They have no right to delegate their powers to other persons.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council is a consultative body assisting the
president to provide the smooth functioning of and interaction
between the state powers," says the decree.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of the State Council are defined as the above-
mentioned assistance and "the discussion of particularly important
problems concerning relations between federal and regional
administrations, the state structure, the bases of federalism, and
proposals made to Russia's president," it reads.
</P>
<P>
The State Council will also consider, at the president's
discretion, the drafts of federal laws and presidential decrees of
general interest to the state and discuss basic personnel
appointments and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
The council will hold meetings in the Kremlin regularly, once
every three months as a rule. Special meetings may be called by
the president. Meetings will be valid with a simple majority of
members present.
</P>
<P>
The State Council will be an executive power body, performing
consultative functions, Putin told the press Thursday, while
visiting the Samara region.
</P>
<P>
The decree was initiated by governor of the Saratov region
Dmitri Ayatskov and supported by Russia's regional leaders and
State Duma (the lower house of parliament) deputies in May, after
the president submitted a draft bill on the new principles for the
formation of the Federation Council, the upper house, to the State
Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, representatives of Russia's regional leaders
rather than the leaders themselves will work in the Federation
Council on a permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
The initiators of the decree urged regional leaders not to be
completely deprived of involvement in the country's political life
at the federal level, proposing to set up the State Council, a
presidential consultative body comprising the regional leaders.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, Putin supported this proposal, pinning the
foundation of the council to the adoption of a package of bills on
reforming the state power.
</P>
<P>
In late July, Putin signed a directive approving of the
proposals made by top-ranking officials from Russia's regions on
establishing the State Council. The president recommended the
chambers of the Federal Assembly to submit their proposals on the
council's status and composition.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Putin noted that the State Council should not be a
substitution for the Federation Council, which currently has
numerous functions of a non-legislative nature that the State
Council could take on and "run efficiently."

<HEADLINE> S. American Summit Calls for Peaceful Solution of the Malvinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The South American Presidents
Summit, which was inaugurated Thursday and ended Friday in this
capital, criticized the colonial situation of the Malvinas Islands,
and called for a peaceful and lasting solution to the dispute
between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
A statement published this noon said that the presidents
attending the meeting have ascertained that the colonial situation
of the Malvinas islands still subsists in the southern Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
The persistence of this situation, according to the document, "
is incompatible" with the ideals of peace, security, and
cooperation in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting of the presidents agrees with the need that the
two parts should resume negotiations aimed at finding as soon as
possible a peaceful and lasting solution to this dispute over the
sovereignty of the islands in agreement with the United Nations
and the Organization of American States resolutions," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Fernando de la Rua had said earlier in the
day that his counterparts from around the continent would likely
voice the unanimous support.
</P>
<P>
Britain has occupied the South Atlantic archipelago off the
Argentine coast since 1833. Buenos Aires and London have since
disputed sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, which are known in
Argentina as the Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a brief but bloody 74-day conflict between Argentina
and Britain took place in the island.
</P>
<P>
On July 11, the U.N. Decolonization Committee adopted a
consensus resolution calling for the opening of negotiations
between Britain and Argentina on the disputed sovereignty issue.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Brief Arab FMs on Palestinian-Israeli Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is due to brief Arab foreign ministers Sunday on the latest
developments of the peace talks with Israel, a senior Arab League
(AL) official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who will deliver a speech to a meeting of the AL Foreign
Ministers Council in Cairo Sunday, is also to keep the Arab
officials posted on the outcome of his recent world tour, Saed
Kamal, AL assistant secretary general, said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has visited more than 20 countries in a bid to win
support for the Palestinian stance on the Mideast peace process
since July 25 when the U.S.-sponsored Palestinian-Israeli Camp
David summit failed to reach a final peace deal due to disputes
over the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader will consult with the ministers and
permanent delegates to the pan-Arab forum on ways of pushing the
Mideast peace talks forward, Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their
future independent state under the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 242 which rules that this sector of the holy city is
part of the Arab territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
War and must be returned. Arab countries support the Palestinian
demand.

<HEADLINE> Russia Positive on Clinton's Decision to Delay Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Friday
described as "constructive" U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision
to leave the issue of whether to deploy a national missile defense
system to the next administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, whose term in office expires in January next year,
announced Friday in a speech at Georgetown University that he is
letting his successor finally decide whether to deploy a national
missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statement shows "constructive elements in the U.S.
administration's activity." "There is hope that a balanced
approach to the solution of salient international problems, above
all those concerning global security, will prevail," Col. Gen.
Leonid Ivashov, chief of the Russian Defense Ministry's
international military cooperation department, said here late
Friday
</P>
<P>
"I believe Russian-U.S. consultations on the U.S. national Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system issue will continue with U.
S. future administration at all levels," Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's outstanding Academician Georgy Arbatov, honorary
director of Russia's Institute of the U.S. and Canada, told press
that Clinton's statement testifies to the common sense of the
outgoing U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "could hardly make a bolder decision, given the looming
elections," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The very fact that the U.S. president decided to be explicit
rather than keep a low profile before the upcoming presidential
elections indicates that quite strong and influential circles in
America are aware of how dangerous it is to deploy a national
missile umbrella, Arbatov said.
</P>
<P>
An ABM defense system will lead to a new spiral in the arms
race, and "ultimately bury all hopes of those living on the planet
for a safer world," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statement "will undoubtedly have some influence on
the new administration when it deals with the ABM issue," Arbatov
noted.

UNITED NATIONS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming Millennium
Summit is expected to be the biggest gathering of heads of state

</P>
<P>
A total of 152 heads of state or government and over two dozen

<P>
The Millennium Summit will address a host of issues under the
official theme "The United Nations in the 21st Century." Among the

<HEADLINE> Somalia's New President Visits Baidoa Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's newly elected
president Abdiqasim Salad Hassan visited southern Somali town of
Baidoa on Friday after spending two days in the capital Mogadishu
on a tour aimed at showing the international community that the
new government could operate inside Somalia even though it was
established in neighboring Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The president and his delegation including over 90 members of
the transitional parliament flew on three small planes from
Issaley airport of north Mogadishu and were received warm welcome
at the Baidoa airport by tens of thousands of cheering people
waving the Somali and Djibouti flags and green leaves and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of battle wagons with hundreds of heavily armed
militiamen escorted the delegation from the airport to the soccer
stadium where tens of thousands of people had been waiting since
early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was greeted with the national anthem and
other patriotic songs by a local band, conveyed his deepest and
heartfelt condolences to the families of those who died or got
disabled during the civil war, and asked the Somalis to forgive
each other and put the past behind.
</P>
<P>
The president also told the rally that the reconstruction of
the country would be given a priority by his administration.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Mohamed Nur Shargudud, chairman of the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA), and Abdulla Dero Issak, speaker of the
transitional national assembly and secretary-general of the RRA
also addressed the jubilant people under the fierce sun.
</P>
<P>
The RRA-controlled Baidoa was designated as the temporary
capital of the new Somali government until the tension eased in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The delegation canceled a trip to the central town of Beletuein
for time constraints and returned to Djibouti Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The new president went home three days after he was sworn in
last Sunday (August 27) in the small Djibouti town of Arta where
the Somali peace conference elected the country's first parliament
and head of state since Somali president Mohamed Siyad Barre was
overthrown in 1991, leading to a decade of anarchy and separatist
rule of warlords.

<HEADLINE> DRC Calls for Amendment of Lusaka Peace Accord  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said this at a graduation ceremony for 35 participants from
all Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries who
had completed a three-week United Nations staff officers course
conducted by the Regional Peacekeeping Training Centre in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Karubi said his government was of the opinion that despite
having been credited for stopping fighting on all fronts, many
clauses of the Lusaka accord have become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said,"The Lusaka cease-fire agreement itself has
provisions that allow for its amendment."
</P>
<P>
It is time all parties to the agreement realize that in its
present form, the accord has lost steam and for the sake of
durable peace let us go back to the drawing board and amend it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
That way, he said, all parties would come up with a text that
would allow peacekeepers to be deployed in the DRC soon.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday this week DRC Foreign Minister Yerodia Abdoulaye
Ndombasi said the Lusaka accord should be reviewed so that they
specifically name Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi as the aggressors in
the two-year conflict in this vast African country.
</P>
<P>

in Harare. End item

<HEADLINE> The Demon of Racism Still Lurks in South Africa: UN Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Racist laws have been
scrapped but the demon of racism still lurks in South Africa and
racially-motivated acts of violence are still apparent, UN human
rights official Nozipho January-Bardill said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"While racism has been removed from the statute books and new
laws are being passed through Parliament to protect us all from
discrimination-- racially motivated crimes still continue,"
January-Bardill told delegates at the on-going national conference
on racism held in Sandton, Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"Acts of racial murders still continue ... black farm workers
and white farmers appear to be the most vulnerable," said January-
Bardill, who serves on the United Nations Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The South African-born official said although violence should
not be condoned, it should be seen in its socio-economic context.
</P>
<P>
As to racially motivated acts in schools, January-Bardill said,
different types of punishment meted to black and white children at
schools for misconduct clearly indicated who was valued and who
was not.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that if racism was to be overcome at schools and
on farms, social justice, democracy and economic power were the
key factors needed to be examined.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Launches Project for Agricultural Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ngulube said this could only be achieved if the role of farmer
cooperatives in the production process is fully supported by both
the government and other stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official Launch of the project to support
farmer associations, Ngulube said the government places strong
emphasis on the need to promote appropriate and effective farmer
cooperatives, which would serve the interests of the members.
</P>
<P>
Ngulube further said farmer cooperatives are not only important
in agricultural marketing but are also important for food security
and livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He said the initial focus of the project will be promotion of
the outgrower schemes in cash crops such as sunflower, parika,
soybeans, guar, kenaf, sourghum, pigeon peas and maize.
</P>
<P>
However, applications from cooperatives involved in other crops
will be considered in line with the ministry's policy of crop
diversification provided they are within the project framework.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that outgrower schemes have a very high
potential to increase farmer incomes and food security as they
connect farmers to lending institutions, input suppliers and
produce buyers, he added.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Sets September as National Malaria Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Department of Health Friday reminded the public that September --
the beginning of the malaria transmission season -- is National
Malaria Awareness month.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that the theme of the
campaign, which is the first of its kind, is "Malaria can be
prevented -- use a bed net".
</P>
<P>
The statement said that a study conducted by the Medical
Research Council (MRC) showed that bed nets could effectively
prevent malaria.
</P>
<P>
"Bed nets usage in the high risk malaria areas will now
complement indoor residual spraying, thus providing more
protection to the individual," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the occurrence of malaria increased by 31
percent in areas where bed nets were not used, while it only rose
by 18 percent in areas where the nets were used.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, bed nets would this year be
introduced in high risk areas such as Mpumalanga, Northern
Province and parts of KwaZulu-Natal.

<HEADLINE> Six EU Members Face Legal Action for Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that it has decided to take six members of the European
Union to the European Court of Justice for non-respect for their
obligations under EU's Major Accident Hazards Directive.
</P>
<P>
The Commission, EU's executive arm, said that Luxembourg,
Ireland and Portugal have not adopted and communicated any
legislation to give effect to the Directive, and Germany, Belgium
and Austria have adopted and communicated incomplete legislation.
</P>
<P>
EU environment commissioner Margot Wallstrom said, "Experience
tells us we need to be pro-active in avoiding major industrial
accidents. I therefore find it disturbing that six member states
are more than a year later in fully adapting their laws to this
important directive, which has pubic safety as its central aim."
</P>
<P>
The relevant directive is aimed at preventing major accidents
involving dangerous substances and limiting their consequences to
man and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for adopting and sending the necessary national
legislation to the Commission was February 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive said in a statement that the decisions in
these cases are a mark of the Commission's determination to fully
establish as soon as possible the common EU framework for
preventing and limiting the consequences of major accidents
involving dangerous substance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves Missile Shield Decision to His Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
decided on Friday not to authorize the deployment of a
controversial national missile defense (NMD) system at present and
thus left a final decision on the issue to his successor.
</P>
<P>
"I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today,
that we have enough confidence in the technology and the
operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward
to deployment," Clinton said in a speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I have decided not to authorize deployment of a
national missile defense at this time," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, whose term will expire on January 20 next year, said
that he has asked Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who is
perhaps the administration's strongest proponent of NMD, to
continue a robust program of development and testing.
</P>
<P>
"That effort still is at an early stage. Only three of the 19
planned intercept tests have been held so far," Clinton said. "We
need more tests, against more challenging targets, and more
simulations, before we can responsibly commit our nation's
resources to deployment."
</P>
<P>
"We should use this time to ensure that NMD, if deployed, would
actually enhance our overall national security," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
"I have reached this decision about not deploying the NMD after
careful deliberation," he said, adding that his decision will not
have a significant impact on the date the overall system could be
deployed in the next administration if the next president decides
to go forward.
</P>
<P>
According to experts' judgment, he said, if the next president
decides to move forward next year, the system still could be ready
or operational in 2006 or 2007.
</P>
<P>
The proposed NMD, projected to cost about 60 billion U.S.
dollars, is designed to protect all U.S. states against attack by
a limited number of long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The move, which violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
signed by the former Soviet Union and the United States in 1972
and poses serious threats to global arms reduction efforts, is
widely opposed both at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Barak Not Sure About Deal on Jerusalem Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak Friday admitted that he did not know at this time whether he
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat could break the deadlock on
the fate of Jerusalem for reaching a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Since the Camp David summit between Barak, Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton collapsed last month, it became more and
more clear that the thorniest issue between the two sides is the
status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims the holy city as its "eternal and undivided
capital", while the Palestinians hope at least East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, will be capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of pro-peace lobbyists' movements in Tel
Aviv, Barak stressed that if a deal is finally reached, he is sure
that the city of Jerusalem will be larger and stronger then ever,
with clear Jewish majority, united Israeli sovereignty and
worldwide recognition as the capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Barak might be referring to the plan he reportedly proposed at
the Camp David talks, in which Israel will transfer some Arab
villages in East Jerusalem and on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the
Palestinians, while Israel will annex some big settlements into the
Jerusalem municipality. The Palestinians rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
another ardent Mideast mediator, had raised some ideas for
resolving the Jerusalem problem, the key for finally ending the
Israeli-Palestinian conflicts.
</P>
<P>
But there are no signs that any proposals had been accepted by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat will both traveled to New York next week to
attend the United Nations' Millenium Summit, on the sidelines of
which they will meet separately with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Barak warned Friday that if it became apparent that Israel could
not found partnership in the negotiations with the Palestinians,
the outcome "will not be simple."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians will face "real tragedy" and the Israelis will
face some serious tests, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are scheduled to declare an independent state
on September 13, but it is now widely believed that they will
postpone the date at least to November.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli officials also claimed that the two sides should
reach an accord by Jewish New Year, or before September 30.
Otherwise, they said, there will never be a deal.
</P>
<P>
In case that the Palestinians unilaterally declare statehood
without an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, some Israeli legislators
had proposed that Israel should annex its occupied lands in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, and block entry of Palestinian workers
and stop trade, which will surely choke the frail Palestinian
economy.
</P>
<P>
On the other sides, Israelis also worried that Palestinian
extremists will resort to terrorist attacks against Israeli targets
in such a scenario.
</P>
<P>
Barak said Friday that he still has faith and hope that the
other side will show more openness and flexibility at the moment of
truth.

</P>
<P>
The prime minister will travel to Brazil for an official visit
from September 10 to 12, which will take him to Brazil's capital

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Rises to 4.1 percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. unemployment rate
inched up to 4.1 percent in August as 105,000 jobs were shed
during the month, the largest drop in nine years, the Labor
Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the decline in total employment came from the
departure of 158,000 temporary Census workers and the impact of
striking workers at Verizon, the nation's largest local phone
company and wireless business.
</P>
<P>
The private payrolls actually rose but only by a seasonally
adjusted 17,000 in August. The government said private payrolls
would have risen by 102,000 had it not been for the effects of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
The nation's jobless rate dipped to a 30-year low of 3.9
percent in April, rose to 4.1 percent in May and then edged down
to hold at 4 percent in June and July.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
moderated a bit in August, rising 0.3 percent to 13.80 U.S.
dollars an hour, down from a 0.4 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
In August, the employment picture showed mixed results.
Manufacturing lost 79,000 jobs in August, the biggest drop since
July 1998, and more than offsetting a large increase the month
before.
</P>
<P>
Retailers cut 35,000 jobs, following two months of above-
average gains. The decline largely reflected losses at bars and
restaurants. In transportation and public utilities, employment
fell by 64,000 in August as 87,000 workers in the telephone
industry were on strike and thus off company payrolls during the
survey period.
</P>
<P>
Finance, insurance and real-estate jobs grew by 25,000 in
August. Employment in the services industry, which includes an
array of business services, grew by 160,000. Jobs were added in
the social services, engineering and management services fields.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department reported that
construction spending fell 1.6 percent in July, surprising
analysts, who had expected spending to increase by 0.3 percent. It
marked the fourth monthly decline in a row, something that hasn't
happened since October 1990-January 1991.

<HEADLINE> Governments Committed Safer, Cleaner, Cheaper Automobiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- An agreement between
governments world-wide committing themselves to harmonize and
improve at global level the safety and environmental performance
of automobiles and other road vehicles formally entered into force
on August 25, 2000, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (UN/ECE) announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the signatories of the agreement are the most important
vehicle manufacturing countries, including the United States,
Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Canada and Russia, as
well as the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of South Africa and Spain have also signed the
agreement although not yet ratified it, and many other countries
are undertaking the necessary legal procedures for acceding to the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Concluded in 1998 after three years of intense negotiations,
this new global agreement provides the framework for the
development of globally agreed vehicle regulations which will
establish the safety, environmental, energy efficiency and anti-
theft performance criteria and limits to which newly manufactured
vehicles throughout the world, their equipment and parts, will
have to comply.
</P>
<P>
The global regulations will address such vehicle components as
braking, tires, lighting and light-signaling, safety glazing,
windscreen defrosting and demisting. They will address the
commonly agreed performance criteria and limits to be complied
with by these components and also harmonized test methods.
</P>
<P>
Developed in the framework of a UN/ECE working party, this 1998
agreement is expected to lead to safer and more environmentally
friendly vehicles, with higher energy efficiency and better anti-
theft protection as well as with lower manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
The future global regulations will also be developed by the UN/
ECE working party, which since March 2000 has transformed itself
into the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations,
assisted by six Working Parties specialized in the various main
areas.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges More Peace Efforts From Israel, Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday urged Israel and Palestinians to make more peace efforts,
saying the peace process has entered a crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
"We have the feeling that we are near the goal, that we need
still a small effort by both sides in order to arrive at this
peace," said Chirac after a meeting with visiting Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Union will join efforts with the
United States to push the peace process, adding that September is
decisive for arriving at peace between Israel and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Chirac also had a telephone conversation with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, discussing particularly the
problem of the status of Jerusalem, the most thorny issue in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, said spokeswoman of the Elysee
presidential palace, Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the peace talks are at a crucial
moment and everything should be done to remove the last obstacles.
</P>
<P>
"France appeals to the two sides to seize the historic chance,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The French president is due to meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, Barak and other leaders of the Mideast region next
week during the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who arrived here Friday to brief Chirac on the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process, said in an
interview with the weekly magazine Le Figaro that the sovereignty
of Jerusalem is the last obstacle to a peace agreement between
Israel and Palestinians.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Final Report on Concorde Crash in Months: Investigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The chief French investigator
for the crash of Air France Concorde said Friday that no final
report explaining the cause of the crash will be published in
months or even years.
</P>
<P>
Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the Bureau of Accident
Investigation (BEA), told the press that the bureau is still
analyzing the problem about the tire on the undercarriage of the
Concorde which apparently burst when it was taking off.
</P>
<P>
The crash, which took place on July 25 in Gonesse near Paris,
killed all 113 people on board, most of them German tourists.
</P>
<P>
The primary investigation report published by the BEA Thursday
night said that a 43-centimeter metal piece on the runway could
have cut the tire, causing a chain reaction including the outbreak
of a fire on the rear part of the supersonic plane.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the runway was cleaned up twice on the
day of the accident, but a final cleaning up was delayed because
of an exercise of several vehicles of firefighters which ran on
the runway.
</P>
<P>
France and Britain, the only two countries which used Concorde
in civil aviation, have suspended flight of the plane permanently.

the wedding and funeral culture and customs from the Qing Dynasty
in 1998 by holding mass parades on holidays.

<HEADLINE> China Strikes against Pyramid Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the
State Council (GOSC) urged governments at all levels to take
effective measures to crack down on pyramid schemes and other
illicit activities.
</P>
<P>
The requirement was raised in a document transmitted today by
the GOSC. Pyramid schemes have reappeared in various parts of
China recently, causing a great financial loss to many people who
were involved in them and disrupting the country's economic and
social order. Some pyramid scheme networks have developed into
underworld gangs, according to a GOSC document.
</P>
<P>
The document called on the industrial and commercial
administration departments to outlaw pyramid schemes or disguised
pyramid scheme networks. The banks should render an active
coordination.
</P>
<P>
With the approval from industrial and commercial administration
departments at or above the county level, the lower level
departments should notify relevant banks to temporarily suspend
the settlement operation of the networks which engage in pyramid
schemes, it said.
</P>
<P>
The public security departments throughout the country should
enhance the management of the transient population and on houses
for rent.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Economy in Better Shape: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Turkey-desk Chief Carlo Cottarelli said that Turkish
economy "is in obvious recovery" this year after last year's grave
contraction, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli, who arrived in Istanbul on Thursday for the third
regular review of a three-year stand-by deal, said that the rise in
domestic demand of Turkey "is positive", but its consumption
component should be kept under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is implementing the three-year economic stability
program under the four-billion-dollar stand-by deal signed with
the IMF last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year loan package approved by the IMF, Turkey
pledged to reduce its chronic inflation and budget deficits,
undertake a comprehensive privatization program and reform
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's gross national product (GNP) posted a robust 4.4
percent growth in the second quarter of this year, against a 3.2
percent contraction in the same period of last year, according to
the figures published by the State Statistics Bureau on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts agreed that the government would be able to achieve its
GNP and gross domestic product (GDP) growth targets of 5.5 percent
and 6 percent respectively this year.
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli said that the IMF team will inspect possible measures
on monetary and fiscal policies for next year within the framework
of the 2001 budget plans.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the second review, important developments had
occurred in Turkish fiscal position, particularly structural
changes in the economy.
</P>
<P>
While non-interest surplus increased, he said, interest rates
fell and the inflation rate is on a downward trend.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that "the current account deficit should be kept
under close observation. The rise in oil prices and the boom in
demand at home raised imports, and this left its mark on current
accounts. Rising oil prices not only aggravated current accounts
but inflation as well."
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli said that sustainability of current accounts deficit
is of importance to Turkey, although tourism revenues also went up.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimistic about the privatization program in the
country, saying that it is possible that further progress will be
achieved in Turk Telekom sell-off and other privatizations.
</P>
<P>
After completion of the IMF team's talks, the government will
send a second supplementary letter of intent to Washington,
whereupon the IMF board should release the fourth tranche of the 4
billion dollars stand-by loan, around 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chief of Turkish Treasury Selcuk Demiralp said that "our
eight-month performance is strong, in particular regarding the
budget. We expect positive and significant developments for the
remaining four months. The IMF also has similar expectations."
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic performance so far showed that the government
has sticked to the program, despite unexpected external factors
such as higher world oil prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that there will be no large deviation from the
program targets. "The more we approach the program targets, the
more we will publicize the success of the program. There is no need
for an extra measure beyond the program we are implementing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF delegation separated into groups on Thursday and will
start technical studies at the Finance Ministry, State Planning
Organization (DPT), the Treasury and Central Bank of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli said that the third visit of the IMF is important to
see the whole picture in 2000 and to determine the macro-economic
targets of 2001.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Robust Parliaments in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
United Nations Kofi Annan on Friday emphasized role of the
parliamentary process in ensuring good governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Robust parliaments pave the way to peaceful coexistence and
harmony in our societies," Annan said in the message delivered by
Lalla Ben Barka, deputy executive secretary of the UN Economic
Commission for Africa, at the opening ceremony of the Fourth
Africa Governance Forum in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
"Better governance means, among other things, the greater
participation of all citizens in the decisions that affect their
lives," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"There is also a need for more participatory, accountable and
transparent processes of decision-making," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day forum organized by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the Office of Prime Minister of
Uganda, representatives from 16 sub-Saharan African countries will
discuss the contribution of the parliamentary process in
strengthening governance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"UNDP and the Economic Commission for Africa have made
governance a priority issue in the battle for economic recovery
and human development on the continent," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said that good governance can
be achieved through harmony between the branches of government -
the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, avoid conflict between the branches of
government in the knowledge that we all work for the common good
of the population," said Museveni in his address read by Prime
Minister Appolo Nsibambi.
</P>
<P>
The conference provides a platform for Africans, international
organizations and Africa's external development partners to engage
in dialogue on the state of governance on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The third one was held last year in Mali and deliberated on
conflict management and governance. Ghana hosted the second one on
"accountability and transparency in Africa" while the first was
held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, dealing with issues of leadership
building, strengthening parliamentary, judicial and administrative
systems as well as free and responsible press.

<HEADLINE> South African Racism Conference Enters Third Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua)-- South Africans must
be frank about their views on racism if they want to overcome the
problem, South African Human Rights Commissioner Barney Pityana
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the third day of the national conference on racism in
Sandton, Johannesburg, Pityana said: "This is the right place for
South Africans to frankly express their views."
</P>
<P>
"People need to express their feelings as we cannot go forward
if they do not overcome their anger," he said.
</P>
<P>
 Pityana earlier warned political parties not to dominate the
discussions and politicize the conference.
</P>
<P>
"This is the platform for all those views should be aired ---
but it can only take place where there is tolerance and mutual
respect between the participants," he said.
</P>
<P>
Friday is seen as the most important day of the four-day
conference. Discussions will centre around strategies to combat
racism.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which costs 4 million rand (about 2.8 million
U.S. dollar) to mount, has attracted more than 1500 delegates.

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Raise Fuel Price  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua)--South African
motorists will from next Wednesday again have to dig deeper into
their pockets, as the retail petrol price will jump an additional
6 cents (about 0.9 U.S. cent) a litre.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale price of diesel will climb 15 cents (about 2.1 U.
S. cents).a litre, and illuminating paraffin 14 cents (about 2
cents) a litre from September 6, the South African department of
mineral and energy affairs confirmed in a statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A litre of petrol in Gauteng would cost 3.66 rand (about 0.52
U.S. dollar) a litre and 3.55 rand (about 0.51 U.S. dollar) a
litre at the coast.
</P>
<P>
The department blamed the increases on higher average
international fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
The South African rand had also weakened slightly over the
period under review -- July 26 to August 25.
</P>
<P>
The monthly petrol price increases have accelerated in 2000,
with a litre of leaded petrol costing 2.90 rand (about 0.40 dollar
)in Gauteng on the first day of the year, an increase of 76 cents
(about 0.11 dollar) a litre.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise has been attributed to a shortage in global oil
stocks.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Gives Pep Talk for 2008 Olympics Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Believing the 2008 Olympics
bid is a business of the entire city, Beijing called on its 10-
million residents to turn their ardour into action for the "
glorious and lofty " mission on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qingling, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, addressed a mass rally that people
from all walks of life should add a new chapter to Beijing's
modernization drive by "unite their strength and combine their
wisdom" in the Olympic campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Over 10 million beijingers should become the mainstay in the
Olympic bid," said Jia, also a member of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jia rallied all grassroots units to throw themselves into the
bid which will "speed up the pace of infrastructure building,
improve ecological environment and promote local civilization
level".
</P>
<P>
Beijing, together with Paris, Toronto, Osaka and Istanbul, has
been shortlisted by the International Olympic Committee for the
2008 Games bid on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of the intense competition ahead, Jia and other
municipal officials detailed to a 1,000-strong crowd their
expectations: the grassroots units of the communist party and mass
party members are urged to play the leading role in the bid;
neighborhoods and townships administration are expected to develop
better community service.
</P>
<P>
And college students should regard the bid as an opportunity of
honing their skills and opening their horizon; police departments
are responsible for securing a safe environment for living and
working; public service departments should work for the image of
the city.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government leaders also pledged to enhance the
ecological environmental protection and accelerate infrastructure
construction.
</P>
<P>
"We should make use of the Olympic bid as a golden chance to
promote our modernization drive," Jia stressed.

<HEADLINE> United States to Play Hosts to Guatemala in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a 1-1 away tie on July 16, the United States will play
the hosts on Sunday in Washington against Guatemala, with its fans
reportedly to disrupt Guatemala's preparations through their "
project mayhem" to keep the visitors from sleeping Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
While not endorsing the disruptive pranks, the U.S. soccer
federation is not discouraging it either.
</P>
<P>
"This is America. We appreciate that fans have the right to
express their support in many ways," said USSF spokesman Jim
Moorhouse.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coach Bruce Arena doesn't mind, saying "things like this
are done everywhere we go, it's interesting to see if our people
can be at all effective."
</P>
<P>
In the earlier match in July, Guatemala employed gamesmanship
by moving the venue from comfortable Guatemala city to muggy
Mazatenango. Its fans blared music all night to keep the Americans
awake.
</P>
<P>
Now it's paytime time. The American fans are planning to set
off car alarms to disrupt sleep, to order pizzas to be delivered
in the middle of the night and to delay service of the Guatemalans
' chartered bus.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Costa Rica leads the four-team group with two wins
against one loss, followed by the American and Guatemala, both
tied in 1-1-1, and Barbodos tailed with one win against two losses.
</P>
<P>
The Americans still have Costa Rica on October 11 in Columbus,
Ohio, and are away at Barbados on November 15. The top two teams
will advance to the final qualifying round next year.

On Thursday, Agassi became the fourth top seed to lost in the
first two rounds since the Open era began in 1968, when he was
defeated by Clement in the second round 6-3, 6-2 and 6-4 in one
hour and 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to tell you, you've got to give people
credit where credit's due," said Agassi, "Clement made an
adjustment, started playing bigger and I never raised my level."
</P>
<P>
Those close to Agassi said he needs time to sort through his
feelings after he disclosed on Tuesday that his mother and sister
were suffering breast cancers.
</P>
<P>
But Agassi repeatedly rejected suggestions that it might be the
reason he has won only one title at the Australian Open this year.
He pointed instead to the physical woes he's experienced since
playing Davis Cup for the United States against Zimbabwe in Harare.
</P>
<P>
On the feasibility of refraining from competing in the Olympic
Games due to the loss and illness of his loved ones, Agassi said:
"I've learned enough to know not to jump to too many conclusions
too quickly, we'll have to wait and see."

<HEADLINE> AL to Assess Party Position at Grassroots Level for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, who last week said her party Awami League (AL) will
go alone in the next general elections, sent party's student
members to the 64 districts of the country Friday to assess the
party position at the grassroots level beforehand.
</P>
<P>
In the backdrop of the opposition's decision to form electoral
alliance in the next general elections, Prime Minister and AL
chief Hasina assigned some 100 former and present leaders of the
party's student wing for fact-finding Wednesday night and sent
them to all the 64 districts Friday to prepare secret reports on
the party position at the grassroots level, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
Each team will have to visit at least three districts before
returning to the capital by September 6.
</P>
<P>
"We are asked to assess organizational strength and weakness of
the party at the district level, party position before the next
year's parliament elections and intra-party feuds in every
districts," disclosed a former student leader preferring anonymity.
</P>
<P>
When asked about reports of intra-party bickering and resultant
incidents of violence in the recent weeks, the party sources said
that Hasina was well aware of the developments and would issue
appropriate directives to AL leadership at the upper level.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister asked the student leaders to have their
reports ready before September 11, the day she returns from New
York after attending the United Nations Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the prime minister had, however, given no
indication as to whether any action would be taken on the basis of
the survey reports.
</P>
<P>
"Our duty is to report to the party chief about the
troublemakers within the party. She did not give us any idea
whether any actions will follow or not," said one source.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here termed Hasina's move as "pragmatic,"
saying that based on the reports, the Awami League should be able
to fix correct strategy for winning the next national elections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Leave Decision on NMD to Successor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has decided to leave a decision on whether to deploy a national
missile defense (NMD) shield to his successor, agencies reports
quoted officials as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech slated for 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) Friday at
Georgetown University, Clinton will announce that he has decided
against taking steps to begin building an anti-missile radar in
Alaska, which would be the first step in deploying a national
missile shield.
</P>
<P>
The proposed NMD, projected to cost about 60 billion U.S.
dollars, is designed to protect all 50 U.S. states against attack
by a limited number of long-range ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Clinton made his decision after thoroughly
reviewing recommendations from his senior advisers and based his
move on the four criteria laid out for decision: threat, cost,
technical feasibility and its overall impact on national security.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said earlier Friday that
Clinton will talk about national security and his decision on
national missile defense in a speech at Georgetown University. But
he did not specify what decision Clinton will announce.

CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympics is a
prime target for an influenza outbreak, a World Health
Organization (WHO) flu expert warned Friday in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Alan Hampson, of the WHO's Collaborating Center For Influenza,
said the Olympics were being staged around the peak of the flu
season, with three flu strains now circulating in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Hampson said in an interview that crowding provided the ideal
environment for the spread of the flu.
</P>
<P>
And highly-trained athletes at the peak of their preparation
had a lower resistance.
</P>
<P>
"If I was an Olympic athlete, I would have had my flu shots,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hampson said Australia's influenza season peaked between July
and September, but it was uncertain what would happen in Sydney in
the leadup to the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It may vanish and it may increase," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's normally slow
traffic slowed to a dawdle around Olympic Park Friday as security
personnel carried out "Lockdown Day" on the home of the Games.
</P>
<P>
It was the final sweep of the Homebush venue, with security
personnel littering Olympic Park and searching through vehicles in
the venue's biggest clampdown on security yet.
</P>
<P>
Officials reported an incident-free day, with the only problem
a non-related transport issue where buses were forced to detour
along Australia Avenue, a problem that should be fixed by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After last Wednesday's lockdown on the Main Press Centre,
Friday's exercise took on a decidedly larger scale.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers began arriving from early in the morning as police and
the army set up a command post near Dawn Fraser Avenue.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 security personnel were on hand to search for
suspicious objects, parcels and anything that might resemble a
bomb or booby trap.
</P>
<P>
All entrances to Olympic Park were manned by security personnel,
conducting thorough searches on anyone or anything that tried to
enter.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles were stopped and searched from bonnet to boot, while
army personnel also roamed the car parks and grounds searching for
anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
From Friday onwards, only people with appropriate accreditation
will have access to Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state Police Commissioner Peter Ryan said
security forces were now prepared for any terrorist threat.
</P>
<P>
"We've planned, we've trained, we've put all resources in," he
said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to respond to it (terrorism). We have hundreds
of bomb-trained and search-trained people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Any vehicles entering the area will need to be accredited and
will undergo full bomb searches.
</P>
<P>
The stringent security will be maintained until October 1.

WASHINGTON, August 30 (Xinhua) -- Vince Carter scored 29
points as the U.S. Olympic team won its first exhibition game
Thursday night with a 99-70 easy win over Canada in Honolulu, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Canada managed to keep it close for only a few minutes before
the Americans took charge with a 16-0 run for a 27-10 lead,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Carter didn't dunk until 7:30 remained, and when it finally
happened it brought the loudest roar of the night from the crowd
of 7,355 at the University of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen finished with 18 points, Alonzo Mourning had 13 and
Kevin Garnett added 10 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was all thumbs in the first few moments,
committing turnovers on its first two possessions _ both on entry
passes to Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
Canada broke the Americans' press and tied it at 6 on a dunk
by Peter Guarasci, but Allan Houston put the U.S. team ahead for
good on a 3-pointer from the right corner just over 3 1/2 minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
The score was 11-10 before the U.S. team broke the game open
with its 16-0 run, the highlight of which was a fast break ending
with four touch passes and a dunk by Mourning.
</P>
<P>
Garnett provided a light moment five minutes into the second
half when he got down on his knees and crawled up behind Todd
McCullough,ready to pounce if an inbounds pass was thrown him way.
</P>
<P>
Garnett never got to spring his surprise, but he was able to
leap high for an alley-oop dunk less than a minute later to give
the Americans a 62-39 lead.
</P>
<P>
Canada pulled within 15 with 11 1/2 minutes left, but the U.S.
team answered with a 10-0 run including five points from Carter.

TIANJIN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kiev, a retired aircraft
carrier of the former Soviet Union, anchored in Tianjin, will be
converted into a tourist vessel.
</P>
<P>
Kiev served as the second generation flagship of Russian Navy
and retired in 1995. It is the largest retired ship China has ever
imported.
</P>
<P>
The Tianma Ship Dismantle Co., Ltd. of Tianjin bought it for 70

it has attracted droves of visitors since it anchored at the
Tianjin Port on July 2.
</P>
<P>
A local first mate named Yang said, "It is a pity to sell it as
waste steel. When the aircraft carrier is painted after having its
rust removed it will get a new look."

Last year, Turkey exported 200,000 tons for 700 million U.S.

The court ruling came after nongovernmental organizations'
complaints that the starch plant was being constructed on 194 acres
of prime farmland.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the Supreme Planning Board's granting of
permission for the construction of a plant on land described in the

<HEADLINE> Barak Rules Out Imminent Iraqi Missiles Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Friday that he did not know any evidence of imminent
missiles attacks from Iraq, but Israel is always ready for the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a U.S. Army Patriot anti-missile
battery in Germany was on alert for possible raid against Israel,
because Iraq, as the U.S. officials said, wanted to launch attacks
against the Jewish state during the political vacuum in Washington
in the next few weeks for presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak, quoted by Israel Radio, said during a tour to
schools in central Israel, "I am not sure any more that we must
truly be worried and I don't know whether this Patriot battery must
truly be worried."
</P>
<P>
But Israel do get ready for the threats from Iraq, the prime
minister added. "I can promise that we are ready and are following
well all that is happening," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Iraq as a major threat in the region. During the
1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a year
earlier, Iraq launched Scud missiles on Israeli targets but caused
no casualties.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, when the gulf tensions escalated once more due
to Iraq's refusal to cooperate with what it called "unfair" U.N.
weapon inspection, the U.S. deployed Patriots battery again to
Israel. But Iraq fired no missiles at Israel.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Govt Rejects Rebels' Demands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
has rejected the fresh demands of the rebel group known as the
West Side Boys who are still holding seven soldiers in the war-
torn west African country, said a report reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer was quoted
as saying in the capital Freetown that the rebels had made no
demands directly to the government and therefore their demands
made public to the media would not be met.
</P>
<P>
Spencer stressed that the government would not be subjected to
such pressure. He warned the West Side Boys they risked criminal
charges if they continued with their actions.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Cambodia, spokesman for the rebel group, demanded on
Thursday that they wanted a review of the Lome Peace Accord, their
reintegration into the government army as well as the release of
their supporters from jail.
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 soldier, 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, were
captured by the West Side Boys last Friday when they were
patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway. Five British
soldiers were released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia disclosed that the remaining hostages were well
treated and being properly fed and provided with adequate medicine
and shelter, but he said they would not release the captives
unless their new demands were met.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the release of the remaining soldiers were
reportedly under way between the Sierra Leonean government, the
United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the British and the rebels.

<HEADLINE> WFP Cuts Number of Angolan Aid Receivers to 1.1 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
has announced that it can only assure assistance to some 1.1
million war-displaced Angolans until November instead of the
originally planned 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here on Thursday, WFP spokeswoman Maria Flynn said her
organization made the decision mainly due to the diminishing food
stocks and the slow-pace donation. Only 51 percent of the aid
promised by donor countries for the year 2000 had been delivered
by the end of August, as against 42 percent by late May, she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in late June, the Rome-based U.N. aid
agency warned that the relief food would run out at the end of
August unless there were "immediate emergency donations".
</P>
<P>
In September, there exists a call for distributing 16,000 tons
of food products to various Angolan provinces, especially those
located in the central highland, where the residents have seen the
most fierce civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
After 26 years of civil war, there are some 3.7 million
displaced persons around the southwest African country, most of
them being short of food, potable water, medicaments and other
living necessities.
</P>
<P>
WFP assistant director for Africa Tesema Negash and its global
logistics and transports chief David Kaatrud are currently in
Angola for a 10-day visit, with an aim to evaluate the current
humanitarian situation and prepare aid operations for the year
2001.

LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 30,000 war-displaced
people camped in Angola's central province of Kwanza-sul are being
resettled in productive areas, the official news agency Angop
reported here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement is being carried out jointly by the local
municipal authorities of Seles, located in southern Kwanza-sul,
and the charity organization German Agro Action (AAD), the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Seles municipal authorities has decided to supply the
displaced persons with some 5,000 hectares of field for
cultivation, while the German non-governmental organization
provides working tools, domestic utensils, construction materials,
assorted foodstuffs, clothes and other goods.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Joao Baptista of Seles, the resettlement of
the displaced persons in fertile areas with relative security is
aimed to change the fact that the displaced persons rely too much
on charity and donations which have never been sufficient for
their needs.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the military situation around the
country in favor of the government troops, the Angolan government
has begun resettling the large number of war-displaced persons,
with the self-sufficient program as the main means, especially for
those living in the central highland.
</P>
<P>
AAD project director Armando de Almeida said they are planning
to construct two schools, with four rooms each, and a medical post.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Urges Guinea to Curb Liberian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has urged his Guinean counterpart Lansana Conte to tackle
Liberian rebels allegedly based in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Liberian government forces have been fighting rebels in the
north of the country since the rebels allegedly invaded the
country from Guinea about two month ago. Most of the fighting has
taken place in Lofa County bordering Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have a problem with Lansana Conte personally. We can
engage Guinea in dialogue to put a halt to the bust-up. This
government does not have a problem with Guinea," Taylor said on
state radio Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for the Guinean government to take the war in
Lofa seriously so that its territory should not be used," he said.
</P>
<P>
He has accused Guinea of harboring Liberian dissidents bent on
toppling his government, a charge Guinea repeatedly rejects.

<HEADLINE> Asian Athletic Association Elects New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Amateur Athletic
Association held congress here Friday electing Suresh Kalmadi,
president of the Amateur Athletic Federation of India, as its new
president for period 2000-2004.
</P>
<P>
The congress also elected new vice presidents. Sheikh Khalid
bin Thani al-Thani of Qatar retained his post as senior vice
president and Shang Xiutang of China and other four officials were
elected as new vice president.
</P>
<P>
Kalmadi told reporters that he will take measures to popularize
athletics in the region and introduce more competitions in Asia on
the pattern of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF)
Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"Currently our athletes hardly get a high level of competition
with the result that they have to go all the way to compete in
Europe and the U.S., which is financially unaffordable for both --
the federations and the athletes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new president said he plan to tie up with television
companies to broadcast the Asian Athletics Programme throughout
the region and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This will bring in much needed revenue by selling rights and
also act to popularize the sport. But this will only be possible
by increasing the number of competition," he added.
</P>
<P>
Explaining other plans, Kalmadi said he will set up one
coaching center per region which will be sponsored by the AAAA. He
will also initiate special steps for junior programme, development
of coaches and introducing more scientific and medical support to
Asian athletes, and provide financial and technical assistance to
the developing countries in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Kalmadi, former railway minister, now holds the post of
President of the Indian Olympic Association, President of the
South Asia Amateur Athletic Federation and Chairman of the Afro-
Asian Games Organizing Committee. The first Afro-Asian Games is
scheduled to be held in New Delhi, India, in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
"These (Afro-Asian) Games will be a big boost for Afro-Asian
solidarity," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The congress Friday also decided to hold the next Asian Track
and Field Championships in Sri Lanka in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Revised Patent Law Compatible to International Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top intellectual
property official pointed out Friday that the newly-revised patent
law is a milestone in the country's intellectual property process
and compatible to concerned international covenants.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference organized by the State Council
Information Office, Jiang Ying, commissioner of the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said the second revision to
the patent law will introduce a far-reaching influence on China's
scientific and technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee,
China's top legislature, adopted on August 25 the second
amendments to the patent law, which will be effective from July 1,
2001.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised law, the State-owned enterprises will
enjoy the same treatment as other enterprises as far as the rights
and obligations relating to filing and obtaining patents.
</P>
<P>
The law also includes articles that define the service inventor
should be remunerated and awarded, strengthen patent protections,
improve judicial and administrative enforcement, streamline
procedure of patent examinations and grants, and introduce an
impartial and efficient patent examinations system and
administration.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, China has adopted the patent law, which was first
revised in 1992. Up till the end of February 2000, China has
received one million patent applications and set up an effective
mechanism for patent protection.
</P>
<P>
The practice over the last decade proves that patent
legislation has played a great role in safeguarding and promoting
the development of China's Intellectual Property, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> China Implements Revised Air Pollution Prevention Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- China started to implement the
revised Air Pollution Prevention Law today.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, discharging pollutants more than the
state standards violates the law.
</P>
<P>
The law provides important regulations concerning the control
of coal burning, the ban of highly-polluting fuel in heavily-
polluted cities, and promotes the use of clean energy, said Xie
Zhenhua, director of the State Environment Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
He said regulations on the inspection of manufacturing,
repairing and fuel-burning of vehicles, quota management of the
production and import of products which can cause depletion of
ozone layer have also been added to the law.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA will cooperate with local governments to work out a
list of key cities for air pollution prevention and will submit
the list to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
The administration will take the pollution of suspended
particles as one of index for the inspection of environmental
pollution in cities, and will issue the program for the areas of
acid rain and sulfur dioxide control.
</P>
<P>
China's Air Pollution Prevention Law was issued in September of
1987, and was revised for the first time in August of 1995. The
revision of the law this year is aimed to take more effective
measures to control air pollution nationwide.

whole world, but none of them has been completely resolved, Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
China should grasp opportunities to speed up its own
development and constantly push forward its current reform,
opening up and modernization drive, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged to maintain healthy trends in domestic economic
development as they have been gained through much hard work during
the current economic transition in the country.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to study and resolve major problems in
economic development, so as to achieve substantial improvement in
the national's economy.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up National Charity Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Yan Mingfu, president of the
China Charity Federation (CCF), announced here today that the
federation is considering setting up a national charity fund.
</P>
<P>
Yan was speaking at a news conference on the exhibition and
auction of 100 rare ceramics donated by Aixinjueluo Qimeng, a
Manchu descendant of the imperial family of the Qing Dynasty (1644-
1911).
</P>
<P>
The CCF president praised what has been done in Shanghai, where
a "social aid fund" has been established. Poor families whose
members have fallen victims to serious illnesses such as cancer
and leukaemia, can get financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
The CCF could learn from Shanghai's experience and set up a
national fund of the kind to help more people in need of social
aid, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
At today's briefing, CCF officials made public an account on
the use of over 100,000 yuan for a 14-year-old Mongolian boy from
north China.
</P>
<P>
The boy was found to have suffered from uraemia when he was
very young. His mother took him to eight provinces and
municipalities for medical treatment but all the attempts to find
a kidney donor failed.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the mother and the boy went to the CCF for
assistance. With the help of the federation, the local website, "
www.leyou.com", and many institutions and individuals, money was
raised for transplanting a kidney for the boy at the Beijing
Friendship Hospital.

JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Chief of the
Investigation Team Into Human Rights Serious Offense in East Timor,
M.A. Rahman announced here Friday that as many as 19 prospective
suspects were allegedly responsible in the human rights violation
in the Indonesian breakaway province of East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said in a press conference at the attorney general
office, that the names of the prospective suspects are the field
functionaries when the abuse was taking place.
</P>
<P>
However, former Chief of the Indonesian Military (TNI) General
Wiranto was not included in the list of the names.
</P>
<P>
Based on the team's report, the highest ranking officer of the
TNI who was recommended to be declared as suspect was Maj. General
Adam Damiri, a former Commander of the Udayana Military Command
overseeing the former province.
</P>
<P>
While from the civilian, former Governor of East Timor, Abilio
Jose Osario Soares was listed.
</P>
<P>
Rahman added that further investigation will start on September
5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were killed and tens of thousands fled their
homes in East Timor last September when pro-Jakarta militiamen
went on a frenzy of destruction after the people voted on August
30 for independence in a UN-sponsored ballot.

LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice President Atiku
Abubakar has appealed to the ruling party and Nigerians to support
the government in its war against corruption, Nigerian press
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second anniversary of the ruling People's
Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja on Thursday, Abubakar said winning
the war against corruption should be the concern of every Nigerian
as it is central to the country's economic progress.
</P>
<P>
He urged the PDP members and supporters to use the ruling party
as a platform to launch the country to a greater height.
</P>
<P>
Describing disputes in the party inevitable, the vice president
said the party's members must join hands with the grassroots so
that the party will control all the six geo-political zones in the
country during the next general election.
</P>
<P>
The PDP played a vital part in ending military rule in the West
African country last year. But with the establishment of a
civilian government, the party has been ridden with inside
struggles between factions representing different regions and
ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants to Push Ahead on Peace Treaty With Japan: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia will push on to resolve
the territorial problem and to sign a peace treaty with Japan,
Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed on the eve of his first
official visit to Japan, slated for September 3-5.
</P>
<P>
"At the recent top-level meeting in Krasnoyarsk, the sides
agreed to bend the maximum effort to sign a peace treaty by the
year 2000," the Interfax news agency Friday quoted Putin as
telling the Japanese newspaper Asahi in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"We needn't be persuaded about the importance of such a
decision. We will undoubtedly continue talks on the peace treaty,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the unresolved border dispute and the absence of
a peace treaty would become an obstacle to the further advancement
of bilateral relations, Putin said relations between the two
countries "cannot be based only on sorting out old problems."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that it is more productive to view the
territorial problem not as something that separates us but
something that may unite us. There should be no doubts: we
sincerely want to give a new nature of partnership to the
relations with Japan," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"The nature of relations between Russia and Japan is directed
at the distant future. That is why we are earnestly interested in
resolving the problem inherited by our countries from the past,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said his meetings with Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori earlier this year have proved that the
leaders of both states intend to cherish everything positive
achieved in bilateral ties and realize their strategic importance
for the countries.
</P>
<P>
Putin noted that the bilateral relations have grown so strong
in the past few years that "even problems inherited from the past
and not fully resolved so far cannot hinder their successful
development."
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia and Japan "
are entering the new millennium as friendly countries."
</P>
<P>
The approaches of Moscow and Tokyo to international affairs
largely coincide, he said, adding that the foundation for
successful bilateral cooperation, primarily in international
affairs, was created through the trustful dialogue of their
leaders launched in the second half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"Security issues, primarily in Northeast Asia, still remain in
the foreground. The appearance of reassuring tendencies in the
inter-Korean settlement makes this work even more topical," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that Japan understands how closely the processes
of the limitation of strategic offensive armaments and
preservation of strategic stability are connected with the
observation of the 1972 Russian-American Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Putin also recognized the possibilities for intensifying
bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He singled out the joint development of oil and gas fields off
the shore of Sakhalin Island, the projects of the Kovykta gas
condensate field and Yakutia gas field, and the construction of
gas mains from Russia to Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I also find interesting and promising the idea of building a
Russia-Japan power bridge," Putin said, adding that the two sides
are drafting several agreements and documents on trade and
economic cooperation for his Tokyo visit.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that these understandings will permit a significant
step forward in advancing mutually beneficial economic relations
and further promote Russian-Japanese relations as a whole," the
president concluded.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Language Teaching May Be Introduced in Swiss Primary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Pupils at primary schools in
Switzerland should get lessons in at least three languages,
including English, according to a press release by the Swiss
education authorities Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a conference in the Swiss capital of Berne on Thursday, the
education directors of Switzerland's 26 cantons agreed that a
first foreign language should be introduced in the third grade and
courses should be taught in an additional foreign language
beginning in the fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
However, they differed on whether English should be made the
first foreign language and a decision was put off.
</P>
<P>
English as a foreign language has been the subject of debate
for several years. Proponents say English has become the "lingua
franca" of international business and that pupils who cannot speak
the language could be at a disadvantage on the labor market.
</P>
<P>
But opponents, particularly those in French-speaking regions,
argue that the priority should be to ensure that Swiss citizens
can communicate in at least two of the four national languages,
which are German, French, Italian and Romansch.
</P>
<P>
Hans Ulrich Stockling, president of the Conference of Cantonal
Education Directors, said all members agreed that proficiency in a
second national language should remain more important than English
in order to ensure Switzerland's multicultural identity.
</P>
<P>
Stockling pointed out the importance of a coordinated approach
to the language issue between the cantons. He said the conference
could recommend a compromise, if there is no nationwide consensus
by November.
</P>
<P>
Under the Swiss federalist system, the 26 cantons are largely
free to determine their own education policies. Canton Appenzell-
Innerrhoden has introduced English as a first foreign language in
the third grade, replacing French. And in Canton Zurich, trials
are underway to start teaching English at an even earlier stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market
sped up its recent slide this week, plagued by listless sentiment
after the market's attempt to advance had fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai B-share index nosed-dived 8.26 points or 11.36
percent to a one-month low of 64.48 points at the end of the week,
posting its largest weekly decline in more than one year.
</P>
<P>
The five-day turnover contracted to 1.26 billion yuan (152.19
million US dollars), which was 60.36 percent less than the total
of last week.
</P>
<P>
The sudden meltdown, started on August 22, continued to weigh
on the market. Taking no additional positive signs from the latest
earnings season, coming to an end this Thursday, investors were
less confident of the direction, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
For the past couple of days, the market had been deteriorating.
As investors had been in a selling mood, the market incurred a
broad slump, with market breadth decidedly negative. It failed to
materialize a recovery, leaving the index stuck around its lows.
</P>
<P>
The only relief from the past week may be the fact that selling
had been easing with trading volume on the lighter side.
</P>
<P>
Homeway analysts say that it will still be the bear's day in
the week ahead as the market is mostly likely to trade with choppy
and fragile sentiment.

BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share incurred
impressive losses this week, unable to reverse courses from its
latest slump for lack of momentum amid investors' conviction that

</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen B-share index plunged 8.21 points or 6.49 percent

The weekly turnover contracted to 699.91 million HK dollars,
which was 58.36 percent less than the total of last week,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and

</P>

The sudden meltdown, started on August 22, continued to weigh

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Most funds on the securities
investment fund market corrected, as the composite indexes on the
two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen continued to move
downwards on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30 funds, four funds rose, eight funds remained
unchanged, and the rest declined. But in general, the 22
discounted funds moved steadily, basically fluctuating 0.01 yuan
around the price levels of the last close, according to Homeway,
China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
However, restructured funds clearly dropped. Those that fell
more than one percent were all restructured funds. Fund Tongzhi
and Fund Yuhua dropped the most, down 4.4 percent and 3.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 22 funds had long been in the discounted trading, making
their price levels bolstered by performances and intrinsic values.
All interim reports had been released recently, current price
levels of most funds were lower than assets value per fund unit
and face values.
</P>
<P>
But the restructured funds' price levels are usually higher
than their own NAVs and it was easy for them to perform actively
when the market was good. Speculation funds played an important
part in the trading.
</P>
<P>
The fund index on the Shanghai stock market closed at 1,051.73

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sees 4.4 Percent of GNP Growth in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's gross national product
(GNP) posted a robust 4.4 percent growth in the second quarter of
this year, against a 3.2 percent contraction in the same period of
last year, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Based on the provisional figures published by the State
Statistics Bureau on Thursday, analysts agreed that the government
would be able to achieve its GNP and gross domestic product (GDP)
growth targets of 5.5 percent and 6 percent respectively this year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth in the second quarter was 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had predicted a modest growth for the second quarter
due to effects of the base period, which was the strongest last
year.
</P>
<P>
The figures carried Turkey's first half GNP growth to 4.3
percent and GDP growth to 5.7 percent, combined with 4.2 percent
and 5.6 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, foreign trade posted a strong 10.6
percent growth with a 26.3 percent rise of import taxes while
industry grew by a modest 4 percent, still edging up from the first
quarter's 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the agriculture sector was 2.3 percent in the second
quarter, sending the figure of the first six months of this year to
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Import-related activities such as trade, transport and
communications enjoyed a significant growth in the first half of
this year on the back of soaring imports," said Altug Karamenderes,
senior economist of Istanbul-based brokerage house Ata Yatirim.
</P>
<P>
He said that "compared to 1998, which was not an economic
recession year, the impact of trade, transport and communications
on growth is positive, but that of industry and agriculture is
negative."
</P>
<P>
"Assuming 1998 as a base year of 100, GNP is 100.8 in the first
half of this year. That 0.8 percentage point growth above 1998
meant an approximately 5 billion U.S. dollar current account
deficit to Turkey," the economist added.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit of the first five months this year
was seen at 4.5 billion dollars, compared with a 431 million
dollars surplus last year when the economy shrank by a record 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector contracted by 0.4 percent in the first
half of this year, largely because of a regulatory suspension of
activity.
</P>
<P>
Another senior economist Baturalp Candemir said that the figures
were suggesting that the government will achieve its growth target
this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting GNP and GDP growths of around 6-6.5 percent in
the second half of this year, mainly because of weak base year
effects," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's GNP contracted by 7.4 percent and 6.1 percent in the
third and fourth quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is a continued strong demand for durable
consumer goods and services, there is also an increase in
investment spending," Candemir said.
</P>
<P>
"Both the private sector's machinery and equipment investments
and public sector's non-building construction have increased
substantially, which is a good sign," he added.
</P>
<P>
Karamenderes predicted that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will urge Turkey to take measures such as tax and interest
rate increase in order not to compromise the inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is implementing a three-year economic stability programme
under a four-billion-dollar stand-by deal signed with the IMF last
December.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year loan package approved by the IMF, Turkey
pledged to reduce its chronic inflation and budget deficits,
undertake a comprehensive privatization program and reform
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The government aims to reduce inflation to 20 percent in 2000,
10 percent in 2001 and 5.0 percent in 2002. The annual inflation
rate stood at 68.9 percent in January of this year.
</P>
<P>
Candemir also foresaw that the government would introduce fiscal
measures some time in the second half of this year in a bid both to
contain the current account deficit and to contribute to next
year's primary fiscal surplus.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Trial Must go on: Wahid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid Friday indicated that the trial process against
former president Soeharto should go on despite the absence of the
defendant in the first hearing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid made the statement in response some parties which were
worried that Thursday's absence of the former strongman from the
court would hamper the long-waited trial process.
</P>
<P>
"I think the trial should proceed, even if Soeharto fails to
attend it," the president was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
He further said that "Whether the defendant be justified to be
absent or not, that is a problem for the medical team to mull over.
"
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that the problem arose when the medical team
concluded that the defendant could not attend the trial due to a
lapse in his reasoning.
</P>
<P>
"That is the problem for medical team. But the medical
conclusion that the defendant is unable to attend the trial does
not mean that the trial itself should be stopped. The trial must
go on," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto failed to appear before the court on Thursday for
medical reasons. Based on the medical reports issued by Soeharto's
doctor team, the former ruler's health condition was not in a good
shape to attend the trial.
</P>
<P>
Chief of judge of the South Jakarta District Court in charge of
trying Lalu Mariyun then adjourned the trial to mid-September to
hear the reports from Soeharto's doctors on Soeharto, the former
five stars general who ran the country with an iron hand for more
than three decades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wahid also reiterated that should Soeharto be
convicted, he in his capacity as the president of Indonesia, would
pardon the 79-year-old man on the condition that the latter would
return the wealth he stole during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
"That is the absolute condition. The amount (of fortune that
should be returned to the state) will be computed by a team of
experts," Wahid said.

<HEADLINE> Old Bank Notes Out of Circulation in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Angola's bank notes of the old
currency unit Readjusted Kwanza is out of circulation in the
market as from September 1, according to a document issued by the
Angolan National Bank (BNA) here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Holders of the Readjusted Kwanza notes can still have them
exchanged for notes of the new currency unit Kwanza at BNA's
counters in the provinces of Luanda, Cabinda Huila and Benguela,
within a period of five years from now, the BNA document said.
</P>
<P>
The document quoted BNA director Jorge Leao Peres for issuing
and credit as saying that the central bank has already created
mechanisms to avoid possible constraints to the citizens and
monetary policy tools to check financial imbalances.
</P>
<P>
He said when the Readjusted Kwanza started its circulation in
July of 1995, there was a process of reforms and monetary
adjustment to address the high levels of inflation which required
large quantities of bank notes for transaction.
</P>
<P>
In December 1999, the corrosion of the purchasing power of the
currency prompted the need to introduce a new monetary
readjustment to adapt the circulating bills to the volume of
transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"People in the past would talk of billions but in real terms it
represented nothing, and this started creating difficulties to the
accounting process of companies," the BNA official said, noting
that then it became necessary to write off the six zeros from the
old bank notes with a view to suit the currency to the volume of
transactions.
</P>
<P>
As for the new bank notes, which have been circulating for nine
months, Peres said the circulation is positive not only for
facilitating the process of transactions but also for bringing a
good process in bank operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 million Chinese
middle and primary school students went to campus and began their
new terms today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education (MOE) said revised
teaching materials for senior high school students will be pushed
from this term, and experts have already completed the revision of
teaching materials for compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the interests and technology development of students,
new teaching materials and outlines have deleted contents outdated
or exceeded student's capability.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianning, director of elementary education department under
MOE said lacking creative ideas is the main gap between China's
elementary education and that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Teaching materials of most Chinese schools exceed the actual
capability of the students, according to Yang Deren, dean of
chemistry department of Shanghai Normal University.
</P>
<P>
Under the burden of school work, some students lost interest in
studying, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Summer Teaching Material Catalog for Primary and
Middle Schools was published by MOE this year, which deleted 39
volumes of teaching material to lessen the study load.
</P>
<P>
Li hopes that more time will be spent in enlarging student's
knowledge, as well as the ability to develop analytical thinking
and reading.

<HEADLINE> Barak Names New Head of National Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak late Thursday night named outgoing Deputy Chief of General
Staff of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Uzi Dayan new head of National
Security Council, or Israel's diplomatic planning unit.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the appointment reinforced Dayan's
chances to be chosen as successor of the current (IDF) Chief of
General Staff Shaul Mofaz, who is scheduled to step down next July,
both Israel's Jerusalem Post and Ha'aretz dailies reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who also holds the Defense portfolio, said Thursday night
that he does view Dayan as "a candidate" for the chief of general
staff. Mofaz has been reportedly at odds with Dayan. But Thursday's
nomination, analysts claimed, has brought a U-turn in the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Dayan, appointed IDF deputy chief of general staff two years
ago, will assume the new post on September 28, according to Barak's
order.
</P>
<P>
The new post, which was vacated by David Levy in January when he
left for Washington as Israeli ambassador there, will give the 52-
year-old popular general a good chance of help the government in
shaping diplomatic and defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
The council deals with various issues such as arms control,
strategy on Iran, which does not recognize Israel, and preparing
Israel's stance on the question of refugees in peace negotiations
with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Flies to Paris for Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
flew to Paris on Friday for talks with French leaders on ways of
helping advance the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, accompanied by ministers of foreign affairs and
information, is due to hold talks with French President Jacques
Chirac on Friday and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Saturday,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, the key mediator in the Palestinian-Israeli peace
process, is expected to brief French leaders on the consultations
held by parties concerned in an effort to help the Palestinians and
Israel narrow gaps in the final-status negotiations to reach a
balanced agreement.
</P>
<P>
The huge differences between the two sides in the negotiations,
especially over the future of Jerusalem, which both sides want as
their capital, has aborted the Camp David summit, the latest peace
talks brokered by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Since then, Egypt has received Palestinian, Israeli and U.S.
officials almost daily to assess the situation and discuss a way
out. It is reported that Egypt has also produced new ideas about
the peace process, but the contents of the ideas were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's French tour is the continuation of Egypt's diplomatic
efforts to try to press for a breakthrough on the Palestinian-
Israeli track. France is holding the rotating European Union
presidency.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' leaders will also discuss the Syrian-Israeli
peace talks that foundered in January over disputes between the two
sides on where the border should be. The core issue in the Syrian-
Israeli peace talks is the return of the Golan Heights captured by
Israel from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.

<HEADLINE> No U.S. Military Involvement in Hostage Crisis: Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that the United States troops in the Philippines for joint
military exercises will not be allowed to rescue abducted American
Jeffrey Schilling.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre made the remarks in
a radio speech as he said that the government would exhaust all
peaceful means to secure Schilling's safe release.
</P>
<P>
"We will always try the peaceful way for the safe release (of
Schilling). Safety of the hostage is primordial in our minds,"
Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded the United States that its elite troops, who
have been in the country since August 14 for military exercises,
must not meddle in the kidnapping case and must respect the
Philippines' sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"They should respect our sovereignty. And they are also bound
by international rules and United Nations principles of non-
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said President Joseph
Estrada has accepted the recommendation of Cabinet Cluster E,
which is charged with the handling of the ongoing hostage crisis,
to treat the Schilling incident as a police matter.
</P>
<P>
The United States "recognizes this as an internal affair of the
Philippines," Zamora said, adding that it "will not interfere,
even in just planning a rescue operation."
</P>
<P>
Shilling was abducted by the Abu Sayyaf in Zamboanga City on
Monday and then brought to Jolo island, where five of the original
group of 21 hostages kidnapped from Malaysia in April and two
French journalists are still being held captive.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Develop "Technical Textile" Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai textile industry is
developing new products, called technical textile, aimed to
increase business opportunities and competitiveness in the world
market, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of Industry Ministry Manu Liewpairoj was
quoted as saying that the Thai textile industry is applying the so-
called technical textile to the production of variety of products.
</P>
<P>
The technical textile will become a key raw material over the
next five years. It is made from plastic fiber, used to substitute
traditional fiber to help enhance the industry's potential, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Thai textile products made from the technical textile are
targeted to be increased to 10 percent of total production,
doubling from currently five percent, over the next five years, he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Development of Thai Textile Industry would
provide useful advices and guidelines for local manufacturers to
alter their production basis to the technical textile, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mana Sethabutr, Director of the Institute of
Development of Thai Textile Industry was quoted as saying that
studies had shown that technical textile products would have high
potential in the world market, as the new material would play
increasing role in the production of textile products.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers in foreign countries currently use the technical
textile by about 40 percent, compared to five percent in Thailand;
so, the institute is pushing for doubling the use of technical
textile to 10 percent over the next five years, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sale of Thai textile products in the international market
accounts for around 500-600 billion baht (about 12.5-15 billion U.
S. dollars) annually, with exports in the first seven months of
this year increasing by 16 percent over the same period of last
year.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Switzerland Lowest in 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of inflation in
Switzerland fell back to 1.3 percent in August, its lowest level
since last November, according to the country's federal office for
statistics Friday.
</P>
<P>
The August rate was sharply lower than the previous month when
inflation was two percent. The federal office for statistics
attributed the drop to lower transport costs, mainly due to a fall
in oil prices, and lower prices for clothing and shoes during the
cut-price "sales" period.
</P>
<P>
The price of oil, a key factor in the inflation rate, is set to
rise again but this has not affected the August consumer price
index, the statistics office said.
</P>
<P>
In its breakdown of prices, the statistics office noted
slightly higher prices for food and rented accommodation.

<HEADLINE> 20 Million Chinese Students Begin New Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 200 million Chinese
middle and primary school students went to campus and began their
new terms today.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education (MOE) said revised
teaching materials for senior high school students will be pushed
from this term, and experts have already completed the revision of
teaching materials for compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the interests and technology development of students,
new teaching materials and outlines have deleted contents outdated
or exceeded student's capability.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianning, director of elementary education department under
MOE said lacking creative ideas is the main gap between China's
elementary education and that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Teaching materials of most Chinese schools exceed the actual
capability of the students, according to Yang Deren, dean of
chemistry department of Shanghai Normal University.
</P>
<P>
Under the burden of school work, some students lost interest in
studying, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Summer Teaching Material Catalog for Primary and
Middle Schools was published by MOE this year, which deleted 39
volumes of teaching material to lessen the study load.
</P>
<P>
Li hopes that more time will be spent in enlarging student's
knowledge, as well as the ability to develop analytical thinking
and reading.

<HEADLINE> New Product Quality Law Implemented in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The newly revised law on
product quality came into effect today to offer effective legal
guarantee for China's quality promotion.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five to ten years, economic competition will
focus on quality competition, and the improvement of China-made
products will be a key factor in China's economic development,
said Li Chuanqing, director of the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The amended product quality law includes 74 articles. The
original version had 51.
</P>
<P>
Li said at a meeting marking the implementation of the new law
here today that under the revised law, anyone selling fake or
inferior products will be severely punished.
</P>
<P>
The revised law further defines the responsibility for the
government to improve product quality and stresses that
enterprises must accept supervision from the quality control
departments.
</P>
<P>
China launched a series of clampdowns on fake and shoddy
products in recent years. However, the production of poor-quality
products is still a serious problem, especially in small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is urgent to set up systems of quality
responsibility, strict quality administration, technical
renovation and after-sale service in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that local quality and technical supervision
departments should help local governments include quality
upgrading into the social and economic development plan.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Alarmed by Spread of Killer Moss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Environment Ministry
has launched an educational drive in a bid to curb the killer moss
(Caulerna taxifolia) from spreading along the country's
Mediterranean coast, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The moss was reported to be accidentally drained into the
Mediterranean Sea from the Monaco Sea Aquarium and quickly spread
to the Mediterranean coast, causing harm to the French, Italian,
Spanish and Greek coastlines.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry, in cooperation with Dokuz Eylul
University's Sea Science and Technology Institute, has prepared a
program, which is being implemented in Antalya, Kas, Kalkan,
Fethiye and Dalan along the Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
Officials were quoted as saying that the moss is about to invade
Turkey and the program is aimed at waging a widespread campaign to
cope with the dangers of the moss.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that people do not have a reliable and effective
technique to eliminate the moss and the only method that can be
used at this stage is for divers to remove the moss from the water,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we don't know any other way to do away with the
moss. The method we're using is difficult and is not an overall
solution," said the officials.

<HEADLINE> China Yet to Increase Farmers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The restructuring of the agricultural sector has made marked
progress so far this year, with the acreage of grain and sugar
decreasing and that of oil-yield crops and vegetables increasing,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Low grain prices continued to fuel the rapid growth of animal
husbandry and aquatic farms in the first half of the year. The
output of poultry and eggs rose 4.2 percent and milk rose 9.4
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Steady growth of agricultural production and the rural economy
in China has increased the income of farmers, according to today's
People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a reduced acreage of summer crops
has led to decreased grain output this year. Grain output was 107.
5 million tons, 11 million tons less than last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the output of oil seeds reached a record of 10.6
million tons, while the planted rape seed reached an all-time high
of seven million ha., 667,000 ha more than last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the cash
income of farmers increased only 1.5 points in the first half of
this year, leaving no optimism for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
The profits of township enterprises reached 347.5 billion yuan
(about 42 billion U.S. dollars), up 14.5 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture said that in the latter half of the
year, the agricultural sector and rural economy are still facing
such problems as drought and pest attacks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Railways Leases Track to Private Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Railways for the
first time in its nearly three decades of operational activities,
has recently leased out 40-kilometer long track from Jessore to
Benapole, in the southwest part of the country, the Independent
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect reached recently, will enable a
private company to look after the track from October 1. This is
part of the overall plan of the Railways to involve private sector
in its activities to improve the quality of maintenance and
service and also to make the organization modern and viable.
</P>
<P>
Railway authorities will provide necessary materials for the
maintenance of the line, while the contractor company will be
responsible for supplying labor and maintain the track for which
they will receive 15 thousands U.S. dollars per annum.
</P>
<P>
The amount will be lesser than the expenditure Bangladesh
Railways used to incur in the past to maintain the line. However,
the overall supervision of the maintenance will be looked after by
engineers of Bangladesh Railways.
</P>
<P>
The process of integration of private sector in Bangladesh
Railways' activities started in 1997 and till now it is confined
to commercial activities (selling and checking of tickets and
cleaning the coaches) and on board service (provide attendants in
coach and catering services).
</P>
<P>
At the moment 10 pairs are being operated and the process have
almost been completed for operating commercial activities in
another 31 pairs. Against operation of three pairs of on board
service, the process is near complete to allow two more pairs.
</P>
<P>
`The running of the trains under private management has
encouraged more passengers to use trains meaning greater revenue
earning for the Railways.
</P>
<P>
Compared to 3,022,000 passengers carried by Railways in July
last year, the number of users grow to 3,375,000, an increase of
12 per cent. The revenue rise was from 0.23 million dollars to 0.
25 million dollars.

<P>
WELLINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
says "No" to a proposal calling for merging the New Zealand
defense forces with their Australian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for New Zealand Minister of Defense Mark Burton
said here Friday that while New Zealand's closest defense
relationship is with Australia, a united force is not something
the government has given thought to.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of the spokesperson are a response to a suggestion
raised earlier Friday by Australian National Party Senator Sandy
MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
While making a speech to the Australian Senate, MacDonald
suggested a joint ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps)
force would make sense considering existing levels of cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For all practical circumstances, he added, the two defense
forces are already integrated, but without acknowledgment and
planning.
</P>
<P>
MacDonald also extended the union idea to currency, saying such
things would come in a global world so they should start earlier
on a regional basis.
</P>
<P>
Senator MacDonald chairs Australia's Senate foreign affairs,
defense and trade legislation committee.

<HEADLINE> Review of Fijian Constitution Opposed in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Council of
Trade Unions (NZCTU) opposes the announcement of a constitutional
review committee by the Great Council of Chiefs in Fiji, according
to a press release issued by NZCTU here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of the South Pacific Organization of
Councils of Trade Unions (SPOCTU), which was held Friday in
Auckland, the biggest city in New Zealand, NZCTU Secretary Paul
Goulter said the Fijian interim administration has no mandate to
review the 1997 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Any review should be undertaken by the elected Parliament
within the framework of the provisions of that Constitution," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Goulter said the NZCTU is calling on the New Zealand government
to oppose this action and to advise the interim government in Fiji
of this country's concern.
</P>
<P>
Also at SPOCTU, a conference of Pacific trade union leaders,
President of the Fijian Trade Union Council Felix Anthony said the
review committee is not representative of the Fijian community and
that the committee includes a number of individuals closely
aligned with coup leader George Speight.
</P>
<P>
"Neither the Great Council of Chiefs nor the interim
administration has any mandate to rewrite the Constitution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Anthony noted the Great Council of Chiefs is an advisory body
and should not be regarded as a substitute for an elected
parliament.

TOKYO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Disaster-relief drills were
conducted across Japan Friday, the Disaster Prevention Day which
evokes memories of the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake that killed 140,
000 people in Tokyo and adjoining cities.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.85 million Japanese people took part in the annual
exercises in 33 of the country's 47 prefectures, according to a
tally by the National Land Agency.
</P>
<P>
The drills this year project a greater sense of urgency in view
of volcano eruptions and earthquakes that have hit the Izu Islands,
south of Tokyo, over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
In Shizuoka Prefecture, southwest of Tokyo, exercises
simulating a major earthquake striking the Tokai region along the
Pacific coast of central Honshu began in Kosai and other
localities.
</P>
<P>
At 8:30 a.m. (local time), Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
sounded a mock alarm for a major Kanto earthquake from his
official residence in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Japanese cabinet took part in the drill and
attended a teleconference with Shizuoka Governor Yoshinobu
Ishikawa.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, meanwhile, some 7,100 service members of the Self-
Defense Forces were deployed to a main avenue of the Ginza
shopping district to practice rescuing people trapped inside
buildings and underground.
</P>
<P>
In Hiratsuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, local authorities staged
relief exercises based on a destructive, vertical-type earthquake
hitting the southern Kanto region.
</P>
<P>
Japan Railway officials said they conducted drills simulating
train stoppages resulting from earthquake damage to Tokaido
Shinkansen Line bullet-train services.

<P>
Total exports in July was valued at 32.7 billion ringgit (8.6
billion U.S. dollars) while imports amounted to 28.7 billion

country in its own way, saying it is a "great undertaking."

COLOMBO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan navy has
constructed an attack craft for the first time at a cost of 7
million rupees (around 89,200 U.S. dollars) within a period of six
months.
</P>
<P>
A similar imported attack craft will cost 17 million rupees (
around 216,600 U.S. dollars), said Navy Commander Vice Admiral
Ciciel Tissera at a ceremony marking the official launching of the
craft at the Naval headquarters here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Commander complimented the engineers and other technical
staff who were engaged in the building of the craft.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Anurudha Ratwatte said that Sri Lanka
was an island country and the navy will take every possible action
to safeguard it. Nine more such craft were to be built and it was
a pleasure to supply all the raw material required for the purpose,
he added.

Tigers who have repulsed the government naval force in the course

BANGKOK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by strong global
demand, Thai exports reached 6 billion U.S. dollars in July, the
highest monthly level traced back to 1993, the Bank of Thailand (
BOT), the central bank, said in a report here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 22.7% expansion of July exports from the same period of
last year was better than the central bank's expectations, given
the decline trend of exports in the second quarter this year, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
Exported products posting strong gains in July included fishery
products, integrated circuits, electronic appliances, and plastics.
</P>
<P>
While stronger economic recovery in Asia and other major
overseas markets created huge demands for Thai goods, the weaker
baht, Thai currency, also helped enhance the competitiveness of
Thai products around the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
It believed that the improved export trend would help offset
the fragile recovery in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Imports totaled 5.35 billion U.S. dollars in July, resulting in
an overall trade surplus of 650 million dollars, and the current
account surplus was 1.09 billion dollars, it added.

<HEADLINE> Consolidated Sino-Indian Ties Important to Regional Stability: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 31 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to further increase
exchanges between the legislative bodies of China and India, as a
consolidated Sino-Indian friendship and its further development
are of great significance to both the economic development of the
two countries and the stability of the region, China's top
legislator Li Peng said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress, made the remark during his meeting here with Gandhi
Balayogi, speaker of the Lok Sabha, or the House of the People.
The two leaders are here attending the millennium summit of the
national parliaments, which began at the United Nations
headquarters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li said that he hoped to push forward the development of
bilateral relations and cooperation in every possible field by
increasing exchanges between the legislative bodies of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the five principles of peaceful coexistence
proposed by Chinese and Indian leaders decades ago continue to be
important guidelines in the development of international relations
today.
</P>
<P>
Balayogi agreed with Li that India and China share identical
views on many issues, such as multi-polarization of the world.
Regardless of the size of countries, they are all equal members of
the international community, and share such principles as mutual
respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-
interference of internal affairs in other countries. He hoped
parliamentary cooperation between the two countries would become
an important component of overall bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li also said he noted that in her opening speech at the
millennium summit of the presiding officers of the national
parliaments Wednesday morning, Najma Heptulla, who is the deputy
chairperson of the Rajya Sabha of India -- the Upper House of
Parliament -- and the president of the Council of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union (IPU) and chairwoman of the millennium
parliamentary summit, reflected China's views, which were drafted
in the final declaration of the parliamentary summit.
</P>
<P>
"We rededicate ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the UN
Charter, adopted some 55 years ago, and to work together to
address the main challenges facing the world community. These are
achievements of international peace and security, democracy and
respect of human rights without compromising sovereignty and
equality and without interfering into internal affairs of member
states and allowing each country to choose its own path of
development," she said in her speech on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Warns Against International Pressure Over E. Timor Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
warned the international community against pressuring Jakarta to
compromise over human rights abuses in East Timor, and against
pushing the government to implement the principle of retroactivity
because it could backfire.
</P>
<P>
"The government will not bow to international pressure to
compromise over human rights abuses in East Timor," Justice and
Human Rights Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I have to remind the international community that we could
also demand the Dutch and the Japanese governments (compensate)
for (past) war crimes committed during the independence war and
their periods of occupation here," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had aired the warning during a meeting
with visiting members of the European parliament early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said they had asked him whether or not a recently amended
article in the Constitution would bar the government from trying
those held responsible for the violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the People's Consultative Assembly amended the 1945
Constitution to prevent an individual from being prosecuted under
laws that did not exist when a crime was committed. The amendment
has sparked intense debate over whether trials of East Timor human
rights abuses can go ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
"I delivered this warning to members of the European parliament
earlier this morning (Thursday morning): 'that the international
community, specifically the western community, should not continue
pushing us to implement the retroactive principle because it can
backfire,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra also said that an article in the same constitutional
amendment mentions that all citizens have to respect the limits
imposed by the laws, and as such the retroactive principle could
be applied to specific cases.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, I would like to convey to the international
community, that there should not be any fear of the amended
Article 28 of the Constitution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military was accused of killing thousands of
people in East Timor before or after a direct ballot which led to
the breakaway of East Timor from Indonesia last year.
</P>
<P>
The Attorney General had promised to announce 30 names as
suspects in the East Timor case. The case dossiers will then be
submitted to the court for further legal action.
</P>
<P>
Of 33 alleged suspects according to an earlier report by an
inquiry team established by the National Commission on Human
Rights, two are four-star generals.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Logging Damages a Lot of Forests to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Illegal logging has damaged
400,000 to 800,000 hectares of forests annually to Indonesia, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Log production from illegal logging averages 17 to 30 million
cubic meters every year in Indonesia, the Business News bulletin
Friday quoted Junior Minister for Forest Nurmahmudi Ismail as
saying.
</P>
<P>
A non-government organization has even reported that log
production from illegal logging has reached 52 percent of the
total wood production from natural forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
The degradation of forest land has reached about 1.6 million
hectares of forests annually in the past ten years, and
deforestation in 2000 is estimated to cover about 2.6 million
hectares of forest land, said the minister recently at a workshop
on illegal logging here.
</P>
<P>
The report said the national wood industry has the potential to
absorb the supply of 80 million cubic meters of logs annually
while natural forests in the country can supply only about 19.5
million cubic meters of logs annually. The shortage of log supply
has stimulated illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
Thus the domestic demand for logs actually has exceeded the
tolerable logging on natural forests. Therefore, the minister
emphasized the need to take concrete steps to ensure the
conservation of natural forests.
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests in Indonesia are one of the biodiversity
centers. Indonesia ranks the third among the seven
megabiodiversity countries in the world today.
</P>
<P>
Nurmahmudi conceded that illegal logging has threatened the
flora and fauna conservation in Indonesia. The government has
provided about 19 million hectares of forest land or about 13
percent of the total forests in the country for the forest
conservation purpose, he added.

<HEADLINE> Moldova in Desperate Need of Elementary School Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Moldova is in desperate need
of primary and middle school teachers, and many schools have to
start the new term in September understaffed, news reports from
Chisinau claim.
</P>
<P>
In Moldova, at least 1,500 primary and middle school teaching
positions, mostly in math, English and biology, are unfilled
nationwide, a Ministry of Education and Science official said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in rural areas is worse than in the cities.
</P>
<P>
According to another education official, in the past three
years, about 8,000 elementary school teachers quit their jobs and
have gone to teach in colleges and universities, or to work in
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in the capital city of Chisinau,
from 1994 to 2000, a total of 7,000 normal college students
dropped out or changed their major.
</P>
<P>
Low pay and poor treatment are the main reasons for the
declining number of teachers in Moldovan schools.
</P>
<P>
A teachers' union in the capital revealed that a young
teacher's income in a month can meet only 15 percent of his
expenses, while a senior teacher who has been teaching for 18
years, can meet only 21.6 percent of his needs. To make ends meet,
they have to find several part-time jobs.

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Pay IMF Debt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This decision was made at a meeting of the Commission of
Exchanges and attended by the SHCP and the Bank of Mexico,
Mexico's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's current foreign exchange situation is much improved
after Mexico successfully fulfilled its fiscal and monetary
objectives these past few years, said SHCP.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has repaid some 3 billion dollars to IMF in the last
fiscal year from July 1999 to July 2000. Statistics show that
Mexico now owes IMF 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
IMF granted loans to Mexico to help the country surmount
domestic economic problems in 1995, according to SHCP.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo's payment
to IMF would relieve the economic burden on the new President
Vicent Fox, who will take office at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
High oil prices on the international market this year have
boosted Mexico's economy. Oil income in the first half of this
year increased by 1,002.2 percent from the same period in l999.

<HEADLINE> Peru Denies Involvement in Weapons Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Foreign Minister Fernando De
Trazegnies on Thursday once again denied that Peru's army was
involved in smuggling weapons from Jordan to Colombian rebels.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister claims the Jordanian government was
reportedly duped by international traffickers in arms.
</P>
<P>
"I have the impression that Jordan's government has been
surprised by a delinquent gang and that it trusted them in good
faith," said the FM, in defense of his government, which has
been named by Jordan as the buyer of weapons that were delivered
to Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Peru's Foreign Minister also rejected Jordanian charges that
Peruvian Air Force military aircraft were involved in the
transportation of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
Peru announced last week that it has smashed a ring that flew
10,000 Kalashnikov rifles from Jordan to Colombian rebels, which
has lead to a diplomatic flap between Peru and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government insists that the guns were sold
legally to Peru in 1998, but Peruvian government officials said
they never purchased the guns.
</P>
<P>
Jordan contends that a Peruvian General Lucio Olivera purchased
the rifles and made arrangements to have them shipped to Colombia
via the Amazon River and jungle, where the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia operate.
</P>
<P>
Peru however claims the alleged general involved in the
purchase and smuggling does not exist, said De Trazegnies.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian FM also advised that the purchase of said weapons
was canceled and the cancellation can be documented by Peruvian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government has sent a note to Jordan and is
waiting for an answer, he added.

The leader thanked the recent visit to Brazil by Mexican
President-Elect Vicente Fox, who requested the opening of an
integration process with Mexico and Mercosur.
</P>

During his visit to Brazil in August, Fox tried to change
Mexico's image in Brazil's political and economical circles,
which is that his country is only looking north, since the signing
of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also stressed the need to give impetus to the

BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Leaders Friday sent

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Commercial Banks Report an Increase in Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 31 (Xinhua) -- An Official report reveals
that Moldovan commercial banks took in 1.63 billion lei( about 132.
1 million U.S. dollars) in total deposits in the first half of
this year, according to reports from Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that deposits in Moldovan commercial banks
increased 25 percent in the first six months of this year from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the growth, deposits were 240 million lei (about 19.4
million U.S. dollars), or 35 percent higher; while deposits in
foreign exchange rose 43 million lei (about 3.5 million U.S.
dollars), or 6 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
The rising bank deposits came under surprising circumstances of
falling interest rates. The annual interest rate for deposits is
about 25.23 percent this year, 2.56 percentage points off from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the stability of foreign exchange rates was the
main reason for rising deposits. Statistics show that the exchange
rate between lei and the U.S. dollar has been within the narrow
band of 12.30 to 12.70 lei to one U.S. dollar, since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Loans offered by Moldovan commercial banks to
foreign countries reached 1.8 billion lei (about 145.9 million
dollars) in the first half of this year, which was one percent
higher than the level of the same period last year. The annual
lending rate is currently 34.67 percent, 0.62 percentage points
lower than that of the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Program to Shield More Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- With one of the richest
varieties of biological resources in the world, China has mapped
out an ambitious plan to bring more endangered species of wild
animals and plants under effective protection.
</P>
<P>
Within the next ten years, 15 new projects are expected to
begin throughout China to bring more than one-third of the country
's endangered species of wild fauna and 45 percent of its rare
flora under sound protection, today's China Daily quoted sources
from the State Forestry Administration as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposed projects are specially designed to shield the
following endangered species of wildlife: the giant panda, the
crested ibis, the tiger, the Tibetan antelope or chiru, the golden
monkey, the Chinese alligator, the elephant, the gibbon, forest
musk deer, Tibetan gazelle, wild deer, wild crane, the tragopan
and orchids.
</P>
<P>
This list includes only some of the wildlife covered by the
administration's newly completed program for the protection of
China's wild plants and animals and their habitats in the 2000-
2050 period.
</P>
<P>
The general target of the long-term program is to actively save
China's key endangered wild animals and plants by putting them
under the category of top State protection, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
The existing State-owned natural reserves are to be extended
and improved and new ones will be set up, including hunting-ban
zones.
</P>
<P>
China has 6,266 species of vertebrates, or ten percent of the
world's total, of which about 500 are mammals, 1,244 birds, 376
reptiles, 284 amphibians and 3,862 fish.
</P>
<P>
China also has the world's third largest number of plants in
the world, over 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Consumption Market Set to Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- In the second half of this
year, China's consumption market will continue to grow at a rapid
pace and domestic consumption will enter a new phase.
</P>
<P>
However, further effort is needed to stimulate China's
consumption, which remains dormant, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, following the
implementation of a successful national macro-economy policy,
crafted as a way of promoting domestic demand and stimulating
sluggish consumption, China's economy has witnessed robust
development. Investment and exports have grown consistently and
quickly. People's consumption patterns have also changed.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of retail sales of consumer commodities during
the first half of the year climbed to 1,624.8 billion yuan (about
196 billion U.S. dollars), 10.1 percent higher than that of the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging changes in China's consumer commodities markets
will boost the development of the national economy, the paper
predicted. The production mix of enterprises is readjusting
quickly and more new products are entering the market. In
particular, the production of communication equipment and
electronics has grown at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
China must make strenuous efforts to re-adjust income
distribution and nurture a healthy consumer environment conducive
to the revitalization of public consumption demands.
</P>
<P>
The paper also suggests that the State should focus on five
kinds of consumer goods including commercial housing, automobiles,
education and arts, products related to tourism consumption and
high-tech electronic and communication commodities.

<HEADLINE> Kofi Annan: U.N. and Olympics Share Same Ideals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 31 (Xinhua) -- Tolerance, equality, fair
play are the same ideals that shared by the United Nations and the
Olympics, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a message.
</P>
<P>
"Together, the Olympics and the United Nations can be a
winning team," he said Thursday. But he warned that the "contest
will not be won easily." "War, intolerance and deprivation
continue to stalk the earth. We must fight back. Just as athletes
strive for world records, so must we strive for world peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Annan praised the International Olympic Committee for reviving
the ancient Greek tradition of the "Olympic Truce," calling for
all hostilities to cease during the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
"I join the United Nations General Assembly in urging all
those at war to observe the Olympic Truce," he said. "This may
sound unrealistic. But as any athlete will tell you, nothing
happens without a dream."
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general added there is increasing interest in
the power of sports to promote a culture of peace, and he praised
the establishment in Greece of the International Olympic Truce
Center under IOC auspices.
</P>
<P>
"Let us all now enjoy this inspiring spectacle, and let us
sustain the momentum of peace and goodwill so admirably set in
motion," he said.

<HEADLINE> Government Lowers Charges in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Some administrative charges in
China's western areas will be reduced and price controls will be
relaxed, the State Development Planning Commission announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The price initiatives are intended to help create conditions
that will help propel the development of western China, a national
priority.
</P>
<P>
Price controls over such sectors as transportation, education,
environmental protection and construction will be eased, according
to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Local price administrations have been told to cut
administrative charges deemed excessive and eliminate any
industrial price-fixing that has not been approved by authorities,
according to China Daily.
</P>
<P>
This is another move that the Chinese Government has taken to
lure investment to the development of the vast, underdeveloped
western region.
</P>
<P>
The government asked local authorities to slash administrative
charges imposed on firms of the agriculture, tourism, real estate
and hi-tech sectors to a "reasonable level."
</P>
<P>
The charges imposed for personnel exchanges must be eliminated
or slashed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
According to China Daily, rail and air fares will be among the
first to see a drop in prices as local railway and air route
authorities are allowed to set prices according to market
development.
</P>
<P>
Also released from control are the prices at ten tourist
destinations, the prices of automobile manufactures in western
parts of China and the prices of water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Highway investors are allowed to collect construction fees on
some of the regional highways.

census, the largest to be undertaken anywhere in the world, on
November 1 this year, and build-up to the census is underway.

A nationwide campaign, including teaching school students
knowledge of the census and China's population problems, started

The campaign will mobilize all forms of mass media, especially
national television and radio stations and newspapers, to spread
information in preparation for the upcoming census, according to
today's China Daily.

<P>
The census will formally register children that have been born
in violation of family planning policies and help China's policy
makers modify and add the finishing touches to medium an long-term
development plans.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean the country is to desert its family
planning policy, according to sources from the Fifth National
Census Office under the State Council.

<P>
More than 5 million census officials an civil servants are to
work on the census. The central government has allocated 500

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. armed forces are mostly ready to perform
wartime missions, but if the country had to fight two major wars
at the same time, it would run a high risk of increased casualties
because of shortfalls in logistic support, the Pentagon said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Most major combat and support forces are ready to meet
assigned taskings under this scenario (two wars at the same time),
although there are force readiness and capability shortfalls that
increase risk in executing operations," the Pentagon said in a
periodical assessment report to the Congress. (US-Pentagon)

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Rebuild Traditional Culture Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is to reconstruct
Liulichang, the "Colored Glaze Street", as a cultural commodities
center featuring traditional Chinese architecture.
</P>
<P>
The street currently features many stalls selling traditional
Chinese works of art, such as calligraphy, Chinese paintings,
chinaware and jade.
</P>
<P>
The cultural commodities center will function as a place to
trade jade and antiques, a distribution center for Chinese
handicrafts, a commercial center for old books, and an area for
Chinese cultural exchange activities.
</P>
<P>
A collection of antique shops are located in the area, giving
both local and international visitors a chance to experience a
part of Beijing's history.
</P>
<P>
There are no sky scrapers on the street, but there are "
Siheyuan" or Chinese-style rectangular courtyards with one-story
houses built in grey tiles and brown bricks featuring delicate
designs on the doorways.
</P>
<P>
The new center will be one sq. km in size, with one quarter
allotted to trade, the rest will be filled with Hutongs and
Siheyuans, architecture typical of ancient Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The street was named "Colored Glaze" because of the many kilns
used to produce colored glaze tiles for the construction of
imperial palaces during the Yuan (1271-1368) and Ming (1368-1644)
dynasties. During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), businessmen came
here to deal in calligraphy works and paintings.
</P>
<P>
Department officials said the local government has decided to
reconstruct the area to relieve congestion caused by several
hundred businesses and street stalls located on the roadsides.
</P>
<P>
Moving and reconstruction is expected to be finished in three
years. Besides keeping the old-style buildings, more Siheyuans
will be built to represent traditional Beijing culture.

<HEADLINE> College Students To Get More Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 1 (Xinhua) -- More loans are expected to be
provided for poor college students from this autumn, said sources
from the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
Student loans were tried last year and proven to be effective
in cities with a high density of universities, including Beijing,
Shanghai and other six cities.
</P>
<P>
The education loans for students from poor families is a major
step for implementing the government strategy of reinvigorating
the nation through science, technology and education.
</P>
<P>
It also helps improve the development of China's educational
sector and deepen the reform of the education system, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To inform cash-strapped students about how to apply for loans,
the ministry circulated booklets in June to those sitting the
national college entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
The booklets explain the State's policies and the assistance it
offers to poor students.
</P>
<P>
Specific departments and individuals will be appointed by
schools to establish links with regional banks to supply loans.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Welcomes Election of New Somali President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government Friday
welcomed the election of Abdiqasim Salad Hassan as President of
Somalia and reiterated its full support for the new president and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"As a country, we welcome the election of interim Somali
President Mr. Hassan," Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told a press
conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Godana said that viable peace in Somalia can only be
achieved through inclusion of faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the warlords and other faction leaders who stay out to
show their goodwill and come onboard," said the foreign minister,
adding: "We hope the international community will do the same and
we are looking forward to seeing a functional government and
functional state."
</P>
<P>
"We are still exacting our own diplomatic pressure and offering
advice that the new team should go out of its way to bring in the
warlords," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, which shares a 1,200-kilometer border with the war-torn
Somalia, is home to 200,000 Somali refugees.
</P>
<P>
When and whether to repatriate the Somali refugees will be
determined by the assessment of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and Kenya will fully cooperate with the
agency, Godana said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia plunged into a civil war in 1991 and has had no central
government since then.
</P>
<P>
A peace conference aimed at ending Somalia's anarchy has been
underway since May 2 in Djibouti. A central government in Somalia
is to be set up in the coming days following the presidential
election on August 25.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Tries to Put out Forest Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South African fire
fighters battled on Friday afternoon a blaze raging through a pine
and gum plantation in Sabie of Mpumalanga Province beginning from
Thursday afternoon, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
South African Forestry Company Limited (Safcol) engineering
manager Benno Krieg said the fire had destroyed thousands of trees
in its Bergvliet plantation.
</P>
<P>
He said Sabie's fire brigade and the community were trying to
put out the fire, saying that the fire did not pose a threat to
communities as the plantation was not near any residential areas.
</P>
<P>
Krieg said they hoped to extinguish the fire late Friday. But
he said it would depend on the weather.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in Mpumalanga has
banned people in terms of the Forestry Act from making fires in
the open until October 31, when the worst of the dry season is
over.

<HEADLINE> New Study Notes Rapid Rise of Internet Use Outside of U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Internet use outside the
United States may be rising much faster than predicted just last
year, according to a report released Friday by an American
industry-funded public policy group.
</P>
<P>
The report from the United States Internet Council (USIC)
estimates that 304 million people worldwide used the Internet on a
regular basis as of March 2000, most of them from outside North
America.
</P>
<P>
There were fewer than 90,000 Internet users just seven years
ago, and 171 million in 1999. Current predictions indicate that
Internet users could exceed the 1 billion mark by 2005, with 700
million located outside North America, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last decade U.S. users and English language content
have defined the Internet as a U.S.-centric environment," the
report said. "However, as more users come online in Europe and
Asia as well as the rest of the world, the Internet is becoming
multicultural, multilingual and multipolar."
</P>
<P>
According to the USIC, English is losing its dominant position
on the World Wide Web in favor of increased linguistic diversity.
Currently, only just over 50 percent of all Internet users are
native English speakers.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the report said, English-language Web sites continue to
dominate. Seventy-eight percent of all websites and 96 percent of
e-commerce sites are currently in English. Additionally, 70
percent of all websites originate in the U.S. and the vast
majority of them are in English.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. to Discuss Strategic Stability in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-U.S. strategic
stability group is expected to convene in New York at the
beginning of September, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The session will be held on the eve of a meeting between
Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
that will take place at the Millennium Summit, Interfax quoted "
well-informed Russian diplomatic sources" as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the strategic stability group, Russia will be represented by
Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov, and the U.S. by Deputy
State Secretary Strobe Talbot.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, "a whole complex of strategic stability issues
will be discussed, including already available and new initiatives
in the sphere of bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation to
strengthen international security, to continue the reduction of
arms, and to improve missile-nuclear non-proliferation regimes,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sides will also probably discuss the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) initiative to curtail its missile program
in exchange for international assistance in launching DPRK
satellites, the sources disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that the upcoming consultations "will be
based on agreements to step up dialogue on strategic stability
issues" that were reached during the last meetings between the
Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow and at the Okinawa summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of both countries have expressed their "adherence
to the search for new ways of cooperation to limit the
proliferation of missiles and missile technologies," and "are
starting a more intensive discussion of issues on the promptest
possible enforcement of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-II (
START II) and the further reduction of strategic forces under the
future START III Treaty, as well as Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty issues, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Russia's position on the ABM treaty "remains unchanged," they
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
Russian-U.S. consultations on strategic stability issues have
been held regularly since February 1999. However, so far the
parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the destiny of
the 1972 ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants amendments to be made to the treaty in a bid
to create a limited national missile defense system. Moscow
opposes reconsideration of the treaty, saying the implementation
of the U.S. plans will destroy the entire system of strategic
stability in the world and will initiate a new arms race.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Ban Approved by Italian Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lighting up in public and private
indoor areas throughout Italy could draw hefty fines under a
smoking ban that was formally approved Friday by Italy's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping ban allows for designated smoking zones in
ventilated areas, but calls for stiff fines against those who
violate the ban.
</P>
<P>
All publicly and privately owned indoor places open to the
public are covered by the bill, including bars, restaurants,
prisons and police stations.
</P>
<P>
Owners, managers and designated "smoke-busters" who fail to
apply the norms are also subject to fines though the cabinet
Friday agreed to reduce the penalty.
</P>
<P>
The proposed fines would range from 100,000-300,000 lire (about
50-150 U.S. dollars) for anyone who lights up.
</P>
<P>
The ban was drafted by Italian Health Minister Umberto Veronesi
and previously approved on first reading by the cabinet and by the
State-Region Conference, and it will go into effect after being
upheld by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Veronesi, one of Europe's leading cancer specialists, has
announced a crusade against smoking, saying that too many Italians
still die of lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1 million people, or 24.5 percent of the
population, in Italy smoke cigarettes though figures compiled by
the national statistics bureau Istat show that the percentage of
smokers nationwide has fallen by nearly 1 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to Veronesi, the proceeds from the fines will be used
to fund anti-smoking campaigns, Veronese said.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Seen to Have Great Potential in Internet Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific as a whole
seems set to play a dynamic role in future Internet development, a
U.S. group tracking the online world said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The region is the third of rapid Internet growth, after North
America and Europe, currently boasting approximately 70 million
Internet users, said the United States Internet Council (USIC), an
industry-funded public policy group.
</P>
<P>
Internet users in Asia-Pacific now account for 23 percent of
the worldwide total of 304 million. The USIC said that the region,
representing almost half the world's population, has significant
growth potential.
</P>
<P>
Regional growth forecasts estimate that by 2003 Asian users
will surpass North American and European users and exceed 200
million. By 2004, Asia-Pacific e-commerce should reach 1.6
trillion U.S. dollars and account for almost 20 percent of the
global total, according to the USIC report.
</P>
<P>
Japan, second only to the U.S. in terms of Internet use, leads
the region. Its total number of Internet users has soared from
around 17 million in 1999 to 27 million in 2000, and is expected
to approach 77 million by 2005..
</P>
<P>
The USIC said that China has the potential to surpass Japan as
the region's dominant Internet nation. Although Internet
penetration remains low, the country has already risen to second
place, behind Japan, in terms of users, with 12.3 million users
online, the report said.

firefighters.
</P>
<P>
Gore will join union workers in Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day
Monday, then head to Louisville, Kentucky, to wrap up his marathon
with an evening rally outside a motor speedway.
</P>
<P>
"Labor day begins a two-month home stretch for the campaign,"

ahead in the polls around Labor Day has won every election for the
last 50 years.

A Newsweek poll released Friday showed Gore 10 points ahead of
his Republican rival George W. Bush and other polls out late next
week will give further evidence whether or not Gore is gaining a
lead.

Texas Governor Bush claimed Friday that his Republican
presidential campaign was "in excellent shape."
</P>
<P>
He said that he had the momentum against Al Gore despite
distractions and slipping polls.

Bush was campaigning Friday in Arkansas, concentrating on the
education issue that has been his chosen topic during the week of
campaign.

<HEADLINE> IMF Forecasts Italy's Economic Growth in 2000 at 3.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF) Friday revised upwards its April forecasts for Italy's
economic growth this year and next.
</P>
<P>
The new forecasts are 3.1 percent in 2000 (compared to April's
2.7 percent forecast) and 3.0 percent in 2001 (compared to 2.8
percent).
</P>
<P>
The new forecasts are contained in the IMF's World Economic
Outlook to be presented at its annual meeting in Prague in
September, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecasts are more optimistic than the latest ones from
the Italian government, contained in its three-year economic plan -
- 2.8 percent in 2000 and 2.9 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts may still be slightly altered, but the picture is
clear: after years of slow growth, Italy is close to hitching its
economic convoy to the European train, which is showing sharp
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary copy of the report, the IMF is set
to revise upwards its forecasts for the euro zone, with 3.4
percent growth in 2000 and 2001, compared to 3.2 percent for both
years predicted in April.

<HEADLINE> S. American Presidents Defend Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South America's competitivity
in the world economy depends on a better integration between the
economic blocs of the continent, the 12 presidents said Friday in
the Communique of Brasilia, issued at the end of the first South
American Summit.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Community of
Andean Nations (CAN) chiefs of state decided to start talks to
create a free trade area between the two blocs before January 2002.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also supported the Plan of Action for the
Creation of the Regional Infrastructure in South America, a study
made by the Interamerican Development Bank (IDB). "The presidents
regard as being of priority the identification of work of
bilateral and subregional interest," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the 12 countries of the continent reaffirmed
their commitment toward the perfecting of the multilateral system
of commerce, said the document.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed the concern of the presidents for the
imbalances in the international financial markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the text, the presidents want the international
financial community to work to find a rapid solution to that
problem to recover the economic growth of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said he hoped the accord
would represent a first step toward eventual creation of "the
United States of South America" though he conceded this may be
little more than wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, for his part, said the
agreement should eventually be extended to include Central America
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"From South America, we have to look at the whole of Latin
America because that's where we will have to eventually have a
complete integration process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
higher Friday after the latest reports showed more signs that the
U.S. economy is slowing and inflation remains tame.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.68 at 11,238.78
points, extending its gain of 112.09 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 27.98 at 4,243.33 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 3.09 at 1,520.77.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate
increased to 4.1 percent in August from 4.0 percent in July while
the National Association of Purchasing Management said U.S.
manufacturing activity shrank in August for the first time in 19
months.
</P>
<P>
The reports offered further proof that the U.S. economy is
slowing and inflation remains under control, which would prompt
the Federal Reserve to end the current cycle of monetary
tightening policy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates for six times in the past
14 months in an effort to cool off the economy and prevent
inflation from rising. The central bank decided to leave rates
unchanged at a monetary policy meeting last week but hold the door
open to a further rate hike if a threat to inflation arises.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index was pushed higher by its components of IBM and
Hewlett-Packard even as brokerage and bank shares fell after a
rally in the previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
Big technology names such as Oracle led the Nasdaq composite's
advance. Yahoo! fell after bearish comments on a falloff in its
adverting revenue.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 3.05 at 677.58 and the American Stock
Exchange index was up 12.30 at 955.78. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.02 at 541.91.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,647 up, 1,195 down and 502
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 766.47 million shares from 1.05 billion
in the previous session.
