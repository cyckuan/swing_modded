<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stresses Security in Solving Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and the U.S. consider
the security aspect as a crucial part of any future solution to
the Cyprus issue, government spokesman Michails Papapetrou said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily briefing, Papapetrou said the security
issue was discussed when President Glafcos Clerides met visiting
U.S. State Department coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the U.S. considers Cypriot government's
proposal for the demilitarization of the island particularly
significant.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that any settlement to the Cyprus issue must
provide for the withdrawal of all troops and wider security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterated our position that the issue of security and
guarantees should be dealt with within the framework of a wider
force of guarantors and not to be left to Greece and Turkey, in
view of past experiences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey and Britain had been guarantors for Cyprus'
independence and sovereignty when the island gained independence
from British colonial rule in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had used it as a pretext to invade Cyprus and occupy the
northern third of the island in 1974, following a failed coup
seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the island has been divided into Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Security-General Kofi Annan on December
17, 1993, Clerides proposed to disband Cyprus' National Guard and
turn over all its arms and military equipment to the custody of
the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) if Turkey agrees
to withdraw Turkish troops in the north and the Turkish Cypriot
armed forces are also disbanded and hand over their equipment to
UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Cypriot government would cover the cost
of a numerically increased UNFICYP.

<HEADLINE> BT Unveils New Wearable Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A computer system created by
researchers at British Telecommunications (BT), which can be worn
on the body, has been unveiled at a disability conference held in
London.
</P>
<P>
The system uses the latest Pentium III laptop-style computer
connected to a pair of glasses, through which the user can view an
image equivalent to a normal desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
The BT research team, which demonstrated its prototype to the
Rehabilitation International Assembly in London, said it could
benefit people with degenerative Alzheimer's disease or the
disabled by acting as a "walking mind".
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a body-worn computer system that can behave
as a remembrance aid, accessing and delivering information when
you most need it based on where you are and what you are doing,"
said Jerry Bowskill, senior research scientist at BT.
</P>
<P>
"For people with memory problems it can act as a little helper,
reminding them of where they are and what they are doing," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The researchers hoped to bring the new wearable computer system
to the consumer market within the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Russian Mir Space Station Into "Drifting" State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Mir space station was
put into "drifting" state Tuesday to conserve energy and retain
the working capacity of the scientific instrument aboard.
</P>
<P>
Upon orders from Mission Control near, the gyrodynes were
stopped at 17:30 local time (13:30 GMT). Inertia will cause the
station to rotate once every 40 seconds, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
The station's motion control system will be shut down at about
01:15 local time Wednesday (21:15 GMT Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
The 27th mission left the station on August 28 after partially
shutting down some systems and others completely. Some may be
activated later.
</P>
<P>
Only the telemetric and temperature regulation systems and the
command radio line continue to operate.
</P>
<P>
The 120-ton Mir station is expected to remain in the "drifting"
position until April 2000. If Russia cannot secure funds for the
continuation of its operations, a final crew will visit Mir in
February-March to prepare it for descent into the Pacific Ocean.

LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Police on Tuesday arrested a
man who burst into the BBC's television headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the outburst was unclear.
</P>
<P>
"He was arrested on suspicion of burglary and taken into
custody but has not yet been charged," a Scotland Yard spokeswoman
told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"He was a 20-year old, unemployed, believed to be from Surrey.
He was not armed and nobody was injured," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday the unnamed man broke through security by
jumping over the main entry barriers and got to the first floor
where he smashed a glass wall with a table to gain entry to the
news centre.
</P>
<P>
He started throwing around monitors and printers until he was
overpowered by BBC staff.
</P>
<P>
"We are not aware of any reason as to why this attack might
have happened," the BBC spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The BBC was tightening its security at the public building
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
It also launched a security investigation to find out how the
man reached the heart of the BBC's news operation despite extra
security imposed since one of its top personalities Jill Dando was
murdered outside her home earlier this year in a hit-man style
shooting.

BUENAS AIRES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Interior
Minister Carlos Corach on Tuesday denied that Argentina has a

</P>
<P>
The Argentine cooperation with the U.S. military is limited to

<P>
ABU DHABI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Energy Minister
and President of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries
(OPEC) Youcef Yousfi will visit the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
next week.
</P>
<P>
The visit is part of a Gulf tour the OPEC leader intends to
carry out prior to the organization's ministerial meeting in
Vienna later this month, the official WAM news agency reported
on Tuesday
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Yousfi will discuss with Gulf oil leaders
the situation in the world oil market, as well as topics in
the agenda of the Vienna meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a UAE oil ministry source told WAM that oil
ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which comprises
the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, would
meet in Riyadh on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to coordinate their stands on
the oil market ahead of the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that the OPEC ministerial meeting would
probably keep the oil output curb accord reached by major oil
producers intact until April 2000.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members and non-OPEC producers Mexico, Norway, Oman and
Russia agreed to cut output by 2.1 million barrels per day
last March.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have risen dramaticly since this move was carried
out.

<P>
LUANDA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Angola hopes that the
international community will intervene "as soon as possible" in
the turbulent situation in East Timor, taking all necessary
measures to avoid genocide, Angolan Vice Foreign Minister said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We consider that the United Nations should take urgent
measures, sending intervention forces as substitution for the
Indonesian troops," said Toco Serao in an interview with Angola's
official news agency Angop.
</P>
<P>
Serao said that Angola is struck with "consternation" at the
turbulent situation in East Timor, accusing the pro-integration
groups of provoking the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He added that the situation in East Timor, which is under
occupation by Indonesia, is similar to an "authentic massacre" and
inspires profound worry.
</P>
<P>
On the amnesty granted by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie of
the pro- independence leader Xanana Gusmao who has been in custody
for seven years, Serao said this move is "extremely important" for
maintaining stability in the region and for pacifying the soul of
the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
According to official announcement of the result of a
referendum held on August 30 in East Timor, an original Portuguese
colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976, 78.5% of the voters prefer an
independent country.

<HEADLINE> UK Businesses to Get "Last Chance" Warning over Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Action 2000, British
government's Y2K task force, Tuesday launched a "last chance"
guide for businesses that have yet to recognize the dangers of Y2K
as well as those who are still to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The booklet, a step by step guide to focus businesses on the
areas critical to their survival, will be mailed to Britain's 1.3
million businesses employing one to 249 staff from September 13,
Action 2000 said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over quarter of a million of the 1.3
million small-to-medium sized firms are still not ready for Y2K,
despite repeated warnings over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, or so-called "Millennium Bug", is a computer
software problem which could result in systems not recognizing the
new date in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Action 2000's Chairman Don Cruickshank
described the millennium date change as "the final challenge of
the 20th century" for thousands of small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Action 2000 has a responsibility to ensure that every company
in the UK is alerted to how to protect their business from risk of
disruption from the bug," said Cruickshank.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we have taken the unprecedented step of mailing
1.3 million named senior individuals from those companies
employing between one and 249 staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
With time rapidly running out, the guide, labelled as "final
lifeline", is designed to be a concise and easy to use tool for
businesses to assess risks, identify problems and take action to
beat the Bug.

WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States would be
waiting for a report by a U.N. fact-finding team about East Timor
before deciding whether to send forces there, the White House said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. team will report back within the next couple of days
and make an assessment on any potential international peacekeeping
force, and we'll take a look at that recommendation," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"Once they've made a judgment on that... we will, as will many
countries, take a look at whether we participate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart told reporters that President Bill Clinton had not
made any offer of troops or equipment to support any U.N.-backed
intervention because U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had not
decided himself whether an international force was warranted.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing now, as we've stressed, is the Indonesian
government getting control of the situation and restoring a secure
environment," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what the United States would do if the
Indonesian government failed to restore peace in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said its relations with Jakarta would be damaged
if the Indonesian government could not bring the turmoil in East
Timor under control.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said there were no immediate plans for any
emergency rescue operation for U.S. nationals in East Timor. They
said three U.S. naval vessels were expected to sail from Port
Darwin, Australia, as early as Wednesday and could move toward the
troubled area.

Lessons on the causes and prevention of the spread of AIDS had
been given to about one million people in the western zone of the
Tigray State, Ethiopian News Agency reported Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin Firms to Pay 1.1 Bln Dlrs to Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Six major vitamin producers
have agreed to pay more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars to settle a
landmark price-fixing lawsuit, the largest sum ever paid in an
antitrust case, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The settlement would resolve allegations that the companies
orchestrated a nine-year conspiracy that led to artificially high
prices for hundreds of food and beverage companies.
</P>
<P>
The higher vitamin prices allegedly led to higher retail prices
for many food products, ranging from breakfast cereal to peanut
butter.
</P>
<P>
The Post reported that the tentative settlement of the civil
suit brought by corporate buyers of bulk vitamins will be
presented to U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan in about two
weeks. The judge will then hold a hearing to determine the
settlement's fairness.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the U.S. Justice Department obtained a
750-million-dollar criminal fine from three of the vitamin
manufactures as a result of allegations that the companies
colluded to divide up markets and set wholesale vitamin prices.
Those three companies were F. Hoffman La Roche &AMP; Co., of
Switzerland, BASF AG of Germany, and Rhone-Poulenc SA of France.
</P>
<P>
The Post said that those three companies in addition to three
Japanese firms -- Eisai Co., Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., and
Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd -- had reached the tentative civil
settlement. Together, the six companies account for about 80
percent of bulk sales of the most popular vitamins.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, nearly 1,000 corporate buyers of bulk
vitamins would receive more than 1 billion dollars reflecting
overcharges during the nine years. The newspaper said 50 law firms
would divide another 125 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. Secretary Pleads Guilty To Lying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros Tuesday pleaded guilty to a single
misdemeanor count of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), ending a four-year investigation by an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros, a former member of President Bill Clinton's cabinet,
acknowledged that during his background checks for a post in the
Clinton administration, he falsely told FBI investigators that he
had paid his former lover Linda Jones no more than 2,500 dollars
monthly.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros reached a plea agreement with prosecutors in which he
agreed to pay 10,000 dollars fine while an 18-count felony
indictment against him was dropped.
</P>
<P>
The plea came as Cisneros' trial on 18 felony counts was to
have started. He was charged with conspiring with Linda Jones to
conceal from the FBI the scope of his payments of more than
250,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I accept responsibility for the conduct," Cisneros told the
court.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel David Barrett has spent more than four
years and 10 million dollars investigating whether the former
secretary lied to the FBI about how much money he paid Linda
Jones.
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' legal trouble began when Jones filed a
breach-of-contract suit against him in her hometown of Lubbock,
Texas, in 1994, charging he had reneged on his promise to support
her.
</P>
<P>
Jones later took her claims to a tabloid TV show where she
accused Cisneros of lying to the FBI, triggering a Justice
Department inquiry and the appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Jones secretly made 88 tape recordings of her phone
conversations with Cisneros as their relationship soured.

<HEADLINE> 4 Islamic Militants Killed in Shootout with Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police shot and killed
four suspected Islamic militants, including a wanted key member of
a violent group, in their hideout in Giza Governorate.
</P>
<P>
The four men, holed inside an apartment in el-Omraniya suburb,
showered police with bullets. The police, which was preparing to
storm into the apartment, fired back, killing all four men.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead was Farid Salem Abdel Qadwani, identified by an
Interior Ministry official as a leader of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, or
the Islamic Group, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Two of them were identified as Saad Nureddin Abdel Galil and
Kasban Sayed Mahfouz, the official said. The identification of the
fourth suspect was in progress.
</P>
<P>
The official said Qadwani and the other three carried out many
attacks on police patrols in southern Egypt in 1993 and 1994, the
height of the Islamic militant insurgency aimed at toppling
Egypt's secular government.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 people have been killed since the militants
took up arms in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Qadwani was twice sentenced to life in prison but had been at
large, police said without giving additional information.
</P>
<P>
The shootout was the first in months that police had with
suspected Islamic radicals.
</P>
<P>
The incident came a day after Hussein Mahmoud Sulaiman, a
40-year-old clothing vendor, described as an Islamic fanatic,
grazed President Hosni Mubarak's hand with a sharp tool in
northern Port Said at the northern end of the Suez Canal and was
shot dead by guards.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's government has launched a harsh crackdown on Islamic
fundamentalism in Egypt. In recent years, it declared the movement
crushed, with most of its leaders put in jail.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Bank Gains Record Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot Popular Bank
gained record operating profits in the first six months of 1999,
the Popular Bank Group's Executive Chairman Kikis Lazarides said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Profits of the bank reached 36.7 million Cyprus pounds (72.4
million U.S. dollars) compared with 24 million pounds (48 million
dollars) the same period last year, registering a 42.5 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders will be given an interim dividend of 10 percent,
compared with 8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Lazarides said the impressive results are partly due to the
Group's expansion in the insurance sector, the spectacular
increase in the stock exchange activity and the effective control
of operating costs.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the next half of the year appear even more
positive," he said, noting that the Group had very good results in
the insurance and stock exchange sectors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the local economy, Lazarides warned a rising
public deficit would pose serious danger for the stability of the
economy at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He described the Group as "a robust modern organization,
capable to meet future challenges and serve its customers."

<HEADLINE> Britain Rules Out Sanction on Indonesia Over Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Tuesday ruled out
using economic sanctions against Indonesia in an attempt to bring
an end to the escalating violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister John Battle said sanctions would have
little effect and more positive approach was needed to solving the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Battle made the comment in Indonesian capital Jakarta before
holding talks with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on the
crisis, a BBC report said.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment the economy of Indonesia is under incredible
pressure with the collapse of the economies in South East Asia so
that [sanctions] would not have any immediate effect," the report
quoted Battle as saying.
</P>
<P>
Calls for sanctions are growing in Britain amid reports that
Indonesia soldiers have joined pro-Jakarta militias in their
attacks on civilians.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, a group of East Timorese protested outside
Downing Street, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's residence.
They insisted that Britain has a moral obligation to help end the
bloodshed in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The campaigners staged a vigil after handing in a letter
demanding that the British government uses its influence to get
Indonesia to allow United Nations peacekeepers into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook cut short his
visit in Tokyo and flew to New Zealand to attend emergency talks
over the bloodshed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain would be heavily involved in the crisis in
East Timor, saying Britain has "got a ship in the area which could
be of assistance if it was required."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Optimistic about Algeria's National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is optimistic about
Algeria's sincerity on national stability, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs Martin Indyck said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. supports the efforts of Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika in introducing the economic and political
reform. He also conveyed Washington's desire to strengthen ties
with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people have been killed since an Islamic
insurgency erupted in 1992 when the military-backed government
canceled elections that the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was
set to win.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official highlighted the importance of Algeria's role
on the regional and international arenas while voicing his
country's readiness to back the economic development in Algeria,
Morocco and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
On the African affairs, Indyck said Algeria's efforts to
resolve the Eritrean-Ethiopian border dispute and the crisis of
the Democratic Republic of Congo were widely hailed regionally and
internationally. "We encourage such endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Middle East peace process, Indyck said the U.S. and
Algeria had common interest in achieving an Arab-Israeli fair,
lasting and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Bouteflika's support and participation in the peace
efforts," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's efforts in enlarging "the peace circle" will have a
great importance due to the country's regional weight, according
to the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Indyck arrived here Monday on a two-day working visit and held
talks Monday night with Bouteflika.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Slams U.S.-British Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) has slammed the continuation of the U.S.-British
bombardment of Iraqi civilian targets as "heinous crime against
humanity."
</P>
<P>
In memos sent to the International Parliamentary Union and the
Arab Parliamentary Union, the Human Rights Committee at the Iraqi
National Assembly described the continuation of U.S.-British
bombardment as aggressive acts, the Iraqi News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee Khalid As-Saadi said in the memos
that the U.S.-British bombardment was basically aimed at harming
Iraqis and destroying their properties.
</P>
<P>
As-Saadi reviewed the details of the U.S.-British warplanes
attacks against Iraqi civilian targets, and the human and
material losses they inflicted on Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the attacks against residential areas,
service facilities and worship places in northern and southern
Iraq is a flagrant violation of human rights and international
norms and values.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration and British government are still
continuing their hostile acts by bombing civilian facilities and
residential areas and killing scores of innocent civilians
including children, women and the elderly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq,
their warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian and
military targets in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The restricted zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western
allies in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

HARARE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- An European Union official said
Tuesday that EU would provide 11.4 million euro to Zimbabwe early
next year for education programs to be implemented over a
four-year period.
</P>
<P>
EU economic adviser Jose Leandro told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that talks between the Zimbabwean education ministry and the EU
were in the final stages and expected to reach an agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
He said the money was going to be used to resolve both long
term and short term needs of the educational sector.
</P>
<P>
"On the short term needs, the money will be used to cover
financial difficulties of those children who were failing to
attend school because of exorbitant levies.
</P>
<P>
"On the long term the money would be used by the ministry to
monitor the impact of its policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "It is good that the International Monetary Fund has
agreed to release funds to Zimbabwe but despite that being one of
our condition our support does not flow automatically because we
still need to look at other issue."
</P>
<P>
"Our main concern is the government's commitment to the social
sector especially in the areas of education and health," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said they also wanted to see the government's commitment to
the privatization process and its military expenditure.

<HEADLINE> 8 Killed in Athens Earthquake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed,
dozens injured and many more trapped in an estimated 30 collapsed
buildings in the Greek capital of Athens when a powerful
earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale hit the city around
3 P.M. local time Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the damage as "significant", saying that
the Greek armed forces, and health and technical services were on
alert while rescue teams were on the scene to begin efforts to
release those trapped in the buildings in the city's northern
outskirts, especially in the area of Thracomakedones, Menidi, Nea
Ionia, Halkidona, Ano Liosia, Kato Fifissia and Nea Erythrea.
</P>
<P>
Two 400kv high voltage centers were also damaged by the
earthquake and the wider Athens region was now serviced by an
150kv center.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters are now flying over the above-mentioned areas to
detect and determine the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
So far, firemen have released three women and a nine-year-old
boy trapped in a building which had collapsed during the quake,
which had an epicenter in the Mount Parnitha region, some 20
kilometers northeast of Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis chaired an emergency
meeting of ministers to coordinate the rescue actions.
</P>
<P>
After the strong earthquake around 3 P.M. local time, there
were also more than 20 aftershocks and the strongest of the
aftershocks registered 4.5 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
Quake experts warned that the next 48 hours could see
aftershocks of up to more than 4 Richter and possibly close to 5.0
Richter while saying that the earthquake was a surface movement
and it originated from a fissure 20 kilometers in length and no
more than 10 kilometers in depth.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake also sent thousands of frightened residents into
the streets while hospitals in the city area have evacuated their
patients. Traffic lights knocked out by the earthquake led to
traffic chaos in the city center and mobile phone network also
appeared to have been knocked out by the quake.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Uncovers Causes of Recent Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- With intensive and unremitting
investigations, the Yemeni security agencies have uncovered the
causes of the explosion that took place in downtown Sanaa on
August 28 morning.
</P>
<P>
The explosion in Sanna's "City Center" shop was caused by some
sort of highly-inflammable materials (oil or gas) and no explosive
substances were used in it, the Yemeni News Agency Tuesday quoted
a security official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was planned by the owner and some workers of City
Centre due to financial difficulties undergone by the centre. The
culprits sought, through the explosion, to get compensations from
the insurance company, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The security agencies got these categorical facts from the
confessions of some suspects who were proven to be accomplices in
the criminal act, he said. The conclusions were in line with the
results of the criminal lab, he added.
</P>
<P>
The explosion left two persons dead, namely, Abdullah Al-Emeiri
- the owner of the centre - and Khaled Hussein Musaad who lived in
a neighboring house. Twelve others were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
The case will be referred to the judiciary, the security
official said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some alien elements tried to mar Yemen's
image as usual but to no avail.

He hoped his ongoing visit will enhance the friendship between
the two peoples and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in
various fields, Jiang said at a meeting with Australian Governor-
General William Patrick Deane, who held a banquet in Jiang's honor
Tuesday evening.
</P>

strides in the bilateral relations since then.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome, Deane said Jiang is in Australia
again as an old friend and yet as the first ever Chinese head of
state, thus the visit is of great importance.
</P>
<P>
This visit will play a positive role in furthering the
existing friendly and close ties between the two nations, Deane
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is very satisfied with the present
relationship between the two states, saying the frequent contacts
between leaders of two countries would help consolidate bilateral
relations.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Deputies To Pay Political Visit To Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said on
Tuesday that Foreign Trade Minister Gerrit Ybema will be paying a
visit to Cuba as the first political visit by the Netherlands to
the socialist island country since 1979.
</P>
<P>
This is a joint initiative on the part of the Netherlands
Foreign Trade Agency, the Institute for Latin America and the
Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce, the government said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch foreign trade minister will lead a delegation of
deputies from Dutch industry to pay this visit between October 28
and November 3. The visit is consistent with the Dutch policy of
stepping up the dialogue with Cuba wherever possible, the
Government Information Council said.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government will further carry out the policy in order
to prevent the Netherlands from slipping behind other countries
and "to create a more solid foundation for vigorously exposing
socio-political wrongs," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
"Economically, the Netherlands has a strong position in Cuba,
particularly in the fields of trade and shipbuilding," it added.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 30 Dutch firms have their branches in Cuba. Now,
the Netherlands is the third-most important market after Russia
and Canada for the Cuban exports, which is about 455 million NLG
(218 million U.S. dollars) per year. Meanwhile, Cuban imports of
100 million NLG (48 million U.S. dollars) a year put the
Netherlands in 11th place, the statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Judge Safety Causes Fear of Distraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More judges are worrying about
their safety in the face of threats of death, bombs and other
dangers arousing concerns about impartiality, the Globe and Mail
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More federally appointed judges are contacting the Office of
the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs to seek extra
protection, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had these calls that we had not had before," the
Ottawa office of the agency was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the anecdotical evidence is a case where a judge received
threats to his life and the lives of his family because of a
ruling he made in a criminal case involving organized crime,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Police took the threats seriously and had the judge change the
color of his car, while the Office of the Commissioner for Federal
Judicial Affairs provided a home alarm.
</P>
<P>
Madam Justice Myra Bielby of the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta told reporters that the concern among judges is not
affecting their judgments, but no one would be served well by
distracted judges, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Expects Positive Initiatives on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Greek Alternate Foreign
Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis said Tuesday that there was potential
for a serious initiative concerning the solution of the thorny
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remark here after meeting the newly-
appointed special U.S. coordinator to the Cyprus problem, Thomas
Weston.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis told reporters that the Cyprus problem could not
remain "an open wound" because it undermined stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that Washington, the U.N. and the EU would
pressure Turkey to cooperate with the international community for
a settlement of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Weston, who arrived here Tuesday from Cyprus, said that there
were positive elements at the international level for the solution
of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974, when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Weston is now on his first trip to the region as part of the U.
S. efforts to restart the deadlocked talks on reunifying the war-
divided island.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Preparing 230 Troops for Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is preparing
230 soldiers for possible participation in a United Nations
peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), South African Defense Minister Patrick Lekota said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's contribution to the mission would depend
solely on what was required by the U.N. and the Organization of
African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we are invited to contribute a contingent to build
the peacekeeping force can we do so. Therefore we can only know
how much we are going to participate when a request is presented
to us by the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The deployment of peacekeeping troops would form the third
phase of putting into effect a cease-fire agreement signed by all
warring factions in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The first phase involved the deployment of unarmed military
liaison officers to the capitals of all the signatories to the
peace accord, and possibly the headquarters of the rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has trained eight military officers for
involvement in the first stage, of which one was chosen.
</P>
<P>
Lekota said Colonel Hans Swart left for Kenya on Monday for
specific training. It was expected that he would be deployed in
Kampala, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The military liaison officers would be responsible for
assisting the Joint Military Commission, comprising
representatives of all the parties to the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
They would also secure assurances of security from all the
parties prior to the possible deployment of military observers in
the DRC, which would form the second phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
South Africa had not yet been asked to take part in the second
or third phases, Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Johan van der Walt, senior staff officer of operational
planning and external operations, said 72 volunteers were being
trained as UN military observers.

LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- China has a major role to play
in ensuring "the long term strength and stability of the world
economy" which is why the UK supports the principle of China's
accession to the World Trade Organization, a British senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the Department of Trade and Industry quoted
Trade Minister Richard Caborn as saying Tuesday: "We want to see
China in the WTO for China's benefit, for our benefit and for the
benefit of World Trade."
</P>
<P>
"Membership would ensure that China's trade partners enjoy
improved market access and a stable environment for investment and
trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Caborn, who has been invited to speak on an international
investment seminar in China Wednesday, said he "will use the
opportunity to underline the strong confidence the UK Government
has in China's future as a key global trade and investment
partner".
</P>
<P>
Britain is now the 6th largest global investor in China and by
far the leading European investor with British companies involved
in more than 2000 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Pledged investment in China by British companies was more than
13 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. In 1999, they have increased by
30 percent to date, compared with last year.

TOKYO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's maritime safety
authorities confirmed Tuesday that three members of a Japanese
right-wing group landed on China's Diaoyu Islands recently.
</P>
<P>
The three members of the Japan Youth League left a small town
in Okinawa Prefecture on Saturday night by a boat and made a brief
landing on one of the islands, also claimed by Japan, on Sunday,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
They spent about one hour and 40 minutes on the island,
replacing a battery for a lighthouse constructed by the group in
1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Japan's Ambassador to China Sakutaro Tanino, in
response to a protest note delivered by Chinese Deputy Foreign
Minister Wang Yi, expressed regret Tuesday over the landing on the
island by the group members.

<HEADLINE> WWF: Study Shows Effective Anti-Malaria Alternatives to DDT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Various innovative mechanisms
can control malaria and other diseases just as effectively as the
notoriously dangerous pesticide DDT, according to the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF).
</P>
<P>
These alternatives would be less harmful to the environment and
human health and just as cheap, said the WWF in a report released
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The results came from detailed case studies focused in six
areas: Africa, India, the Philippines, South America and Mexico.
The alternative techniques used include pesticide-impregnated
bednets, odor-baited cloth targets to attract and destroy
disease-carrying insects; lower-risk pesticides used in rotation
to avoid the development of resistance; and widespread elimination
of mosquito breeding grounds and introduction of natural predators
and sterile insects.
</P>
<P>
The WWF said that the results confirmed that 34 million people
in West Africa were protected from river blindness and 700,000
Indians from malaria. There was a 50 percent reduction of malaria
in certain Tanzanian villages, and a 50 percent reduction in
malaria cases in the Philippines with 40 percent less expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"If DDT were the only tool to fight malaria, we would not even
consider advocating its phase-out," said Clifton Curtis, Director
of WWF's Global Toxics Initiative. "However, as these case studies
show, people around the world are using innovative methods to
fight tropical diseases that do not rely on a pesticide so
dangerous it has been banned in most countries."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Locate New Gene for Dyslexia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists said Tuesday they
have identified the location of a gene for dyslexia, raising the
hope of screening tests and early treatment for this common
learning disorder.
</P>
<P>
The DYX3 gene, discovered by an international team of
researchers based in Norway, Belgium, and the United States, lies
within a small region of chromosome 2, one of the 22 chromosomes
that everybody inherits from their parents.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, published in Britain's Journal of Medical
Genetics, strongly indicates that dyslexia manifests differently
among those who inherit the gene for it.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed that they will now be able to clone
the genetic sequence and so gain important insights into the
processes involved in reading and spelling, for which it is
thought several genes may be responsible.
</P>
<P>
No gene for dyslexia has been isolated until now, although
scientists have long suspected a genetic basis for the disorder
and have even roughly mapped the region of the brain likely to be
involved.
</P>
<P>
Previous research indicated that many children under the age of
two, in whom the language areas of the left side of the brain are
impaired, can go on to develop normal language ability, unlike
teenagers and adults who sustain damage to this area.
</P>
<P>
"This suggests that the areas of the brain responsible for
language development are relatively plastic in the early years of
life," said the researchers.
</P>
<P>
"A genetic test that could detect dyslexia early in life could
therefore facilitate earlier diagnosis and corrective treatment,"
they concluded.

<P>
GENEVA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
(CD) concluded its 1999 session here Tuesday without agreement on
a program of work, said the United Nations Office at Geveva.
</P>
<P>
While agreement had been reached on most of the elements of a
program, the UN said, major differences remained among national
delegations on two topics: nuclear disarmament and prevention of
an arms race in outer space.
</P>
<P>
However, the conference, the world's sole multilateral forum
for disarmament negotiations, have taken a consensus decision to
admit five new members, Ecuador, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,
and Tunisia, increasing the total number of the CD members to 66.
</P>
<P>
In its press release at the conclusion of the CD's 1999
session, the United Nations recalled that on March 26, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech before the CD. Jiang was
the first head of state to speak before the conference.
</P>
<P>
The CD has fixed the following dates for its session for the
year 2000, which will take place in three parts: January 1 to
March 24, May 22 to July 7, and August 7 to September 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The second volume of the White
Book on NATO Crimes in Yugoslavia were circulated by the embassy
of Yugoslavia here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the book there are many pictures of parts of bodies,
destroyed houses, TV stations, factories and infrastructure as a
result of the 78-day-long NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Charge d' affaires of the Yugoslav embassy Dusan Zupan said:
"Some foreign powers try to influence civil strives, to fuel
internal differences, to help separatism and to exploit ethnic
tensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the way for them to control these countries and, by
controlling them, to dominate and to exploit them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose to publish the book is to preserve this for the
history and for generations to come as testimony, evidence and
proof of criminal behavior, arrogance and inhuman politics of some
western governments in the wake of 21st century and the third
millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States needed to create crisis and confusion
as justification to dominate all region of Balkans. The only
remaining country in the region that refused to comply with
American diktat and has been truly independent was Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The aggression on Yugoslavia is not over and American and its
allies are continuing to commit crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They keep under embargo all economical activities in my
country already destroyed by their bombs. They are also keeping
away many western organizations from helping and giving aid to
Serbian people. They don't allow our financial transactions with
foreign subjects. Even they don't allow us to open our airport in
Belgrade," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Snowbirds aerobatics team
of Canada is losing its 14 ageing Tutor aircraft as part of the
defense budget cuts, according to the Ottawa Citizen newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Jane's Defense Weekly report, the newspaper said
Tuesday that the air force has been trying to come up with 2
billion Canadian dollars (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars) to
upgrade its frontline CF-18 fighter fleet and Aurora patrol
planes.
</P>
<P>
It is considered impractical to keep Tutors just for the sake
of Snowbirds, which perform at Canada Day celebrations every year,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The scaledown also involves other types of aircraft, the
newspaper reported, adding the Challengers will cease flying by
May 2000 and the Silver Stars will be withdrawn from service by
the end of March 2002.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two Dash-8 trainers based in Winnipeg are to go
out of service, while the search and rescue Buffalo aircraft will
be eliminated on the west coast.
</P>
<P>
In total, more than 50 support aircraft are expected to be
removed from the flight lines, reducing the air force to half the
size it was in 1991, the newspaper quoted defense analysts as
saying.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Assist Turkey in Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
D. Wolfensohn Tuesday told Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
that the bank is intensifying its commitment to assist the
government in its reconstruction and recovery programs in the
aftermath of the August 17 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to convey that the World Bank is preparing a
1 billion dollar package for Turkey to help finance the costs of
reconstruction and recovery," Wolfensohn said. "This package will
take the form of 300 million dollars in re-allocations from
existing loans to Turkey and up to 750 million dollars in new
long-term loans, which would be committed over the next three
months."
</P>
<P>
Within 36 hours of the earthquake, the World Bank had
reallocated funds from existing loans and had identified funding
for new loans for reconstruction needs, the bank said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
As the full extent of the damage and needs for recovery have
become clearer, the bank has augmented the amounts to make even
more financial and technical resources available to support
Turkey, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that the overall costs of reconstruction will be
much greater than those we can finance. Consequently, the bank is
working with other international agencies and countries that could
offer bilateral assistance, to ensure that remaining costs are
financed," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank will assist and advise the Turkish
government as it works to improve the systems for enforcement of
building codes, insurance, and overall emergency response.
</P>
<P>
Two World Bank teams are now working with the government in
Turkey -- one is assessing the costs of reconstruction and service
restoration, and the other is assessing the impact of the
earthquake on the economy and the needs for economic recovery.
Both teams will make their first results available by September
14.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Declares State of Emergency in Amazon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANIERO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Environment
Ministry Tuesday declared a state of alert in the Amazon and
prohibited the act of land clearing by the use of fire, in a
measure taken to prevent forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are afraid that because of the drought and the
absence of rain in the Amazon, any fire may grow to enormous
proportions, as happened last year in the province of Roraima.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighters have combated around 2,000 forest fires in 15 of
the 27 states.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency ordered by the civil authorities and
military forces, as well as those in charge of the environment,
assures that the aforementioned services are ready to act in the
case of any forest fire in the Amazon region.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Latin American
visitors contributed 10 percent of foreign visitors to the United
States in 1998, said reports here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the number of visitors from the region to the United
States, with the exception of Mexico, represented only 6.9 percent
of visitors, the newspaper Portafolio quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
Including Mexicans, the visitors from Latin America and the
Caribbean represent 31 percent of the approximately 46.4 million
foreign visitors, who stayed at least one night in the United
States last year.
</P>
<P>
Canada contributed to the tune of 29 percent of the visitors,
Europe 22 percent, and Asia 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1998, the general growth in international
visitors to North American cities was approximately 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of visitors from Latin America and the Caribbean
shot up 42 percent to 14.1 million.
</P>
<P>
Visitors from South America rose 123 percent in 1998, those
from Central America grew 69 percent and those from the Caribbean
went up only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans who spent one night in the U.S. registered an increase
of 32 percent to 9.27 million, representing the highest number.
</P>
<P>
The increase was especially strong from Argentina, with a rise
of 183 percent, totaling 524,000 visitors last year, followed by
Brazil, with an increase of 128 percent, to 909,000.
</P>
<P>
Florida is the most popular destination in the United States,
attracting two thirds of Caribbean visitors, 70 percent of Central
American visitors and 61 percent of South Americans.
</P>
<P>
New York and California are also popular places with the Latin
Americans.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Effort to Reduce World's Illiterates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has called upon the United Nations and Member States to
work jointly to reduce illiterates in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
In a message for International Literacy Day, which falls on
September 8 every year, Annan said, "The United Nations and Member
States must work jointly to build societies, where literacy is
integrated into overall development efforts."
</P>
<P>
"We must aim to create competence and skills that enable people
to confront and solve problems, formulate their own vision of
development and make informed judgements in all decision-making
processes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must optimize the use of technologies, both traditional and
new, to help bridge the knowledge gap," he said. "We must strive
to provide lifelong learning opportunities for all."
</P>
<P>
"That means working as a time," he said. "The United Nations
and UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization), the lead United Nations agency in
education, relies on cooperation with all United Nations Member
States. financial partners, civil society associations and the
hundreds of thousands of literacy workers -- most of them
volunteers -- around the world."
</P>
<P>
There are 880 million illiterates in the world today.
Two-thirds of them are women. More than 120 million children are
deprived of all education, formal or informal.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we step our commitment of literacy, they will be the
adult illiterates of tomorrow," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest UNESCO estimates give us cause for hope," he said,
"The percentage of adult illiterates in the world has already
declined from more than one-third in 1970 to a quarter in 1990."
</P>
<P>
"It is projected to drop below one-fifth in the beginning of
the new millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO decided in 1966 to designate September 8 ever year as
"the International Literacy Day," in a bid to mobilize all
governments and international organizations to wage a fight
against illiteracy in the world.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Make Demographic, Health Survey Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is to launch a
demographic and health survey (DHS) early next year, the first of
its kind in the country, the Central Statistics Authority (CSA)
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar, CSA General Manager Abdulahi Hassen said
reliable socio-economic and demographic data are important factors
in any development planning.
</P>
<P>
The DHS is a national sample survey designed to provide
information on levels and trends of fertility, infant and child
mortality, family planning as well as maternal and child health,
Abdulahi said.
</P>
<P>
The planned survey will be financed by the United States Agency
for International Development, the United Nations Population Fund
and the Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaires will be conducted in 540 sample sites, with
14,300 women aged between 15 and 49 to be interviewed in randomly
selected households, Abdulahi said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, with a population of 60 million at an annual growth
rate of 3. 5 percent, has been making efforts to curb increasing
population in the country, he said.

WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 600 people were
evacuated Tuesday from their suburban Detroit homes in Michigan
State, the United States, as a precaution following the derailment
of a railroad tanker that possibly contained a toxic chemical,
reports reaching here said.

<P>
The tanker may contain ethylene oxide, which can cause severe
burns and "might even have the potential to be lethal if inhaled,"
the reports quoted Ecorse Police Chief Robert Royals as saying.
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of leakage. However, local officials were

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Businessmen Welcome New Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's private sector on
Tuesday welcomed the naming of Alcides Tapias as the new
Development, Industry and Trade Minister.
</P>
<P>
According to businessmen, the arrival of Tapias to the cabinet
of Brszil encourages the productive sector, as he was successful
as vice-president of the Bradesco Bank, one of the largest in
Brazil, and is also an ex-president of the Brazilian Federation of
Banking Associations.
</P>
<P>
The industrialists showed confidence in Tapias, believing that
he will develop financing systems for the exports of the small and
medium sized businesses of Brazil, as the country needs employment
and growth.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of the businessmen, the fight against
protectionism in developed countries and the promotion of the
formation of large business groups, is a principal part of the
work of the new minister.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year Tapias was named by President Henrique Cardoso on
Monday, replacing Clovis Carvalho, who resigned last Friday,
because of a divergence in economic policies with Finance
Ministrer Pedro Milan.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts see the departure of Carvalho as the latest
conflict within the government and its allies over whether to
pursue the tough fiscal cuts agreed to with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), despite a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has agreed with the IMF to reach strict fiscal targets
in exchange for a 41.5 billion dollar loan package aimed at
bailing Latin America's biggest economy out of the devastating
effects of its 30-plus currency devaluation in January.
</P>
<P>
the country is fighting sky-high unemployment, a stagnating
economy and high interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils Health Plan In New Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Tuesday unveiled a health program to bring millions of uninsured
Americans into the health care system and improve coverage for
those already in it.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic presidential candidate promised to offer
affordable heath care to the nation's nearly 11 million
uninsured children by 2005, marking a new campaign season of
specific policy prescriptions by presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
Gore made clear that, if elected president, he would pursue the
same incremental approach to changing managed care that President
Bill Clinton adopted after his attempt to revamp the system failed
to win congressional approval in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"We have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one
fell swoop," Gore said in a speech at Children's Hospital in Los
Angeles. "Experience has taught us that there is a way to keep
what is right, while fixing what is wrong with American health
care."
</P>
<P>
Gore's speech came one day before Democratic rival Bill Bradley
formally declares his candidacy in his hometown of Cristal City,
Missouri, and a few days after Republican front-runner George Bush
outlined his support for school vouchers in an address to the
Latino Business Expo in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
After a summer focused in large part on fund-raising prowess
and a nonbinding straw poll, leading candidates are now preparing
policy addresses on specific topics.
</P>
<P>
The Children's Health Fund, an advocacy group for disadvantaged
children, estimates some 11 million children have no health
insurance in the U.S. and almost as many have inadequate plans or
live in places without enough doctors.
</P>
<P>
To help insure more children, Gore would expand the Children's
Health Insurance Program, which helps states provide coverage to
children in working families.
</P>
<P>
Gore would also allow families that do not qualify for the
program, and do not receive health benefits through their jobs, to
buy into the program.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested to allow "vulnerable Americans" to buy into
the Medicare program as early as age 55 and he promised a 25
percent tax credit to help defray the cost as currently Americans
are eligible for Medicare at 65.

WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary damage
estimates from Dennis, which weakened from a hurricane to a
tropical depression, exceeded 43 million U.S. dollars in North
Carolina State of the United States, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a hurricane, Dennis sideswiped the Outer Banks last week,
then went out to sea and stalled. It backtracked and came ashore
on Saturday, then slowly made its way inland, dumping up to 50
centimeters (20 inches) of rain on North Carolina coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the saturated atmosphere left over from Dennis
caused flooding Tuesday in parts of Pennsylvania State, where many
areas were soaked by 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) of rain,
and schools were closed in several communities.
</P>
<P>
Some 175 people were evacuated from low-lying sections of
Lycoming County, in north-central Pennsylvania, and several people
were rescued from flooded campgrounds in nearby Snyder County.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
 Frederick Sumaye and his Uganda counterpart Apollo Nsibambi have
called on multinational pharmaceutical companies to lower the

UNITED NATIONS, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The new U.S. permanent

</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was accompanied by acting U.S. Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott during the ceremonial activity.
</P>
<P>
The new U.N. ambassador, who just returned from his Balkan

"high and continuing commitment to the United Nations, to the
importance of the work that it does and to engage in serious
substantive discussion of several major problems that are

U.S. dollars in arrears.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Netherlands Cuts all Aid to Kenya For Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands will cut all
aid to Kenya within the next three years due to its bad
governance, Jelte van Wieren, first secretary of the Royal
Netherlands Embassy in Kenya, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Wieren said Kenya had failed to meet requirements for continued
 bilateral aid due to its bad governance, human rights abuses and
impeded democratization, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the level of poverty in Kenya remains high, the
country will not get further funding due to failure to implement
policies and lack of good governance," Wieren told the press
before the opening of the World Press Photo Exhibition in Mombasa,
a port city in southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation was in
Kenya recently to brief the Kenyan President on the stand adopted
on severing future bilateral aid.
</P>
<P>
The first secretary noted that bilateral aid to Kenya stood at
an original level of 54 million U.S. dollars for the past decade,
but was scaled down to 24 million U.S. dollars last year. In the
next three years, it will be all phased out.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government had reviewed its initial bilateral
aid policy with 78 nations and would only continue to support 17,
adding that Tanzania and Uganda were among the countries that
would continue to get bilateral aid from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The level of economic development in these countries is
positive due to their good policy implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition of entries for this year's World Press Photo
contest opened Tuesday at the Mombasa Old Law Courts for the
first time in Kenya, and will run for two weeks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Independent Probe into Waco Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno has asked Republican former Senator John Danforth to inquire
independently into the government's use of force against the
Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, government sources said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Danforth, 63, served as attorney general in Missouri for eight
years before entering the Senate. He retired from the Senate in
January.
</P>
<P>
Reno's decision came as congressional Republicans have
increased pressure on her and on FBI director Louis Freeh to
explain how evidence, including a videotape, about the siege was
withheld from the public for years.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party tries to find out whether the FBI lied
about using incendiary tear gas canisters during the final raid on
the cult compound in Waco. More than 80 cult members died in the
raid.
</P>
<P>
The FBI revealed recently that it fired several flammable tear
gas canisters at the compound hours before the main Branch
Davidian building went up in flames in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The FBI and the Justice Department had previously denied use
of any incendiary devices.
</P>
<P>
The independent investigations are expected to focus on whether
this misinformation was the result of a bureaucratic slip-up or a
coverup.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party have used the recent revelations to
attack the credibility of Reno and the Justice Department.

<HEADLINE> Denktash's Statements on Cyprus Issue Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government
Wednesday firmly refused to condition the start of peace talks on
the recognition of the breakway Turkish Cypriot republic in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said that if Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and his supporter Turkey insist on
"the recognition of the illegal regime" in northern Cyprus as a
condition to start talks, no initiative on Cyprus will be able to
take place.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said that "if this is Mr. Denktash and Turkey's
final position, then there can not be any talks, initiative or a
solution to the Cyprus issue."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Denktash will "finally change his
views, come to his senses," so that the Cyprus issue will be
settled.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Turkish Cypriots-controlled north
and Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is only recognized by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou's remarks came in response to statements made by
Denktash in Washington.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Strategic and International Studies Center,
Denktash said he will not enter negotiations for a Cyprus
settlement unless "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" is
recognized.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that the only prescribed solution for Cyprus is
the establishment of a confederation of two states, which had been
staunchly rejected by the Cyprus' government and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island in a
bi-communal federation formula, but the talks between the two
rival sides have been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also criticized the G-8, which
groups the U.S., France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan,
the seven most industrialized nations, and Russia, for rejecting
"the existence of the Turkish Cypriot community."
</P>
<P>
The G-8, in their Cologne summit in June, requested
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to invite the leaders of the two
sides to unconditional negotiations in the autumn of 1999.

<HEADLINE> China Pledged to Protect Legitimate Rights of Taiwan Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will do its utmost to
protect all legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan investors,
no matter what happens to the cross-Straits relations, a senior
Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make unremitting efforts to accelerate economic
exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits," said Li
Bingcai, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council, at the ongoing Third China Investment and Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Any attempts to interfere in the cross-Straits economic
development under the pretext of political differences violate
economic law, are unwise, and will be to no avail, Li stressed,
referring to Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui's separatist "two states"
remark.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Lee's remark has created tension between the two
sides of the Straits and jeopardized both Taiwan's economy and
cross-Straits economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mainland has been the main target of
investment for Taiwan investors since it has maintained political
and social stability, and rapid and steady economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to encourage Taiwanese investment in the
mainland and provide more support and better services to Taiwan
investors, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll stick to the principle that economic exchanges across
the Straits should not be affected by any differences," Li added.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops have
started active advancement in western and southern directions of
the village of Karamakhi in Daghestan's Buinaksk district, the
Interior Ministry press service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, elite OMON police and rapid reaction units
encountered setbacks due to mine-fields laid by the rebels in and
around Karamakhi, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian air force planes pounded rebel positions near the
village of Chabanmakhi, another stronghold nesting higher in the
foothills of Chaban mountain.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russian forces are engaged in fighting against rebels
in seven villages near the breakaway republic of Chechnya,
striking the Islamic extremists with air, artillery fire and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small groups of guerrillas are also trying to
infiltrate into other parts near the village in order to
destabilize the region, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Four rebel snipers, two mortars, one ZU-23 air-defense system,
five ammunition storage facilities, and three fuel and lubricant
storage facilities were destroyed by the federal forces in the
villages of Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi Tuesday, the Interfax news
agency quoted the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels damaged two Interior Ministry helicopters, and put
one tank, six armored vehicles and one anti-aircraft system out of
commission, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Russia May Review Participation in Kosovo Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian official said
Wednesday that Moscow might take a new look at its participation
in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation unless progress is made in
ensuring stability in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"The Federation Council might reconsider the form of Russia's
participation in the operation, unless progress is made in
ensuring stability in the region, or Kosovo's secession from
Yugoslavia becomes imminent with the subsequent creation of a mono-
ethnic state," said Leonid Ivashov, head of the Defense Ministry's
International Cooperation Department.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been critical of NATO peacekeeping forces' slow
progress in disarming the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
protection of ethnic Serbs there.
</P>
<P>
NATO forces have failed to ensure the safety of the people
living in the territory, primarily that of non-Albanians, Ivashov
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the disarmament process of the KLA is unsatisfactory.
The KLA is unlikely to turn in its arms by the scheduled date of
September 19, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No serious disarmament of the KLA is underway, therefore it
is pointless to speak about any sort of stability in the region,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has some 3,600 troops in Kosovo as part of a 40,000
multinational peacekeeping force.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Opening-up: Wu Yi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua)-- China will continue to actively
develop economic and trade cooperation throughout the world, State
Councillor Wu Yi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also an alternate member of the Political Bureau of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the
remarks in her address at the "Symposium on International
Investment Cooperation in the 21st Century" held in this coastal
city.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China will continue to push forward investment and
trade liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region, actively expand
opening-up, and promote economic and trade contacts and mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
This will be done by adhering to China's status as a developing
country, taking into consideration its national conditions and in
line with the principle of equality between rights and obligations,
she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, China has successfully warded off the Asian
financial crisis and sustained the high-speed growth of its
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that the Chinese government's policy to
stimulate the national economy has paid off, she said, adding that
China's economic growth also made its due contribution to the
stability of other Asian economies, even the world economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that China has not slowed down its steps to open
wider, even during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the use of overseas capital is an
important part of China's opening-up policy, and the foreign
investment played an important role in China's economic growth and
the reform and opening-up cause.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China boasts political and social stability,
sustained economic growth, stable currency and sufficient foreign
exchange reserve, she said. These factors combined make the
comprehensive investment cost quite low in China, turning the
country an attractive destination for overseas investors, she said.

MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada signed into law Wednesday a measure postponing the
elections of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) from
September 13, 1999, to the second Monday of September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony held at the Presidential
Palace, Estrada said the postponement of the elections will give
ARMM Governor Nur Misuari more time to bring peace and development
to Mindanao and the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The president added that he signed the law also because a
plebiscite ratifying the proposed New Organic Act of the
autonomous region must precede any elections.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the proposed New Organic Act is yet pending in
Congress, he said there is nothing to ratify and therefore there
can be no elections this month.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, the president said he was heartened by the
news that the government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front signed an interim agreement last week to start formal peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the agreement will bring a "stable political
environment" that is vital for Mindanao to attain peace and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated his pledge to transform Mindanao from a land
of promise to a land of fulfillment during his term which ends in
2004.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with his vow, he said the proposed budget for the
year 2000, which the administration submitted to Congress, gives
Mindanao the highest per capita allocation.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Regional Services
Department (RSD) Wednesday announced a ban on wax-burning
activities during the Mid-Autumn Festival, a traditional Chinese
one which falls on September 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
The department will step up enforcement action against those
burning wax at any pleasure ground or gazetted beach during the
festival, a RSD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Wax-burning activities must be severely dealt with because hot
steam and wax, going out of control, will not only stain, char and
damage facilities but also cause severe burns to players
themselves and innocent people in the vicinity," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent such tragic incidents, the RSD has recently put up
anti-wax burning posters at all pleasure grounds and gazetted
beaches, and informed school principals in writing to convey the
message to their students, he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to enforcement action, the spokesman said that not
less than 500 staff would be deployed to patrol the venues on each
of the nights of September 23, 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutions will be taken out against those who do not abide
by the law and ignore warnings given by our staff," he said,
adding that last year, more than 14,000 people were verbally
warned.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Sino-Australian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin stressed here Wednesday the need for China and
Australia to undertake efforts to build a Sino-Australian
relationship oriented towards the new century.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a welcoming luncheon hosted in his honor by
Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Jiang said he saw the need
for the two countries to undertake the following efforts:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, to have a firm grasp on the bigger picture of the
bilateral relationship and constantly expand common interests by
standing at a strategic high ground and proceeding from the long-
term interests of the two peoples;
</P>
<P>
Secondly, to elevate, in a pioneering and innovative spirit,
the interflow and cooperation between the two countries in the
economic, trade, scientific and technological fields to a new
level;
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, to strengthen consultations and coordination on
regional and international issues and make more contribution to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world at large;
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, to properly approach and handle the differences and
divergences between the two countries and promote a sound and
stable development of the bilateral relations according to the
principles of treating each other as equals and seeking common
ground while shelving differences;
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, to increase personnel exchanges between the two
countries at different levels and promote mutual understanding
between the two peoples so as to foster a solid foundation for the
development of Sino-Australian relations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said China and Australia share broad
interests in developing their respective economies and promoting
regional and global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
He said the economies of the two countries, with their
distinctive features, are highly complementary to each other.
Therefore, he said, there is a huge potential and a broad prospect
for exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the
economic and trade, scientific and technological and educational
fields.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said important progress has been made in
the bilateral relations with frequent exchange of high-level
visits and close consultations and dialogues in various areas. The
steadily expanding economic and trade cooperation have made the
two countries important partners to each other.
</P>
<P>
All these exchanges and cooperation have benefited the Chinese
and Australian people and contributed to the stability and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, Jiang said, adding "We are
fully confident about the development prospect of the bilateral
relationship."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that as long as our two sides take a longer
view by standing on a higher ground and join hands with each other,
we will surely be able to bring a sound Sino-Australian
relationship into the 21st century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said at the luncheon that President Jiang's visit to
Australia, the first by a Chinese head of state to the country, is
of great importance to the development of relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia and China, both members of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation, are countries of major influence in the Asia-
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Relations between them, based on mutual respect, acknowledgment
of differences and attaching importance to common ground between
them, are now in the best period in history, said Howard.
</P>
<P>
Howard also reiterated Australia's one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia supports China's entry into the World Trade
Organization and the two sides have completed bilateral talks on
China's access to the organization. Australia will continue to
make efforts to strive for China's entry into the WTO as early as
possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the luncheon, Jiang also met with Australian Senate
President Margaret Reid and House Speaker Neil Andrew.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The vast Chinese market will
continue to be the driving force behind Hong Kong's economic
growth, the financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region said here today.
</P>
<P>
"A sustained and highly prosperous economy in the interior
areas is in the best interest of the Hong Kong people," Donald
Tsang said at the Symposium on International Investment and
Cooperation for the 21st Century, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that from a long-term perspective, Hong Kong should
conform its economy with that of the interior areas, especially
the neighboring Pearl Zhujiang River Delta and Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Tsang said, Hong Kong will be more qualified for
regional and global competition.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that the inland is now offering lots of business
opportunities for the Hong Kong people as it is preparing to enter
the World Trade Organization and to open wider its service
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tsang added that the service industry in the inland will catch
up with that of advanced countries in the world in about a dozen
years as the business environment improves.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsang, the Hong Kong people have invested 142.7
billion U.S. dollars in the inland over the past two decades,
accounting for 51 percent of the inland's total investment from
overseas, and this has helped Hong Kong's economic transformation.

<P>
URUMQI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The foundation stone was laid
today for an internationally-funded children's home to be built in
Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in
northwest China.

<HEADLINE> Russia Steps Up Strikes on Rebels in Daghestan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops have
started active advancement in western and southern directions of
the village of Karamakhi in Daghestan's Buinaksk district, the
Interior Ministry press service said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, elite OMON police and rapid reaction units
encountered setbacks due to mine-fields laid by the rebels in and
around Karamakhi, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted the press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian air force planes pounded rebel positions near the
village of Chabanmakhi, another stronghold nesting higher in the
foothills of Chaban mountain.
</P>
<P>
So far, Russian forces are engaged in fighting against rebels
in seven villages near the breakaway republic of Chechnya,
striking the Islamic extremists with air, artillery fire and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, small groups of guerrillas are also trying to
infiltrate into other parts near the village in order to
destabilize the region, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Four rebel snipers, two mortars, one ZU-23 air-defense system,
five ammunition storage facilities, and three fuel and lubricant
storage facilities were destroyed by the federal forces in the
villages of Karamakhi and Chabanmakhi Tuesday, the Interfax news
agency quoted the Interior Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rebels damaged two Interior Ministry helicopters, and put
one tank, six armored vehicles and one antiaircraft system out of
commission, Interfax said.

MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Belarus would remain a foreign
policy priority regardless of government reshuffles in Russia.
</P>
<P>
No matter how frequently Russia's government is reshuffled,
its leadership "has always considered Belarus a strategic partner
and will continue to do so," the Interfax news agency quoted Putin
as saying during a meeting with Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko in Minsk.
</P>

Lukashenko, for his part, thanked Putin for choosing Belarus

<P>
He expressed concern over the tense situation in Russia's
Caucasus region, where Russian troops are fighting Islamic rebels
in the Daghestan republic.

 "The Caucasus is our pain, our indignation, in a word, a
whole range of feelings," Lukashenko said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Bans Duty-free Import of Meat Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada approved Wednesday a ban on the importation and sale of
chicken, pork and beef by duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
The directive was based on Agriculture Secretary Edgardo
Angara's recommendation to stop the duty-free importation of these
products which poses unfair competitive to local producers.
</P>
<P>
Angara said local livestock and poultry producers have
expressed concern over the importation of these meat products
citing the inability of duty-free authorities to restrict their
sale within duty-free zones.
</P>
<P>
He said the share of duty-free shop's importation of these
products has also been found to be unusually high relative to
total imports.
</P>
<P>
As of August 1999, importation by duty-free shops accounted for
33 percent of total chicken imports, 11 percent of pork imports
and 9 percent of beef imports.
</P>
<P>
Angara said since those imported and sold by duty-free shops
are not covered by the minimum access volume (MAV) setup, this
does not support the agriculture sector to become more efficient
and competitive.
</P>
<P>
The MAV, which varies per commodity, is the import volume of a
farm product given low tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
As legally provided, the quantity allowed to be imported should
be equivalent to only three percent of a country's consumption of
that product.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, tariff for chicken has been pegged at 45 percent,
pork at 30 percent and beef at 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
For imports outside the MAV, tariff for chicken and pork has
been placed at 60 percent while beef, which has been liberalized,
is levied a 30 percent tariff.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Meets Venus Williams in Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams had to
overcome seven double-faults while Martina Hingis must whipped
wind that sent shots flying wildly before them to set up a
showdown in the semifinals of the U.S.Open.
</P>
<P>
This year's semifinal will be their second meet since two years
ago Hingis thrashed the inexperienced Williams 6-0,6-4 in the
final of her Open debut.
</P>
<P>
From 0-2 Tuesday, the top-ranked Hingis won 12 straight games
amid stiff gusts to stroll into the semis with a 6-2, 6-0 victory
over Germany's Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
The wind died down a bit after a brief shower in the evening,
and the No. 3 Williams unleashed an all-court attack that enabled
her to overcome serving woes in a 6-4, 6-3 win against No. 12
Barbara Schett of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 19, has won only three of her 10 matches against the
18-year-old Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Injuries continued to plague the men's draw, already weakened
by the loss of American Pete Sampras and Australia's Mark
Philippoussis before the tournament, as Sweden's Magnus Norman
became the seventh man to quit in midmatch.
</P>
<P>
Norman hurt his back and had to stop after losing the first set
7-6 (7-4) to No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, allowing the 1997
French Open champion from Brazil to advance to the quarterfinals
against Frenchman Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
Pioline, who knocked off No. 14 Tommy Haas of Germany 6-4, 7-5,
6-3, reached the Open final in 1993 and at Wimbledon in 1997, but
he has never won a Grand Slam tournament.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Todd Martin rallied after losing the first two sets to
beat No. 9 Greg Rusedski 5-7, 0-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 6-4. Rusedski
served for the match in the third and led 4-1 in the fifth set,
only to have Martin win 20 of the final 21 points.
</P>
<P>
In the quarters, Martin will play unseeded Slava Dosedel, who
downed Jiri Novak 6-4, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Norman, who won a tuneup tournament the day before the U.S.
Open,was the second Swede to pull out with an injury during this
year's event. Magnus Larsson retired from his third-round match
with seventh-seeded Todd Martin.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: China Not to Abandon Use of Force If Taiwan Seeks Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will by no means
abandon the use of force if there occurs "Taiwan independence" or
foreign intervention, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is purely China's internal affairs and China's
policy on this issue is "peaceful reunification" and the principle
of "one country, two systems", stressed Jiang in a joint press
conference with Australian Prime Minister John Howard following
their official talks in the morning.
</P>
<P>
He answered questions raised by reporters, and explained China'
s principled stance on the Taiwan issue and China's entry into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He stated that there was once a good momentum in the cross-
straits exchanges and Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits had originally planned to
visit Taiwan this fall.
</P>
<P>
However, Lee Teng-hui brazenly made the "two states" remarks,
Jiang said, which will by no means be accepted or allowed by the 1.
2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang meanwhile noted that the Taiwan issue is a very sensitive
issue in the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
After Lee made the "two states" remarks, Jiang said, U.S.
President Bill Clinton had time and again assured him that the U.S.
government would adhere to the "one China" policy, abide by the
three joint communiques between the U.S. and China, and adopt the
"three-no" policy
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the U.S. announced sales of advanced
weapons to Taiwan that were valued at 550 million U.S. dollars,
Jiang said, adding that the Chinese people can by no means
understand this.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. proposal that it hopes Wang Daohan would
visit Taiwan as scheduled, Jiang said that Wang's visit will not
come true unless the following two preconditions are met: one is
that Lee openly withdraws his "two states" remarks, and the other
is that Lee could only receive Wang in his capacity as the
Chairman of the Kuomintang, instead of the so-called "President of
the Republic of China".
</P>
<P>
Jiang is here for a state visit.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on China's Access to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Wednesday expounded China's principled stand on China'
s access to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Australian Prime Minister John
Howard after their meeting, Jiang said he talked with U.S.
President Bill Clinton on the question of restoring the lawful
seat of China in GATT, now called the WTO, during his meeting with
Clinton at the first informal meeting of leaders of Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Seattle of the United States, in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said: "I expounded three principles at the time, which
now remain applicable. Firstly, the WTO will not be comprehensive
without the entry of China, the largest developing country in the
world, since it is an international organization. Secondly, China
can only join the WTO as a developing country. Thirdly, there
should be a balance between China's rights and duties for its
entry into the organization."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia was bombed on
May 8 this year, and three Chinese were killed in the bombing. "
The U.S. government and President Clinton personally apologized to
us again and again. Nevertheless, the timing then was totally
inappropriate for the U.S. government to request that talks
between China and the United States on China's access to the WTO
continue. And therefore, the talks were suspended."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the United States has kept sending messages
requesting the resumption of talks with China since August. "
Recently, President Clinton wrote to me specially, on the question
of resumption of such talks. And I agreed in my reply. Thus, the
talks started again," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said some reports in Western media have alleged that it
is China that is eager to resume talks with the United States. "
This is not the fact," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said that he will attend the informal meeting of the
leaders of APEC, to be held in Auckland of New Zealand in a few
days, and is expected to meet President Clinton during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I think that China and the United States should proceed with
talks according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit to the United States in 1997 and
Clinton's visit to China in 1998, the two countries had originally
planned to solve the question concerning China's entry into the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue was not discussed, because of the reasons
reportedly lying with the U.S. Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the United States again lost a good opportunity
this spring when Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visited the United
States. At the time, the two countries could have reached an
agreement, and again, the reasons for the failure to reach an
agreement reportedly lay with the Congress, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, an agreement has been reached between China and Australia
on China's entry into the WTO. How the talks between China and the
United States will proceed and whether or not an agreement can be
reached depends, to a large extent, on the United States." Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: As Honeymoon Over, Economic Headaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- One-hundred days after
taking office, Nepali Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai has
drawn both praise and criticism for his performance.
</P>
<P>
The new government came into office on May 31 after the Nepali
Congress, the largest party in the country, won a comfortable
majority in the parliamentary election in early May.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the performance of the new government in the first
100 days, it appeared to have been on the course to fulfill its
promises.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai has reiterated his commitment that he will try to
change the face of the country within a period of three years. "I
am aiming for a tangible change in the living conditions of
average Nepalese," he said after he took office.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai's government has been focusing on solving the
pressing problems faced by the country, including poverty,
corruption, unemployment and the ultra-leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"My first and last priority is to root out corruption in
Nepal," Bhattarai told reporters the other day. "Those amassing
wealth beyond their reasonable means and found guilty of
corruption will be punished not only with prosecution, but also
with other instruments of deterrence," he said.
</P>
<P>
In its policies and programs presented at a joint sitting of
the parliament on July 1, the government identified poverty
alleviation as one of its priorities.
</P>
<P>
To meet its aim of poverty alleviation, the government has
brought up a campaign called Bishweshwar Among the Poor. The
program aims to help 20,000 absolutely poor families with soft
loans of up to 30,000 rupees (about 529 U.S. dollars) at 5 percent
interest rate to enable them to have access to integrated
facilities of shelter, income-generating schemes and the kind.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining law and order is another priority of the
government. To contain the ultra-leftist guerrillas who have been
causing unrest in some part of Nepal since 1996, the government
has introduced the Ganeshman Peace Campaign, which aims to help
those who give up the path of violence and terror and return to
lead a lawful and normal life.
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken other steps to get the country
out of heaps of problems, such as banning the polluting
three-wheeled vehicles to prevent air pollution, and implementing
the value-added tax to enlarge the income base, among others.
</P>
<P>
But there have been doubts whether the government's priorities
will be translated into actions.
</P>
<P>
Given all those problems and the dismal reality of the country,
the task of the new government is no less challenging than that of
the previous ones, even though it is a majority government which
is likely to enjoy stability for a considerable long time.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has seen six minority or coalition governments since 1994
because of political instability.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with about
45 percent of the country's 22 million population living below the
poverty line, and a per capita annual income of 200 dollars. And
only 40 percent of the people can read and write.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth was 2.1 percent in 1998, below the
population growth of 2.4 percent. The country had a fiscal deficit
estimated at 300 million dollars in 1998/1999. And about 60
percent of the development projects funds come from donors.
</P>
<P>
With numerous constraints and limited resources at disposal,
the present government faces a tough road.
</P>
<P>
"People expect religious-minded Bhattarai to take some drastic
actions towards achieving the goal of poverty alleviation, but it
is not being taken up," columnist Dhruvahari Adhikary wrote in a
weekly on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He promised to change the face of the country in three years,
but because of the decision to add one more weekly holiday, the
goal has now turned into a six-year plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Still there are some optimistic views about the Bhattarai
government.
</P>
<P>
Columnist Naresh Joshi wrote in The Rising Nepal Tuesday that
though the government faces a host of challenges, it is also
invested with hopes from the people.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Bhattarai's image and reputation as a man keen
to get things done is high. His political stature within and
outside the NC (Nepali Congress) inspires confidence among the
people that the Bhattarai cabinet will be in the business of
improving the quality of life of an average Nepali," Joshi wrote.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been implementing
an Education for All (EFA) program covering formal and non-formal
education which have turned 100,000 illiterates into literates
since the World Conference on Education for All held in Thailand
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The country has also drawn up a specific program for the year
2000, said Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, at a ceremony held
here Wednesday to mark the International Literacy Day.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 660,000 illiterates in 145 EFA townships
in Myanmar. Of the 240,000 learners, over 100,000 have become
literate.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Khin Nyunt, who is also chairman of the
Myanmar Education Committee, stressed the need to provide
continuing education to those who have obtained basic literacy.
</P>
<P>
Continuing education covers literacy promotion, income
generation and better life programs through reading circles,
libraries and community learning centers.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a Myanmar Literacy Resource Center (MLRC)
will be set up in the near future with the technical and financial
assistance of the Asia-Pacific Culture Center for the U.N.
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
He anticipated that the MLRC will be able to extend and expand
the literacy program in Myanmar. He emphasized the need for
effective implementation of the EFA program in the country with
active community participation to improve the health, fitness and
education standard of the Myanmar people.
</P>
<P>
The literacy rate of Myanmar in the early 19th century was
significantly high compared with some other countries.
</P>
<P>
After regaining independence in 1948, Myanmar, with a
population of approximately 17 million then, had a literacy rate
of only 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the Mass Education Law in 1948 and firstly
introduced the illiteracy eradication program, followed by a
national literacy campaign in 1964.
</P>
<P>
These literacy campaigns enabled 24 million of the people aged
15 and above to become literate.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar was awarded the Mohammed Reza Pahlavi Literacy Prize in
1971 and the Noma Prize in 1983 by the UNESCO for the success of
its literacy campaign.

the greenback at the Philippine Dealing System.
</P>
<P>
Traders blamed both internal and external factors to the
depreciation of the currency, which has recovered from last year's
unprecedented low level of 45 pesos against the greenback to 37-39
pesos level since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
They said the country's low interest policy increased liquidity
of the local currency while decreasing its value against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's unstable political situation triggered
mainly by the disputes of the Charter change also worried local
and foreign traders and attributed to the depreciation of the
peso.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the rates hike of the United States, the
risk of East Timor and the depreciation of other Asian currencies
also prompted fund managers to convert their holdings into dollars
which carried more stable yields.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, said earlier he might raise bank reserve requirements
or take other measures if the local currency breaches the 40 pesos
to one dollar psychological level.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Criticizes U.S. Laws on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Wednesday criticized foreign legislation and American
laws banning imports of goods being allegedly manufactured by
children.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day conference on "The State of Child Labor
in South Asia" here, Aziz said these laws need to clearly define
the child labor.
</P>
<P>
Referring to criticism by some western countries of Pakistan's
soccer industry for the involvement of children in football
manufacturing, Aziz said that 93 percent of child labor has been
removed from this industry, but soccer import is still banned
under the U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
He called for the effective implementation of the law
formulated for reducing and checking the practice of child labor
as well as raising the age of child from 14 to 15 years old in
terms of child labor laws.
</P>
<P>
He noted that significant progress has been made towards the
elimination of child labor. However, a lot still needs to be done
for the welfare of children in Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is the responsibility of the government to provide its
youth with the best available opportunities and possibilities,
where they can prosper and become useful members of the society,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that child labor is prevalent in most of the
developing countries as well as in some of the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a problem that is peculiar to any particular area or
region of the world," he said, adding "child labor is the directed
result of the prevailing endemic poverty that forces the child to
labor," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will take a series of
measures to reduce or remit taxation on foreign funded enterprises,
a Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
official announced here today.
</P>

Taxation on equipment, technology, fittings and spare parts
introduced by high-tech and export oriented enterprises and

purpose of technological upgrading will be exempted from import
tariffs in line with certain regulations, according to Ma Xiuhong,
MOFTEC assistant minister, at the China Fair for Investment and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
The business tax will be remitted when foreign-funded
enterprises transfer their technology to Chinese enterprises, Ma
said.

<P>
"The income tax will be even exempted for foreign-funded
enterprises involving advanced technology or with favorable
conditions after approval from the State taxation departments,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
And the sales tax from technological transfer by foreign-funded
enterprises and research and development centers will also be
exempted.

"Some foreign funded enterprises will enjoy preferential
taxation treatment when purchasing domestic equipment," Ma said.

enterprises in terms of finance, management and legal system and

<HEADLINE> World Bank Injects $7.16 Billion in Nigeria in 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has between 1959
and now injected 7.16 billion U.S. dollars into Nigeria's
economy, a leading Nigerian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian quoted Nigerian Finance Minister Mallam Ciroma as
saying in Abuja Tuesday that 5.879 billion dollars out of the
amount came as loans and credits.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the socio-economic benefits that the country has
derived from the implementation of World Bank assisted projects
over the years, coupled with the present administration's policy
of exploring new windows of opportunity, government has initiated
discussions with the World Bank with a view to accessing new
concessional facilities," Ciroma said.
</P>
<P>
Praising the international financial institution's assistance
in alleviating poverty in the country, he, however, lamented the
frequent and high turnover of project staff which, according to
him, assumed alarming proportions since the inception of the
Olusegun Obasanjo administration.
</P>
<P>
Ciroma identified inadequate counterpart funding as one of the
impediments to smooth implementation of the World Bank assisted
projects in the west African country, saying the "government will
continue to accord priority to the provision of counterpart funds
for the projects."

<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
APEC -- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation:
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia Pacific economies. It is a grouping of
21 regional economies set up to improve the stability, security
and prosperity of its peoples. Begun as an informal dialogue
group, APEC has since become the primary regional vehicle for
promoting free and open trade and investment, and practical
economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
ABAC -- APEC Business Advisory Council:
</P>
<P>
In 1995, APEC Economic Leaders established a permanent council
composed of up to three senior business people from each member
economy to provide advice on implementation of APEC action plans
and on the specific business sector priorities.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
ATL -- Accelerated Tariff Liberalization:
</P>
<P>
The Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) initiative
sought to liberalize trade in 15 key sectors ahead of the Bogor
2010/2020 timetable. At Kuala Lumpur, participating economies
agreed to transfer the tariff elements of the first nine sectors
to the WTO to broaden participation and seek binding negotiations.
</P>
<P>
As APEC Chair, New Zealand is coordinating discussion of those
elements, now known as the ATL initiative, in Geneva.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
CAP - - Collective Action Plans:
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC (MAPA), adopted by APEC Leaders
in 1996, includes the Individual and Collective Action Plans and
progress reports on joint activities outlined in Bogor. CAPs
essentially are "business plans" where APEC members collectively
outline plans for trade and investment liberalization, business
facilitation and ECOTECH in 14 areas: tariffs; non-tariff
measures; services; investment; standards and conformance; customs
procedures; intellectual property rights; competition policy and
law; deregulation; government procurement; rules of origin;
dispute mediation; mobility of business people; and implementation
of the WTO Uruguay Round.

on liberalizing and facilitating trade and investment. It works
to reduce impediments to business activity in 14 specific areas,
including tariff and non-tariff measures, services, intellectual
property rights, competition policy and dispute mediation.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
ECOTECH -- Economic and Technical Cooperation:
</P>
<P>
APEC's third pillar, economic and technical cooperation (trade
and investment liberalization and facilitation make up the first
and second pillars), covers a variety of capacity-building
activities conducted by APEC bodies. These are aimed at enhancing
members' -- especially developing members' -- ability to benefit
from the liberalization agenda and reducing disparities within the
diverse APEC region.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
IAP -- Individual Action Plans:
</P>
<P>
The Manila Action Plan for APEC (MAPA), adopted by APEC Leaders
in 1996, includes the Individual and Collective Action Plans and
progress reports on joint activities outlined in Bogor. IAPs are
the central mechanism by which each economy outlines their plans
for trade and investment liberalization, business facilitation and
ECOTECH in 14 areas: tariffs, non-tariff measures; services;
investment; standards and conformance; customs procedures;
intellectual property rights; competition policy and law;
deregulation; government procurement; rules of origin, dispute

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Police Officers Seek Training From Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has requested
Tanzania to train its police officers because Rwanda's police
force is not enough to handle the ever-increasing crime rate at
home.
</P>

Principal Secretary of the Rwandan Ministry of Home Affairs,
Seif Kamazi, made the request while meeting Tanzania's Inspector
General of Police, Omar Mahita, in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam
Tuesday.

Kamazi's delegation, which is in Tanzania for one-week visit,
is scheduled to tour a police college in north Tanzania's Moshi
town.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Seek More Overseas Investment in Central-Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma announced the move at the ongoing China Fair for Investment
and Trade hosted in Xiamen, a coastal city in east China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
"China will loosen conditions for setting up overseas-funded
enterprises and overseas investors' shareholding proportion in
enterprises in the central and western areas, which are
economically-underdeveloped as compared with coastal areas in the
eastern and southern areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, overseas-funded enterprises in the areas will
enjoy a 15-percent tax incentive for three more years after the
current term matures. At the same time, enterprises with over 25
percent overseas investment will enjoy the same preferential
policies as overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, overseas-funded enterprises already in operation
in coastal areas are encouraged to make investment or operate
business in overseas-funded or domestic enterprises in the central
and western areas," she said.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the State Council, the enterprises will be
free from tariffs while importing equipment, technological
facilities, fittings, and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
And China will allow development zones in the provinces and
autonomous regions of the central and western areas to apply for
the status as state-level economic and technological development
zones. But the number will be restricted to one for every province
or provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 80 percent of overseas investment for the
country are made in coastal areas. "There is a great need for
expansion of overseas investment in China's central and western
areas," Ma stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has given top priority to sprucing up
the country's central and western areas. Policies and measures,
including tax incentives, increase of fixed-asset investment, and
preferential terms for overseas investors, have been adopted to
accelerate the development pace of the region.

<HEADLINE> More Financial Aid to Overseas-Funded Businesses:Ministry Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China will allow eligible
overseas-financed businesses to issue A shares (for domestic
investors) or B shares (for overseas investors), Ma Xiuhong,
Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on investment policies at the
ongoing third China Fair for Investment and Trade, which opened
today in Xiamen, Fujian Province, Ma said that China would also
provide overseas investors who are funding State-favored sectors,
such as energy and transportation, with insurance policies against
potential risk.
</P>
<P>
Also revealed were a range of other new measures to give more
financial aid to overseas-backed firms in China, including the
establishment of a special industrial investment fund which would
ease the shortage of Chinese investors' equity stake in joint
ventures when overseas investors add funding.
</P>
<P>
When overseas-backed businesses borrow money inside China,
Chinese banks will be allowed to receive guarantees from overseas
share-holders, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
But loans in Chinese currency obtained by using guarantees from
overseas share-holders and from hard currencies should be in line
with China's industrial development policies. These loans can be
used to invest in fixed assets and used as working capital, and
must not be used to purchase foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded businesses will be permitted to use foreign
investors' assets abroad as mortgages at overseas branches of
Chinese banks, and they will get the need-based loans given by the
Chinese banks' overseas branches or domestic branches.
</P>
<P>
The China Fair for Investment and Trade, the third annual event,
runs from September 8-12.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Ironed out in Kenya's Mombasa Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Mombasa Port, the major one
along the Indian Ocean in southeastern Kenya, has announced that
it will be open for business as usual across the period of the Y2K
date change.
</P>
<P>
Mombasa is among the first of the world's major ports to make
such an announcement, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the confidence of the port to do so stems
not only from its own highly successful Y2K program but also from
its adherence to international standards and best practice.
</P>
<P>
By following the guidelines laid down by the International
Maritime Organization (IMO) and working closely to the standards
set by their colleagues in Hong Kong Port, Mombasa Port's Y2K team
has done tremendous work over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The compliance in turn provides the reassurance the
international shipping industry needs in order to plan its own Y2K
working arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K compliance for the port covers its cargo handling
equipment, its computer systems, its communications and general
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the ships have to attain the IMO's
certification of Y2K readiness, involving the entire vessels from
navigation systems through engines to safety and support
equipment. They must also carry a Y2K due diligence log.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that after September 30, 1999, vessels not
possession of the IMO certification and due diligence logs will be
refused entry to Mombasa Port.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Doctors Strike on Colleague Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's doctors Wednesday
staged a nation-wide strike to protest a verdict by a Beirut
military court that sentenced three doctors for negligence.
</P>
<P>
Doctors across the country heeded the Medical Syndicate's
call, stopping work for the day and dealing only with urgent
cases.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of physicians in white robe picketed the Lebanese
parliament in downtown Beirut to demand a legislation that
immunizes the medical profession against prosecution without
scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the demonstrators will meet House Speaker
Nabih Berri to extend their demands.
</P>
<P>
The military tribunal Tuesday night sentenced the three
accused doctors to five days in jail each for their negligence
which led to the death of an army sergeant.
</P>
<P>
Since the three doctors had spent more than one week in
custody during the investigation, they were released after the
trial.
</P>
<P>
The trial was the first of its kind in Lebanon's military
court history because the country does not have laws that pertain
specifically to medical malpractice and dissatisfied patients or
their families usually have to resort to civil courts.
</P>
<P>
The case sparked strong protest and criticism from the
country's medical associations.
</P>
<P>
Ghattas Khouryt, the head of Medical Syndicate for Beirut and
North Lebanon, said "we are not against doctors facing up to their
responsibilities, but we don't accept that they be treated like
criminals."
</P>
<P>
"We are against their arrest, because we know this will create
a crisis between doctors and patients," he added.

<HEADLINE> Lectures and Homework Efficient But Unlovely: Student Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of Chinese
primary and middle school students shows that while they'll admit
lectures and homework are a good way to learn, they would prefer a
livelier curriculum that involves hands-on experience, computer-
assisted training, and out-of-class reading of their favorite
subjects.
</P>
<P>
"The old-fashioned, 'efficient' learning techniques are meant
to help students cope with exams," says Dr. Zheng Xinrong of
Beijing Normal University, who headed the survey sponsored by the
China Juvenile Research Center (CJRC). "Most students cannot
improve their efficiency through their favorite style of learning.
"
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 students from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai
municipalities, and Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan,
Sichuan and Guangdong provinces answered the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
"It's human nature, especially the nature of children, to
acquire knowledge through hands-on learning. But the Chinese
educational system is yet to highlight this active way of studying,
" Zheng says.
</P>
<P>
In today's information age, rote memorization is no longer as
effective for young people and has been knocked off its pedestal
by experiential learning, says Dr. Zheng.
</P>
<P>
However, standard-answer tests have long been a feature of
China's education system, she says, and are still believed to be
the best preparation for difficult exams.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the parents polled agreed their children
should take the initiative to determine which learning style
offers the best fit, but they worried that students who study by
themselves might be wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
"Most students and their parents do believe that the
traditional way of memorizing is out of date," Dr. Zheng says. "
But the reality of the Chinese exam-evaluation system cannot make
their ideal choice of a learning style a possibility, at least for
now."
</P>
<P>
She says that the key to developing a quality education system
in China is to re-structure the current one.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Japanese Man Stabs 8 People, Killing 2 in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese man stabbed eight
people at random in a bustling district in Tokyo on Wednesday
morning, killing two and injuring six others, police said.
</P>
<P>
The victims, including five men and three women, were stabbed
in the downtown Ikebukuro district. They were taken to hospital,
where two of them died later.
</P>
<P>
Of the six others, one sustained serious injuries, while the
remaining five suffered minor injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police identified the assailant as Hiroshi Zoda, a 23-year-old
without a job or a fixed address.
</P>
<P>
The suspect apparently first attacked people coming up by
escalator to the ground floor of a large-scale do-it-yourself
store and then went onto a street, swinging a knife at passers-by,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Zoda, who was later seized by passers-by and arrested initially
on suspicion of attempted murder, said he committed the act
because he lost job and was irritated, police said.
</P>
<P>
Zoda said he had become jobless about a week ago and around
that time decided he wanted to kill someone, according to police.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Reactivate Barter Trade With Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is to reactivate
barter trade with Myanmar as this approach has proven to benefit
both countries in the past, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, reached an agreement in this regard when he visited
Myanmar last month, Ling told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
During Ling's meeting with Myanmar trade and economic planning
ministers, the two sides agreed to reactivate barter trade which
ceased several years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries would sign a memorandum of
understanding soon to formalize their intention to reactivate the
bilateral barter trade.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the Myanmar government had previously regarded barter
trade as illegal trading but has now concurred with Malaysia's
stance that both countries stand to benefit much from such trading
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that the now-defunct barter trade between Malaysia's
northern state of Pulau Pinang and Myanmar once stood at 800
million ringgit (over 210 million U.S. dollars) a year, which he
said "is a very attractive figure."

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Confidence of Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted recently by
MasterCard International showed that the Chinese consumers are
optimistic about the quality of life and China's economic
development while they are mainly worried about employment issue.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out in 13 Asia-Pacific countries and
regions including Australia, China, India, Japan and Republic of
Korea, asks the respondents to predict the future of five economic
factors which include: employment, the economy, regular income,
the stock market and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The current survey asked consumers for their views on the
period from June to December 1999.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the answers, the MasterIndex of consumer
confidence is calculated based upon ranges from 0 to 100, with 0
as the most pessimistic and 100 as most optimistic. The index
error was five percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey is held twice a year and was introduced in the
general Asia-Pacific region in 1993 and in China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest index shows that most Asian people believe the
region is back on its feet and that they are optimistic about the
market.
</P>
<P>
The result of the China survey, carried out in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, indicated that the index has increased to
63.6 from last time's 54.7. The current score is the highest of
the last three.

Three years later, the macro-economic control measures adopted
by the central government reached the anticipated targets, the
national economy successfully realized a "soft landing", providing
a solid basis for national economy to enjoy a fast, sustainable
and healthy development in a fairly long period, as well as for
the country to enjoy a long-term political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The "soft landing" not only helped China to minimize the risks
arising from the subsequent Asian financial crisis, but also
enabled China to maintain its currency stable, contributing
greatly to protecting regional economic stability, which has been
generally acknowledged by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Concentrating on its modernization drive, China needs a stable
environment both domestically and internationally, especially
friendly relations with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has always devoted to global
peace and stability. So far China has signed boundary agreements
with 10 of its 15 neighbors, creating the best time of
relationship with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have suffered bitterly from alien invasions
and wars in history, this is the first time in China's modern
history since the Opium War that the nation is able to concentrate
on construction amid peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
More and more people from the international community have held
that China's stability and development have strong impact on both
Asian and global peace and development.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry
said Wednesday government troops have killed 11 Tamil rebels of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in their latest
fighting in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that government troops on Tuesday killed
six LTTE rebels in two confrontations in the northern Jaffna area,
the former stronghold of the LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
It said that the troops also killed five Tamil rebels in three
separate clashes in the Wanni area, the venue where the government
troops have launched a series of operations against the LTTE since
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year old war between the
Sinhalese majority dominated government and the Tamil minority
rebels who demand a separate homeland in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the
long-running ethnic clashes. Official figures showed that between
1995 and July this year a total of 21,999 people were either
killed or presumed missing.

<P>
Charles Tank, who rates China's banks at Moody's in New York,
said that the AMC scheme "should deliver substantial benefits to
the four banks in terms of enhanced asset quality and capital
levels, and enhanced profitability and liquidity."
</P>
<P>
As for the enterprises, those selected as qualified for debt-to-
equity swaps have to have viable market for their products,
advanced technology, and efficient management.
</P>
<P>
In applying for such conversions, they also have to submit
persuasive drafts elaborating on matching measures they would take
to improve performance such as reducing the workforce,
establishing a modern enterprise mechanism, and improving
management.
</P>
<P>
According to the AMC scheme, after the economic situation of
the enterprise has taken a turn for the better, the shares
controlled by the AMC will be returned to the enterprises, either
by listing the company, transfer or buy-back by the enterprise
concerned.
</P>
<P>
No single remedy exists for China's SOE reform, nor should debt-
to-equity swaps be taken as the final measure by all State
enterprises to evade repaying bank loans, according to Zhang
Chunlin, an expert on SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
The policy is intended to prioritize companies with high asset-
liability ratios, which have resulted from the lack of
recapitalization by the State in the past, and these companies
should have few fundamental weaknesses outside of a large
inherited debt burden, Zhang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Envisioning the nation's two-decade SOE reform, Zhang said, "
While those qualified enterprises will take advantage of the debt-
to-equity swaps and improve performance, about one-third or even
more State enterprises will have to be liquidated in the end and
stop wasting social resources."

BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- With an asset-liability ratio
of more than 117 percent, Beijing Cement Plant is virtually
bankrupt in economists' eyes.
</P>
<P>
But company managers have never been as optimistic about the
plant's prospects: they expect more than 20 million yuan in net
profit for next year after 70 percent of the plant's equity stake
is transferred to the loaner, the Xinda Asset Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
The plant is the first, followed by the Shanghai Coking Co. Ltd,
to benefit from a nationwide campaign to examine and clear bad
debts the State-owned sector has owed the major State banks.
Experts estimate these debts will involve about one trillion yuan
(about 120.9 billion U.S. dollars) of non-performing loans
belonging to about a half of the total SOEs.
</P>
<P>
To meet its goal, China has set up four asset management
companies (AMCs) -- Huarong, Xinda, Changcheng, Dongfang -- to
absorb the non-performing loans of its four big banks, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank,
Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China.

After taking over these banks' non-performing loans and
converting the bad debts into shares in the enterprises, the AMCs
will earn dividends and can take part in decision-making at the
firms.
</P>
<P>
"Swapping the debts of some qualified enterprises for equity
stake in the enterprises will rescue them from the edge of
bankruptcy and enable them to improve performance, instead of
liquidating all the deficit-ridden State enterprises
indiscriminately," said an official surnamed Duan from the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Hailed as the boldest move ever adopted in reforming the debt-
ridden State-owned sector, the debt-to-equity swaps are expected
to create a win-win situation for both the loaners and the debtors,
economists said.

<HEADLINE> China Industry Grows Faster in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China's industry grew faster
in August than in July, with state-owned and foreign funded
sectors expanding more rapidly and the private sector slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBC) show that
industrial output totaled 166.6 billion yuan in August, increasing
9.5 percent year-on-year. The growth rate was 0.2 percentage
points higher than in July.
</P>
<P>
Increasing government investment in fixed assets and
technological innovation helped boost the growth rate of output of
state-owned enterprises by 0.6 percentage points over July.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funded enterprises continued to lead the country's
industry in terms of output growth, increasing 13.7 percent year-
on-year and 0.8 percentage points more than in July.
</P>
<P>
However, lackluster investment activity in the private sector
pulled its growth rate down by 2.6 percentage points in August.
Industrial output of the private sector grew by 11 percent in
August, compared with 13.6 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Exports of industrial products surged by 13.1 percent year-on-
year, 6.5 percentage points higher than the average growth rate of
the previous seven months.
</P>
<P>
Output of raw materials continued to grow in August. Sales of
industrial products also improved.

<HEADLINE> Massive Gas Field Found in Northern China Basin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Wenrui, director of the Changqing Petroleum Exploration
Bureau (CPEB), a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC), said his firm confirmed a gas-bearing area of
2,500 square kilometers in the Ordos basin in early September,
precluding the verification of two gas zones with 100 billion
cubic meters of proven reserves each.
</P>
<P>
After 50 years of exploration, CPEB has located a total of 36
oil-gas fields in the Ordos basin, the country's second largest
sedimentary basin with an area of 370,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Ordos basin sprawls across Shaanxi, Shanxi and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous
regions. China's first oil well was sunk in Ordos in 1907.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, cumulative proven hydrocarbon reserves
there were reported to be 1.05 billion tons, of which 600 million
tons remain untapped.
</P>
<P>
Based on current exploration results, CPEB's geologists believe
that potential hydrocarbon reserves in the Ordos basin are around
12 billion tons, of which gas reserves are six to eight trillion
cubic meters, accounting for nearly 20 percent of the national
total.
</P>
<P>
Currently, CPEB has an annual crude production capacity of 4.3
million tons. The bureau also has an annual natural gas production
capacity of 2.2 billion cubic meters and three long-distance
pipelines transporting gas to Beijing, Xi'an and Yinchuan are now
operational. By 2003, targeted output for the region is expected
to generate 10 million tons of oil equivalent.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Calls for Integrated Efforts to Raise Literacy Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has called for integrated efforts to raise the
literacy rate as well as improve education standard in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the International Literacy Day Wednesday,
Sharif underlined the need to realize the fact that quick take-off
for development is not possible without achieving 80 percent
literacy rate in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"And to achieve this target we, as a nation, will have to take
extra-ordinary measures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif asked the intellectuals, writers, journalists,
educationists and representatives of non-governmental
organizations (NGO) to come forward and contribute to this noble
cause so that inequalities of educational opportunities could be
removed altogether within a short span of time.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistani government has decided to take
revolutionary steps for achieving a target of 70 percent literacy
rate by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The National Education Policy is intended to raise primary
enrollment from 74.8 percent to 90 percent by the year 2002, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide quality primary education facilities to all
the school age children, 45,000 new primary schools will be
established in the country, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Literacy Commission (PMLC), he said, has
been assigned the task of formulating and implementing a
comprehensive non-formal primary education program under which
free education facilities will be provided to the deprived
segments of the society.
</P>
<P>
"The PMLC would set up 82,000 new community schools by the year
2003. This program is aimed at multiplying the government's
endeavors in providing primary education to millions of children,"
said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that Pakistan is now spending 2.2 percent of its
GNP on education. "This is being gradually increased to four
percent by the year 2003."

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains that hit the
southern part of Zhejiang, a coastal province in east China, last
Saturday have resulted in the deaths of 153 people, according to
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rain, causing mountain flooding and landslides, swept
across the cities of Wenzhou and Taizhou and Lishui Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Rain inundated seven counties, and affected seven others and
233 townships. Floodwaters also affected 4.92 million people,
besieged 1,028 villages and left 10,600 people homeless in the
three areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 117,000 hectares of crops were damaged and some major
hydro-electric, transportation and communication facilities were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The State and provincial governments have sent rescue teams to
the flooded areas. Some 720,000 people have been evacuated to
safer areas, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
This past June, a severe flood hit northern part of Zhejiang,
killing 32 people and causing economic loss of about 10.5 billion
yuan.

<P>
Uranium ore deposits have also been discovered in the
northwestern area of the basin while a further six trillion tons
of potential sylvine deposits are estimated to be buried in the
central region of the basin.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these finds, geothermal energy resources have been
reported in the southern and western rims of the basin, all buried
at shallow strata and located in a densely-populated area which
will facilitate easy development and provide a promising potential
market.
</P>
<P>
However, the CPEB's most surprising and exciting discovery, and
the one which has attracted most attention from some quarters, is
of vast underground water resources in the central and northern
areas of the basin; a place where the local people have long been
combating drought.
</P>
<P>
A bureau survey indicates that there are water reserves of 11
trillion cubic meters at a depth of less than 600 meters covering
an area of 140,000 square kilometers. The freshwater resources are
reckoned to be close to seven trillion cubic meters. Once water
pipelines are constructed, all regions in the locality could see
an end to the threat of droughts, said sources from CPEB.
</P>
<P>
Other discoveries in the basin include gypsum, asbestos,
limestone, quartzite and bentonite.
</P>
<P>
The Ordos basin is a comparatively poverty-stricken area. And
the CPEB's discovery is expected to give a strong boost to the
local economy.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin: China's Stance on Taiwan Issue Remains Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China stands "very firm" on
the principle of safeguarding sovereignty and territorial
integrity, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here
Wednesday during talks with Australian Prime Minister John Howard.
</P>
<P>
He said that Lee Teng-hui's recent "two states" remarks
represent a very dangerous step towards splitting China, as their
essence is to completely defy and abandon the internationally
acclaimed "one China" stance.
</P>
<P>
Lee's separatist remarks and activities have damaged the
stability in Taiwan and undermined the political basis of the
cross-straits relations, leading to tension and deterioration in
the cross-straits relations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed China's strong opposition to any remarks or
activity aimed at undermining China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, saying that the country is against the "two Chinas" and
the "one China, one Taiwan" viewpoints, or any attempt or activity
that leads to Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation of Australian leaders' remarks in
favor of the "one China" policy on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
Howard, on his part, reiterated Australia's stand of firmly
following the "one China" policy.

<HEADLINE> DVD Software Market to Expand in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- A market analysis report
released Tuesday predicted that 11 percent of U.S. homes will own
at least one DVD device by the end of 1999, and 58 percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to Strategy Analytics forecast, U.S. sales of DVD
software will reach 57 million discs this year, worth 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars, and by 2005 more than 1.3 billion discs will be
shipped annually, worth 36 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annual sales of DVD devices will reach 9.1 million units in
1999 and will continue to soar, reaching 52 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
TV-based DVD video players are becoming the format of choice
for movie fans and videophiles, the market research firm said. DVD
also will become a standard feature of home PC systems within the
next year or so.
</P>
<P>
DVD PCs currently account for 75 percent of the installed base,
the research firm said, but this share will fall to 59 percent by
2002 as TV-based DVD becomes more widespread.
</P>
<P>
Currently only 4 percent of U.S. households own DVD video
players. But Strategy Analytics predicted that the shift from
video home systems to DVD software will happen quite rapidly,
since early DVD owners are the avid movie and video enthusiasts
who account for a major share of pre-recorded video sales and
rentals.
</P>
<P>
"DVD is set to become the dominant packaged media platform for
the next decade," the firm said. "DVD players will be everywhere,
and discs will be even more pervasive than CDs are today."

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials End Talks on Ministerial Meeting Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum ended their
talks here Wednesday on the agenda of the forthcoming ministerial
meeting preceding the 7th informal meeting of APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the meeting agreed to the outline of the
papers that will be presented to the APEC ministerial meeting
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, New Zealand's Maarten Wevers,
chairman of the senior officials meeting, told a press conference
after the conclusion of the talks.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the participants did not reach a final
agreement on all the issues discussed. According to the official,
the discussions over the past two days generally focused on three
major topics proposed by New Zealand -- to expand opportunities
for doing business throughout the region, to work with other
economies to strengthen the functioning of markets and to broaden
support for and understanding of APEC in its respective
communities.
</P>
<P>
"What we have been doing here over the last couple of days was
to put final touches on specific proposals and papers," he said.
Specifically, he said that the participants discussed individual
and collective action plans, APEC's contribution to the World
Trade Organization, the issues of electronic commerce, business on
the Internet, trade facilitation among a broad range of other
issues.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the senior officials meeting, APEC
foreign and trade ministers will meet here over the next two days
to make preparations for the 7th informal meeting of APEC leaders
on September 12-13.
</P>
<P>
APEC was established in 1989 in response to the growing
interdependence among Asia-Pacific economies. It is a grouping of
21 regional economies set up to improve the stability, security
and prosperity of its peoples.
</P>
<P>
It now groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, China's
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> China Stepping Up Improvement of Forest Ecosystem (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is attaching greater importance to the improvement of its
forest ecosystem in an effort to raise the forest cover from the
present 13.9 percent to 19.4 percent in the next ten years,
according to the State Administration of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The country's afforestation project has enjoyed substantial
growth since the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949 in terms of quantity and quality as well as economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The past twenty years witnessed a drastic annual increase of
four million hectares of afforestation plus 2.4 billion trees
planted by volunteers each year.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has successfully preserved 34.3 million ha. of
afforestation, ranking the first in the world. More than one third
of the country's provinces and autonomous regions have taken full
advantage of the waste land suitable for tree planting.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the country has launched ten key afforestation
projects including building shelter forests in northern,
northeastern and northwestern China with a view to fending off
wind and sand from the desert lands in the north, tree-planting
along the Yangtze River for soil-erosion control, and anti-
desertification campaigns aimed at curbing loss of arable land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the shelter forests in the north have
spread across 25.8 million hectares with the forest cover rising
from 5.1 percent in 1975 to 8.6 percent in those regions.
</P>
<P>
Newly planted trees in China's Loess Plateau, which sheds some
1.4 billion tons of sand and silt into the Yellow River each year,
have brought soil erosion in nearly one third of the area under
control.

<P>
Meanwhile, the upper and middle reaches of China's longest
river the Yangtze has been covered by 4.1 million ha. of
afforestation, which has reduced soil erosion in more than 100
counties in the valley.
</P>
<P>
The anti-desertification drive has also paid off with 64.4
million ha. of desert reclaimed during the 1992-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13.3 million ha. of farmlands in desert areas are
now protected by forests.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has committed itself to the protection
of natural resources, and a system to protect the country's wild
life is also taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there were 630 nature reserves in
China at the end of 1997, covering an area of 61.5 million ha., 6.
4 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Among these are 14 zones included in the United Nation's "Man
and the Biosphere" network and seven zones listed in the
international list of important wetlands.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has established 873 forest parks across the
country, covering 7.5 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the ever-improving ecosystem, rare and extinct
species of animals are now increasing steadily in numbers
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
However, at present the number of wild giant pandas still
remains at a perilously low 1,000 while the number of Chinese
alligators is only a little over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"Through the improvement of forest ecosystem featuring
protection of natural resources and wild life, China will take on
a new look with more beautiful scenery and a healthier environment,
" said Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forest Administration.

More than 600 aftershocks shook Athens until dawn Wednesday,
with the latest two both registering 4.2 on the Richter scale at 6:
20 a.m. and 6:35 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 firemen, 400 soldiers and 25 units from the special

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Export Rises Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's coffee exports during
the past coffee year from October 1998 to August 1999 show steady
rise in both volume and value.
</P>
<P>
The export volume and value has risen by 21.4 percent and 3.5
percent respectively compared to the same period last year,
according to a monthly report of the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports made so far this year stand at 3.43 million bags
(60 kilograms per bag), an increase of 13.1 percent over the
1997/98 cumulative total, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the improvement in the level of
performance volume- wise to the generally good weather and better
husbandry practices due to enhance extension services.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative value of exports for the same period stood at 268
million U.S. dollars, up from 260 million dollars in the
corresponding period of last season.
</P>
<P>
Plummeting prices on the international market is blamed for the
 relatively low percentage rise in value.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Uganda's top foreign exchange earner followed by fish
and cotton. Coffee export accounts for more than half of the
country's foreign exchange reserves.

<HEADLINE> New China Grows Amid Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Over the past month, China has
concentrated its efforts on exposing and criticizing the fallacies
of the Falun Gong cult, and the great power and effectiveness of
the struggle demonstrates the close attention the Chinese
government stresses on political stability and its determination
to protect that status.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with the former President of the United States
George Bush in early 1989, Deng Xiaoping, architect of China's
opening up and reform policies, said that "for China, the
overwhelming need is stability." This has been reiterated and
confirmed by President Jiang Zemin in recent times.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years of New China's development has proven that their
assessment of the situation is correct, and this has increasingly
been acknowledged by overseas people.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing New China's half century of history, there were
periods of stable development. Shortly after the founding of the
People's Republic, the central government adopted the principle of
concentrating on the development of social productive forces in an
bid to gradually meet people's growing material and cultural needs.
</P>
<P>
During the first Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957), the output
value of industry and agriculture grew 18 percent and 4.5 percent,
respectively, while a number of key infrastructure projects that
were critical to the national economy and people's livelihoods
were completed.
</P>
<P>
However, there were also bitter lessons to be learned when
instability seriously harmed the national economy and social
development. This social unrest resulted from the "Cultural
Revolution" (1966-1976), known as the "Ten-year catastrophe",
which drove the national economy to the verge of destruction.
</P>
<P>
The "Cultural Revolution" left all businesses in China awaiting
rejuvenation. The second generation leaders of the Communist Party
led by Deng Xiaoping correctly judged the situation and timely
shifted the Party and the government's working focus from
political struggle to economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Poll Gives President Obasanjo Pass Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 6 (Xinhua) -- A poll found that a majority of
the respondents in Nigeria thought President Olusegun Obasanjo had
performed above average in his first hundred days in office.
</P>
<P>
The poll conducted last week by The Post Express newspaper said
that among the 553 persons polled, 339 representing 61.30 percent
said that the president had done well in addressing the problems
confronting Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results released by the paper Monday, 164
persons or 29.66 percent of the respondents, did not think the
president has done well while 50 persons or 9.04 percent were
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
Most of those who gave the president a pass mark praised his
handling of the fuel crisis which characterized the General Sani
Abacha era and continued till the handing over of the power by the
military to the new civilian administration in May this year.
</P>
<P>
They also commended Obasanjo administration's policies towards
better telephone services, employment generation and the
retirement of military officers.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, nearly all those who said that the president
had not done well criticized his tardiness in addressing the
electricity problem which has crippled many small and medium-scale
industries and made life painful for ordinary Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
They also slammed the president for not moving decisively
against armed robbers and other social miscreants who have made
the nation's major cities unsafe for law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the nationwide poll sought an assessment of
the performance of the president by Nigerians of all walks of
life, including men and women of diverse political persuasion and
ethnic background.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Cabinet Reshuffle Draws Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet reshuffle designed
to streamline public service and enhance efficiency has drawn
different reactions, mainly along partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
Richard Leakey, Head of Civil Service, threw his weight behind
the reshuffle announced Monday by Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi, and urged Kenyans to fully support it.
</P>
<P>
Leakey described the reshuffle, with the number of the
ministries dwindling from 27 to 15 and one ministry having more
than one head, as "the best thing that has ever happened to Kenya
in recent times", according to Wednesday's East African Standard
daily.
</P>
<P>
The move will help reduce the government's pay package and cut
down on expenditure incurred annually in renting offices and
fueling cars for ministers, Leakey said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators, led by Mwai Kibaki, however, dismissed
the reshuffle as inconsequential to Kenya's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"It is an exercise in futility and a big disappointment to the
nation. It will lead to inefficiency and confusion," Kibaki said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stock brokers said that the stock market was still waiting for
the government's full economic recovery blueprint before any
comments could be made.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Association of Manufacturers welcomed the changes as
evidence of Moi's seriousness to jump-start the stalled economy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been on the decline since the International
Monetary Fund suspended its 205 million U.S. dollars loan in July
1997 in protest against corruption and poor governance in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth dropped from 4.6 percent in 1996 to 2.3
percent in 1997. In 1998 it stood at 1.8 percent and this year it
is expected to be less than 1.6 percent.

data for the April-June quarter may be worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 66.12 points, or 0.37
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 17,641.38.

Stagnant capital investment by Japanese companies, announced by
the Finance Ministry on Tuesday, has stirred fears that the second-
quarter GDP will be lower than expected, a dealer said. Japan's
GDP data is scheduled to be released on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section remained sluggish, edging down to
484.58 million shares from 487.07 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electronic Corp. was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
Investors generally sit on the sidelines ahead of the GDP
announcement, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Share prices, however, will not fall sharply even if the GDP
figures are lower than expected, as weak GDP data will force the
government to take additional stimulus measures to boost the
economy, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers by 831 to 363, with 144 issues remaining

On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar rose against the

<P>
At 5 p.m., the U.S. currency was quoted at 111.20-24 yen, up
from 110.77-80 yen at 9 a.m., and from 110.70-80 yen in late

<HEADLINE> Outlook Negative for Global Reinsurance Industry: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- The global ratings agency
Standard &AMP; Poor's said Tuesday that outlook for the global
reinsurance industry remains negative.
</P>
<P>
This is because combined ratios are expected to rise as pricing
and low reserve levels compound to generate underwriting losses,
the agency said in a global industry report.
</P>
<P>
"While investment income on the very strong capital levels
bailed out most reinsurers last year, these returns are not
sustainable over the long term," added the report.
</P>
<P>
Reinsurance refers to insuring under a contract by which a
first insurer is relieved of part or all of the risk, which
devolves upon another insurer.
</P>
<P>
For the global reinsurance market, Standard &AMP; Poor's pointed
out two themes that have held constant throughout the 1990s --
globalization and flight to quality. "These themes will remain
dominant through the next decade as the second tier of reinsurers
struggle to achieve scale and broaden the range of products and
services provided," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also discussed the emerging convergence of insurers
with banks and the capital markets, with reinsurers at a critical
nexus of this trend.
</P>
<P>
"Reinsurers are performing a number of roles from the provider
of risk to packaging and, perhaps most frequently, as purchasers
of insurance-linked bonds," the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, capital market alternatives are still too costly, too
cumbersome and too time-consuming to represent an immediate threat
to reinsurers. Nevertheless, the ratings agency warns that
disintermediation is a real threat to the industry.

<HEADLINE> New China Grows Amid Stability (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 50 years of development, especially the past 20 years,
China's total economic volume has climbed to the seventh in the
world, with comprehensive national strength obviously increased,
international status constantly raised and people's lives largely
improved.
</P>
<P>
An official with the World Bank said: "Other countries would
have to spend centuries to reach the achievements that China has
in one generation."
</P>
<P>
With 900 million rural residents, the stability of rural areas
is essential to the national good. In the early 1980s, China
introduced the household contract responsibility system with
remuneration linked to output in rural areas, which greatly
motivated farmers' enthusiasm in production and resulted in
unprecedented prosperity in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
To date, the average annual income of Chinese farmers has risen
from 44 yuan (about 5.5 U.S. dollars) 50 years ago to more than 2,
100 yuan (about 256 U.S. dollars) now, the issue of providing
adequate food and clothing to the 1.2 billion people has been
basically solved, and China is entering a stage of comfortable
life for its people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always paid attention to stability
through the whole process of reform and development, pilot
projects always preclude key national reforming measures. The
enduring needs of the masses and all social sectors are taken into
full consideration to ensure that all reforms proceed in a stable
social environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also been strictly vigilant over
issues which have emerged in the process of reform and development
that may affect stability, and promptly adopted measures to solve
them.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, facing an "overheated" economy and inflation pressure,
the Chinese government adopted appropriately tight financial and
monetary policies to strictly control money supply, stabilize
financial situation and control the scale of infrastructure
construction.

year.
</P>
<P>
Near 850 exhibitors will come from the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"The large number of exhibitors from this region assumes even
greater significance in view of the economic status of Asia on the
world stage," Roloff said here today.

information technology, network computing, automatic data capture,
software consulting and services, telecommunications, office
automation, bank technology, card technology and security

"An extensive program of joint displays, conferences, forum
events and company presentations completes the list of attractions,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
"Launched in 1986, the CeBIT has witnessed a constant increase
of exhibitors and visitors. It is expected to attract about 600,
000 to 70,000 visitors this time," Roloff noted.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Hails King's Visit to Kuwait As Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials hailed King
Abdullah Bin Hussein's just concluded visit to Kuwait as a
successful landmark which would herald a new era in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The visit marked a new beginning of Jordanian-Kuwaiti
relations, Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabedh said in a
statement after Abdullah concluded his two-day official visit to
Kuwait on Tuesday, the first by a Jordanian ruler in nearly a
decade.
</P>
<P>
"The summer clouds between the two countries" had disappeared,
the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
In a departure cable to Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Ahmad Sabah,
Abdullah said Jordan would stand by the emirate over the prisoner
issue, a sensitive issue between Iraq and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait claims that Iraq was holding some 600 Kuwaiti war
prisoners captured during the 1990 Gulf Crisis, triggered by
Iraq's invasion of the emirate. Iraq denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
Amman hoped King Abdullah's visit to Kuwait would restore
bilateral ties to levels prior to the Gulf Crisis, during which
Kuwait severed its ties with Jordan and accused Amman of siding
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After taking the throne in February this year, Abdullah is
apparently following a policy of keeping friendly relations with
all Arab countries, including its neighbor Iraq and Iraq's arch
Arab foes Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said on many occasions that his kingdom would not
improve ties with one country at the expense of another.
</P>
<P>
Currently Jordan depends on Iraq as its only source of crude
oil, importing some 75,000 barrels a day from Baghdad under the
United Nations' oil-for-food program for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan also hoped to reopen the labor markets in
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as labor export was one of the pillar
industries of the debt-ridden desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian workers in Kuwait had remitted billions of dollars
back home each year before they were expelled from the emirate
during the Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Less than 30,000 Jordanians are currently working in Kuwait as
against 350,000 before the Gulf Crisis.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Lowers Fuel Prices Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has lowered gasoline
prices by 200 Lebanese pounds (about 0.13 U.S. dollars) per 20
liters, the second drop after two prices hikes in August, the
Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a decrease in world oil prices, Lebanese Oil Minister
Suleiman Traboulsi decreed that a 20-liter tank of 92 octane
gasoline would cost 12,500 pounds (about 8.33 dollars), unleaded
gasoline would be priced at 12,800 pounds (about 8.53 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decree also lowered the price per 20 liters of 98
octane gasoline to 12,900 pounds (about 8.6 dollars), increased
the cost of kerosene from 6,600 pounds (about 4.4 dollars)
to 6,800 pounds (about 4.53 dollars), and kept the cost of
diesel fuel at 6,100 pounds (about 4.06 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decrease followed a 200 pounds cut last week. The
minister has said that prices will be modified on a weekly
basis according to fluctuations in international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
In August, prices first rose 400 pounds (about 0.26
dollars) and then 300 pounds (about 0.2 dollars). In April,
the Cabinet imposed a 2,000 pounds (about 1.33 dollars) surtax
on every 20 liters to bolster the government's coffers.
</P>
<P>
Traboulsi said the hikes were necessary to offset increases
in international prices.

<P>
HARARE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) board is
expected to approve a 140 million U.S. dollars structural
adjustment credit to Zimbabwe, an official of the bank has said.
</P>
<P>
World Bank resident representative to Zimbabwe Thomas Allen
said Tuesday that he was optimistic next Thursday's meeting would
agree to release the funds from the bank's International
Development Association.
</P>
<P>
The money to support a program to get Zimbabwe's economy back
on track would be followed by a further two follow-up structural
adjustment credits if the program remained on track, the Herald
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's intention to provide structural adjustment credit
comes in the wake of last month's approval of a 194-million-dollar
standby facility by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Allen said recent developments in the country's land
resettlement were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Workable land reform could contribute significantly to poverty
reduction, he said. But the World Bank official expressed
disappointment at the rate at which the land reform was taking
place.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Get Import Trade Financing Facility with IDB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Industry Bank
Wednesday signed here with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) the
Import Trade Financing (ITF) Facility agreement, amounting to 10
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The facility, which is offered on short term basis, is to
assist Malaysian importers in the purchase of materials such as
industrial raw materials, intermediate goods and capital goods
from member countries as well as non-member countries of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Bank Industry Malaysia Executive Director Mohamed Saleh Ghazali
told reporters that there were already few companies which could
be provided with this facility and he was confident that the total
amount, which was approved on June 19, 1999, will be fully
disbursed by next year.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth line of ITF facility. The bank received the
first line of ITF amounting to 10 million dollars in 1988, while
the second and third line agreements, amounting to 10 million
dollars each were signed in December 1991 and February 1997
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The three lines had since been fully utilized and in total, 26
companies had benefited from the previous ITF facilities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Industry was appointed by the Ministry of Finance to act
as one of the executing agents as well as a guarantor for
Malaysian companies utilizing this IDB facilities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Official on Adjustments of Dong, Dollar Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- There would be no sudden
adjustment of the exchange rate between the Vietnamese dong (VND)
and the U.S. dollar like last year, Vietnam's business newspaper
The Saigon Times Daily Wednesday quoted an official of the State
Bank of Vietnam as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, as the dollar is strengthening against VND on
Vietnam's Interbank market, the Vietnam's central bank will
continue to make gradual adjustments in this direction in the
upcoming months.
</P>
<P>
A Vietnam's bank official admitted that over the past three
months, the U.S. dollar appreciated against VND by 30 VND per
dollar each month.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate announced on Tuesday by Vietnam's central
bank was 13,964 VND to a U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam's bank official said that the exchange rate will be
adjusted in line with market movements and how wide the adjustment
should be depends on the balance of foreign currency supply and
demand in each quarter.
</P>
<P>
"In previous years demand for the greenback often increased
from September due to businesses boosting imports to prepare for
the Lunar New Year Festival, but this year the demand has softened
due to shrinking trade deficit," the Vietnamese official said.

<HEADLINE> Few U.S. Companies to Cut IT Investment in 2000: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Only 7 percent of
companies in the United States and Canada indicated that they will
cut information technology (IT) spending after Y2K projects have
been completed, according to a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corporation (IDC), a U.S. market research
firm, conducted the recent survey among 1,145 North American
companies on Y2K effect.
</P>
<P>
"The time lines that companies have chosen to address Y2K
compliance are having an immediate impact on short-term IT
investments," IDC said. "However, the long-term prospects for the
continued proliferation of IT remain strong."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, according to the IDC, Y2K projects will have
a "dampening effect," hampering spending on other IT projects, and
this effect will only worsen as the year 2000 draws closer.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very definite correspondence between achieving
compliance late in 1999 and the need to postpone non-Y2K projects
or reduce non-Y2K spending," IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Y2K projects will have the greatest negative impact on spending
for software applications, end-user and server hardware, and
network upgrades.
</P>
<P>
But as the survey results indicated, despite Y2K projects,
companies are still willing to invest in technology that can give
them a differential, competitive advantage, such as Internet
applications as well as products with lower price point or
critical to ongoing maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Building Contractor to Be Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Building contractor Veli
Gocer, who built numerous shoddy apartments in western Turkey, 90
percent of which collapsed in last month's earthquake, is expected
to be given prison terms of between four and 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News reported Wednesday that Gocer was arrested on
Monday in a friend's house in Alibeykoy in Istanbul, the largest
city of Turkey, and was then sent to the Bursa E-Type Prison in
western Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The crushed buildings set up by Gocer caused the deaths of
thousands of people and the public prosecutor's office in Yalova
province issued an arrest warrant in absentia for him last week,
the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Gocer confessed to having used poor quality concrete in his
buildings, a practice that would cut costs but threatens the
structural integrity of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
Gocer, who fled out of fear of being lynched after the monster
quake, said earlier he used substandard materials in construction,
and that the houses were in poor conditions.
</P>
<P>
Shoddy construction was widely blamed for the high death toll
in the 7.4-magnitude earthquake hitting northwestern Turkey on
August 17. Some 14,000 people were confirmed dead so far but
government officials feared that as many as 40,000 people could
have been killed in the quake as many are still listed as
missing.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Howard Hold Talks in Canberra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- China is satisfied with its
present relations with Australia, visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Wednesday in talks with Australian Prime Minister
John Howard.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two nations have maintained frequent contact and
exchanges of visits, Jiang said, adding that both sides have good
relations regarding some major international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral consultation and dialogue is continuing
to be strengthened and bilateral trade and economic relations are
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing visit is intended to further develop the friendship
between the two peoples, expand mutually beneficial cooperation
and push forward bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1972 when the two countries set up diplomatic ties, Jiang
said, bilateral relations have been progressing smoothly. The Sino-
Australian ties have maintained good momentum through the
concerted efforts of both sides, especially in recent years, the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which proceeded in a "friendly manner,"
Jiang and Howard reviewed the development of bilateral ties since
the two nations forged diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said that China and Australia, both as Asian-
Pacific nations with important influence, share wide-ranging
common interests in safeguarding world and regional security and
stability, as well as promoting regional economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to make greater efforts in exploring new areas of
cooperation and to work together for the long-term, stable and
sound Sino-Australian relationship geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Jiang's current visit is very important for
Australia, which indicates that bilateral relations are mature and
continue to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
He is convinced that the visit will further strengthen the
existing friendly cooperation between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Australia-China ties as one of its most
important external relationships, Howard said Australia values its
long-term cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Australia is satisfied with the current bilateral relations, he
said, though there still exist some different viewpoints, this
cannot become an obstacle preventing the two nations from
furthering cooperation on the basis of seeking common ground and
mutual benefit while preserving differences.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders agreed, based on
strengthening the present dialogue and consultations, to set up a
regular meeting mechanism -- an annual meeting between leaders of
the two nations and between the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The time and form of the meeting will be arranged in accordance
with the need, they said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to continue to strengthen consultations
and cooperation in multilateral international organizations and on
some major international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are willing to make concerted efforts for a fair and
reasonable international economic and financial order, they
claimed.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the
consular services, mining industry and enforcement of law.
</P>
<P>
They said that they are pleased and satisfied with the
consensus the two sides reached on a framework joint statement on
network economy and e-business cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two attended a signing ceremony for five
documents between the two nations: a memorandum of understanding
on trade and investment cooperation in mining industry and energy
resources; a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Firms Post 477M Dollar Debt Suspensions in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The total liabilities involving
the suspension of debt repayments among Philippine corporations
reached 19.071 billion pesos (477 million U.S. dollars) during the
first semester of 1999, an official report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the country's Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) said that 10 cases were filed with the SEC from February to
July 1999, involving 16 corporations with total assets of 41.224
billion pesos (1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the total debt suspensions from 1982
to July 1999 reached 103 cases involving 133 corporations with
total assets of 177.192 billion pesos (4.4 billion dollars),
representing total liabilities of 139.4 billion pesos (3.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the period indicated, the year 1998 showed the biggest total
liabilities amounting to 96.34 billion pesos (2.4 billion
dollars), representing 46 corporations which filed debt suspension
applications with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 came second with 32 applications whose total
liabilities amounted to 12.8 billion pesos (32 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a related development, SEC Executive Director Eugene Reyes
said that the licensing of the securities market declined further
in 1998, compared to the previous year's 38.4 percent decline in
the number of registrants.
</P>
<P>
He said this was so because corporations tended to be skeptical
in conducting initial public offerings during the period due to
the lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
If they do, only few interested people will buy the shares that
they are offering to the public because of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, this also resulted in the shrinking of income
supposed to be generated by the SEC from securities fees paid by
corporations, Reyes explained.

<HEADLINE> China's Mogao Grottoes Getting More High-Tech Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Mogao Grottoes just
outside the city of Dunghuang in northwest China's Gansu Province
are now being protected from the ravages of shifting sands by
Chinese scientists using newer high-tech methods.
</P>
<P>
The grottoes hold 45,000 square meters of murals and 2,000
figurines that were made from the fourth to the 14th centuries.
They were added to the UNESCO's world cultural heritage list and
began attracting thousands of visitors from around the world. But,
the unique cultural relics have long been threatened by sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
Every year some three to four thousand cubic meters of sand
are blown around them, so scientists have built three barriers
using plants and nylon. As a result, the sands around the grotto
area have been reduced by some 70 percent from a few years ago. As
more visitors come to this museum on the Gobi, Chinese scientists,
working with foreign colleagues, have done more researches on ways
to protect the relics.
</P>
<P>
They have built a monitoring station and a computer data bank
to record temperature, sunlight, and wind changes both inside and
outside the grottoes and have had scored some success in
preserving and recreating the murals through the use of computers.
People can now have a look at the murals without coming to
Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Lasers and other high-tech methods are also being used to
clean and restore images on the murals and to understand the
coloration and pigmentation.

CHANGCHUN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An animal like Scotland's
Loch Ness monster was sighted recently in Songhua Lake in China's
Jilin province, causing people who were swimming there to leave

<P>
The man-made lake, 200 k.m. in length, is on the Songhua River.
There have been reports of a monster since the 1950s, although no
one has ever seen it up close. One eye-witness spotted it swimming
or drifting on hot days, but it never put its head out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
A swimsuit seller said that he had seen it on eight occasions
since mid-July and described it as a black-skinned object two
meters wide and eighty or ninety meters long. On the morning of
August 19 it was seen on the surface for nearly two minutes. The
swimsuit seller took some photos of it but it appeared as a
blurred spot because of the distance.
</P>

One speed boat driver reported seeing a large, black thing
moving fast towards him and he got so scared that he fled.

China's most famous lake monster is said to be in Tianchi, or

skeptical about it.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Takes New Measures to Control Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
taken new measures to control foreign currency by setting up the
Foreign Currency Reserve Fund and the Foreign Exchange and Gold
Price Stabilization Fund.
</P>
<P>
The two new funds will be established under a decree signed by
Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai last week, according to a
report of Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two funds will be used as levers to ensure the soundness of
both Vietnam's foreign exchange reserves and its international
payment system.
</P>
<P>
The measures were designed to overcome shortcomings in the
country's foreign currency control system, said an official of
Vietnam State Bank.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam State Bank is prepared to intervene in the domestic
foreign exchange and gold markets if they fluctuate sharply.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Currency Reserve Fund will be used to invest in
different dealings in international monetary markets. They include
depositing money with overseas banks, buying and selling foreign
currencies and gold, and buying and selling stock shares in
foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Exchange and Gold Price Stabilization Fund will be
used to intervene in the domestic foreign currency and gold
markets in cases of great turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Forms of intervention include spot sales, term-sales, swaps and
other dealings.
</P>
<P>
The news decree becomes effective on September 14 and replaces
an existing foreign currency regulation fund established in April
1991.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Calls for Respect for Yugoslav Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said Tuesday here that the UN special representative for
Kosovo must respect the state sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia and protect residents of all ethnic in
Kosovo when carrying out his duty.
</P>
<P>
He said this when meeting Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev, who arrived here Sunday for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president and Russian minister noted that ethnic
Albanian terrorists are still rampant in Kosovo and the
international peace keeping force constantly violates the relevant
UN resolutions, thus seriously threatening the regional stability
and political solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also demanded a quick end to terrorism and anarchism,
disarmament of the "Kosovo Liberation Army" and permission for the
Yugoslav police to enter Kosovo so as to create conditions for
refugees home coming.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Avdeyev expressed support to Yugoslavia's
principled stand on the Kosovo issue, saying the Russian troops in
the peace keeping force will perform their mission according to
the UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, when meeting Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic, Avdeyev pointed out that certain peace-keeping
operations in Kosovo by western nations in fact worked to split
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kouchner, UN special representative for Kosovo, was
accused of trampling upon the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and going
against the UN resolution for his September 4 decision that German
mark would serve as the major official currency in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In August, the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, led
by Kouchner, set about to establish a separate customs service for
Kosovo, which was termed by Yugoslavia as "a flagrant violation"
of June 10 Security Council resolution, particularly its
provisions regarding Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Bill to Toughen Penalties in Medicine Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
in principle the Public Health Ministry's draft medicines bill
which imposes heavier penalties on unauthorized producers,
dispensers and importers, Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill, approved Tuesday, will be forwarded to the
Council of State before going to the House of Representatives, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The draft also provides criteria for obtaining a permit to
advertise medical products, and empowers the Food and Drugs
Administration (FDA) to order advertisers to correct misleading
information.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows the FDA to ban production, sale and import of
medical products deemed unsafe for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Producers must bear responsibility for any damage caused by
their medical products, which are to be divided into three
categories: those requiring a physician's prescription, those that
must be dispensed by pharmacists, and over-the-counter drugs.
</P>
<P>
Medicines in the first and second categories must be clearly
separated.

<HEADLINE> ADB Assists China in Urbanization Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the Ministry of Construction and cities
across China gathered in Beijing on Tuesday to discuss the
challenges facing China's urbanization process, today's China
Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
A package of measures aiding urban infrastructure construction
is expected to emerge on Thursday, according to ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Topics up for discussion by participants to the Urban Policy
Workshop include water supply, environmental management, urban
transport and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Officials and consultants from the ADB will hold individual
meetings with the cities' representatives tomorrow to discuss
concrete financial assistance, the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has provided loans of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars to
China, together with offers of advanced technology valued at 29
million U.S. dollars. These have been conducive to the improvement
of China's urban living standards, said vice-minister of
Construction Zhao Baojiang.
</P>
<P>
The growth of China's urban economy and population has raised
demands for more urban public utilities, while the development of
urban infrastructure such as water supply, housing, roads and
bridges has generally been lagged behind, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate infrastructure facilities are mainly the result of
insufficient investment in urban infrastructure and shortage of
funds for urban infrastructure investment.
</P>
<P>
State financial sources have been very limited due to the
decentralization of infrastructure financing responsibilities to
local governments, which have limited funds from taxation, the
paper says.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Work on a new economic zone
commenced recently near the newly-built Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone is aimed at making the best of the bridge,
which is one of the key infrastructure projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The economic zone covers an area of 9.15 square kilometers
between the Wuhu Economic and Technological Development Zone and
the existing city proper of Wuhu, in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Its construction will be divided into two phases. During the
first phase, scenic spots will be built along the river and a
trunk road will be paved. Tourist, business, high-tech and
residential zones will be built. In the 2001-2005 period, efforts
will be made to turn the economic zone into modernized new city.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Bridge at Wuhu is the last highway-railway
bridge China builds in this century. It is expected to be
completed by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> El Guerrouj's World Record Highlights Golden League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 7 (Xinhua) -- World 1,500 chapion Hicham El
Guerrouj of Morocco stole the limelight from the jackpot hunters
when he added the 2,000 meters mark to his collection of world
records in the last leg of the IAAF Golden League here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gerrouj, already the fastest man over 1,500 meters and one mile,
is the only athlete who now holds three world records. He clocked
four minutes 44.79 seconds to beat the old mark by the vast margin
of more than three seconds.
</P>
<P>
The previous mark of 4:47.88 was set by Algerian Noureddine
Morceli in July 1995 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Kipketer of Denmark and Gabriela Szabo of Romania had
earlier completed their seventh Golden League victories to share a
one million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer and Szabo outclassed the opposition again in the men's
800 meters and women's 5,000 meters respectively, pocketing 500,
000 U.S. dollars each for becoming the only two athletes to have
won all seven events in the series.
</P>
<P>
After letting Kenyans Robert Kibet and William Tanui set the
early pace, El Guerrouj kicked and raced the last 600 meters well
ahead of the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Paul Bitok was a distant second in 4:54.36 and Portugal'
s Rui Silva third in 4:54.66.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan steeplechaser Bernard Barmasai failed to complete a
clean sweep when he was beaten into second place by unfancied
Algerian Ali Ezzine.
</P>
<P>
World 3,000 meters steeplechase record holder Barmasai, who had
won all six previous races, was disqualified from the one million
jackpot after he said he had asked compatriot Christopher Koskei
to let him win in Zurich last month.

<P>
BRAZILIA, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Rivaldo scored a hattrick as
Brazil beat Argentina 4-2 on Tuesday in an exhibition game in
Porto Alegre, Brazil, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, coming off a 2-0 loss to Argentina on Sunday in Buenos
Aires, pressured Argentina from the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
After two goals from Rivaldo were ruled offside, the Brazilian
star got it right, drawing out goalkeeper Bonano and firing it
past him. Rivaldo scored again two minutes later, with a header
off a feed from Roberto Carlos.
</P>
<P>
Argentina made it 2-1 in the 45th minute when Ayala scored on a
header off a feed from Veron.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo scored his third goal in the 70th minute off a feed by
Ronaldo. Then it was Ronaldo's turn in the 82nd minute with a left-
foot shot from the center.
</P>
<P>
Ortega scored the game's last goal for Argentina in 88th minute
dribbling past a handful of Brazilian defenders.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Friendship Forest Built in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese friendship
forest is being built in the city of Shizuishan in northwest China
's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to mark the fifth anniversary of
the establishment of friendly relationships between Shizuishan and
the Japanese city of Hamada.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 2,000 different kinds of trees from both China and
Japan have been planted in the eight hectare forest inside a big
park on the Gobi desert outside the city. With 300 hectares of
land, the huge park on the Gobi desert used to be a vast area of
desert. But now over 300,000 trees have been planted in the area,
turning more than 200,000 square kilometers of its land into green
fields.
</P>
<P>
"The planting of the forest will be completed at the end of 2,
000," according to the city's mayor Ma Ruiwen.
</P>
<P>
Shizuishan is the second biggest city in Ningxia while Hamada
is a port city in southwestern Japan. The two cities established
friendly twinning arrangements in November 1994 to seek better
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation Causes Losses of 43B Dollars in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The destruction of forests in
Indonesia during the 22 years from 1977 to 1999 caused losses of
up to 43 billion U.S. dollars or almost 2 billion dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Agus Purnomo, executive director of World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) Indonesia, at a seminar here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation had been carried out on a large scale because
businessman dealing in timber made large profits from the permits
to manage forest on a large scale, said Purnomo.
</P>
<P>
According to WWF, there were indications that out of 1.2
million hectares of primary forest in Jambi, Sumatera Island, 69.5
percent remain unchanged, 8.4 percent had been converted into
secondary forest and 5 percent into agricultural lands and
grassland. The damage in Kalimantan and Irian was even worse.
</P>
<P>
From the global change point of view such conversions were
evaluated in terms of carbon from each vegetation types. The
deforestation in the region and other parts of Indonesia had
resulted in stronger emissions of radioactive trace gases to the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Indonesia-United Kingdom Tropical Forest
Management Program indicated that from the total output of logs in
Indonesia of up to 32 million cubic meters annually, the output
from illegal log fellers was up to 10.3 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Hariadi Kartodihardjo, lecturer from Bogor Farming Institute,
said that of the total forest area of 143 million hectares in
Indonesia, 30 million hectares were intended for converted forest,
which means that people can fell trees to get logs and replant
them again.
</P>
<P>
From the total converted forest, 16.6 million hectares or more
than 50 percent had been totally damaged and were in irreversible
condition, he added.

GUIYANG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Gelo are an old ethnic
group in China's Guizhou Province that has seen some development
since the founding of the new China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Their population has gone from 53,000 in 1982 to 500,000 in
1999, with over 90 percent of them living in Guizhou. Wang
Liangming, a Gelo who works for the provincial government, says
that his ancestors used to live in Guiyang, the capital, but had
to move to Dagouchang Village in a remote rural area because of
discrimination and that it was only in the new China that they got
equal rights and a chance to study and progress. In recent years,
more ethnic minority students in the village have received a
higher education at the better institutes of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
A number of people from the village have been chosen as
government officials, Wang says, and the provincial government has
set up a dozen Gelo autonomous counties and townships in the past
decade.

LHASA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tibet's highland barley output
is expected to be increased from the present average of 3,750 kg
per ha to 8,100 kg per ha with the introduction of a new strain.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China has set up a 667-
ha demonstration zone in Nyemo County in order to experiment with
the new variety called "Tibetan barley 85".
</P>
<P>
So far, areas devoted to growing highland barley, a main food
for local farmers and herders, account for 70 percent of the
region's total farmland. However, the supply of barley cannot meet
demand because of low yield.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the barley output of the demonstration
zone will be increased by one million kg, and output value by two
million yuan with the adoption of the new strain.

SANTIAGO, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Interim Foreign
Minister Mariano Fernandez Tuesday refused the petition of Spanish
Judge Baltasar Garzon who ordered Augusto Pinochet to present
himself before the Madrid court in person to hear charges of human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Garzon, who is in charge of the Pinochet case, asked
the former Chilean military leader to appear before the court
within 20 days.
</P>
<P>
The interim minister insisted that Spain has no jurisdiction to
try the case which took place in Chile and viewed the case as
interference in Chile's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has been under house arrest in Britain on Spain's
request since last October. Spain accused Chilean lifelong Senator
Pinochet of responsibility for killings and torture during his
1973-1990 military rule in Chile. He is facing an extradition
process to Spain, which was requested by Judge Garzon.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Storms into U.S. Open Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The victory sets up a possible Hingis-Williams showdown -- a
rematch of the 1997 Open final -- in Friday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
That match has been anticipated since this year's draw was
announced nearly two weeks ago. It can become a reality if the 19-
year-old Williams, seeded third, defeats No. 12 Barbara Schett of
Austria later.
</P>
<P>
"She has to first get there," Hingis said when asked about a
match with Williams. "She had the night match. I'm going to be
watching."
</P>
<P>
Hingis started slowly, dropping the first two games of the
match, but she quickly got on track by breaking Huber in the third
game.
</P>
<P>
Huber made 39 unforced errors in the 57-minute match and won
just 12 points in the second set in losing to Hingis for the ninth
time in 10 career meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I had to try and play aggressive, play my game," Huber said. "
But it was very hard with the wind. I was trying, but I lost all
the long rallies. I just wasn't using the wind as well as she did.
"
</P>
<P>
Williams, who advanced to the final in her U.S. Open debut in
1997, earned a berth in the quarterfinals by rallying to defeat
fellow American Mary Joe Fernandez on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, former French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten
became the lastest player to benefit from the slew of on-court
injuries during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten, the fifth seed from Brazil, advanced to the U.S. Open
quarterfinals for the first time when unseeded Magnus Norman of
Sweden was forced to retire from their fourth-round match due to a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
Norman is the seventh player in the men's draw to retire during
a match. That group includes two-time defending champion and
fourth seed Patrick Rafter and eighth seed Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
Norman was up a break and ready to serve for the opening set
when he became the latest victim of injury. Kuerten came back to
capture the first 7-6, won the tiebreak 7-4, and was leading in
the first game of the second set when Norman decided to call it
quits.
</P>
<P>
"I heard a click in the back when I was going to return the
serve at 30-40. I felt an unbelievable amount of pain. I broke for
6-5, but when I came to the chair, I said, 'this is not right. i
had never felt that way before," said Norman.
</P>
<P>
Norman was one of the more active players during the summer
hardcourt season. He played in five tournaments in the six weeks
preceding the Open and had won 21 of his last 23 matches.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Unhappy with Sydney Olympic Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IAAF issued a statement on Tuesday, clarifying its position
with regards to the timetable for the Athletics Competitions at
the Sydney Olympic Games next year.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "the IAAF would first point out that such a
timetable, according to the Olympic Charter, must be agreed by the
relevant International Federaton together with the Olympic
organising committee. As of today, the timetable presented by
SOCOG has not been approved by the IAAF and therefore cannot be
considered valid."
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF advised SOCOG from the outset and on several other
occasions that no timetable should be made public until agreed
with the IAAF. Regardless of this advice, SOCOG took it upon
itself to offer a substantial number of tickets for sale to the
Australian public for the Athletics Competitions without IAAF's
agreement. The IAAF is aware that a disclaimer was included in the
ticket sale stating clearly that the timetable published by SOCOG
was subject to change without notice."
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF regrets that SOCOG took this decision to start with
tickets sales against the advice of the world governing body for
athletics and in the absence of a specific agreement on the
timetable. The IAAF also understands the frustration this will
provoke among the Australian public should a different timetable
now be issued."
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF would like to make clear, however, that the best
interests of the athletes and their health should be foremost in
developing any Olympic timetable. Should the IAAF adopt a
timetable for the Athletics Competitions in Sydney which is
substantially different from the one issued by SOCOG until now,
this would be principally due to the need to provide more rest to
the athletes between their races."
</P>
<P>
"Such a motivation could certainly not be considered any less a
priority than selling tickets," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Dyer Doubt for Keegan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 7 (Xinhua) -- Kieron Dyer is England's main
injury doubt ahead of their clash against Poland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But David Beckham, Martin Keown and Tony Adams should all be
fit to start the European Championship qualifier, Kevin Keegan has
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Dyer, who was substituted at half-time at Wembley last Saturday
after a sparkling debut, faces a fittness test on Tuesday night
which will go a long way to determining whether he or Gary Neville
is picked at right-back.
</P>
<P>
Keown sat out the England training session at the Legia Warsaw
stadium with a sore Achilles tendon but he should still be
available to partner Adams, who seems to have recovered from a
dead leg, in central defence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little more concerned about Kieron. He took part in the
training session this morning but I told him that I didn't think
he was running too well," said England coach Keegan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it seems that Beckham's hamstring problem has
cleared up and that he will start the game on the right wing, with
Paul Scholes returning to the side in central midfield after
suspension.

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials Continue Talks on Ministerial Meeting Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND, New Zealand, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum are
continuing their talks here Wednesday on the agenda of the
forthcoming ministerial meeting preceding the 7th informal meeting
of APEC leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day talks that started on Tuesday, the APEC
senior officials are set to propose topics of discussions for
their ministers, who will meet here on Thursday and Friday making
preparations for the 7th informal meeting of APEC leaders on
September 12-13.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that senior officials participating in the talks
will recommend that China and Chinese Taipei join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) before the start of the next round of global
trade talks in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft report discussed in the talks Tuesday,
"Senior officials recommend to ministers that they... note the
progress that has been achieved in the negotiations on the
accession to the WTO of China and Chinese Taipei, and call for the
conclusion of these negotiations at the earliest opportunity, if
possible before the third WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle."
</P>
<P>
Necessary revisions will be made to the draft report before it
is submitted to trade ministers from the 21 APEC members.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between China and the United States on China's
entry into the WTO were suspended after the May 7 U.S. bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton are expected to meet on the sidelines of the APEC leaders
meeting on a series of major issues.
</P>
<P>
Besides talks on the WTO, the APEC leaders will discuss a broad
range of other major issues, such as the expansion of
opportunities for doing business throughout the APEC region, the
working with other economies to strengthen the functioning of
markets and the broadening of support for and understanding of
APEC in its respective communities.
</P>
<P>
They are also likely to discuss the crisis of East Timor. New
Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley has invited non-APEC
countries to participate in a "Special Ministers Meeting" on the
crisis to be held on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Those from non-APEC members to participate in this meeting will
include British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is to arrive
here later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
APEC, which was created in 1989, now groups Australia, Brunei,
Canada, Chile, China, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE>    Shearer Hits Back at Kelly Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shearer was criticised as being "childish and immature" by
former Football Association chief executive Kelly in his book "
Sweet FA" for his reaction after being charged with misconduct for
kicking Leicester's Neil Lennon towards the end of the 1997-98
season.
</P>
<P>
The England captain, who was later cleared of the charge, told
a news conference in Poland: "It is criminal that it has been
released at this time to cause maximum damage to myself and
maximum disruption to an England side which is focusing on such an
important game."
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm sure everyone, ourselves, the fans, wants to
concentrate 100% on the game and getting a good result, which I
believe we can."
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had got the row out of his system, the Newcastle
striker replied: "It wasn't in my system.
</P>
<P>
"There might be a time in the future when I tell my side of the
story but now is not the time."
</P>
<P>
At his book launch on Monday, Kelly claimed he had no influence
over when his book would hit the streets or be serialised.
</P>
<P>
He said: "It is entirely outside my control. I signed a
contract to do the book six to eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
"It didn't appear to do Alan Shearer any harm and there are far
bigger things that are going to rock the boat if the boat is going
to be rocked.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate if in some respects it caused some upset
during an important time but it is outside my control," he added.

<HEADLINE> Rate Cuts Boost Business Confidence in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 7 (Xinhua) -- More relaxed financial
environments following the rapid decline in interest rates have
helped boost South Africa's business confidence, the South African
Chamber of Business (Sacob) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The business confidence index (BCI) rose marginally by 2.1
points in August to reach 92.2 points, Sacob said, predicting that
another percentage point could be trimmed by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
"In August, nine of the 13 indices used in determining
confidence levels were either neutral or positive. Seventy-one
percent of the respondents to Sacob's monthly manufacturing survey
nevertheless expect sales to improve over the next 12 months, the
highest level of expectation since April 1997," Sacob said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "as the more positive financial environment will
take time to filter through to the demand and supply side of the
economy, an improvement in real economic activity can be expected
in the remaining months of this year."
</P>
<P>
Sacob noted that further enhancement of the business mood would
most probably depend on positive developments in the real economy.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates are not likely to decline as rapidly as was the
case during the first half of this year. A further reduction of
one percentage (point) is expected for this year, followed by
another one percent in the first half of next year," it said.
</P>
<P>
Sacob said that the prime lending rate now stands at 16.5
percent.
