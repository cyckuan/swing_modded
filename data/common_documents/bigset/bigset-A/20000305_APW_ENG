<HEADLINE> No.21 Okla 59, No.13 Okla St. 56  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN CANFIELD, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma made for a rude guest at
Oklahoma State's farewell party.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 21 Sooners got a season-high 21 points from Nolan
Johnson and overcame a 13-point second-half deficit to beat the
13th-ranked Cowboys 59-56 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final game for Oklahoma State's six senior regulars,
and the last game in Gallagher-Iba Arena before the 62-year-old
building is expanded. Yet the Sooners came through to end OSU's
streak of 16 straight road victories dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our program is built on toughness, and I thought that that was
what this game was about,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said.
''We really had a solid game plan. We knew what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a junior college transfer, scored 12 points in a 23-6
run that allowed Oklahoma (24-5, 12-4 Big 12) to overcome a 46-33
deficit. He also put the clamps on Desmond Mason, who failed to
make a field goal and finished with just six points, 12 below his
average.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to limit his touches or make him take tough shots,''
Johnson said. ''I did what was asked of me tonight -- play defense
and make shots when I was asked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's top two scorers, Eduardo Najera (18.9) and J.R.
Raymond (14.9) scored just nine and two, respectively. But Johnson
came through in the clutch, as did freshman Kelley Newton and
freshman Hollis Price.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-0 Cowboys run made the score 46-33 with 11:44 remaining.
Then Johnson converted two three-point plays to start the Oklahoma
surge.
</P>
<P>
   It was 50-49 before Oklahoma hit six straight shots and scored
on seven consecutive trips to take the lead for good, 56-52. Newton
had two 3-pointers, Johnson hit three baskets and Hollis Price
scored five points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had too many defensive mistakes,'' OSU coach Eddie
Sutton said. ''They hit some big shots. Even when you make a
defensive mistake, you still have to put the ball in the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins scored on a backdoor layup with 1:11 remaining to get the
Cowboys within 58-56, but they didn't score again. Johnson made a
free throw with 15.3 seconds remaining for a 59-56 lead, and
Glendon Alexander's 3-point try with two seconds left bounced off
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best win of my career,'' Najera said. ''Tonight we
showed we're a great team. I had an OK game, but everybody else
stepped up. We've improved a lot and we're playing our best
basketball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory makes the Sooners the No. 3 seed in the conference
tournament. Oklahoma State (23-5, 12-4) will be the fourth seed.
</P>
<P>
   Mason wound up 0-of-8 from the field. Najera was 2-of-10 and
didn't score in the final 18{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Montonati had 15 points and Adkins scored 12 for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher-Iba Arena, which opened in 1938, will be doubled in
size to about 13,000 when it reopens in December.

<HEADLINE> Thais Vote in First Senate Election  </HEADLINE>
By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- With high voter turnout and the
victories of a slew of human rights advocates, Thailand's first
Senate election was being hailed Sunday as a major advance toward
full-fledged democracy -- despite reports of rampant vote-buying and
the triumphs of candidates with close ties to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   According to unofficial results released by the Election
Commission, at least 70 percent of eligible voters cast ballots --
and cast them for candidates considered honest in this
corruption-ridden system. There were 1,521 candidates running for
200 Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never in the 68 years since we changed from an absolute
monarchy have Thai voters so desperately tried to deliver their
verdict: We want democracy,'' read an editorial from Sunday's
editions of The Nation newspaper. It called Saturday's election ''a
watershed in the ongoing democratic development in Thailand.''
</P>
<P>
   Official results would be announced late Sunday, but the
Election Commission said it did not expect any major changes from
the unofficial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unofficial winners: Pratheep Ungsongtham, known as the
''Slum Angel'' for her work among Bangkok's poorest residents, and
Mechai Viravaidya, internationally recognized for his anti-AIDS and
birth control campaigns. Chaweewan Kanchornprasart, wife of the
interior minister, was one of many successful candidates with close
ties to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   That said, monitors reported allegations of rampant vote-buying
in every province in the election, the first time since Thailand
adopted constitutional rule 68 years ago that senators were elected
rather than appointed. Some arrests of canvassers caught handing
out bills in exchange for promised votes was also reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Gen. Kowit Wattana estimated that at least $540
million may have changed hands in the feverish bid for ballots. The
highest fees, he said, were paid in Bangkok -- the equivalent of $54
per vote.
</P>
<P>
   Saiyud Kerdpol, deputy chairman of one independent poll watch
group, said after polls closed that his network had received
thousands of phone calls complaining about fraud and other
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   ''To determine whether it was fair or not, we have to look into
the results and investigate the reported frauds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates' wins can be nullified later if an investigation
shows they won by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Saiyud Kerdpol, an official of one poll watch group, called the
election ''a very good start,'' with senators coming from many
walks of life. While acknowledging vote buying, Saiyud said the new
enthusiasm for democracy had ''disappointed'' many who had tried to
buy votes.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was also the first test of political reform under
Thailand's 1997 constitution, which attempts to increase citizens'
participation in politics while limiting the influence of money and
special interests.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent money and special-interest groups from influencing
the campaigning, candidates were prohibited from affiliating
themselves with a political party.
</P>
<P>
   They could hand out pamphlets about their background and
introduce themselves at rallies, but were not allowed to advertise
or campaign in any other way, nor were they supposed to discuss
their policies.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on campaign activities coupled with a bewildering
array of candidates -- 265 vying for 18 seats in Bangkok alone --
left many voters confused.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 residents on Bangkok's northern outskirts complained
to police that they were told they had already voted upon arrival
at the polls. Balloting in the area was halted pending the Election
Commission's decision on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disappointing and unbelievable,'' said Chulalak
Promduang, who came home from the United States to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The election was billed as a contest between the people's
emerging power and traditional money politics.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1997 constitution, senators, who will serve six-year
terms, have the power to remove corrupt officials and politicians,
including the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate election, however, does not affect the makeup of
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's government.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers see the vote as a test-run for an election for the
more powerful House of Representatives that must be held by
November.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Criticizes NBA Officials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dallas Mavericks' 110-96 loss to the Phoenix Suns on
Saturday night, Rodman criticized the officiating in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't give a damn who they put out there because they're all
the same referees,'' Rodman said. ''They call the game as they see
it, but sometimes they need to wear some damn glasses or get a
second opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman was upset that he drew a technical foul from Joe Forte
for throwing the ball in the stands in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just to entertain the fans. That's all,'' Rodman said.
''Just trying to have some fun with the fans. Not a big deal. But
you can't even do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who grabbed 19 rebounds, blew a kiss to a heckler in the
stands after he missed a free throw in the third quarter. When he
left the game with 40 seconds left, Rodman pulled off his jersey
and threw it in the stands.

GOP Rivals Gear Up for Super Tuesday
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush charged John McCain with ''clouded''
education views Saturday and the senator asked ''Where's the outrage?'' over a
late surge of money to pay for negative TV ads, as the two Republicans battled
for the vote on Super Tuesday. McCain's question about ''outrage'' mimicked a
line from the 1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, a close friend of McCain.
In the weekend before Tuesday's 13-state sweepstakes, Bush campaigned in New
York while McCain started in New England, the geography highlighting the
presidential contenders' different strategies as they seek their share of the
613 delegates up for grabs.

   PALMEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Thousands of Mozambique's hungry and thirsty
flood victims straggled into makeshift camps Saturday after days of huddling on
rooftops or clinging to tree branches. As more supplies and equipment arrived
from around the world -- including the first of three U.S. planes carrying boats
from Miami -- survivors converged on camps. There they gulped down cornmeal soup
and beans, the first food many had eaten in four or five days. Authorities
estimated that 1 million people in this southeast African country urgently
require food, medicine and shelter.

the latest push from Dobrasin, a predominantly ethnic Albanian town in eastern
Serbia. Hundreds of people have fled the area in the past two months, streaming
into the closest Kosovo town of Gnjilane, about 30 miles southeast of Kosovo's

Clinton is to lead marchers across a Selma bridge to mark the 35th anniversary
of ''Bloody Sunday'' in the civil rights movement. Afterward, members of the
Southern nationalist organization that staged the rally signed a ''Declaration
of Southern Cultural Independence,'' described as the first step in what they
hope is a second secession by the South. Montgomery police estimated the crowd

couple, arrested at their house in the eastern Sicilian city of Catania, won
about $400,000 from the betting, Capt. Giancarlo Sulsenti of the paramilitary
tax police said in a telephone interview from Catania. The tax police, who are
continuing the investigation, said they didn't know exactly how many credit
cards were involved, but that they numbered in the thousands.

Oilers goalie Tommy Salo had a tough night as two of Pittsburgh's goals came

assessed a five-minute boarding major and game misconduct.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Protest  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- As China's national legislature opened its annual
session on one side of Tiananmen Square, followers of the banned
Falun Gong sect unfurled protest banners at the edge of the vast
plaza Sunday only to be swiftly arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Having sealed off the square, police took away at least 39 Falun
Gong followers or suspected group members along the plaza's fringe
during the morning session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, China has cracked down on Falun Gong, a sect
that has drawn millions of Chinese with its combination of
slow-motion exercises and syncretic blend of Taoist and Buddhist
cosmology and ideas drawn from founder Li Hongzhi, an ex-government
clerk who now lives in New York. Adherents say Falun Gong promotes
health and morality and is not political.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of those detained Sunday unfurled banners, some
proclaiming ''The Great Law of Falun,'' as they stood under the
towering portrait of Mao Tse-tung which hangs on the Gate of
Heavenly Peace at the square's north end. Among those taken away
were a man and a young child.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers arrested were far higher than during the congress'
opening in previous years. But this session is China's most public
political event since communist leaders banned Falun Gong as a
social menace and threat to Communist Party rule more than seven
months ago. They have ordered tightened security to prevent
disruptive protests by the group during the congress.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the session in the Great Hall of the People beside
Tiananmen Square, Premier Zhu Rongji said the communist government
''took decisive measures against the Falun Gong cult'' over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped many people along the square, a popular tourist
site, to check bags and ask where they were from. In one case, an
officer told a woman to say ''Falun Gong is an evil cult.'' When
she did, he let her go on her way.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, police detained 68 Falun Gong followers in
Beijing's Fangshan district and were holding them at the
Huangshandian Drug Rehabilitation Center, a Falun Gong member said
Sunday. The followers were on a hunger strike, some in their third
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong-based rights group, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China, appealed to the
legislature Sunday to investigate the death of Falun Gong member
Chen Zixiu and punish those responsible. The center made the appeal
in a statement faxed to foreign news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 60, died last month in eastern Weifang city after police
stopped him from boarding a train to Beijing. The Information
Center and Falun Gong members said she died from a police beating
but the government disputed the account, saying Chen was not
mistreated and that she died from a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Center said Chen's daughter and Ying Xia, a
former medical school student and Falun Gong activist who was
detained with Chen, believe the woman died from cold, lack of food
and severe beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Ying heard Chen being beaten and tortured with electric shock
over two days and tried to care for her as she was dying, the group
said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Canucks 4, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Brad May scored twice and
Alexander Mogilny had three points as the Vancouver Canucks beat
the New Jersey Devils 4-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   May scored twice in the first period and now has three goals in
two games after going 15 without any. May's second goal gave
Vancouver a 3-0 lead with 51.2 seconds left in the first period.
The Vancouver forward went hard to the net and put a rebound past
Devils goalie Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver is 8-3-2 since the All-Star break and the Canucks are
inching closer to a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Mogilny scored once and added two assists, giving him
400 in his career. Andrew Cassels had a goal and an assist to reach
500 career points.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, tops in the Eastern Conference with 88 points, lost
for the sixth time in eight games. The Devils are 1-2-0 on their
seven-game road trip and have scored just four goals.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded power-play goals in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison scored with the man-advantage for New Jersey,
ending Vancouver's streak of consecutive penalty kills at 19.
Morrison spent most of the night on the Devils' first line in place
of Petr Sykora, who missed his second straight game with a viral
infection.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Patrik Elias scored his 27th goal, the only tally
in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Snow -- making his first start in six games -- stopped 28
shots for his ninth win. He was helped when New Jersey hit the goal
post twice in the opening minute of the third and when the Devils
had a goal disallowed because Sergei Brylin batted the puck in with
a high stick.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Vladimir Malakhov played his first game for New
Jersey since being acquired from Montreal on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Coach: Texas Afraid To Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii football coach June Jones struck back at
Texas officials, dismissing the Longhorns' bid to get out of a
Sept. 2 game because of financial concerns as ''hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not want to play us, period,'' Jones said. ''They have
nothing to gain and everything to lose. I'm sure they looked at
some of the tapes and realized we have a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived in Texas for four or five years, and I've never known
a Texan to back down from a fight before. I guess their coach isn't
from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds has asked that the
Longhorns be released from their contract to play Hawaii in the
season opener at Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds told Hawaii athletic director Hugh Yoshida it would cost
$400,000 for a charter. But Yoshida told Dodds he could arrange for
a charter for less than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which is guaranteed $175,000, will have to pay Hawaii
$100,000 if it cancels the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the rising price of fuel, costs for an established
charter to make the trip have escalated tremendously since the game
was first scheduled,'' Dodds said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ''can't afford to do something that is fiscally
irresponsible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know we have a chance to beat them and they don't want to
take that chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he could understand if Texas were playing Oklahoma
the following week. But he said the Longhorns are playing ''that
powerhouse'' Louisiana-Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, meanwhile, is looking for a replacement for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things will work out for the best,'' Jones said. ''We'll end
up with somebody who's not afraid to play us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first season at Hawaii, Jones led the Rainbows to an 8-4
mark in the regular season and a 23-17 victory over Oregon State in
the Oahu Bowl. Hawaii was 0-10 the previous season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raising Money in California  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As his potential successors stumped across
the country, a sidelined President Clinton was in California
raising money for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The president, headliner at a pair of Saturday night
fund-raisers in Los Angeles that was bringing in $600,000 for the
Democratic National Committee, was carrying a stump message for
Californians to reject a ban on gay marriages and say yes to a
school construction measure.
</P>
<P>
   With the importance of this year's elections in mind, Clinton
urged listeners to not be lulled into complacency by the booming
economy. And he noted that he was traveling before dawn to Alabama
to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the civil rights march in
Selma.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty-five years ago ... 600 brave Americans walked across a
bridge for the right to vote,'' he said. ''Some of them were killed
for it. Many of them were brutalized for it. But because they
walked across that bridge, this country is a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's events came after Clinton completed a marathon round
of appearances Friday night in San Francisco that raised $1 million
for Democratic candidates. He offered abundant advice to voters in
a state that supported him in 1996 and is pivotal to Vice President
Al Gore's fortunes in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, when each party stages more than a dozen
primaries or caucuses, California's primary is the crown jewel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't vote in this primary, but I hope you'll vote,'' the
president said. ''You've got a big ballot. You'll have an
opportunity to vote for things that will affect your future and to
send a signal where California is.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, Clinton said
Proposition 22, which would bar California from recognizing
same-sex marriages should they become legal in any other state,
would have ''no practical effect whatever.'' It is, he said, ''a
solution in search of a problem that isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   But he curried support for Proposition 26, which would allow
school districts to use property taxes to repay loans for school
construction and renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll build people up,'' Clinton said. ''We've got, already,
untold numbers of kids in schools that are either overcrowded or
tumbling down. ... You need to get all the roadblocks out of your
way to building your children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The first fund-raiser in Los Angeles was organized by a group of
Iranian-Americans, and the president told them he regretted ''that
so many of you had to leave your native land -- one of the most
wonderful places in all of human history, one of the most important
places culturally in all of human history.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I hope and pray that what we have seen in three elections
now there means that there is a movement toward openness and
freedom there, too, and that some day all of you will be able to go
home to visit and have two homes, complete and open and free. I
have done my best to support that process in the limited way any
American president can,'' he added.
</P>

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ron Francis scored two of Carolina's
three third-period goals as the Hurricanes beat the San Jose Sharks
5-2 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kovalenko gave Carolina a 3-2 lead at 3:27 of the third
period, scoring from close range off a pass from Robert Kron.
</P>
<P>
   Francis added his 20th goal of the season with 6:13 left, and
completed the scoring with a power-play goal with 3:54 to go. Both
goals came off scrambles in front of San Jose goalie Steve Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Kron tied it at 2 with 1:45 left in the second period. Kron's
goal came 20 seconds after Vincent Damphousse scored for San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Jeff O'Neill opened the scoring in the first period
with his 20th goal of the season. San Jose tied it midway through
the second on Brad Stuart's goal during a two-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sharks goalie Arturs Irbe faced only 13 shots en route to
his 25th victory of the season. Shields made 21 saves.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jozef Stumpel scored his 100th NHL goal on a
power play 28 seconds into overtime Saturday night, lifting the Los
Angeles Kings to a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bylsma ended a 23-game scoring drought and defenseman Garry
Galley also scored, helping the Kings end a three-game winless
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Houlder scored his third goal at 13:19 of the second period
and Scott Walker scored midway through the first as the Predators
rallied twice to tie. Each of Nashville's last five defeats have
been by one goal.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year expansion team is 0-3 against Los Angeles, after
going 3-1 against the Kings last season -- including two wins in the
final 6 1-2 weeks to spoil their playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to score on five power plays, the Kings got
another chance when referee Mick McGeough sent Karlis Skrastins off
for tripping with 25 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel beat Mike Dunham high to the stick side with a one-timer
from the middle of the left circle for his 12th goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators, outshot 25-2 in the final 35 minutes of
Thursday's loss at San Jose, managed only two shots through the
first 13:19 of the second period against Stephane Fiset. The second
shot tied it 2-2, as Houlder skated down the slot and redirected
Greg Johnson's centering pass over Fiset's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was replaced by Jamie Storr 56 seconds later because of a
groin strain, after facing 11 shots. Another 36 seconds elapsed
before teammate Bryan Smolinski sustained a corneal abrasion and a
two-stitch cut under his left eye, the result of an inadvertent
high stick by Johnson as they battled behind the Los Angeles net.
</P>
<P>
   The injury knocked Smolinski out of the game, and the Kings
managed only one harmless shot during the ensuing four-minute power
play.
</P>
<P>
   Storr earned the victory, stopping all seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham stopped Ziggy Palffy on a breakaway less than four
minutes in and a minute later, Luc Robitaille hit the right post
from close range and had his 16-game point streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Bylsma opened the scoring at 9:19 of the first, beating Dunham
high to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was credited with his sixth goal just 57 seconds later
when his centering pass banked in off the leg of Kings defenseman
Mattias Norstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Galley made it 2-1 at 16:22 of the period with his ninth goal.
Galley beat Dunham high to the stick side with a slap shot from the
right circle.

president, headliner at a pair of Saturday night fund-raisers in Los Angeles

   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Holders of tickets sold in three states
will share Saturday's $150 million Powerball jackpot, lottery
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Winning tickets were sold in Kansas, Minnesota and Missouri,
Powerball officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will have the option of collecting $50 million each over
a period of 25 years, or taking about half the amount in one lump
sum. They'll have 60 days to decide.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate claims to the jackpot were reported by officials.
</P>
<P>
   Powerball jackpots seldom reach as high as $150 million. Still,
Saturday's drawing was well below the record Powerball jackpot of
$295.7 million, reached in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery is played in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
Saturday's winning numbers were 3-6-8-43-48, with the Powerball 1.

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Blames Technical Problems  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- American balloonist Kevin Uliassi said
Sunday that minor technical problems forced him to abort an attempt
to become the first person to fly solo around the world in a
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi landed his craft safely on Friday in a field in central
Myanmar, also known as Burma. He had traveled more than 10 days,
covering 13,000 miles from the United States and across the
Atlantic Ocean, north Africa and India.
</P>
<P>
   Upon landing, he hit his head as his balloon tried to skirt palm
trees and struck an embankment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was unconscious for a very short period, and the villagers
helped me out. I couldn't think of a better place to land,''
Uliassi told reporters before leaving Myanmar for Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to spend a night in Bangkok, Thailand, before
heading home to Chicago on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi, whose flight crew is based in the Chicago suburb of
Homewood, said his flight time of about 245 hours was the
longest-ever solo flight in a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was over Burma that I experienced difficulties, and I
decided very quickly to land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a series of small problems, technical problems. I
had enough fuel for nine days. I made an emergency landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi said he would give details of his problems upon his
return to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not disappointed in failing to achieve his goal
of circling the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We measure success in small packages,'' he said. ''First,
success is launching. And this was the longest solo flight ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi said he had no plans yet for another attempt, but said
he hoped to return to Myanmar with his wife, and thanked the
Myanmar people for their assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous part of his try was flying near the Dominican
Republic, where he encountered a severe thunderstorm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi last communicated with his flight crew in Homewood about
13 hours before he landed Friday, saying he was going to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   When the command center noticed he was descending, the crew
sought assistance from the State Department, which had the Myanmar
government begin a search-and-rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar authorities said he landed near railroad tracks and a
road 310 miles north of the capital, Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a hospital, where an examination found he had
suffered only a few bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard and English
balloon instructor Brian Jones became the first people to circle
the world nonstop in a hot air balloon, landing safely in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This was Uliassi's second try at becoming the first person to
circle the globe alone.
</P>
<P>
   On his first attempt, in 1997, his balloon ruptured over O'Hare
International Airport, forcing him down in Indiana. Uliassi lives
in Scottsdale, Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Relations Improving Some in Balkans  </HEADLINE>
By VESELIN TOSHKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLOVDIV, Bulgaria (AP) -- The foreign ministers of three
traditional Balkan rivals gathered at a symbolic meeting Sunday
meant to demonstrate improving relations among them.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Cem of Turkey and George Papandreou of Greece arrived in
the southern Bulgarian city of Plovdiv at the invitation of their
Bulgarian counterpart, Nadezhda Mihailova, to discuss cooperation
among the three bordering countries and Balkans stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''This meeting symbolizes the opening up of a new spirit of
cooperation in the region,'' Papandreu said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the ministers expressed hope that the
Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe -- an international effort
meant to reward progress toward democracy with financial and
development aid -- will give a strong impetus for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two NATO allies, Turkey and Greece, have
decreased sharply in the past year with a series of diplomatic and
civic initiatives, including an outpouring of mutual aid during
serious earthquakes in both countries last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Greece dropped its veto and allowed Turkey to be
considered for European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the recent escalation of violence in Kosovo, the
three foreign ministers called for a more active peacemaking role
of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria, once a Cold War enemy of NATO members Greece and
Turkey, has improved relations with both neighbors. Its aspirations
for NATO membership have been supported by Greece and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Report: 2 Bosnian-Serbs Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers on Sunday
arrested two Bosnian Serbs, one of whom is accused of committing
war crimes while helping run a notorious internment camp, Serb
police sources and media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were identified as Dragoljub Prcac and Rade
Mikanovic. The Belgrade-based Beta news agency said Prcac was the
deputy commander of the Omarska camp.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of emaciated Muslim prisoners at that camp and two
others in 1993 fed international outrage against atrocities
committed in the Bosnian war. That outrage led to the setting up of
the U.N. war crimes tribunal and to NATO's intervention two years
later, which helped end the war.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands, confirmed one
arrest but gave no details, possibly meaning that Mikanovic was
only briefly detained because he was with Prcac and then released
because he was not being sought.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of this morning, there has been a NATO operation underway
on behalf of the tribunal,'' said spokesman Paul Risley.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal issued an indictment in 1995 for Prcac, on
allegations of war crimes committed during his time at Omarska.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives in Sarajevo and Brussels, the
organization's headquarters, said they had no immediate information
on the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The two were arrested after three NATO vehicles stopped their
car, local Serb police sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Beta said the arrests took place in the village of Jelicka, near
Prijedor. The NATO troops broke a window of the vehicle the two
were traveling in and dragged the two outside, the news agency
said.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese disposal experts on Sunday defused an
unexploded bomb believed to have been dropped by U.S. forces during
World War II, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The one-ton bomb was unearthed in January on a construction site
in a residential area of Osaka, 255 miles west of Tokyo, a
spokesman from the prefectural police said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Police stopped subway trains running through the neighborhood
and closed off a section of an expressway passing near the site
during the 2{-hour operation to defuse the bomb, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some 3,400 people within a 220-yard radius around
the site were evacuated, according to Kyodo News agency.
</P>
<P>
   World War II-era explosives are occasionally found in cities
such as Osaka and Tokyo, which were heavily bombed during the war
by U.S. airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In February, some 10,000 residents of a Tokyo neighborhood were
temporarily evacuated after an unexploded bomb was found during
construction of a shopping center.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops on Alert for Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli police and troops were on top alert
Sunday for possible bomb attacks by Palestinian militants in
Israeli cities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were supported by helicopters and bomb squads with
dogs trained to detect explosives, a senior police officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Extra roadblocks were set up on the borders between the
Palestinian areas and Israel, and patrols were strengthened at
shopping malls, bus stations and other crowded places, said Yehuda
Bachar, the police chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our deployment consists of several concentric rings, beginning
with roadblocks on the border, followed by increased police
presence on the roads and crowded places in the cities,'' Bachar
told Israel radio. ''Our activities are both visible and covert.''
</P>
<P>
   The alert followed Thursday's siege of a house in the Israeli
Arab city of Taibeh, where Israeli police commandos killed four
Palestinian Islamic militants and arrested one other.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the uncovering of the cell by the
Israeli Shin Bet security service prevented a major attack. He did
not elaborate, but TV reports said the men were planning a series
of suicide bombing attacks in the greater Tel Aviv area.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not be imprecise to say that the present alert is a
consequence of the Taibeh affair,'' said Public Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami, who is responsible for the police.
</P>
<P>
   The cell belonged to the militant Hamas group, which is opposed
to the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombing attacks. Israeli media
reported Sunday that Hamas was determined to carry out a new
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli media said Palestinian security forces were
cooperating with Israel in the hunt for the Hamas militants, in an
attempt to prevent new attacks inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamas is a common enemy of the Palestinian Authority and
Israel,'' Ben-Ami told Israeli army radio, ''and the Authority
understands that Hamas is a fire which can consume the stability of
the Palestinian Authority too.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police have arrested two bodyguards in Hamas leader
Sheik Ahmed Yassin's entourage, Yassin told The Associated Press,
naming them as Soheal Abu-Naher and Ramez al-Halabi. Another six
members of Hamas' youth movement were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin accused Israel of grandstanding, saying he had nothing to
do with the Taibeh affair and has no connection with the military
wing of Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those people want to show that they have found evidence and a
big story, and they want to give the Israeli people the feeling
that they are taking care of Israeli security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that two of the dead named by the
Israeli media -- Nael Abu Awad and Ali Hassanein -- were followers of
Hamas.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Thatcher Gave Pinochet Plate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given
Gen. Augusto Pinochet a silver plate originally cast to celebrate
Sir Francis Drake's victory over the Spanish fleet -- a clear
reference to Spain's failed attempt to extradite the former Chilean
dictator, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Thatcher had arranged for the plate -- the
design for which was first cast in 1588 -- to be delivered to
Pinochet's plane as it prepared to take off from a British air
force base Thursday for Chile. The plate was inscribed with
Thatcher's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the plate was a note from Thatcher that read:
''Your return to Chile has ensured that Spain's attempts to impose
judicial colonialism have been firmly rebuffed,'' the Sunday Times
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from Thatcher, who defended
Pinochet throughout his 16-month detention in Britain and argued
for his release.
</P>
<P>
   The general was a key ally of Britain in its 1982 war with
Argentina over the Falkland Islands, which occurred when Thatcher
was in power.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had been held on an extradition warrant issued by a
Spanish judge who wanted to try him for alleged human rights abuses
during his 1973-90 dictatorship. He was released after Home
Secretary Jack Straw ruled he was medically unfit to stand trial.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Found Near Swiss Summit Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) -- Police found a bomb hidden close to a
conference center where world leaders, including President Clinton,
gathered earlier this year, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb, weighing between 11 and 22 pounds, was found inside a
trash sack in an electricity substation 200 yards from the
conference center in Davos, an eastern Swiss ski resort, the weekly
SonntagsBlick reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the bomb was discovered Feb. 25, less than a
month after the end of the World Economic Forum, which attracted
political and business leaders from across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The federal justice department said an investigation had been
launched.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tightened in Davos this year, following December's
violence at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. There
was no repeat of Seattle, but about 1,000 protesters against free
trade defied a ban on demonstrations, and some windows and vehicles
were vandalized.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the event, firework rockets shattered two
windows at the conference center.

<HEADLINE> Blair Blocks Former Nanny's Article  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie have
gone to court to stop a newspaper from publishing an account of
life at Number 10 Downing Street written by their children's former
nanny.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid Mail on Sunday was forced to pull the story from its
early editions, which appeared Saturday night, after a judge
granted the Blairs an injunction barring publication of the memoirs
of Rosalind Mark.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman, said the
article ''represents a clear breach of a confidentiality agreement
between the Blairs and their former nanny.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Sunday, Mark denied she had given the material to
the newspaper or authorized its publication, blaming literary
agent, Jonathan Harris, ''the only person to whom I showed the
manuscript.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm absolutely devastated that something I wanted to be nice
about ... has been presented in the way that it has and has caused
them upset,'' she said. ''I'm absolutely sickened by what has gone
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Sunday, the newspaper stood by its
story, saying its reporters had spoken with Mark on Friday and
Saturday and that she had revealed the contents of the book and
posed for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Mark has written a book in which she
chronicled the four years she spent with the family until 1998,
during which time Blair's Labor Party moved from opposition into
power.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Mark gives an affectionate and intimate
picture of a genuinely happy family and sheds new light on Blair's
political life, his opinions and relations with other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Mail on Sunday said Mark would give money raised by the book
to charity. It has yet to find a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairs have kept their three children well away from the
media spotlight. Downing Street officials never comment on their
activities, and they are rarely photographed. Mrs. Blair is
expecting a fourth child in May.

<HEADLINE> Creatine May Help Athletes Perform  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Creatine, the supplement that many athletes
take to help build muscle, may also help their performance in their
games, new studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The amino acid already has been shown to help the body store
energy that can be used in short bursts to help athletes train
longer and harder. The new studies suggest creatine also may help
muscle recover faster in such sports as basketball, football,
soccer and baseball. However, one dissenter says the case for
creatine as a performance aid is far from proven.
</P>
<P>
   The two Spanish studies are in the American College of Sports
Medicine journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Creatine-supplemented players showed an improved performance
during six 15-meter sprints, as well as a limited decay in jumping
performance after an exhausting soccer-specific intermittent
endurance test,'' said one examination of highly trained soccer
players.
</P>
<P>
   In this experiment, 17 athletes were divided randomly into two
groups, one getting creatine and the other getting a fake
preparation for comparison purposes. The creatine group received 20
grams a day for six days, which is considered enough to load muscle
with the compound.
</P>
<P>
   On sprints, the creatine group showed better performance than
the group on the fake compound, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The creatine group's average improvements were .02 seconds over
5 meters and .03 seconds over 15 meters, the report said. These
improvements would translate into distances during play ''which
would be more than enough to outrun an opponent and, for example,
maintain possession of the ball,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Spanish researchers looked at whether creatine helps in
aerobic exercise. This project involved 14 highly trained cyclists
who were similarly divided into creatine and placebo groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-day study, the athletes rode stationary bikes,
alternating 3 minutes at 30 percent of their maximum abilities with
3 minutes at 90 percent, and kept this up until they could no
longer continue the pace. Researchers measured how much oxygen the
athletes were using.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes in the creatine group were able to continue longer,
compared with their pre-supplementation levels, improving from
almost 30 minutes to about 37 minutes, the researchers said. The
group on placebo made no such improvement, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The riders in the creatine group also were able to use more
oxygen in the rides at 90 percent of their maximums, while athletes
in the placebo group did not show this improvement, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the creatine group of cyclists showed less
accumulation in the blood of ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism
during exercise. This indicates the athletes on creatine may have
become more metabolically efficient, the researchers in the cycling
study said. The creatine group of soccer players also had less
ammonia.
</P>
<P>
   ''To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting in vivo
changes in oxygen consumption with decreased blood ammonia
accumulation and improvements in humans during relative long
duration muscular contraction after creatine supplementation,'' the
researchers said. In vivo means within a living organism.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence is accumulating that creatine enhances short-term
sprinting and repeated sprinting,'' said researcher Richard B.
Kreider of the University of Memphis, who was not a part of either
study. This may make the chemical valuable in many sports,
including baseball, swimming and hockey, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings take creatine's potential beyond the original
concept that it helped in strength training, Kreider said.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine, which the body makes as well as accepts as
supplements, works by helping to replenish adenosine triphosphate,
known as ATP, which is a cellular fuel. Adding creatine could help
strength athletes train because they would have more energy
available for, say, lifting weights -- and could recover faster from
the energy demands of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The new research indicates creatine helps to move fuel in the
cell to where it is needed, so athletes become more metabolically
efficient and can perform better in their sports, Kreider said.
</P>
<P>
   However, another expert thinks creatine's value has yet to be
proved. One problem is that creatine users may guess they are
getting something that could make them stronger, because creatine
makes them bigger, said researcher Ronald L. Terjung of the
University of Missouri, Columbia. If athletes expect this, they may
work harder and therefore would produce better results on the
experiments even if creatine itself were having no effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am dumbfounded that they can truly be blinded that they are
on creatine,'' Terjung said. ''To be taking these gram quantities
and be naive to what's happening is becoming more and more
far-fetched.''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Intrigued by Winter Harvest  </HEADLINE>
By ANN S. KIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, Maine (AP) -- A carpet of snow covers the Laughing
Stock Farm and the ground is frozen four feet deep. But, unlike
most farmers, Lisa Turner has not hibernated for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature drops to 13.5 degrees on a typical February day,
but that doesn't stop Turner from heading out each morning to tend
her tiny salad mix plants in unheated greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   She is among a handful of Maine farmers who have begun
cultivating their crops in the dead of winter without the benefit
of heaters to coax their greenhouse plants along. The technique
relies on natural sunlight, careful planning and plastic layers to
insulate the plants.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about twice as long for the plants to reach maturity in
the winter than in the summer, but Turner has managed to harvest
hundreds of pounds of salad mix since November.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her three greenhouses are unheated, and the temperature
dips to freezing at night. But the temperature reached 67 degrees
inside the greenhouses on a recent sunny day.
</P>
<P>
   Turner started winter farming after being intrigued by the
success of Eliot Coleman and Barbara Damrosch, a husband-and-wife
team who are so successful with their winter harvest -- greens, root
vegetables, peas and scallions, to name a few -- that they have
given up summer growing at their farm in Brooksville.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman has been experimenting with winter cultivation for two
decades and has transformed his Four Seasons Farm into a successful
winter operation over the past five years. Everything Coleman and
his wife grow is sold to nearby restaurants and markets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bordering Canada, Maine gets the same amount of light as
the Mediterranean. In fact, the cold Atlantic waters off Portland
are at the same latitude as the beaches of St. Tropez.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have as much sun. They just have the Mediterranean and the
Gulf Stream making their winters, on average, 25 degrees warmer. We
make up those 25 degrees with two layers of plastic,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the snow clinging to the sides of Turner's Freeport
greenhouses, a different micro-climate lies under the plastic
blanket covering the plants for much of the day. The covering is
enough for the hardy winter vegetables to withstand freezing
temperatures overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The technique doesn't work with warm weather plants like
tomatoes, but Coleman and Damrosch say it makes more sense to eat
with the seasons anyway. Carrots are sweeter when grown in the cold
months and arugula loses the bite it has when grown in the warmer
months, Damrosch says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why eat things that taste like cardboard when you can eat
things that are meant to grow in the winter and taste
magnificent?'' Coleman asks.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman and Damrosch hope farms like theirs sprout up across the
state to supply people with fresh, locally grown products. Their
ideas do seem to be catching on in Bath, Belfast, Brooks and Lisbon
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   That the trend seems to be concentrated around the coast is a
coincidence, according to Eric Sideman, staff scientist of the
Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association. He said the
success of the technique doesn't rely on the coastal climate, but
the location of those farms do offer a different kind of advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need an affluent market to sell it to and in Maine the
affluent market is along the coast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie MacDougall, owner of Blue Sky Farm in Wells, grows herbs
in her unheated greenhouses. She says the techniques have extended
her growing season and have allowed her to grow some plants that
would not normally survive in Maine. Rosemary in her greenhouse
blooms in March, just like in south France, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've also been able to grow bay in there, little bay trees.
And those certainly shouldn't be able to grow here. You see them in
the Middle East,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Libby, executive director of Maine Organic Farmers and
Gardeners Association, says people have been experimenting with
winter cultivation since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people trying Coleman's techniques seem to be
concentrated in Maine's active organic farming community, but it
looks like word could spread. He travels to conferences and
recently published an article in Mother Earth News magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of like Eliot Coleman is Lewis and Clark and we're
the pioneers following,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the first year Turner has tried her hand at
commercial winter farming and she had a lot of initial expenses on
the greenhouses, she doesn't expect to see a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to say I'm making a fortune from it, but there are a
lot of bugs that need to be worked out,'' she says. Nonetheless,
Turner thinks she will probably put up more greenhouses next year:
''I have faith in what's going on.''

<HEADLINE> Nonvital Organ Transplant Debated  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES RITCHIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Not long ago, Matthew Scott did something
he had wanted to do for years. He started wearing his wedding ring
on his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   It is an indication of how comfortable Scott now feels with the
limb doctors took from a cadaver and attached to his forearm in a
14{-hour operation at Jewish Hospital a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   When surgeons in Louisville began talking about performing the
nation's first hand transplant, many in their field had serious
reservations. The likelihood of success was too small, critics
said, the ethical concerns too great.
</P>
<P>
   Despite promising results so far, the debate over the future of
transplants of such nonvital organs has yet to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicists have been most concerned that transplant
patients must take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives
to keep the body from trying to destroy the foreign tissue. The
drugs suppress the immune system, leading to an increased risk for
infections, cancer and even death.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Linda Emanuel, director of the American Medical
Association's Institute on Ethics, the basic question has not
changed: Do the potential gains of the procedure justify the risks?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is clear for a heart or liver transplant because the
patient will die without the organ. Nonvital parts such as a hand
require further contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, 38, lost his hand in a firecracker accident in 1985 and
did not adjust well to a prosthesis. He knows the transplanted hand
he received in January 1999 will never be as good as his real one,
but he has no regrets about the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a different person now than I was a year ago,'' he said.
''A lot of those daily frustrations -- the kind that would send a
pen flying across the room -- are gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's doctors say his progress has met all of their
expectations. They recently showed video of him using the new left
hand to write his name, pour a glass of water, deal cards and tie
his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is those things that most people never think about that
matter most to Scott, who works as an administrator for an
emergency medical center in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At first, many doctors doubted he would ever develop useful
function or sensation in the new extremity. But he now has some
feeling in his fingertips, can feel changes in temperature and can
move his thumb as he begins to gain function in the small muscles
of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   The progress is part of the reason why in January, on his last
visit to Louisville for a checkup, Scott and his wife, Dawn, went
to a jeweler and got his wedding band resized.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Scott's case shows that such an operation has
some benefits for the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are more optimistic about it now. Someone has
lived to talk about it a year later,'' Emanuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Given what is known, Emanuel believes the surgeons in Louisville
are justified in continuing their work on hand transplants. But the
situation still bears watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have some reservations,'' Emanuel said. ''Those reservations
are somewhat diminished, but they're not completely gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's doctors, meanwhile, say they are ready to perform
another transplant as soon as a suitable match can be found between
patient and donor. It's a plan the American Society for Surgery of
the Hand opposes, even as it advises caution.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Dr. William P. Cooney, said no further
hand transplants should be performed until doctors from around the
country can examine Scott and confirm his progress. The group would
also like to see more animal research.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's doctors cannot guarantee that he will not lose the hand,
nor can they be sure that future patients would keep transplanted
hands. Cooney said it would be a shame to perform the operation on
several more patients, only to learn eventually that the
transplants had a high rate of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Matthew Tomaino, chief of microsurgery for the University of
Pittsburgh's orthopedic surgery department, said he is closely
observing Scott's case. Initially skeptical that a transplanted
hand would ever have much sensation, Tomaino said he's been
impressed by Scott's improvement. If Scott continues to improve
after a couple of years, he said, he could foresee the University
of Pittsburgh attempting the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the future of nonvital transplantation is very bright.
It makes complete sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomaino was particularly encouraged when he learned that Scott's
regimen of anti-rejection drugs is similar to what kidney
transplant recipients take. That means his immune system is not
suppressed as much as those of patients who receive other organs,
such as a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Five people in the world are living with transplanted hands. Two
of them underwent surgery in France, with the first receiving a
hand in September 1998. Two have had hands attached in recent
months in China.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jon Jones, the lead transplant surgeon for Scott, said he
anticipates hand transplants will continue to be performed on a
low-volume basis for several years until there are major advances
in preventing rejection -- possibly treatments that do not affect
the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Then the benefits of the surgery would be proportionately higher
and larger numbers of people might opt for it, he said, as long as
doctors can show that transplanted hands can consistently develop
good function and improve quality of life.

<HEADLINE> Irish Gays Pledge To Protest Parade  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's deja vu. Or in this case, O'vu.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization wanted to march up Fifth
Avenue in the annual St. Patrick Day Parade -- again.
</P>
<P>
   Parade organizers refused them a permit -- again.
</P>
<P>
   The gay activists went to court and lost -- again, the eighth
straight year of failed efforts to infiltrate the nation's oldest
and largest celebration of Irishness.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the ILGO members have already vowed to try again next
year -- but only after protesting (again), by flooding Fifth Avenue
with some 2,000 demonstrators March 17.
</P>
<P>
   There may be peace in Northern Ireland before this Manhattan
battle is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The parade's organizers, the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
promise their opposition to ILGO is unwavering. But it's not just
the gays who raise the Hibernians' Irish; Ernest Mathews, the
Hibernians' attorney, insists that the ancient order merely wants
to keep the focus on Irish-Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hibernians would object if Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
marched,'' Mathews vows. It's a good analogy: the decade-long fight
has left ILGO members grumpy, parade organizers happy, and many
others a bit sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   And all this fuss is over a gay rights organization that never
had more than 50 active members, and is now down to under a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's edition of the parade is its 239th, the gay
angle only emerged in 1991 after ILGO first petitioned to march
under its own banner. The group had formed a year earlier as a
meeting place for the city's gay Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The application drew instant, overwhelming attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had everything: politics, religion, sex,'' recalls Anne
Maguire, a founding ILGO member.
</P>
<P>
   The Hibernians quickly objected, saying the Catholic Church's
opposition to homosexuality made the gays unwelcome in the parade.
A deal was brokered that allowed ILGO to march, but not as the
Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they were sponsored by a Manhattan division of the
Hibernians. The result was bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very ugly,'' remembers ex-mayor David Dinkins, who
accompanied 35 ILGO members along the 2{-mile parade route. ''It
was reminiscent of some of the incidents in the Deep South during
the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Full cans of beer were thrown at the marchers, while spectators
sprayed them with beer and insults. Police guarding Dinkins opened
umbrellas to protect the mayor from the sudsy fusillade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terrifying, and it was really moving in a lot of ways,
and totally surreal,'' says Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the gays were out of the parade -- but they were
allowed to stage a pre-parade march along the route. The next year,
they were not allowed to march at all. And so things have remained
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   This year's banishment was sealed exactly one month before the
festivities, when a federal jury ruled that the city did not
violate ILGO's civil rights by refusing its bid to hold a
pre-parade march.
</P>
<P>
   While ILGO was disappointed, the decision did nothing to change
its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before the actual parade steps off, ILGO plans to pour
demonstrators into Fifth Avenue at 59th Street. Dozens of gay
activists from Ireland are flying in to participate; some members
of the original ''ILGO 35'' are planning a St. Patrick's Day
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Why do this again?
</P>
<P>
   ''Their decision to keep us out is based on bigotry against
lesbians and gay men who are open,'' Maguire says. ''So I think
it's just as important now as it was in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its dwindling membership and a mailing list that is
about half its peak of 400, ILGO still wields some political and
media clout. When U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
announced plans to march in this year's parade, ILGO accused the
first lady of being insensitive to their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who now plans to march at a different,
''all-inclusive'' St. Patrick's Day Parade in Queens, has not said
whether she will join in the Manhattan festivities.
</P>
<P>
   While ILGO fights its losing battle in Manhattan, gay
contingents are already marching in St. Patrick's Day parades in
Seattle, San Francisco, and Cambridge, Mass., as well as in cities
across Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the irony,'' Maguire says with a wry grin. ''Most of us
came to New York because it was so oppressive in Ireland. And then
they're marching in Cork. They're marching in Dublin and Galway,
and in Belfast, Limerick and Derry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Totally ironic.''
</P>
<P>
   ILGO, despite its repeated losses in court and the endless
rebuffs from the Hibernians, says it will be back next year in an
effort to join the parade -- again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a tradition now,'' says Maguire. ''We're just as
much a part of the day as anything in the parade. You can't mention
the parade without mentioning us.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe one year they'll think, 'OK, let's give in and get it
over with.'''

<HEADLINE> Pinochet's Return Sparks Questions  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet's return home last
week spurred Chile into an uproar: Pollsters quizzed residents
about whether they thought he will face trial here, pundits
speculated on the lawsuits awaiting him and locals argued
incessantly over his legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   But for Elisa Sepulveda Lazo, the burning question isn't the
fate of the 84-year-old former dictator. She just wants to find out
what happened to Luis, her husband, who vanished at the hands of
the Pinochet secret police one afternoon in December 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only think I want to know is, where did they kill Luis?''
asks Lazo, 67. ''Where did they throw him and the others? We've
gone all these years without knowing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's return from more than 15 months of detention in
London has divided Chile along ideological fault lines as severe as
the geographical rifts of this quake-prone South American country.
</P>
<P>
   But for many kin of some 3,200 people the government listed as
detained and disappeared during the 1973-1990 right-wing
dictatorship, the issue is more than one of politics. It is more
than whether the white-haired Pinochet, who now clutches a cane in
his once-legendary iron fist, was truly medically unfit for trial
in Spain on torture charges stemming from his rule here.
</P>
<P>
   Their overriding question is embodied in a Spanish phrase
plastered on photographs of the victims that have been carried for
years at anti-Pinochet rallies: ''Donde estan?''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ''Where are they?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the missing is Luis Lazo, a labor leader who was
dismissed from Chile's electric company after the coup that brought
Pinochet to power. Lazo knew he was being watched before he
vanished near his home on Dec. 15, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''To this day we don't know what happened. He just
disappeared,'' said his wife, who carries his picture in a worn
plastic sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Allende lost her father, elected Marxist president
Salvador Allende, in the chaos of the September 1973 military coup.
She said many families need to know what happened if the country is
to find closure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wounds haven't healed and they won't heal because we still
have not obtained justice or truth,'' Allende said.
</P>
<P>
   She joined hundreds of Pinochet opponents for a march Saturday
to the government palace. The palace is the spot where her father
died in an army assault and air force bombardment that left the
historic building smoldering.
</P>
<P>
   While many of Chile's 14 million people consider Pinochet a
savior who plucked the country from leftist chaos under Allende's
crisis-ridden rule, many also complain the coup interrupted a
century-old democratic tradition that was longer than most in the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Chants of ''Pinochet, Assassin!'' and ''Trial for Pinochet!''
were revived anew as demonstrators lowered the 12 large Chilean
flags to half-staff outside the government palace last week. ''Our
lives will never be the same,'' declared Isabel Gallardo, who lost
several family members during Pinochet's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Gallardo was one of the more fortunate ones: The bodies of her
father and others were recovered. But all showed signs of torture
and mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet returned to Chile on Friday after 503 days under house
arrest in Britain. He had been held on a warrant by a Spanish judge
who wanted to extradite him and try him for human rights abuses.
But British officials let him go after medical reports said he was
unfit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   That decision won support from some quarters. Former British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave Pinochet a silver plate
originally cast to celebrate Sir Francis Drake's 16th century
victory over the Spanish fleet -- a clear reference to the failed
extradition attempt, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Thatcher had arranged for the plate to be
delivered to Pinochet's plane as it prepared to take off from
Britain on Thursday. Accompanying it was a note from Thatcher that
read: ''Your return to Chile has ensured that Spain's attempts to
impose judicial colonialism have been firmly rebuffed,'' the Sunday
Times said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pinochet is ensconced behind his walled compound in an
affluent Santiago suburb, guarded by commandos in camouflage. His
arrival in Santiago was replete with helicopters, adoring throngs
and sharpshooters on rooftops to guard him -- in short, a live
broadcast drama as gripping for Chileans as the O.J. Simpson chase
was for American television.
</P>
<P>
   As the drama fades, ''Where are they?'' remains the nagging
question each day for Carmen Vivanco.
</P>
<P>
   She lost her husband, Oscar, and a 24-year-old son on Aug. 4,
1976, when agents took them away. The police came back the same
week and seized her brother, a sister-in-law and niece. She has
never heard a word about any of their fates.
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing their whereabouts, Vivanco cannot forget the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like being tortured every day,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Parkway eyes E-ZPass discount  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Motorists who use the E-ZPass electronic
toll collection system may get a discount on the Garden State
Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Highway Authority, which runs the Parkway, is
considering giving drivers a price break for using E-ZPass. But the
toll road's tight budget may prevent such a discount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd have to get an analysis of what (a discount) would mean to
us,'' said Highway Authority Chairman Joseph Buckelew.
</P>
<P>
   He said a report examining the issue should be ready in six
weeks to two months.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Parkway officials have rejected the idea of a toll
discount.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a discount is approved, it probably wouldn't be a
bonanza for drivers: just 1.7 cents off the regular 35-cent toll,
the same discount enjoyed by those who buy Parkway tokens.
</P>
<P>
   Other roads, bridges and tunnels that use E-ZPass offer
motorists a discount. But many of those, such as the Atlantic City
Expressway, debuted E-ZPass at the same time as a toll increase
took place.
</P>
<P>
   That's what's happening with the New Jersey Turnpike, where
E-ZPass users will pay 8 percent more, while cash customers will
pay 20 percent more when the service starts on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Parkway notes that even a slight discount could hurt its
bottom line. It costs the toll road 2.5 cents to handle an
exact-change or token payment, but 4.3 cents to process an E-ZPass
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman supports the idea of a Parkway toll
discount for E-ZPass, spokesman Peter McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to their analysis, and hope there wouldn't be
an adverse financial impact from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the amount of fines collected from E-ZPass toll
violators --a key source of funding for the project-- is running far
below projections, according to a consortium of five transportation
agencies in New Jersey, New York and Delaware. The agencies expect
to get $450 million in fines over the next decade to finance
E-ZPass.
</P>
<P>
   But less than $1 million has been collected since July, when the
consortium's violations processing center started operations. The
group expected to get $17.8 million in 1998 and 1999, $78.4 million
this year, and $96.9 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Gross, executive director of the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority, the lead agency in the consortium, is confident revenues
will increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cut us a break for a year and let us see if this model, which
is designed to be as fair to the public as possible, is working,''
he said. ''I think it will.''

<HEADLINE> Mine Workers Face Uncertain Future  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It's a middle-aged worker's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the United Mine Workers of America -- average
age 50, job prospects uncertain -- are trying to prepare for the
future of a coal mining industry that is changing rapidly under
economic and environmental pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows where the coal industry is heading?'' said UMW
President Cecil Roberts. ''We are being attacked on every front:
global warming, the Clean Air Act, mountaintop mining in West
Virginia, (mine) subsidence in Pennsylvania. It's something
everywhere you look.''
</P>
<P>
   During a four-day convention that begins Monday, union officers
will ask about 700 delegates to approve an early start to contract
negotiations with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, and to
make improved pension benefits the focus of those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to fight for our members' jobs,'' Roberts said.
''But if they can no longer work in the industry, they should at
least have a dignified retirement. The industry owes them that.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract with the employers' group expires in 2002 and
covers employees at the unionized subsidiaries of the nation's four
largest operators: Peabody Group, Arch Coal Inc., CONSOL Energy and
Zeigler Coal Holding.
</P>
<P>
   The American coal industry has undergone major changes as
mechanization has reduced the need for workers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, coal
industry productivity -- the amount of coal produced per worker per
hour -- more than doubled from 1986 to 1997, from 3.01 tons per
man-hour to 6.04 tons per man-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, production rose by less than a quarter,
from 890 million tons to 1.09 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
   The industry isn't producing anywhere near its capacity, and
average coal prices have fallen from $29.52 a ton in 1986 to $16.14
a ton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''These increases in productivity have led to a lot of layoffs,
and they threaten the jobs of those miners fortunate enough to
still have one,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The union itself goes into the convention a much leaner
organization than it was in 1995, when Roberts became president,
but on a more solid financial footing than it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   Its strike fund stands at $105 million, its pension fund is
estimated at $8 billion, and last year, the UMW sold its longtime
Washington headquarters, moving to the suburbs and adding $8
million to its general treasury fund, now at $27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the infusion of cash, the union still faces serious
problems in the trust fund that pays health benefits to 68,000
so-called ''orphan'' retirees, UMW members whose last employer has
gone out of business or can't be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs are rising, and enrollment in the plan has
swelled as coal companies have ceased to operate, industry analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The UMW does not release membership figures. But while coal
industry employment is dwindling, the union has been trying to pick
up new members in its traditional geographic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   It just won a representation election for city employees in
Butler, Pa. Other new locals include police officers in Wyoming and
health care workers in West Virginia. But it is hard for these
organizing drives to outpace the decline in membership in the
mines, and few of the new non-miner union members earn the $18 an
hour, plus benefits, that a top-scale miner earns.
</P>
<P>
   As still-working miners see job losses down the road, some of
those with at least 20 years on the job are taking early
retirement, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least 3,000 people have made application for benefits or
are already receiving benefits under the '20 and out' provision,''
Roberts said. ''We have some people as young as 39 receiving a UMWA
pension because of this program.
</P>
<P>
   ''That gives them an opportunity to stay in the coalfields and
raise their families in the coalfields, even if they can't find
another job as good as the one they had.''

<HEADLINE> Thais Hail First Senate Election  </HEADLINE>
By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's first Senate election was
hailed Sunday as a major step toward full-fledged democracy,
despite rampant vote-buying and victories by wives of Cabinet
ministers, provincial godfathers and suspected underworld figures.
</P>
<P>
   Observers praised the unprecedented voter turnout -- at least 70
percent by the Election Commission's unofficial count -- and wins by
independent-minded social workers, human rights activists,
academics and technocrats. The commission said it would announce
the official results late Sunday or Monday, but it did not expect
any major changes.
</P>
<P>
   The election was the first test of political reforms under the
1997 constitution, which attempts to increase citizens' political
participation while limiting the influence of money and special
interests. It was also the first time since Thailand adopted
constitutional rule 68 years ago that senators were elected rather
than appointed. Some past Senates were stacked with members of the
then-powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   ''A new chapter of Thai politics has just been opened,'' said
former Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun, a key architect of the
reformist constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Election Commission and independent watch groups
received thousands of calls complaining about vote-buying, fraud
and other irregularities. Several hundred voters turned up at polls
only to find their ballots had already been filled out.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Gen. Kowit Wattana estimated at least $540 million
may have changed hands in the feverish bid for ballots. Commission
member Gothom Arya said investigations would be launched and those
found guilty of fraud would face jail terms of up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 constitution empowers senators, who serve six-year
terms, to remove corrupt officials and politicians, including the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The election for the Senate does not affect the makeup of Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai's government. But the race for 200 Senate
seats was seen as a contest between the people's emerging power and
traditional money politics.
</P>
<P>
   The winners include slum workers and human rights lawyers.
Observers said such people would serve as a counterweight to the
roughly one-half of the winners who are closely related by blood or
loyalty to politicians or powerful provincial godfathers.
</P>
<P>
   While voting was mandatory, penalties for not doing so were
largely symbolic. Many voters had to travel for hours aboard packed
buses and trains to reach poll stations at their homes of record.
The cost of travel in many cases was higher than any cash corrupt
canvassers could offer.

<HEADLINE> Doctors report women reluctant to take trial breast cancer drugs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Some of the nation's top breast cancer
specialists are having a hard time recruiting enough women to
participate in a breast cancer drug trial that is one of the
largest such studies ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   In May, doctors embarked on a study to compare the effectiveness
of two promising cancer prevention drugs -- tamoxifen and raloxifene
-- but discovered they couldn't persuade enough women to volunteer
as test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Sunday's editions that of
the 22,000 women needed for the nationwide study, only 3,500 women
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   The drug trial is called STAR, standing for the Study of
Tamoxifen and Raloxifene. Doctors were hoping it would prove which
drug can best prevent cancer in post-menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   ''The recruiting is going much more slowly than we thought it
would,'' said Deborah Capko, a breast surgeon at the Institute for
Breast Cancer at Hackensack University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 women Capko interviewed since last summer, only six
have volunteered to take part in the study.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for women's reluctance to participate in the study is
how the test would work.
</P>
<P>
   Women would be given either tamoxifen or raloxifene, but the
subject would not know which drug she was taking.
</P>
<P>
   Others who fit the profile of a perfect volunteer -- middle-aged
women at risk for breast cancer -- are taking hormone replacement
drugs and don't want to stop taking them to participate in the
study.
</P>
<P>
   And some women are already prescribed raloxifene for
osteoporosis, while others are taking the drug for cancer
prevention. Raloxifene was approved for preventing osteoporosis by
the Food and Drug Administration in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tamoxifen was approved by the FDA for breast cancer prevention
in women who are at high-risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But some women are afraid of tamoxifen's side effects, which
could range from nausea to uterine cancer. However, those risks are
minimal when statistically compared to the chances of developing
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To defray recruitment costs, Eli Lilly and Co., maker of
raloxifene, has contributed $36 million for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly and Astra-Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures
tamoxifen, are spending millions more to provide the drug for free.
</P>
<P>
   Managing the study is a Pittsburgh-based organization called The
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. The group is
funded primarily by the federal National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wickerman, associate chairman of the national trial
center, acknowledged that recruiting women for the drug trial is
challenging, and suggested recruitment trouble might not be limited
to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clearly not just a problem in this area,'' said Judy
Much, a nurse practitioner managing the trial at the Cancer
Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick. ''All over the country,
people are saying the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bishop, 57, an oncology nurse at Newark Beth Israel
Hospital, has been taking her two unidentified pills since October.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think about statistics, I think about individuals,
about people,'' said Bishop, a mother of two daughters. ''And if
this helps save one life, then it's worth it to me.''

   SINGAPORE (AP) -- The outcome of presidential elections in the
United States will not affect the country's policy towards Asia, a
top U.S. official said Sunday.
</P>

<P>
   He said the United States' relationship with China would be ''a

<HEADLINE> Vini, vidi, vici: Paterson-born actor plays casino's Julius Caesar  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- He's been a dancer, a mime, a
juggler, a magician, a comedian, an actor, and a goodwill
ambassador. He's worked at world's fairs, resorts, community
theaters, on cruise ships and on stages.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing quite like being Julius Caesar, says Charles
Senack.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it means parading past the baccarat pits in a
thigh-length tunic. Or fending off frisky fans who want a piece of
him. Or coaxing silver-haired gamblers into a mid-afternoon game of
Simon Says, next to the Elvis slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, I'm an emperor. And who wouldn't want to be an emperor?''
says Senack, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Senack portrays the Roman Emperor five days a week at Caesars
Atlantic City Hotel Casino.
</P>
<P>
   For boxing matches and processions, news conferences and
ceremonies, Senack acts as goodwill ambassador and symbolic head of
Caesar's ''empire'' on the Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from ancient Rome to casino-era Atlantic City.
But Senack has his sandals planted firmly in both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a maroon-and-gold tunic, a microphone-equipped
breastplate and a laurel wreath crown, Senack gets in character and
stays in it, come hell, high water or grumpy gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   He schmoozes high rollers and nickel slot players alike as he
moves through the casino accompanied by Cleopatra, centurion
soldier Flavius and cut-up messenger Bacchanalius.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have some stock things I say, like 'From what far-off land
do you come?' 'Pittsburgh.' 'Oh, yes, Pittsburgh. I conquered
Pittsburgh.'
</P>
<P>
   ''People like to warn me about the ides of March, or tell me to
beware of Brutus. One day, I was doing the medallion ceremony and
this guy comes up and he's hitting me in the chest. 'I'm stabbing
you, I'm stabbing you,' he says, and I'm trying to hold him off
while I finish my speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People have been known to get personal with Caesar,'' he says,
lowering his eyes to his left leg, where the tunic ends and a hairy
leg begins. How personal? Caesar won't say. An emperor has his
limits.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't always an emperor. A native of Paterson, he started
acting at Eastside High School and studied theater after that at
New York University. He took lessons in dance, folk dance, mime,
improvisational theater and juggling and found work where he could.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he met and studied briefly with famed mime Marcel
Marceau, worked for a dance company, learned magic and developed
his own character -- the Silent Cop, a mime who would write
summonses for people and play other imaginary games without ever
opening his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He performed at world's fairs in Vancouver, B.C. and Brisbane,
Australia and worked for Carnival Cruise Lines and Club Med.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the real Julius Caesar (100 B.C. to 44 B.C.), he didn't
ascend the throne by driving the Germans out of Gaul, establishing
a colony in Carthage or defeating Pompey's army. He got the job
through the want ads.
</P>
<P>
   Farrington Productions, a Las Vegas-based special events
company, was advertising for an actor to portray a jester. When he
sent in his picture, company manager Tom Presti saw an emperor.
</P>
<P>
   He was bald, he was graying, he was ... imperial-looking.
Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looking for an elder statesman, since Atlantic City is
an older crowd,'' Presti said. ''In Vegas, it's a younger crowd. So
we have a younger Caesar there.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was only the backup Caesar, working 20-hour weeks.
Then his predecessor gave up the crown for a job with an
illusionist. Senack stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the perfect job for me,'' he said recently, during a
dressing-room interview before his shift. ''I love interacting with
people. I'm comfortable with the job and it suits me. I like being
playful with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Five times a day, he leads a procession through the casino.
Fanfare blows and he and Cleopatra stroll through the slot
machines. Some gamblers jerk their heads around to see what the
commotion is, others barely notice him.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping for the medallion ceremony, he bellows: ''I, Caesar,
along with the enchanting Cleopatra, and our royal entourage
welcome you to Caesars. Yes, I, Caesar, am feeling most grand today
and would like to invite each of you to sample the marvelous
pleasures of my empire,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bacchanalius lines about eight gamblers up for a game of
Simon Says. The winner gets a gold medallion. Senack keeps a
straight face the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's irony, sure. I'm very conscious of portraying Caesar.
Then I'll look up and see the Elvis slot machines. You can't help
but realize where you are,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Or forget who you are -- even at home with his wife and two young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''My daughter walks around the house saying, 'Hail, Caesar,'''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats in fierce battle over future of Medicaid  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a Democratic race where the candidates
agree on much, Bill Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid has produced
the sharpest disagreement, as Al Gore accuses Bradley of putting
millions of poor Americans in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid now offers generous benefits but pays doctors very
little. Bradley promises to keep the benefits while paying doctors
more, but experts say that will cost more than he thinks. And many
of Medicaid's problems may be endemic to poor communities, and
shifting insurance plans won't help.
</P>
<P>
   For those with no health insurance, experts agree, Bradley's
plan is a huge step forward, albeit an expensive one -- a total of
$65 billion each year. He allows people to buy into the health
insurance program for federal workers, with new subsidies for many.
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications are more complicated for those already in
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors are loathe to practice in poor communities, and his
plan won't change that. Some parents can't leave their jobs during
the day to see a doctor, meaning they land at the emergency room at
night. Bradley's plan won't change that either.
</P>
<P>
   And experts suspect it will cost more than Bradley budgets just
to maintain the benefits Medicaid now provides.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would move millions of poor women and children from 50
state-run Medicaid programs into the federal system that provides
health insurance for government workers. He'd also open the program
to any American who wants in, subsidizing premiums for people with
low and moderate incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, has a plan, that would tinker with the current system
rather than replace it. He also would let more people qualify for
government coverage, but not as many.
</P>
<P>
   The point of sharpest debate is how people now in Medicaid would
fare under Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley complains that many doctors decline to participate in
Medicaid because the program pays them so poorly compared with
private insurance companies. Clients who don't have a regular
doctor wind up in emergency rooms, he says, getting more expensive
and less effective care.
</P>
<P>
   So attracting more doctors will mean, in part, paying them more.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies that participate in the federal employee
plan do pay their doctors more. But most of these plans cost far
more than Bradley budgets -- a point Gore makes repeatedly. And most
of them do not offer benefits that compare with Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Medicaid offers an unusually generous package --
covering any care that's medically necessary without a single
copayment or deductible. And it often covers extras tailored to the
very poor that are unheard of in private insurance -- transportation
to the doctor, for instance, and translators for people who don't
speak English.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy to keep benefits high, pay doctors more and
keep the cost at an average of $1,800 per year to insure each adult
and $1,200 per child -- Bradley's budget.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Medicaid will spend more than that -- an estimated
$2,100 per adult and $1,300 per child -- and that's with low payment
rates for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone looking at (Bradley's plan) says it's got to be a
little more generous,'' said Diane Rowland, a national expert on
Medicaid with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley assumes insurance companies will be willing to pay
doctors market rates and offer Medicaid-type benefits -- all at a
discounted premium -- in exchange for massive new business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the economies of scale -- bringing so many people in one
system,'' said Margaret Heldring, Bradley's coordinator for health
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that's no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   With 9 million people in the federal employee health system,
economies of scale have been largely achieved, said Dr. Donald
Young, chief operating officer for the Health Insurance Association
of America. Adding another 30 million people will require many more
health plans to participate, he said, and each of them will only
have a portion of the population, reducing the discounts that can
be achieved by a large pool.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also hopes to erase the welfare stigma that has been
attached to Medicaid, once meant as a companion to cash welfare.
But experts warn that if payment rates are too low, only a few
health plans will end up bidding for the Medicaid population, and
that could recreate some of the stigma, with certain insurance
plans known as those that serve poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Even adequate subsidies don't mean doctors will be available.
Too few doctors set up in poor communities and many don't have
night or weekend hours, Rowland said. ''Just because you have
private insurance doesn't mean you have access to every doctor in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors discourage Medicaid patients out of simple
prejudice, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family
Foundation: ''There's a reluctance to have a lot of low income
people or minority people in their practices.''
</P>
<P>
   And many people use the emergency room because they don't know
what else to do, said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth
Fund, a health policy research group. ''If you're in a lot of pain
or have a child with a high fever, at least there's a place where
if you wait long enough, someone will see you.''
</P>
<P>
   These are details, said Heldring, who helped write Bradley's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill Bradley has a vision of how it can be and most people are
accustomed to how things are,'' she said. ''It takes a little time
to get with the vision.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese PM Promises Stronger Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Premier Zhu Rongji promised Sunday a tougher
government fight to punish corrupt officials no matter how
powerful, pressing forward with a campaign that has already
unnerved China's political elite.
</P>
<P>
   Opening an 11-day annual session of the national legislature,
Zhu also warned that China will not ''sit idly by'' if Taiwan heads
toward outright independence. But he tempered recent threats to
attack Taiwan by offering negotiations for a peaceful unification.
</P>
<P>
   ''We place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and even more on
the Taiwan people,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into smuggling and other forms of corruption have
shaken the communist power structures in several provinces and
implicated members of Zhu's Cabinet, the party Politburo and the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the congress, a spokesman said that Cheng Kejie, a
powerful legislative vice chairman, was under investigation for
economic crimes. In addition, a former deputy governor of Jiangxi
province, Hu Changqing, has been sentenced to death for taking
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu repeatedly dwelled on the corruption and abuses of officials
that have eroded public confidence in Communist Party rule. From
levying taxes to running state enterprises, he cited the need for
probity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honesty in the performance of official duties is the minimum
requirement for people at all levels,'' Zhu told the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu demanded that leading officials ''stay clean'' and make sure
their staffs and relatives do, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''All major cases, no matter which department or person it
involves, must be thoroughly investigated, without favoritism or
leniency, and corrupt elements must be severely punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegates applauded, one of the few times they interrupted Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we're going to perfect our reforms, then we need to
eliminate corruption,'' Chen Rongzhen, a delegate from eastern
Anhui province, said afterward. ''People shouldn't be protected.
The government shouldn't be protected either.''
</P>
<P>
   The party-dominated National People's Congress is largely
powerless, but its 2,984 delegates include senior provincial
politicians whose support the leadership needs.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu also presented few new initiatives in a 90-minute overview
of government policies. His speech showed the collective communist
leadership's caution as it struggles to keep China's economy
growing, while coping with rapid globalization and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu promised a third-year of deficit spending to pump growth. He
supported a buildup of the politically influential military. He
also said more money would be channeled to poorer Chinese and
less-developed western China to lessen social tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the assembly in the Great Hall of the People, police
detained at least 39 followers or suspected members of the Falun
Gong spiritual movement, as they protested a seven-month government
ban. Some tried to unfurl banners proclaiming ''The Great Law of
Falun'' underneath the giant portrait of Mao Tse-tung at the north
end of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   With President Jiang Zemin and the rest of the Politburo on the
dais behind him, Zhu pledged more prosecutions of ''evil cults.''
He called the crackdown on Falun Gong one of last year's ''great
victories,'' along with protests against the U.S. bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and opposing provocative moves by
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Census officials: Rural areas prone to undercounts  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In migrant worker shacks, unregistered
apartments and middle-class households throughout New York's 44
rural counties are tens of thousands of people Census takers are
likely to miss during their 2000 count.
</P>
<P>
   New York state is heavily rural, and despite the perception of
undercounts being an urban problem, the 1990 Census missed
approximately 1.2 percent of all rural residents. A greater
percentage of rural renters were missed than urban renters-- 5.9
percent as opposed to 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you think it's hard counting every head in a crowded city
block, Census workers say, try not missing anyone in a
4,000-square-mile area of woods, lakes and rolling farmfields.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like Charles Kuralt,'' said Donald Bernhoft, office
manager for the regional office in Glens Falls, which covers seven
counties from Saratoga north to the Canadian border. He referred to
the author of ''On the Road,'' a book about Kuralt's travels
through the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   In Bernhoft's area, some 1,200 Census enumerators will go to
each and every house, with the goal of sitting down and talking to
each resident.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhoft, a retired school principal called the job an ideal way
to ''get out in the country and meet interesting people.'' He says
he also takes the job seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to count every person in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is his area vast and much of it remote, it is nesting
ground for ''snowbirds'' -- retirees who spend the winter months in
Florida or some other Southern state but consider upstate New York
their prime residences.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, enumerators will retrace their steps in ''non
response follow ups,'' which will continue from late April through
early July.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for a full count will peak in upcoming months, as
the April 1 ''Census Day'' passes into what federal officials
pledge to be the most comprehensive count ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting an accurate count of the rural population in key to
making sure rural New York is properly represented in Washington
and that we get our fair share of federal funding,'' state
Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers said.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1990 count is any example, the reasons for undercounts
vary.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, getting enumerators to work across New York's
rural stretches is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more difficult to get people to go out and do
enumeration,'' agriculture department spokesman Pete Gregg said,
''It's not the kind of blanket coverage that you get in an urban
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents may not count offspring away at college. They may forget
to list smaller children. There may be fear of local governments
finding out about an unpermitted wing housing tenants. To illegal
immigrants, Census takers are part of a government that wants to
deport them, and chances are high they spent arduous months, if not
years, finding their way here.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I think is that people could be afraid and people could
be intimidated by the forms,'' said Sister Yliana Hernandez of the
Hispanic Catholic Center in Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is one of the volunteers Census 2000 has enlisted to
act as liaisons with hard-to-reach populations, such as Hispanics.
Her job will be helping Spanish-speaking people fill out the forms
and assuring them that the information cannot be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits Census officials from sharing information
with welfare agencies, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
or any other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Middletown Census office, which she will assist, covers
Delaware, Orange and Sullivan counties. They are the first rural
counties north of the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the state's rural counties, Sullivan had the second
highest undercount in 1990, a reflection of the surge of Central
and South Americans edging northward from the New York City area in
search of low-skill, sometimes off-the-books jobs as farm laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The area also has a growing Ukrainian and Russian population, as
well as Hasidic Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Gindes of the regional Census office in Boston, which
oversees Census 2000 operations in New England and upstate New
York, said ''the Census Bureau doesn't ask about somebody's
citizenship, it just wants to know where people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Measures are being taken to make sure representatives reach all
of these groups, said Alan Hochauser, manager of Middletown's
Census office.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials with the mammoth Census 2000 effort --
there are 520 local Census offices employing 860,000 people --
undercounts mean areas lose out on government money that could be
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures also determine how much representation an area
gets.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is part of the Catskill Mountains, a faded tourism
center currently engaged in a battle over whether to host casinos.
Already officials are griping about the possibility of a
casino-related population surge going uncounted until the next
Census, in 2010.

   While on the remote island, Hanks has to ''completely transform
himself both physically and emotionally in order to survive his

<HEADLINE> Two polls show Bush edging ahead; Gore still well ahead  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As two statewide polls out Sunday showed
Texas Gov. George W. Bush edging ahead of John McCain as they
battled for victory in New York's ''Super Tuesday'' primary, the
senator from Arizona picked up endorsements from two major
newspapers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   One poll, conducted for the New York Daily News by Blum &AMP; Weprin
Associates, had Bush leading McCain, 47 percent to 39 percent,
among likely GOP primary voters with 3 percent supporting other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A second poll, conducted by Zogby International for the New York
Post, had Bush ahead of McCain, 45 percent to 39 percent, among
likely Republican voters with Alan Keyes trailing at 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a third poll out Sunday, conducted by Zogby for the Times
Union of Albany and the Buffalo News, had McCain at 43 percent and
Bush at 40 percent, a statistical tie, with Keyes and Steve Forbes
each at 2 percent. While Forbes has withdrawn from the race, his
delegate slates remain on Tuesday's primary ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between the two Zogby polls is that the Post's
was conducted through Saturday while the one for the two upstate
newspapers went through Friday. The Post's daily tracking poll by
Zogby has been showing movement toward Bush among New York's
Republican voters in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   All three polls showed Vice President Al Gore far ahead of
former Sen. Bill Bradley among New York Democrats. New York's
Tuesday primary is considered a ''must-win'' state for Bradley, a
former Hall of Fame player for the New York Knicks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   On the newspaper endorsement front, McCain got the nod from both
The New York Times and the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News editorial called McCain ''a true hero at a time
when America is hungering for heroes.'' The paper said Bush has
been engaged in mud-slinging and that ''John McCain is the best
thing that has happened to the Republican Party since Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times said that ''as a zestful insurgent battling to open
his party, Mr. McCain has brought gusts of fresh air, excitement
and common sense to American politics'' while Bush ''has embraced a
punitive hard-right agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times endorsed Gore for the Democratic primary, saying ''he
has a strong internal compass and is more prepared for presidential
responsibility than Mr. Clinton was in 1992 and than Mr. Bradley is
today.'' The Times said ''the voters picked up on Mr. Bradley's
lack of energy and on a certain emotional austerity in his
connection with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Bush has the backing of most of the state's top
Republicans and has Gov. George Pataki running his campaign effort
in the state. Bush could also be helped by the fact that in New
York, GOP voters don't vote directly for the candidates, but for
their proposed convention delegates. Bush's delegate slates are
populated by well-known GOP figures while McCain's are generally
filled with little-known supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, New York has given Bush a real test and is
considered the most competitive of the big states up for grabs on
Tuesday. The Texan is ahead in polls of Ohio and California
Republicans who are also to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator McCain is a tough competitor and I'm a better
candidate for it,'' Bush said Saturday during a campaign stop with
Pataki in Binghamton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Lead Memorial March  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Thirty-five years after America's Bloody
Sunday, when police beat and bloodied voting rights marchers at the
Edmund Pettus Bridge, modern-day civil rights figures were tracing
the same path Sunday with Bill Clinton -- a white Southerner who
rose to be president.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal images of the ugly violence of the 1965 march galvanized
many far outside the South to the civil rights movement, and helped
win support for the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   On March 7 that year, Alabama state troopers and sheriff's
deputies used tear gas, nightsticks and whips to break up an
attempt by blacks and white integrationists to march 50 miles to
the state Capitol in Montgomery to protest the denial of voting
rights to blacks in Selma.
</P>
<P>
   Some marchers retaliated with bricks and bottles. Among 17
blacks who were hospitalized was John Lewis, then the chairman of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and now a Democratic
congressman from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, under the protection of a federal court, the
Rev. Martin Luther King led hundreds of people on the long walk to
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The march helped launch the careers of black leaders including
Lewis, but it also helped make way for a new kind of white Southern
politician -- moderate, attuned to civil rights issues and appealing
to both black and white voters.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Jesse Jackson, who accompanied President Clinton on Air
Force One to Selma, said the president owes his political
beginnings to the march and its legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole new South -- new America -- flows out of Selma,'' he
said. ''Southern politicians could emerge with their dignity and
not be stigmatized. No Selma, no Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joining Jackson, Lewis and others for a tour of the
Voting Rights Museum and then a walk across the bridge. Lewis, who
marches every year to mark the anniversary, invited Clinton to join
him this year, Clinton's last in office.
</P>
<P>
   Before the re-enactment, Clinton and Jackson stopped on the side
of the bridge where a memorial park is planned -- right at the city
limits. The two stood silently for a few minutes before two large
rocks that have served as an informal monument for years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Clinton watched the events in Selma from Washington,
where he was then a student at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles hours before flying to
Selma, Clinton said he hoped Sunday's re-enactment will dramatize
for Americans just how much the country has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me as a Southerner, it will be the experience of a
lifetime to be able to go there as the president of my country,
having lived through it,'' as a young person, Clinton said. ''I
don't even have the words to say to you what it means to me. ... I
want you to see us all walking across that bridge, and remember
that 35 years ago when people did it, they were risking their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, only 2.1 percent of blacks of voting age in Selma were
registered to vote. They were shut out by strict rules, such as one
that allowed Negroes to register only on the first and third
Mondays of each month -- only to encounter police who would beat
them if they attempted to register.
</P>
<P>
   They also were subjected to literacy tests and made to answer
irrelevant questions. One such question, Lewis has said, was to
identify the number of bubbles in a bar of soap.

<HEADLINE> Pope Beatifies 44 Martyrs  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- From Polish nuns executed by Nazis to
victims of 17th-century religious warfare in Brazil, Pope John Paul
II honored 44 martyrs Sunday, holding up their lives as profiles in
courage for today's Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The honor, called beatification, is the last formal step before
the process of sainthood can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Among those declared blessed during the ceremony on a
spring-like day in St. Peter's Square was Vietnam's first martyr,
Andre de Phu Yen. He was baptized at age 15 and beheaded three
years later in 1644, when he refused to renounce Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ''May all the disciples of Christ find in him the strength and
support in trial,'' John Paul said in French.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's people are predominantly Buddhist, but the country has
the largest Catholic community in Southeast Asia outside of the
Philippines. Many Vietnamese attended the beatification in
traditional silk costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to tire during the 2{-hour-long ceremony, the pope
used the various languages of the martyrs' homelands as he offered
encouragement to Catholics worldwide. Shoring up faith of those who
have trouble with church teachings, such as bans on birth control
and premarital sex, is a key goal of John Paul's papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although they lived in historic moments far apart and in very
different cultural contexts,'' the pope said of the 44 martyrs,
''they are brought together by an identical experience of loyalty
to Christ and to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Many from Rome's large Filipino community were among the tens of
thousands of faithful at the ceremony. They cheered loudly when the
pope proclaimed the beatification of Pedro Calungsod, a Filipino
killed at age 17 during a 1672 expedition by Spanish Jesuit
missionaries to the Marianas.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also beatified Maria Stella Adela Mardosewicz and 10
fellow Polish nuns who offered their lives to the Nazis in exchange
for those of dozens of families in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The women were executed by rifle fire in woods near the border
of Poland and Belarus. The families all survived, although many
were deported to work camps in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let their witness be an encouragement for all,'' the pope said
of the martyrs at the end of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to give Catholics new role models, John Paul has beatified
or canonized more than 1,200 candidates since he became pope in
1978. That is about as many people as had been beatified or
canonized from the early 17th century until his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a miracle is required for beatification, but in the case
of martyrs, the requirement is waived.

<HEADLINE> McCain Counting on New England  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The yard signs were pulled from the
fertile soil of New Hampshire on primary night last month and
spirited out of state. The voting day placards are hand-me-downs
from South Carolina. And, ''none, zip'' is the amount of money John
McCain's campaign has sent to Connecticut, says Ben Davol, the
volunteer-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain is counting on a late barnstorming tour to carry
him to victory in five New England states and give his lagging
candidacy a boost as the polls begin closing elsewhere on Super
Tuesday. ''This could form a base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His base, but possibly his campaign bunker as George W. Bush
works to limit McCain's successes to this corner of the nation, and
possibly even surprise him in a state or two.
</P>
<P>
   In all, New England accounts for five of the 13 states with
Republican contests Tuesday, the busiest night of the primary
season, on which 102 of 613 delegates are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, who flew into Connecticut briefly on
Saturday, told reporters, ''We're going to battle every state -- and
I think you're going to be surprised by the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's strategy seems more designed to contain McCain in
New England. Bush's only stop in the region was the brief weekend
visit to Connecticut, next door to New York, where he is in a
fierce battle with McCain. And the only television advertising
Bush's campaign has purchased in New England is in Burlington, Vt.,
which sends its signal into upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had weekend stops in Connecticut, Massachusetts and
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's win in New Hampshire's leadoff primary bounced him
higher in New England than anywhere else. The Arizona senator
quickly shot ahead of his rival in the polls despite Bush's backing
from a familiar array of forces -- the region's governors, senators
and congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the Republican machinery will be behind Bush and working
this weekend,'' in Rhode Island, says Sen. Lincoln Chafee. Yet, he
readily conceded he expects McCain to win. ''John has struck a
chord with the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in Massachusetts, the largest of the states with 37
delegates, with an open primary, McCain may have his best showing
of the year. ''Independent votes will be the Republican primary,''
says pollster R. Kelly Myers, director of the polling firm RKM
Research and Communications.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bush is not being helped by Gov. Paul Cellucci's
endorsement. The governor's image has taken a pounding recently
with disclosures of sizable cost overruns at a large public works
project in Boston, known locally as ''The Big Dig.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, says Sen. James Jeffords, residents ''love an
independent person and certainly John McCain has resonated'' with
the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is counting on the establishment in Maine, as well,
although the presence of Gov. Angus King in the Statehouse is
testimony to the state's willingness to vote independently.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Bush was supported by Gov. John Rowland and
other party leaders, and appeared to be cruising until he lost New
Hampshire. McCain quickly surged ahead, and Bush campaign officials
concede they are ready to write off the state, along with the rest
of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Jay Malcynsky, Bush's Connecticut chairman, ''that
momentum has dissipated a little bit.'' Recent public opinion polls
point to a close race in Connecticut, much like in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most New England states, Connecticut's primary is open
only to Republicans. But here, as elsewhere around the country, the
McCain forces have tried to work around that.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we hope you remain in our party, you can return to
unaffiliated voter status at any time,'' says a brochure paid for
by his state volunteers and aimed at non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, a state that favors moderation, Bush also was
buffeted by the fallout from a tough South Carolina primary, where
he tacked to the right to appeal to conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, whose signature issue is overhauling the
campaign finance system, says he differed with Bush's operation
about the wording of a brochure planned for Connecticut's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Shays says he wanted them to ''take out the negative things that
we saw in the South Carolina race and focus on his message. ..He
has every right to say he's a reformer with results,'' he added.
''So talk about your reforms and talk about your results.''
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of difficulties aren't likely to plague McCain's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Davol, who once lived in Washington and described himself as a
''graduate of the Iron Triangle'' of legislation, lobbyists and
money that McCain rails against, says he saw to it that the McCain
yard signs were removed from New Hampshire after the polls closed
Feb. 1
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to South Carolina the day after the primary and
returned with signs that say ''Vote McCain Today'' that were paid
for by a McCain supporter in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of brochures also means some Connecticut Republicans
have received literature bearing the picture of Warren Rudman, the
former New Hampshire senator who escorted McCain around that state.

<HEADLINE> New kind of question to appear on bar examination  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Prospective lawyers will have to answer a
new kind of question on the state Bar Examination starting next
summer in what administrators say is the first major change to the
New York exam in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The new ''Multi-State Performance Test'' question will be a
90-minute exercise where test takers will be expected to use
background materials to respond to a hypothetical situation, such
as preparing a legal brief in support of a court motion or a
memorandum evaluating the grounds for objecting to the probate of a
will.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states have added so-called performance exercises to
their bar examination processes, according to Richard Bartlett, the
chairman of New York's Board of Law Examiners. The examiners
develop and administer the bar exam in New York, which people need
to pass before being allowed to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will test candidates in situations very much like those
encountered every day by practicing lawyers,'' Bartlett said of the
new question. ''That is, analyzing facts, identifying legal issues
and looking up the law to apply to those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The new section will be added to the New York bar exam beginning
in July 2001. That delay is necessary to allow law schools time to
prepare their graduates for the new phase of the bar exam,
according to Gary Spencer, spokesman for the state Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The court, the state's highest, has ultimate responsibility for
the bar examination and other workings of the legal system in the
state. A study it commissioned on the New York exam, plus
pro-performance question reports by national and local bar
associations, led to adoption of the requirement in New York, court
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The performance test question will be administered on the first
day of the two-day bar examination process. It will count 10
percent toward the final grade. To create more time for the new
exercise, the number of essays required of test-takers will be
reduced from six to five. Fifty multiple-choice questions about the
law in New York will also still be given the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The second day will continue to consist of answering 200
multiple choice questions developed by the Multi-State Bar
Examination.
</P>
<P>
   Bar exam administrators in New York say the addition of the
performance test question is the first major change in the exam
since 1979, when a second day was added to the test so the 200
Multi-State Bar Examination questions could be given.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo lawyer Lauren Rachlin said the performance test question
''is a way to test lawyering skills that are a little different
than just plain book knowledge. In fact, it's a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachlin chairs the state Bar Association's Legal Education and
Admission to the Bar Committee. It endorsed the addition of the new
question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are constantly looking for ways to improve the bar
examination to try to make it more responsible ... and there is a
lot of feeling that many of the real skills that a lawyer has are
not tested by the bar examination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bar examination is given twice a year in New York, in
February and July. Prospective lawyers must take the exam in either
New York City, Albany or Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11,500 people took the New York bar exam in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Lloyd's of London Faces Fraud Claim  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Lloyd's of London, a onetime gentlemen's club that
grew into an insurance colossus, takes up the fight of its 312-year
life Monday when lawyers begin arguments in a lawsuit accusing it
of massive fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Lloyd's investors, known in the business as Names,
allege that they were duped into joining the institution at a time
when Lloyd's faced overwhelming losses due to claims by victims of
asbestos-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Names argue that top Lloyd's executives knew about these
enormous liabilities but deliberately concealed them as they
launched a worldwide drive to recruit thousands of new investors to
help absorb the potential losses.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks damages of up to $237 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bigger risk to Lloyd's is the harm such a judgment
might do to its reputation, and a successful suit could possibly
open the doors to crippling claims of fraud from others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the trial itself, win or lose, is a fatal blow to the
institution,'' said Dona Evans, a New York resident and Name who is
suing to recover losses of $395,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's denies all the allegations, which have been circulating
since at least 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lloyd's, which is a market of insurance syndicates
rather than a company in its own right, note that the government's
own Serious Fraud Office reviewed the allegations in 1992 but
decided to take no further action.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's spokesman Adrian Beeby dismissed any suggestion that
Lloyd's or its executives acted in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they're seeking to prove didn't exist, simply could not
exist, in a market like Lloyds ... which could be described as one
of the leakiest markets in the world. What happens in Lloyd's gets
leaked to the press all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial pits more than 230 Names -- including 24 Americans --
against an institution that over the years has come to epitomize a
uniquely British image of integrity and trustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1688 by insurance brokers and merchants at Edward
Lloyd's coffee house in London, the market grew along with the
British Empire to become the world's No. 1 insurer against marine
risk. Among the ships it insured was the Titanic, which cost
Lloyd's $1.58 million when it sank in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's also accepted more unusual risks, insuring a wine
taster's palate and the legs of World War II pinup icon Betty
Grable.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament even passed a law -- the Lloyd's Act -- in 1982 that
entitled the market to regulate itself. The act also protected
Lloyd's from any lawsuit except in cases of proven fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos-related insurance claims began to mount in the 1970s,
and it was then, claimants in the lawsuit allege, that Lloyd's
began to recruit large numbers of new investors. Lloyd's made it
easier for them to join by changing its rules to let new Names
pledge their homes as collateral for the policies they underwrote
and for which they were personally liable.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Names ballooned from 6,000 people in 1975 to a
peak of 36,000 in 1988, said Catherine MacKenzie Smith, co-chairman
of the United Names Organization -- the umbrella group for most of
the Names who filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the UNO alleges, senior Lloyd's executives
lied to potential recruits about the extent of the risk posed by
the rising tide of asbestos claims.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, a London resident who became a Name in 1984, said
the financial information that Lloyd's made available to him gave
''absolutely'' no hint of the danger that awaited.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an accountant, I investigated their figure(s) fairly well.
I think I asked the right questions but was given the wrong
answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd's lost some $12.6 billion from 1988 to 1992, and many
Names faced financial ruin. About 30 Names, unable to cope with
their share of the losses, committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Evans blames the stress from her loss for the breakup of her
marriage and, with it, the loss of her six-bedroom London
townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was appalling what it did to families. It really, really,
wasn't just the money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lloyd's tried to contain the damage by lumping all its
earlier liabilities together and forming a new body, Equitas, to
reinsure them. All but 5 percent of its Names opted to pay large
premiums in order to off-load their debts to Equitas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Names that didn't -- or couldn't -- pay their premiums
ended up accusing Lloyd's of fraud and suing.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge in the case rules in their favor, the damages
Lloyd's would have to pay would tear ''a large hole'' in its
finances, said Robert Merkin, a professor of commercial law at
Cardiff Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But in what he calls ''the doomsday scenario,'' Merkin suggests
there might be legal grounds for additional lawsuits by any of the
other 95 percent of Lloyd's Names who accepted the 1996 Equitas
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last until the summer.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Accused of War Crime Nabbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- NATO peacekeeping troops on Sunday
arrested a Bosnian Serb wanted for war crimes committed in 1992 in
the notorious Omarska prison camp, the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Dragoljub Prcac was ''another step in NATO's
drive'' to arrest the remaining war crimes suspects, NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO would continue to arrest war crimes suspects and
send them to the U.N. Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let today's arrest, the fourth in three months, serve as a
warning to those with guilty consciences,'' Robertson said. ''It is
time to turn yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO gave no immediate details of when or where the arrest took
place, saying only that Prcac, 63, had been detained and was being
''processed for transfer'' to the tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Prcac is under indictment for war crimes allegedly committed
between May 25 and Aug. 30, 1992 in the Omarska prison camp, where
he was deputy commander. The alleged crimes include murder,
torture, rape, inhuman acts and unlawful detention.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his capacity as deputy, Prcac held a position of authority
and was superior to all others in the camp, except the commander,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, the private Beta news agency said
another man, Rade Mikanovic, was also detained. However, NATO and
the U.N. war crimes tribunal mentioned only one arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the detention took place just outside Prijedor
in northern Bosnia. The NATO troops broke a window of Prcac's
vehicle and dragged him and a companion outside, Beta reported.

<HEADLINE> Putin Criticized for NATO Statement  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin set off a wave of
criticism Sunday from his rivals in the presidential race by
telling a British television network that Russia could join NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics called Putin's comments a betrayal of Russia's
interests. Others called them a bid for votes from Western-minded
Russians in the March 26 election, or an effort to soften his
hard-line image abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Russia could join NATO, Putin told British
Broadcasting Corp. interviewer Sir David Frost: ''I don't see why
not. I wouldn't rule out such a possibility. But I repeat -- if and
when Russia's views are taken into account as an equal partner.''
The interview was broadcast Sunday and picked up by Russia's main
networks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been keen to cooperate with the Kremlin since the 1991
Soviet collapse, but has not shown any sign it is inviting Russia
to join. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said NATO
could expand to include Russia, but other U.S. politicians strongly
resist the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite cooperation on some projects, relations between Russia
and NATO -- formed during the Cold War to deter Soviet troops from
moving westward -- remain shaky. Most Russians see NATO expansion
into Eastern Europe as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow virtually severed all ties with NATO last year in
response to the alliance's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia. NATO,
meanwhile, condemned Russia for using excessive force in Chechnya.
But an agreement to restore ties was announced last month when NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appeared unlikely that Putin would press soon for
membership in the U.S.-led alliance. Putin has made restoring
Russia's global clout a key campaign slogan, and has brushed off
months of Western criticism of the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television commentators Sunday pointed out that Putin
usually tailors his remarks to his audience, and keeps many
promises vague.
</P>
<P>
   Reformist lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky dismissed the comments on
NATO, saying Putin was unlikely to follow through with action.
</P>
<P>
   ''His actions absolutely don't correspond to his statements,''
Yavlinsky said on the Itogi television program. Yavlinsky is also
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who polls at a distant second
behind Putin in the presidential race, said Sunday that joining
NATO would further weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's ''statement is naive and unpardonable for a politician
of his level,'' Zyuganov told Interfax. ''He should at least hire
knowledgeable foreign policy advisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Titov, a presidential candidate and the reformist
governor of the Russian region of Samara, welcomed the idea of
joining NATO. But Titov said Putin's statement was little more than
a campaign stunt for attracting reformist voters, according to
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Parliament Speaker Vladimir Lukin said Sunday that Russia
could join NATO if it was transformed from a military to a
political alliance and Russia was offered equal terms.

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Jewish Leader Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Ernest de Souza, the spiritual leader
of Jamaica's 500-year-old Jewish community, has died, his family
said. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   De Souza died of a heart attack shortly after celebrating
Sabbath services on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer by profession, De Souza was best known in this
Caribbean nation of 2.6 million people as the spiritual leader of
the dwindling Jewish community. He had filled the post since the
last ordained rabbi left in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Jews first came to Jamaica with Spanish settlers in the early
16th century. Many were Marranos -- Jews who had converted to
Christianity during the Inquisition but practiced Judaism in
secret. The Jewish population here now numbers around 250, down
from more than 2,000 a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   De Souza published a number of books on the community, including
a pictorial history of Jews in Jamaica and a synagogue prayer book.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Judith, and sons David and Robert.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Reported in Somalia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Fighting between rival militias in a
town south of Mogadishu left several people dead and others
wounded, witnesses said over a high-frequency radio channel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting Saturday took place in Coriolei, about 50 miles
south of the Somali capital. Militiamen of the Islamic court
battled the Digil Salvation Army and the Rahanwein Resistance Army,
the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting had subsided by nightfall, but the town remained tense
Sunday because another attack was expected from the DSA and RRA, a
witness said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting figures about casualties. One witnesses
said he saw at least five dead bodies and a dozen wounded. DSA
spokesman Asad Mohamed Abdi said by radio that his militia
coalition had killed 13 and wounded 19 fighters of the Islamic
court's Al-Itifad Al-Islam militia.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has had no functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of late dictator Mohammed Siad Barre by a coalition of
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   After ousting Siad Barre, the rebels turned against each other,
and the country split into fiefs protected by clan militias. To
curb lawlessness, Muslim leaders have set up courts in the
predominantly Muslim country and hired their own militias to
enforce order in some parts.

<HEADLINE> Paramedic suspended after last-ditch try to save a life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A paramedic from Spotswood was suspended and
later put on probation for trying to use a last-ditch medical
procedure to save a man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the midst of a desperate situation, 27-year-old
Christopher Loscar said he did the only thing possible to try to
save the life of a man who had swallowed hot, waxy liquid after
falling into a chemical vat. But the patient died anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Loscar's efforts to clear the man's air passage through his
mouth were unsuccessful. The wax clogged both a suction machine and
an endotracheal tube.
</P>
<P>
   So Loscar phoned a physician at University Hospital in Newark,
and the two agreed that the only hope for the man was a procedure
called a cricothyrotomy, in which a needle with a catheter is
inserted into a patient's throat just under the voice box to open
an air passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The patient was almost blue. His lungs were completely filled
up with this soapy material,'' Zamir Breli, the University Hospital
doctor who approved the procedure, told The Star-Ledger of Newark
for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Loscar was suspended without pay for two days and placed on
probation by the hospital for three months because paramedics in
New Jersey are not authorized to perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The state tried to impose an additional six months of probation,
prompting Loscar to hire an attorney and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   University Hospital was fined $800 for approving the
cricothyrotomy, according to hospital spokeswoman Sharon Dilling.
</P>
<P>
   Loscar faces a June hearing before the state Department of
Health and Senior Services, which licenses New Jersey's 1,200
paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in April at Port Newark when John Zocco, a
private chemical inspector, fell into a vat of molten lauric acid
he was testing and stayed there until he was rescued by other
workers about 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was essentially dead when my client got to him,'' said
Loscar's lawyer, David Shotwell. ''This (cricothyrotomy) was the
only chance of resuscitating him.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics throughout the country, including in New York and
Pennsylvania, are trained and authorized to perform
cricothyrotomies, but in New Jersey only those assigned to the
state's medevac helicopters have authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Loscar, who was trained in the procedure in Pennsylvania and is
a certified paramedic instructor there, said the same training
should be extended to paramedics in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Sol Nevins, who is chairman of the committee of Mobile Intensive
Care Unit directors that advises the health department on emergency
services, said paramedics haven't been authorized to perform the
procedure because it is so complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's extensive training for something that's going to be used
very, very rarely,'' he said. ''But my personal opinion is that
such training is useful, and my hope is that we will move in that
direction in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Loscar said he has no regrets about trying to save Zocco's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The funny thing is everybody from the hospital to the state
has said we shouldn't have done it,'' he said. ''But not a single
person has said what we should have done.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Lawmakers Face Term Limits  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The clock is ticking on Florida's
lawmakers, leaving some who have occupied the Statehouse for
decades with just two more months to make a lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   The state's ''Eight is Enough'' amendment that takes effect this
year is forcing out nearly half of the House members and more than
a quarter of the state senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of like our last chance,'' said Senate President
Toni Jennings, who is out after 20 years in that chamber and four
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three of the Legislature's 160 members can't seek
re-election, meaning the session that starts Tuesday is their last
chance to bring home money for roads and special projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, particularly House members, hope to continue their
public careers by running for seats in the other chamber. Jennings
is running for insurance commissioner and treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the world's biggest job fair up here,'' said state Rep.
Bob Henriquez. ''A lot of folks will be very careful not to make
people angry.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 other states have term limit laws for state lawmakers,
most put into effect after voters had petition drives and then
voted them into law.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, this is also the first year lawmakers are being
forced out by term limits. California voters imposed term limits on
their lawmakers in 1990. Under term limits in Michigan, 64 of the
110 state House races had no incumbents running in the 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits on congressional candidates were declared illegal by
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, some legislators complain that with new lawmakers
with less experience, staff and lobbyists will gain more power in
the lawmaking process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even knowing the process, it still takes several years to
establish expertise in a certain issue,'' said Rep. Debbie
Wasserman Schultz. ''By the time you establish that expertise, it's
time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and other advocates are also concerned about losing
their champions.
</P>
<P>
   Dorene Barker, who works on poverty issues with a group called
Florida Legal Services, said it takes years to establish
credibility with lawmakers. At the same time, however, lawmakers
who have blocked her legislation also face term limits.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of Florida Citizens for Term Limits, Max Linn,
said throwing lawmakers out will be beneficial. Right now lobbyists
only have to cozy up to a few ''power brokers'' with seniority, he
said. That should change.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want out of Tallahassee is institutional knowledge,''
Linn said. ''We want fresh new ideas and fresh people in office.''

   ST. GEORGE, Ga. (AP) -- A 7,800-acre brush fire in dense pine
thickets near the Georgia-Florida border was declared 70 percent
contained Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Patrol kept a 12-mile stretch of Route 121
closed because of thick smoke and urged drivers to avoid the area.

   About 25 St. George residents who were evacuated Saturday were

part of the fire near the small town had been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   A mobile home, a barn and numerous outbuildings were destroyed

injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was reported Saturday afternoon and raged quickly out

<HEADLINE> Report on Columbine Shooting Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Parents of the victims of the Columbine
High School massacre and officials with a state review panel are
urging sheriff's investigators to release their final report before
the first anniversary of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The report on the April 20, 1999, attack, in which 12 students,
a teacher and the two teen-age gunmen died, initially was to be
released last November.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Steve Davis, a spokesman for Sheriff John Stone, said
there was still considerable work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the largest in Colorado history, filling
more than 300 three-ring binders and producing 10,000 pieces of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the report on the deadliest school shooting in U.S.
history will be published on CD-ROM, with video clips from TV news
reports and excerpts from investigators' reams of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mauser, the father of slain student Daniel Mauser, said he
worries that the sheriff's office may not be sensitive to the pain
families will be experiencing as they near the one-year mark of the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The closer we get to April 20, the more painful it's going to
be,'' Mauser said. ''I would hope (the report release is) sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado Supreme Court Justice William Erickson, who
heads the state Columbine Review Commission, said the delay in
releasing the report is handicapping the commission's work.

<HEADLINE> 'Whole Nine Yards' Retains Top Spot  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Less than stellar openings provided little to
laugh about for the new comedies that hit the screens this weekend,
according to industry estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The top box office spot was locked up for a third week by ''The
Whole Nine Yards,'' with $7.3 million in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The top new comedies were ''The Next Best Thing,'' starring
Madonna, which took second place with $6 million, and ''Drowning
Mona'' with Bette Midler, which took fourth with $5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the comedy ''Analyze This'' opened on the same
weekend last year with $18.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the films in the top 10 were comedies, and the
audience just wasn't large enough to go around, said Paul
Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks box
office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just so many of these adult-oriented comedies out
there that audiences were sort of pulled in a lot of different
directions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the audience that goes out and sees three films in
a weekend. ... not the most voracious moviegoers,'' Dergarabedian
said. ''Older audiences will come out in big numbers if the film
becomes a must-see. None of these openers really fell into that
category.''
</P>
<P>
   In further contrast to the newer comedies, ''My Dog Skip''
zoomed up the ladder in its eighth week, jumping from 54th place to
third place with $5.94 million as it went into wide release.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Planet Are You From?'' tanked, debuting out of the top 10
with only a $3 million gross from Friday through Sunday. Garry
Shandling's comedy about an alien sent to Earth to father a child
got poor reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, we were hurt by some of the reviews,'' said Ed
Russell, a spokesman for Columbia Pictures. ''It certainly was a
competitive weekend, which didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Several films had good openings in limited release, led by
''Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai'' by cult favorite Jim
Jarmusch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ghost Dog,'' starring Forest Whitaker as a spiritual hit man
who lives by a samurai code, opened at 14 theaters in New York ah its weekend
gross of $4.1 million, ''American Beauty'' had
the best per-screen take among the top 10 films at $3,062.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures were to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Next Best Thing,'' $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''My Dog Skip,'' $5.94 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Drowning Mona,'' $5.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. (tie) ''Pitch Black,'' $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. (tie) ''Snow Day,'' $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Reindeer Games,'' $4.8 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colombian Cycle Star Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A retired cycling star was freed Sunday,
one day after suspected left-wing rebels kidnapped him from his
family's farm.
</P>
<P>
   The 1987 Tour of Spain champion, Luis Alberto Herrera, was
released in the mountains south of Bogota, near the farm where he
was snatched by gunmen Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera told RCN radio that his kidnappers decided to free him
after seeing television reports showing the massive military
search-and-rescue operation launched in response to the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   No group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, which
provoked national outrage. But police officials said the region is
a stronghold of Colombia's largest guerrilla faction, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's left-wing rebels increasingly depend on extortion and
kidnapping for ransom to fund their nearly 40-year campaign against
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, 38, said his captors treated him well, but he was
forced to hike for seven hours through the mountains to return
home.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera won the Vuelta de Colombia competition four times, and
competed in the Tour de France and the Tour of Italy before
retiring in 1995 to take up cattle ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, rebels of the National Liberation Army freed cyclist
Oliverio Rincon after two weeks in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Brussels Withdraws Austria Invite  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The Belgian capital of Brussels has
withdrawn an invitation to Austria to attend a major tourism
exhibition, a city official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflected the European Union's continuing displeasure
at the participation of Austria's Freedom Party in the government
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's state tourism secretary Mares Rossmann called on
Brussels Mayor Francois-Xavier de Donnea to reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rossmann, who is a member of the Freedom Party, described the
withdrawal of the invitation as ''an act of absolute intolerance
and animosity'' by the mayor towards Austria. She told the Austrian
Press Agency that her country might take the matter to the European
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium and France have been among the EU members most critical
of the Freedom Party's participation in Austria's government
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the government was sworn in on Feb. 3, the other 14
EU nations announced sanctions against fellow member Austria. The
EU sanctions include a ban on bilateral contacts at the ministerial
level.
</P>
<P>
   But Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, whose conservative
People's Party shares the coalition with Joerg Haider's Freedom
Party, denied in comments published Sunday that the sanctions were
affecting his ability to lead the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not handicapped in my role as leader,'' he said in
comments carried by the Austria Press Agency ahead of publication
Monday in the news magazine Format.
</P>
<P>
   Austria's Franz Fischler, the EU's top agricultural official,
said in Format that a planned visit by Austria's President Thomas
Klestil to Brussels would help normalize relations and ease the way
for any future visit by the chancellor.

<HEADLINE> Cheers, boos as Hillary Clinton marches in St. Patrick's parade  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid boos and cheers, Hillary Rodham Clinton
marched in an early St. Patrick's Day parade Sunday that allowed
gay groups to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The main St. Patrick's Day parade, held March 17 on Fifth Avenue
in Manhattan, excludes the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization on
the grounds that the event is run by a Catholic fraternal group,
the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate candidate said Sunday she still hopes the main
parade will be inclusive, but even if it's not, she confirmed she
would attend. ''I'm marching,'' she said with a firm nod.
</P>
<P>
   With a green scarf tucked into her jacket, the first lady
smiled, waved, and posed for pictures as she marched seven blocks
along the parade route in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she was enjoying herself, she said: ''I sure am. How
could you not? It's a glorious day with a lot of happy people.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of hecklers followed her, but she ignored them and the
occasional boos from others in the crowd of several thousand people
scattered along the parade route.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to Arkansas, carpetbagger!'' called out Bernie
Mulligan, who works for a cable TV company. ''She's too liberal.
But I like everything about the mayor. I think he's a
straight-shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is running for Senate, and her likely Republican
opponent will be Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the onlookers -- some of them holding signs saying
''Irish-Americans for Hillary'' -- clapped and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to vote for her. I think she's great -- a woman, a
strong woman. She knows the politics,'' said Susan DiScala.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied by a group of Democratic officials that
included city Comptroller Alan Hevesi, Public Advocate Mark Green,
City Council President Peter Valone, U.S. Reps. Jerry Nadler and
Carolyn Maloney, both of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens parade was billed as the first local ''inclusive''
St. Patrick's Day event because it allowed gay organizations to
participate. Among them were Lavender and Green, a gay Irish group
that had about two dozen members walking a half-block behind the
first lady. They also received an occasional boo, but one of them,
Barbara Moore, said: ''Hate is not going to win today.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday in a speech at Riverside Church in Manhattan, the
first lady chastised city officials for refusing to acknowledge
problems with the police force in the aftermath of the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, was shot to death
last year by four white officers. The police were acquitted of
murder last month.
</P>
<P>
   She cited Boston and San Diego as places where both crime and
racial tensions are down because of good relations between police
and citizens.

<HEADLINE> Seaweed Trade Bolsters Chilean Town  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORRAL, Chile (AP) -- A diver tethered to a rowboat descends into
the calm bay and resurfaces moments later with a bag full of the
tangled seaweed known locally as ''pelillo,'' or little hair.
</P>
<P>
   This harvest is an important one for the people who live simply
in this remote town on Chile's southern coast. They don't eat the
seaweed -- but it helps them eat.
</P>
<P>
   The pelillo is converted into the fine, cream-colored powder of
pure agar, most of which is shipped more than 10,000 miles across
the Pacific to Japan, where it is used in noodles, candies,
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other products. Some also goes to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly global economy, companies are going to the
ends of the Earth to find the goods they need.
</P>
<P>
   The cool bay that laps at the shore of Corral is known for
producing seaweed of good quality, and Japanese companies have
turned to such places because harvesting is hard work with low pay
that appeals to a dwindling number of Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on seasonal businesses -- fishing, logging and farming
-- the town of less than 6,000 people welcomed the new business.
</P>
<P>
   A small fleet of rowboats dot the bay from September to March,
when the weather is sunny enough to allow the seaweed to dry
outdoors in this area 530 miles south of Santiago. Two-man crews
row ashore with their boats loaded with seaweed, and they sell it
to Victor Guajardo, a businessman who dries the moss-like plant in
the sun and bags it in 55-pound sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of it is from Chile and it goes away, and later it returns
as products,'' he says. ''I've been working in this for about 10
years already.''
</P>
<P>
   Within sight of a Spanish fort that once guarded the port,
Guajardo's three teen-age nieces help him clean the dried seaweed.
They grab handfuls and shake free all that the frizzy filaments
have collected -- dust, dead crabs and shellfish. Each full sack of
clean seaweed sells for about 5,000 pesos, or $10, Guajardo says.
</P>
<P>
   An industry to process this type of seaweed has taken root in
Chile during the past two decades. Guajardo takes shipments across
the bay to Valdivia, where he sells the seaweed to a middleman who
then resells it to a Japanese-owned company, Proagar, in nearby
Llanquihue.
</P>
<P>
   At the company's processing plant, a Chilean manager, Manuel
Gomez, explains that pure agar, often known as agar-agar, is
released by treating the seaweed chemically and then boiling it.
The seaweed is pulled from the sea with its natural greenish-brown
color and finishes the process whitened, as if the life has been
sucked from it.
</P>
<P>
   The best seaweed for producing agar happens to grow in this part
of Chile, Gomez says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Japan, the production of agar-agar is limited because the
pelillo is of lower quantity and quality,'' Gomez says.
</P>
<P>
   His company, which claims to be the world's second-largest
producer of pure agar, exports an average of about 880,000 pounds
of it each year. While most of the agar goes to Japan, some also
goes to the United States and other parts of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the powder is made into thick noodles called
''tokoroten,'' a dish with no calories that is eaten cold, usually
with soy sauce, sesame seeds and mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Agar also has other uses in Japan, the United States and other
countries as a food thickener and stabilizer, lending its
gelatinous texture to pastries, fruit jelly candies, chocolate
fillings, some yogurts and some canned foods. It often is used as a
culture medium in laboratory dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who live in Corral know little about what the
seaweed is used for except that it is exported to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, executives at the country's largest domestic maker of
agar, Ina Food Industry Co., say Japan now imports about five times
as much of this type of seaweed as it produces, because of the
falloff in Japanese harvesters.
</P>
<P>
   Chile has filled the void, becoming the largest exporter of agar
to Japan, company officials say. Other countries producing agar
include Morocco and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, Proagar's processing plant employs about 130 people.
The company makes $6 million in sales a year, Gomez says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that money filters down to the people who row their
boats away from the rocky shore into Corral's bay to collect the
seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where there is money, you do something,'' says Guajardo.
''Everyone keeps a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Girl's Church Seeks Understanding  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE HOUSEHOLDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A day before classes were to
resume at the elementary school where 6-year-old Kayla Rolland was
shot to death, members of her church gathered Sunday in search of
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed animals lined the sills of Calvary Assembly of God
Church in Flint, and balloons and flowers were placed behind the
pulpit, where the Rev. Gene Warren told about 30 congregants to
never forget Kayla. Many wore pink ribbons in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was part of this church for just a short time, but she was
loved,'' Warren said. ''She will be remembered for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla, a first-grader at Buell Elementary School, was buried
Saturday at a private funeral. The school is scheduled to open
Monday for the first time since the shooting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old classmate is accused in the killing, and
authorities have said the boy didn't know any better.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that Kayla's death needs to be in vain,''
Warren said. ''I believe God can take what we believe to be tragedy
and turn it into something good. We need God in our schools. We
need God in America today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla's family issued a statement of thanks to the community
Sunday through J. Dallas Winegarden, attorney for her mother,
Veronica McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have all become members of our family. God love you and
keep you all safe,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Birdie Shields, pastor of the Greater Azusa Friendship
Church of God near Buell Elementary, said no one can ever know why
the shooting happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''This little girl became the daughter of all of us. She's my
daughter, your daughter. This boy is our son. But he needs some
help,'' he said. ''He's not responsible for what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Though state and federal prosecutors have said they have no
plans to charge the boy, Shields said ''maybe to some extent he
should be punished, but somewhere where he can learn and be
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's young enough,'' Shields said before services. ''It's
important to forgive, because when you forgive, you release the
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Worshiper Mechalle Ruffin, who attended the service with her
3-year-old daughter, agreed the boy should be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was Kayla's mom, I'd have to forgive this young man
because maybe he thought if he shot her, she'd get up just like in
all the video games and it would start over,'' she said.

Bradley, McCain Keep Campaigning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley tried to
kick start their campaigns today as they made the rounds through the TV talk
shows today. The two underdogs expressed confidence even as aides braced for the
worst by quietly making plans for dignified exits. Bradley advisers acknowledged
he has little chance of loosening Al Gore's grip on every "Super Tuesday" state.
The McCain team held out hope for an election night surprise. Republicans
compete Tuesday in 13 states for 613 delegates, and Democrats battle in 15
states for 1,315 delegates -- more than half the total each party requires of
its nominees.

troops from southern Lebanon by July, a pullback that would end an 18-year
occupation. Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has been trying to revive stalled
peace talks with Syria, has said he prefers a withdrawal based on an agreement.
The Cabinet statement did not explicitly state that in the absence of a peace
deal, there would be a unilateral withdrawal. However, it seemed to imply as
much by saying that "in case the conditions for a deployment by agreement are
not met, the Cabinet will discuss at the appropriate time how to implement the
decision" to withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Hygiene Key To Reducing Infections  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Infections contracted in hospitals kill as many
as 88,000 people each year, a number that could be reduced with
increased use of technology and simple measures such as more
frequent hand washing, a researcher said Sunday at a conference on
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control opened a five-day
conference on preventing and reducing healthcare-associated
infections in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of the internal medicine
department at the Medical College of Virginia said new devices such
as catheters coated with antibiotics have proven effective against
infection spread at health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But those are still far costlier than simple but equally
necessary steps as getting doctors and nurses to wash their hands
after every patient contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand-washing is cheap, but the impact from it is great,''
Wenzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Using what he called conservative estimates, Wenzel calculated
that bloodstream infections contracted at health care facilities
could be the nation's eighth leading cause of death, claiming more
than 25,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the CDC reported that the rate of such infections
fell by about 44 percent in the 1990s in medical intensive care
units at 300 facilities that report to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The infections typically are caused by catheters, intravenous
lines and breathing tubes common to most hospital stays. Such
devices allow bacteria easy entry into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel said simply placing an alcohol dispenser at each patient
bed cut blood infection rates by 40 percent in one hospital because
workers disinfected their hands more often.
</P>
<P>
   Another effective method is for doctors to model good habits in
front of colleagues and medical students.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm up in the ICU and I'm washing my hands, I always tell
the students, 'Oh this feels good, oh it's phenomenal,''' Wenzel
said. ''I give them the idea that they are missing out on something
if they don't wash their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, with the CDC's Hospital Infection Program,
said medical professionals must control infections better because
the number of older Americans will soar in the next century. The
elderly are particularly at risk for infection and more likely to
spend time in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis estimated the population of people over 65 in the U.S. --
40 million in 1998 -- is likely to double by 2035.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Jarvis calculates that about 88,000 people die each
year directly from blood and other infections contracted in health
care facilities. About 2 million Americans contract an infection
each year while in a hospital or other medical center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the at-risk population is growing, more and
more people are using longterm-care facilities or even home
healthcare, which also affects infection levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few longterm-care facilities have dedicated surveillance to
even detect these infections,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Home health care is the fastest growing component of healthcare.
An estimated 8 million Americans received medical care in the home
in 1996, according to Dr. Michele Pearson, an epidemiologist with
the CDC's Hospital Infection Program.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to track rates of infection passed to patients
during care in their own homes, Jarvis said. Such cases are not
adequately investigated and standards for home healthcare workers
and documentation of infection rates are limited.

<HEADLINE> Waco Tear Gas Amount Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Evidence from the Branch Davidian siege suggests
the FBI fired more pyrotechnic tear gas rounds into the compound
than the agency previously admitted, government investigators said
in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   Crime scene records, videos and photographs call into question
where, when and how many rounds were fired by the FBI's hostage
rescue team, or HRT, at the end of the siege in 1993, investigators
told the paper. The paper did not name any of the investigators or
the agencies for whom they work.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all that we are seeing, it seems quite probable that the
HRT fired more pyrotechnic rounds than they've ever fessed up to,''
said an investigator. ''You have to remember: They were running out
of tear gas that day.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno maintain that Davidians
deliberately set the fire that raced through the compound. They
have said pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were fired hours before
the fire began, bounced off the roof of a bunker and rolled
harmlessly into a field.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigator said the appearance of white smoke
characteristic of tear gas grenades on video shot by a Waco
television station suggests one of the rounds might have been fired
as the sect's compound began burning.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman declined comment on the report,
citing an investigation by Waco special counsel John Danforth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Danforth is in the process of sifting through all
these allegations so it would be inappropriate to comment,''
spokesman Myron Marlin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Angela Bell also declined comment on the story.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI last August acknowledged firing a ''very limited
number'' of pyrotechnic rounds at the compound after years of
publicly denying that any potentially incendiary devices were used.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers last month completed a lengthy final report on
efforts to identify questioned evidence from the standoff and
locate a pyrotechnic tear gas projectile that disappeared in 1993
after it was photographed by a Texas Department of Public Safety
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' report said the photographer's field notes show the
projectile was ''located about 200 yards northwest of the (compound
water) tower.''
</P>
<P>
   That means the device probably was fired from behind the
building, and not from the area where FBI officials have previously
said that such devices were launched that day, investigators
involved in the ongoing inquiries told The News.
</P>
<P>
   Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80 of his
followers died as the compound burned, and attorneys for surviving
sect members and families of the dead have filed a federal wrongful
death lawsuit against the government.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas 64, No. 19 Auburn 55  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY KING, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Joe Johnson missed Arkansas' first
game against Auburn this season because of the death of his
grandmother. The 19th-ranked Tigers saw plenty of the Razorbacks
freshman on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 22 points, including a momentum-building
40-footer at the end of the first half, and Arkansas beat Auburn
64-55, the reeling Tigers' fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's 18 first-half points ended with an on-the-run
one-hander that was good off the glass after time expired for a
34-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just threw it up and prayed it would go in,'' Johnson said.
''I'm glad it was answered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Joe put on a tremendous show, especially in the first half,''
Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said. ''He made a lot of plays. He's just
a tremendous player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks (15-14, 7-9 Southeastern Conference) protected
the lead throughout the second half. Teddy Gipson scored five
straight points for an 11-point lead and Auburn (21-8, 9-7) never
got closer than six points over the final 11:46.
</P>
<P>
   It was 51-45 when Auburn tried a lob that was intercepted by
Larry Satchell. He passed ahead to Brandon Dean, who made a high
pass for a dunk by Gipson.
</P>
<P>
   It was 55-49 when Carl Baker and Chris Walker each made one free
throw; 57-51 when Johnson made two free throws with 67 seconds to
play and 59-53 when Walker made one of two free throws with 39
seconds to play. Walker, Arkansas' only senior, scored 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Auburn's third in a row since forward Chris Porter
was suspended by the NCAA for contact with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Porter situation is a distraction, but we will be fine,''
Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory likely earned Arkansas a bid to the NIT. If so, it
would be 14 straight years of postseason play for the Razorbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NIT is just a backup plan, but all the guys need more
experience so it is nice to assure ourselves a postseason,'' Walker
said. ''I couldn't ask for a better way to end the regular
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack McGadney led Auburn with 19 points and Doc Robinson added
13.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn had one chance for the lead in the second half, but
Robinson missed a 3-pointer when it was 42-40. Alonzo Lane's bank
shot from 6 feet made it 44-40 and Johnson then scored on a jump
stop in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson started from the left side, blew through the lane and
beat the shot clock with a layup from the right side. Auburn's
Mamadou N'Diaye went over the back of an Arkansas player on an
unsuccessful try for a tip-in and Gipson hit a 3 for the 11-point
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's 15-footer ended Auburn's nine-minute field goal
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teddy Gipson made two big plays, one on a slash to the goal
and the other on the alley oop that looked like it was going over
the backboard until he dunked it,'' Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson
said.

<HEADLINE> Iditarod Dogs Take Off For Nome  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- With fans yelling encouragement and
snapping pictures, the Iditarod sled dog race began Sunday with 81
dog teams mushing up the 1,150-mile trail to Nome.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Doug Swingley of Lincoln, Mont., bent over to
give his two lead dogs, Stormy and Abby, reassuring pats as he
waited his turn to start.
</P>
<P>
   The record field, which includes 29 rookies, is competing for a
share of a $525,000 purse, the largest ever. The race was begun in
1973 to commemorate the feat of dog mushers who delivered
lifesaving diptherium serum to Nome on Alaska's West Coast in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley, who holds the 1995 course record of 9 days, 2 hours,
42 minutes, would not say whether he can break his own record.
</P>
<P>
   If temperatures remained in the 30s, other mushers said it would
be difficult. The warm weather will force them to go slow, perhaps
moving mostly at night, so as not to overheat the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley said 11 of the dogs in his team this year were on last
year's winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are really animated and resilient,'' he said. ''They
don't need much rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Iditarod winner Martin Buser of Big Lake, who placed
second last year, said he's hoping to avoid the injuries that
forced him to drop six dogs early in the 1999 race. While many of
the dogs are the same, he said this year's team appears stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like they're heading toward a peak,'' Buser said.
</P>
<P>
   DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow has an inexperienced team. She was in
second place last year when her lead dog refused to go on and she
was forced to scratch. It was the first time in 16 Iditarods she
didn't finish.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Jonrowe said she had a mishap with her new lead
dog, 3-year-old Softail. An ice hook snagged his back leg while she
was practicing with another team. The injury required 10 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't cry. I couldn't say anything. I just picked him up
and put him in the sled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The dog's injury healed. Now she is relying on him to lead the
way over two mountain ranges, along rivers and miles of frozen sea
ice. But, just in case, she has two other dogs that could lead the
team.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for his turn, Dan Dent, an investment counselor
from Baltimore, checked the contents of his sled bag to make sure
he had packed everything, including plenty of peanuts and raisins.
Dent was forced to scratch as a rookie last year when, shortly
after the start, his hands were badly damaged in a dog fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ought to make it this year,'' Dent said.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Peters, who won in 1975 but hasn't raced since 1992 when
he scratched because of a knee injury, said his goal is to make it
to Nome one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is it,'' he said. ''I'm in no hurry.''

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Connecticut 85, St. John's 41  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- A day after St. John's Latasha Thompson set
a Big East scoring record with 25 points in a half, top-ranked
Connecticut made sure there was no repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   First, they stole Thompson's thunder, giving the 3-point
specialist few outside looks, then they stole the ball early and
often. The defending conference champs lead the conference in
steals and came away with an 85-41 quarterfinal win over the Red
Storm, setting a Big East record with the 44-point margin of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''There weren't a lot of areas that I thought we didn't play
well,'' said UConn coach Geno Auriemma. ''Our focus in practice has
been defense oriented. I thing that got us going.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn used a two-minute stretch of thievery early in the first
half and 70-percent shooting to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   Swin Cash and Tamika Williams had 14 points apiece for the
Huskies (28-1). Kennitra Johnson had four of UConn's 15 steals.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies converted four straight steals into baskets, capped
by a Sue Bird layup with 11:57 remaining in the first half for a
22-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, St. John's had seven turnovers in nine
possessions. The Huskies' swarming defense kept St. John's off the
scoreboard for up to six minutes at a stretch. UConn converted 25
Red Storm turnovers into 34 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the number one team for a reason,'' said St. John's
coach Darcel Estep. ''They're very balanced and very aggressive. As
a team they do a lot of things well.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn outscored St. John's, 52-14, in the paint and dominated
the boards, 41-26. Svetlana Abrosimova led the Huskies with 10
rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Tynisha Myles and Angela Stith had 11 points each for the Red
Storm (11-18).
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who had a career-high 33 in St. John's first-round win
over Pittsburgh was held to a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely didn't want to give her 33 points against us.
It's March now, we have to play our A-game,'' said Shea Ralph, the
conference player of the year and team steals leader with 74. She
had three picks and 12 points against the Red Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory was the largest since Notre Dame beat
Georgetown 83-43 in a 1997 semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   UConn will play No. 4 seed Boston College on Monday. The Eagles
advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 1990 with a
74-52 win over Georgetown.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Mbithi Wins LA Marathon  </HEADLINE>
By LOUINN LOTA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kenya's Benson Mbithi, fighting a headwind in
pouring rain with temperatures hovering in the 50s, won the Los
Angeles Marathon on Sunday, .
</P>
<P>
   ''The course is very good but the weather is very bad,'' Mbithi
said after completing 26.2 miles in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 55
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   He said that because of the headwind, the field was already
slowing down when he made his move at the 18th mile.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Yatich, also of Kenya, finished second to the 22-year-old
Mbithi.
</P>
<P>
   Estonia's Jane Salumae won the women's race in 2:33:33.
</P>
<P>
   Salumae slowed her pace as she hit mile 21, a climb that goes
from 197 feet to 395. She led the women elites from the start.
Russia's Albina Galliamova was second Peru's Maria Portilla Cruz
third.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyans dominated the men's elite field, including course
record-setter Simon Bor, who finished last year in 2:09:25. Bor's
brother, Noah, was the pace-setting ''rabbit'' who dropped out at
mile 18.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's Godfrey Kiprotich, who wasn't feeling well at race
start, dropped off at about mile 10.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers Bor maintained a blistering pace in the first half
of the 26.2-mile race, which drew about 23,000 runners.
</P>
<P>
   Each winner received $35,000 and a car.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Has Last Laugh Aganst Stanford  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- For the first time all season, JaRon
Rush had the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   After spending three miserable months on the UCLA bench while
serving suspensions for taking improper payments, Rush returned to
the court Saturday and got the reception he dreaded -- hundreds of
Stanford students waving dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw all that and, man, I got nervous,'' said Rush, whose
picture was plastered in the middle of an oversized $200 bill held
by Stanford fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Rush responded with 19 points, including the final five
points of a wild overtime, as UCLA dispelled doubts about whether
it will receive an NCAA tournament bid by shocking top-ranked
Stanford 94-93.
</P>
<P>
   With the Bruins trailing by four points in the final minute of
overtime, Rush hit an NBA-length 3-pointer to pull UCLA within
93-92. Then, after Stanford failed to inbound the ball in time, a
wild Bruins possession ended with Rush hitting a disputed 13-foot
baseline jumper with 3 seconds remaining for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rush smiled as teammates and coaches cried in the locker room
following the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to be out there on the court with the team for so
long. I tried to bring my energy to the team and help us go to the
tournament after all,'' Rush said. ''It's a new season for us.
We've got a four-game winning streak, we beat the No. 1 team on its
home court and now we're a team to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Rush had played since Dec. 1. He missed
the previous 24 games because of two suspensions -- one for
receiving benefits from an AAU coach while in high school in Kansas
City, the other for accepting $200 from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest suspension was supposed to last for the rest of this
season and into next season, but the NCAA responded to a UCLA
appeal last week by cutting it from 29 games to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Man, NCAA, couldn't you have suspended him for one more game?
They had to bring him back for us?'' Stanford's David Moseley
asked. ''He didn't even play a game (for months) and he came out
and took it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush hit his winning jumper after grabbing a loose ball under
the basket that Stanford's Jarron Collins likened to a hand
grenade. The shot clock appeared to expire during the wild scrum
for the ball.
</P>
<P>
   After running to their locker room in celebration, the Bruins
were called back to the court as referees twice watched a replay to
review their decision. The refs concluded a shot earlier in the
UCLA possession had scraped the rim, meaning the 35-second shot
clock should have been reset and that Rush's shot was legal.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the head official Saturday was Charlie Range.
Earlier this season, he was involved in a similar dispute at the
end of a Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game and was suspended from officiating
Big 12 games the rest of this season because he improperly
consulted a TV replay.
</P>
<P>
   After that earlier incident, the NCAA adopted a new rule
allowing officials to watch replays to review disputes over time at
the end of games.
</P>
<P>
   The loss highlighted some big problems for Stanford (25-2),
which had won its previous 13 games by double-digit margins. The
Cardinal, who have overwhelmed teams with their depth all season,
were outscored 50-11 by UCLA's bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't been in a close game in a long time. We made some
mental errors,'' Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said. ''We haven't
faced a situation in a while where we had to think for 45
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   For UCLA (17-11), it was vindication after a long season during
which the Bruins have been booed at home. And it helped ease
memories of a 109-61 loss to Stanford at Maples Pavilion in 1997,
when UCLA coach Steve Lavin still had an interim title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went through the Maples Massacre here, so I've always been
kind of emotionally scarred. Every time I set foot in this place
brings back emotional flashbacks to the time we were down 58 points
in this place,'' Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one is special just because this year has been so
difficult for our kids. It was two great teams just slugging it
out. Actually, one great team and a team that was trying to get
back into the mix nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery corrected Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were great,'' the Stanford coach said. ''They were great
today, and we were good.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Erickson Plans May Return  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Scott Erickson returned to the
Baltimore Orioles' training camp Sunday, wearing a sling on his
right arm and a grim look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, the No. 2 man in the Baltimore Orioles' rotation, was
expected to miss six to eight weeks after surgery to remove bone
chips from his elbow. It now appears he will miss at least the
first month of the regular season, and maybe more.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to start a game in May,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Erickson is planning to go home and watch TV.
After returning to Florida following Friday's procedure in Los
Angeles, the right-hander called up Orioles trainer Richie Bancells
and asked if he could begin to straighten his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Bancells nixed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we have to guard against with Scotty,'' manager
Mike Hargrove said. ''Guys like that you have to rein in a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Erickson to keep the elbow immobilized for
several more days, then work a week or two on strengthening the
joint before finally throwing again. Erickson has accepted his
fate, although it's not exactly how he envisioned spending March
when he arrived at camp three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no point in being upset about it. It's over with,'' he
said. ''Hopefully it gets better sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The timetable is hindered by the fact that Erickson hadn't quite
reached maximum arm strength before undergoing the operation. He
was only in camp a little over a week when he woke up one morning
and realized he couldn't move his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of tests revealed nothing, magnetic resonance
imaging revealed loose chips in Erickson's tender elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big problem is that I was only 70 percent before the
surgery. So I go down to 40 percent and then work back up to 100
percent,'' he said. ''A lot of guys who have it during the season
are at 100 percent and go down to 70 percent. It will take me a
little longer to come back than the average person.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the timing couldn't have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it happened in the offseason, I could be full-steam ahead
right now,'' he said. ''It's a little bit upsetting, but it's a
common thing. I'm not real concerned about it. It's going to be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Orioles could still trade for another starter,
their initial plan is to move Sidney Ponson, Jason Johnson and Pat
Rapp up a notch in the rotation and fill the fifth spot from within
the current 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm making an effort to talk to other guys to make sure they
don't put more pressure on themselves because he's going to out for
a month or six weeks starting the year,'' No. 1 starter Mike
Mussina said. ''The four of us can only pitch on our four days, and
we can't do anything about the other days. There's going to be
someone who comes in to substitute for Scotty.''

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Janell Burse scored 23 points and Grace
Daley added 18 as No. 23 Tulane beat North Carolina Charlotte 79-75
in the semifinals of the Conference USA tournament Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave (25-4) advanced to Monday's championship game
against Alabama-Birmingham, a 79-67 winner over Southern
Mississippi in Sunday's other semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Goree had 17 points and Fabrecia Roberson added 10 for
Tulane, which shot 51 percent from the field and 50 percent from
behind the 3-point line. Burse, Daley and Goree combined to make
22-of-38 shots, including 5-of-8 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Jameka Jones scored 23 points, Adrienne Jordan had 18 and Tonya
Phifer 10 to lead 11th-seeded Charlotte (10-20). Freshman guard
Alecia Abernathy pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds as the 49ers
outrebounded Tulane 41-32.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane led 40-31 at halftime, but the 49ers rallied to tie the
game at 47 on a layup by Abernathy with 12:35 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The lead changed hands several times down the stretch. Jones'
3-pointer pulled the 49ers within 74-73 with 41 seconds to play.
Burse followed with a layup and free throw with 19 seconds
remaining to seal the game.

   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- On an afternoon set aside for seniors,
nervous freshmen carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   First-year players Drew Gooden and Kirk Hinrich shrugged off
enormous the pressure and made two free throws each over the final
12 seconds as No. 23 Kansas squeezed past Missouri 83-82 Sunday in
the Big 12's regular season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, intentionally fouled by Jeff Hafer as he darted in for
what would have been a layup, turned an 80-79 deficit into an 81-80
lead for the Jayhawks (22-8, 11-5).
</P>
<P>
   Then after Hinrich's two foul shots gave Kansas an 83-80 lead
with 7.6 seconds to go, Missouri's Clarence Gilbert tipped in Keyon
Dooling's miss with one-tenth of a second left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was under a lot of pressure. It was like a dream,'' said
Gooden, who had 20 points and 13 rebounds. ''I've never been in
that position before in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Hafer was charged with an intentional foul, the Jayhawks
retained possession. Hafer's foul was not called intentional on
Hinrich. But the freshman guard calmly canned both shots and
brought a roar from the sellout throng who had come to honor four
seniors playing their last game at Allen Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (17-11, 10-6) had erased a 14-point second-half deficit
to take a one-point lead on T.J. Soyoye's free throw at the 1:40
mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm stinging a bit from this one. It hurts to play like we did
and lose,'' Missouri coach Quin Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Hafer did not dispute the intentional call foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want him to get an easy two or have an opportunity
for a three-point play,'' he said. ''It's something I did and it
turned out not to be a very good play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooling and Hafer had hit consecutive 3-pointers to launch a
13-2 Missouri rally after Nick Bradford's free throw had given the
Jayhawks a 77-67 lead with 4:20 left in the seesaw game between the
archrivals.
</P>
<P>
   After Soyoye's free throws, Kansas inbounded the ball with 39
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was probably a good call,'' Snyder said of the
intentional foul.
</P>
<P>
   Hafer, a 6-foot-5 senior averaging 7.2 points, hit two
3-pointers and a short jumper, scoring eight straight points during
a 12-2 run that saw the Tigers shave a 63-49 deficit to 65-61
midway through the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Bradford, a 6-7 senior, scoring seven straight
points to give the Jayhawks a 72-63 lead with 6:42 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was delighted, at first, to see Hafer called for the
intentional foul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked up and saw he'd called it intentional. I thought
good, then I thought, 'Oh, gosh, now I've got the pressure to make
the free throws.' The crowd quieted down for me and I knocked them
in,'' he said. ''I kept thinking we've got to win this one for the
seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinrich figured he needed to make both his foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to win the game so bad,'' he said. ''I had made some
mistakes early in the game and the last couple of possessions. ''I
thought if I made both of them we were sitting pretty good. If I
didn't, then we were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri went six minutes without scoring during a 14-2 Kansas
run opening the second half. The Tigers hit only three of their
first 14 shots of the second half and Kansas appeared to be pulling
away for an easy win until Hafer and Dooling halted the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The victory matches Kansas against 12th-seeded Kansas State on
Thursday in the first round of the Big 12 tournament. Bradford had
15 points and Nick Collison added 14.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush had 20 points and Gilbert added 18 for Missouri,
which will play Texas Tech on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri had eight 3-pointers in the first half and twice led by
as many as six before the Jayhawks pulled away for a 45-42 halfime
lead.

<HEADLINE> Report: Browns Reach Deal With Oben  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns, who still don't know if
offensive tackle Orlando Brown will be able to play next season,
but reportedly have agreed to terms with Roman Oben on a three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Oben, who was in town to visit with the Browns last week, has
agreed to a $10.8 million deal that includes a $3.2 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   A Browns spokesman on Sunday could not confirm Oben had agreed
to the deal, but several published reports said the sides came to
an agreement late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oben, a 6-foot-4, 305-pounder, had been a three-year starter at
left tackle for the New York Giants, who recently signed former
Browns left tackle Lomas Brown. Oben, 27, began to fall out of
favor with the Giants, who thought his play was affected by a minor
knee injury last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' pursuit of Oben underscores their concern for
Orlando Brown's health. Brown is still suffering from vision
problems after being struck in the right eye by an official's
penalty flag in a Dec. 19 game.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown was not well enough to play at right tackle,
second-year lineman Scott Zahursky, would replace him. However, if
Brown's eye problems clear up, he'll start on the right side with
Oben on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Oben is the second former Giants player to sign with the Browns
this winter. Last month, Cleveland signed safety Percy Ellsworth,
who led New York with six interceptions last season.

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead in India Political Rioting  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Mobs angry about losing political power
rioted and clashed with police Sunday in India's most lawless
state, leaving two people dead and thousands in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the National Democratic Alliance, or NDA, had
dislodged their party from power in Bihar State, political
activists also nearly caused two train accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Socialist leader Laloo Prasad Yadav was among the thousands of
members of his Rashtriya Janata Dal party, or RJD, detained for
rioting and defying a government order prohibiting public
gatherings on Sunday in Bihar, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An RJD member and a postman died when police fired during a mob
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   RJD members started rioting Saturday, a day after the main
opposition NDA -- the party of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee --
formed its government in the eastern state following state
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The elections gave no party a majority. Using a constitutional
convention, state Governor Vinod Chandra Pandey asked the NDA to
take power and prove its majority. Its leader, Nitish Kumar, took
over as chief minister from Rabri Devi, an RJD leader and Yadav's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Rajdhani Express luxury train rammed into a pile
of uprooted iron girders placed on the railroad track by political
activists near the state's Niazipur station. The high-speed train
dragged the girders along, but the driver brought the train to a
halt before it could derail, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another train, the Ganga Damodar Express, had a similar accident
near the Tarenga station, but no damage was caused. Both incidents
occurred in the Jehanabad district, notorious for its lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   RJD activists also burned down at least three cars on different
trains. Elsewhere in the state, the rioters ripped up railroad
tracks and attacked other railroad property.
</P>
<P>
   The rampage brought to a halt most trains going to or coming
from India's eastern and northeastern states that pass through
Bihar. The route is traveled by tens of thousands of people each
day. It is also crucial for trade.
</P>
<P>
   Violent protests are common in Bihar, India's poorest and most
lawless state. The state is also wracked by caste clashes and a
rebellion by Maoist groups.

<HEADLINE> Poor, Sick in Need of New Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the White House and Congress debate who
should be eligible for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit,
researchers are bolstering the Republican argument that aid should
go to the neediest senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a core group of elderly -- those who are poor and
those who have chronic illness -- who have the greatest need for a
drug benefit,'' said John K. Inglehart, founding editor of the
policy journal Health Affairs, which published three new studies of
retirees' prescription costs and usage in an issue released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Together, the studies indicate that, given the Medicare
program's limited financial resources, government assistance should
be targeted to those beneficiaries most in need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come as Congress and the Clinton administration
wrestle over how best to help elderly and disabled Americans, who
get health insurance under Medicare, pay for drugs. Medicare
provides no reimbursement for most prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate are questions about who should get
expensive new government drug benefits -- all Medicare beneficiaries
or just those in greatest need.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed offering an optional, limited
drug benefit to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. Republican
congressional leaders say it should be targeted more narrowly.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the new findings, the Clinton administration
released a statement from Medicare administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle
noting that many middle-class retirees struggle to pay for
prescriptions. ''We must not limit a benefit to those with low
incomes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the studies confirmed past estimates that at least
two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries already have some type of drug
coverage -- generally from private sources such as corporate
retirement benefits, HMOs and Medigap insurance, or from state
health programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that a smaller share of retirees with
incomes below or near poverty level have drug coverage -- 65 percent
compared with 69 percent overall.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers John A. Poisal and George S. Chulis, who work at the
federal agency that runs Medicare, based their findings on a 1996
government survey of beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Medicare recipients who said they were in fair
or poor health was roughly the same -- about a quarter -- regardless
of their drug coverage, suggesting similar medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   But the 11.6 million recipients without drug coverage used five
fewer prescriptions on average in 1996 and still spent 83 percent
more of their own money on drugs -- an average $463 compared with
$253 for those insured, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   These disparities were greatest among two subgroups: those near
poverty, and disabled Americans under age 65 covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Policy-makers should keep this in mind as they plan how to
structure and pay for any Medicare drug benefit,'' Poisal said.
</P>
<P>
   A second study suggested that senior citizens with chronic
illnesses would continue to face high out-of-pocket costs under a
widely available but limited Medicare benefit like the one
President Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The study, financed by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and
conducted by private researchers, looked at 1998 claims by 375,000
Americans age 65 and older who have drug coverage as part of a
corporate retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   It found that 18 percent purchased no drugs at all in 1998. But
among those who bought drugs used to treat chronic diseases --
including diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and
osteoporosis -- more than one in four spent at least $2,500, with
the top 1 percent spending as much as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would initially cap Medicare drug reimbursements
at $1,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   The third study looked at possible consequences for people with
chronic illness. It found that elderly patients with high blood
pressure are less likely to buy medication for the condition if
they lack insurance coverage. Those who did buy it paid 36 cents
more per pill and purchased an average of 37 fewer tablets a year
than their insured counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings by Jan Blustein, an assistant health policy
professor at New York University, were based on data from a 1995
Medicare beneficiary survey.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Examines Hospital Infections  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Infections contracted in hospitals kill as many
as 88,000 people each year, a number that could be reduced with
increased use of technology and simple measures such as more
frequent hand washing, a researcher said Sunday at a conference on
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control opened a five-day
conference on preventing and reducing healthcare-associated
infections in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard P. Wenzel, chairman of the internal medicine
department at the Medical College of Virginia said new devices such
as catheters coated with antibiotics have proven effective against
infection spread at health facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But those are still far costlier than simple but equally
necessary steps as getting doctors and nurses to wash their hands
after every patient contact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hand-washing is cheap, but the impact from it is great,''
Wenzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Using what he called conservative estimates, Wenzel calculated
that bloodstream infections contracted at health care facilities
could be the nation's eighth leading cause of death, claiming more
than 25,000 people each year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the CDC reported that the rate of such infections
fell by about 44 percent in the 1990s in medical intensive care
units at 300 facilities that report to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The infections typically are caused by catheters, intravenous
lines and breathing tubes common to most hospital stays. Such
devices allow bacteria easy entry into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel said simply placing an alcohol dispenser at each patient
bed cut blood infection rates by 40 percent in one hospital because
workers disinfected their hands more often.
</P>
<P>
   Another effective method is for doctors to model good habits in
front of colleagues and medical students.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I'm up in the ICU and I'm washing my hands, I always tell
the students, 'Oh this feels good, oh it's phenomenal,''' Wenzel
said. ''I give them the idea that they are missing out on something
if they don't wash their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, with the CDC's Hospital Infection Program,
said medical professionals must control infections better because
the number of older Americans will soar in the next century. The
elderly are particularly at risk for infection and more likely to
spend time in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis estimated the population of people over 65 in the U.S. --
40 million in 1998 -- is likely to double by 2035.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Jarvis calculates that about 88,000 people die each
year directly from blood and other infections contracted in health
care facilities. About 2 million Americans contract an infection
each year while in a hospital or other medical center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the at-risk population is growing, more and
more people are using longterm-care facilities or even home
healthcare, which also affects infection levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few longterm-care facilities have dedicated surveillance to
even detect these infections,'' Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   Home health care is the fastest growing component of healthcare.
An estimated 8 million Americans received medical care in the home
in 1996, according to Dr. Michele Pearson, an epidemiologist with
the CDC's Hospital Infection Program.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to track rates of infection passed to patients
during care in their own homes, Jarvis said. Such cases are not
adequately investigated and standards for home healthcare workers
and documentation of infection rates are limited.

<HEADLINE> Riot in Egypt Over Road Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Thousands of villagers rioted Sunday,
hurling rocks at motorists and setting vehicles ablaze after a
speeding truck killed a 16-year-old girl, a police official said.
</P>
<P>
   The rampaging villagers seized the driver of the truck that
killed Samah Mustafa, beat him severely and set fire to his
vehicle, the official said on condition of anonymity. The driver
was hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters demanded a crackdown on motorists who routinely
ignore traffic rules along the road, which is the main agricultural
route to the coastal city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers said scores of people had been killed and injured
along that part of the road as a result of speed violations and
reckless driving, the police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of riot police were sent to the village of Mit Nema,
about nine miles north of Cairo, after about 3,000 people began
demonstrating. Villagers set fire to a police van, a fire engine
and a paper factory. They also rolled a boulder onto railway
tracks, blocking trains for an hour, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Police fired tear gas and arrested about 20 alleged protest
leaders, the official said. Six police officers and 34 villagers
were admitted to hospital with injuries. Most of the villagers
suffered from tear gas inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance caused a traffic jam stretching to the outskirts
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Road accidents resulting from reckless driving along Egypt's
main roads claim thousands of lives every year. Traffic figures for
1998 reveal that over 6,000 people were killed in accidents.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Rips Arab States Over Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein said Sunday the
United States and fellow NATO countries were ''dogs'' for their
attacks against Yugoslavia last year, and he denounced Arab states
for supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a reception for the former speaker of the Serbian
parliament, Dragan Tomic, Saddam talked about the NATO airstrikes,
which were designed to pressure Yugoslav officials into stopping
the forced expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who attacked you are dogs, and we cannot justify any
Arab (states) who stand with dogs against you,'' Saddam said on
state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   During the conflict, many Arab countries sided with the ethnic
Albanians, who are mostly Muslims, and sent aid to their refugee
camps in neighboring Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ''When dogs attack a friend, we should not join the dogs even if
the friend was wrong. We must save him from the dogs first, and
then listen to him,'' Saddam said. The purpose of the visit by
Tomic, who was Serbia's parliament speaker until last month, has
not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi president's comments came days after U.S. State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin called Saddam a ''mad
dictator'' who cared nothing for the welfare of his people. Rubin
spoke in a Feb. 29 presentation designed to counter the charge that
U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, had
caused widespread suffering among ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam accused the United States of using the Islamic faith of
the Kosovo Albanians as an excuse for actions which, he said, were
aimed at ''dominating the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We refuse the use of Islam as an excuse to massacre, destroy
and terrorize nations,'' Saddam said, adding that ''Islam is not
American and, if Islam were American, it would not be Islam.

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks To Heal US-Iran Ties  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Italy wants to help heal relations between
Washington and Tehran following the stunning victory by Iranian
reformists in recent legislative elections, the Italian foreign
minister said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Following talks with Iran's President Mohammad Khatami, Lamberto
Dini told reporters that Italy stood beside Iran in its effort to
improve relations with the West, and that Italian firms were eager
to help Iran achieve its economic goals.
</P>
<P>
   Dini said he was not carrying a message from Washington for
Iranian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we hope that our talks both with Iranian and U.S.
officials will create the conditions for the two countries to begin
political discussions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Iran severed ties shortly after Iran's
1979 Islamic revolution ousted the U.S.-supported shah. During the
uprising, radical Iranian students attacked the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric trying to broaden social and cultural
freedoms, came to power in May 1997 elections. Contacts with Italy
soon after represented Iran's first steps out of isolation from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Dini's three-day visit -- which started late Saturday -- comes
soon after reformists ousted hard-liners from control of Parliament
for the first time since the 1979 revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has welcomed closer cooperation with Iran following the
reformist victory. German Foreign Minister Joshcka Fischer is due
to arrive in Tehran on Monday for a two-day visit to discuss a
possible trip by Khatami to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi told reporters that his
British counterpart, Robin Cook, was expected to visit Iran this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Dini has visited countries that other Western nations shy away
from. He has traveled to Libya, and later this month is expected to
go to North Korea in what is being billed as a trip by the
highest-ranking G-7 official to that communist country.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Vs. Proposition 22  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The pastor of St. Andrew's
Presbyterian Church told his congregation Sunday that he welcomes
gay people into his church. But he doesn't want them marrying.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Huffman Jr. said he supports Proposition 22, the
controversial measure on Tuesday's ballot that would bar gay
marriages from official recognition in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Love the sinner, hate the sin,'' Huffman said. ''I am not
prepared to declare that what the Bible says is sin is no longer
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election just two days away, churchgoers around
California struggled with how to vote on a measure that has
galvanized and divided the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Mormon, Roman Catholic and evangelical Christian
churches support Proposition 22. Three Southern California bishops
-- Episcopal, Lutheran and Methodist -- issued a joint statement
opposing it, saying it could lead to discrimination. On Friday, the
Roman Catholic priest who heads the Los Angeles Archdiocese's
ministry to gays and lesbians also publicly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman titled his sermon ''The Bible, Homosexuality and
Proposition 22.''
</P>
<P>
   ''God called his people to sexual purity -- a man and a woman
committed to each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Church elders at St. Andrew's voted last month to support
Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel, as Christians, we should be taking a stand on that, a
loving stand, and basically be supporting marriage between a man
and a woman,'' said Pam Metherell, 56, an elder.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was on the minds of 200 Mormons gathering at a
suburban Sacramento church for a monthly sacrament meeting. Church
member John Tennant urged the congregation to pray for Proposition
22's passage.
</P>
<P>
   In liberal San Francisco, a forum at an Episcopal church failed
to attract any proponents of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno, who is gay, called the
proposition ''mean-spirited,'' pointing out that gay marriages
aren't allowed in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a completely bogus argument,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California does not allow same-sex marriages, and that won't
change whether Proposition 22 passes or fails. The measure would
keep California from recognizing same-sex marriages allowed

<P>
   No other state allows such marriages, but proponents argue
Vermont is close enough to make the initiative a necessary
preemptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Measures similar to Proposition 22 have passed in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure appears to have the support of voters, who
favored it by 13 percentage points in the latest Field Poll. The
margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and
other prominent officials -- including President Clinton -- oppose
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clergymen say marriage is central to organized religion. So
while religious leaders often refrain from weighing in on secular
politics, many are stepping forward now.

<HEADLINE> Boeing To Impose Last Contract offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. declared Sunday it will impose its
most recent contract offer on engineers and technical workers whose
union has been on strike against the aerospace giant for
three-and-a-half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will be notified Monday that they will receive the pay
increases specified in the company's Feb. 26 contract offer,
officials said. Technical workers will receive a guaranteed minimum
increase of 2 percent, with some workers receiving more. The total
raises are capped at 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For engineers, the company will set aside salary increases
totaling 8 percent this year, with raises being doled out from the
fund on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the men and women of our engineering and technical
workforce ... we have a wonderful future ahead of us. With new
products and new services driven by technology innovations, we will
continue to lead the world of aerospace. But we need to work
together to achieve it. We are taking this step to implement wage
increases because it is the right thing to do for our employees,''
Boeing senior vice president Alan Mulally said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing declared an impasse Wednesday in contract talks as the
strike by 17,000 engineers and technical workers entered its fourth
week.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations had broken down Feb. 27 between the company and the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace despite
the efforts of C. Richard Barnes, head of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, and other federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses,
like those received by production workers represented by the
Machinists, Boeing's largest union.
</P>
<P>
   However, the company has offered -- and now imposed -- mostly
selective pay increases. The company proposals also have included
reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes in health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape Canaveral, Fla., four Boeing electrical engineers walked
off the job last week to join other striking workers. Their
decision meant all 10 SPEEA-represented people stopped work on the
launch of a $1 billion defense satellite scheduled for April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents about 22,200 Boeing employees, mostly in
Washington state but also in Kansas, California, Florida, Oregon,
Texas and Utah. About 63 percent are dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union had no strike fund earlier, the union and the
King County Labor Council have raised $160,000 since the strike
began. The union is also setting up a job bank, and has lists of
temporary contract agencies on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 union members have quit the company for new jobs
since the strike began, according to SPEEA. The union has urged
workers not to quit -- at least not until the strike is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The company delivered 15 aircraft to customers last month, well
short of the 47 it delivered in February 1999 and the 33 it
delivered in January. Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said military
projects have seen ''some moderate impact'' due to the strike, but
he would not be more specific.

<HEADLINE> Blast Damages Greek Paper Offices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Separate bomb attacks on Sunday damaged
the offices of a suburban Athens construction company and two
newspapers in northern Greece, police said. No one was injured in
either blast.
</P>
<P>
   A time bomb went off outside the offices of Aktor, a Greek
construction company, causing superficial damage. The company's
office is in the suburb of Halandri.
</P>
<P>
   A man claiming to be with the group Revolutionary Cells claimed
responsibility for the attack on behalf of the group by calling two
Athens newspapers about 20 minutes before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary Cells has carried out 11 bombings in the past
three years, including an April 1999 attack against an
American-owned hotel that killed a bystander. That attack was
carried out to protest NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. The
group said the hotel was targeted because an international
financial conference was to be held there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day a powerful explosion damaged the offices of
the newspaper Efta Imeres and the sports daily Athlitiki Gnomi,
police said. The two papers have offices in the same building in
the center of Ioannina city, 275 miles north of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the attackers used sticks of dynamite and a
slow-burning fuse.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for that blast. Last year, the
sports daily's offices were vandalized in an attack blamed on local
soccer team supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of firebombings and some bomb attacks are carried out in
Athens every year, most claimed by anarchist gangs who target the
cars and offices of government agencies, large companies and
diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
   Police consider Revolutionary Cells among the most dangerous
terror groups in Greece.

<HEADLINE> Czech Leader, Albright Hold Talks  </HEADLINE>
By JAN SLIVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- After talks with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the Czech president promised Sunday not
to allow the sale of parts to Iran that could boost its alleged
nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A deal signed last year by a Czech company to help in
construction of an Iranian nuclear plant has raised concerns in the
United States, which says the plant is part of an Iranian effort to
develop weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference with Albright after their talks, Czech
President Vaclav Havel said the Czech government will not allow
export of any components which could be misused for production of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a part of the international community, and we will not
allow any such exports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech government has proposed legislation that would bar the
ZVVZ Milevsko company from supplying air conditioning technology to
the Busher nuclear plant on the shore of the Persian Gulf. But
opposition communist deputies say they will try to thwart the
bill's passage in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, on a four-day visit to the land of her birth, is to
commemorate the 150th anniversary on March 7 of the birth of Tomas
Garrigue Masaryk, first president of what used to be Czechoslovakia
before splitting into the Czech and Slovak republics Jan. 3, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's press conference, Albright urged Serbia's democratic
opposition to work together against Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, whom she called ''a leader who takes Serbia down the
wrong road.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serb people don't deserve Milosevic,'' Albright said, of
the Yugoslav president, whose power base is Serbia, the largest
Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she was concerned about the latest incidents in
the Presevo region bordering the Serbian province of Kosovo, site
of several recent clashes between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants, adding it is now important to prevent extremists from
both sides from ''disrupting the situation any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright's father, Josef Korbel, a Czech diplomat, fled with his
wife and children to London as Germany took control of
Czechoslovakia at the onset of World War II, and then migrated to
Denver, Colo., in 1948 when the communists took over the country.

<HEADLINE> Said Jospin Attackers To Be Freed  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian students who allegedly
stoned the French prime minister will be released because the
attack was unplanned, brought on by frustration with the stalled
peace talks, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A police investigation into last week's attack on Lionel Jospin
found that ''the students did not plan the attack,'' West Bank
security chief Jibril Rajoub said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The students acted out of a deep frustration towards the peace
process that is not producing any results,'' Rajoub said. ''It was
an emotional act.''
</P>
<P>
   About 130 students were rounded up after students threw rocks at
Jospin during a visit to Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. Some
students climbed on Jospin's fleeing limousine and smashed the
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The students were angry over Jospin's statement that Hezbollah
guerrilla attacks against Israel in southern Lebanon were
''terrorist.'' Jospin suffered a slight head wound.
</P>
<P>
   Rajoub said about 30 students remained in custody, but would be
released in groups over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   He said the names of some students, those clearly seen on a TV
video tape stoning Jospin's car, would be referred to the
Palestinian Justice Ministry to decide whether to charge the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision, I believe, serves the interest of the
Palestinian people,'' Rajoub said.
</P>
<P>
   The students' release comes at a time when Palestinians are
increasingly frustrated with the peace process and the performance
of the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrests, there have been wide-scale protests
throughout West Bank universities in support of the students, and
100 Bir Zeit students began a hunger strike Saturday. Many
protesters also denounced Israel and what they called its
minimalist concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat suspended peace talks last
month over territorial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Students contesting elections at a polytechnic institute in the
southern West Bank town of Hebron used the stone-throwers as a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jospin, you are a coward, and the stone is the response,''
masked students chanted Sunday while campaigning for the militant
Islamic Jihad movement.
</P>
<P>
   In defiance of the Palestinian Authority, Bir Zeit students and
professors have refused to attend classes until their colleagues
were released.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin 56, No. 14 Indiana 53  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Standing at the foul line with the game in
the balance, Mike Kelley was just concentrating on his ride home.
</P>
<P>
   With big free throws from Kelley and a career-high 16 points
from Maurice Linton, Wisconsin roared from behind in the closing
minutes to upset No. 14 Indiana 56-53 Sunday in the Big Ten's final
regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   Linton put the Badgers ahead on a crashing layup with 59 seconds
left, and Kelley made four tense free throws over the final 25
seconds. After the game's controversial finish, the Wisconsin
student body stormed the court and lifted Kelley onto its
collective shoulders -- just like he had imagined moments earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never had the crowd rush the court before,'' Kelley said.
''I was just thinking, please let me make these so they can rush
the court. That's the best way you could end the year here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin closed the game on an 11-3 run and then survived for
its second double-digit comeback win in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Dane Fife missed a 3-pointer with three seconds left,
and television replays indicated that the ball bounced off a
Wisconsin player and landed out of bounds with at least one second
showing.
</P>
<P>
   But the clock ran to 0:00 and the buzzer sounded. After a short
conference, the officials declared the game over.
</P>
<P>
   That drew a clipboard-throwing display of anger from Indiana
coach Bobby Knight, who attempted to grab official Ed Hightower and
plead his case.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Hightower said the officials had determined that the
buzzer sounded at about the same time one official blew his
whistle, making the play non-reviewable.
</P>
<P>
   Knight didn't comment directly on the game's ending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me put it (this) way, we didn't have a chance to win at
the end of the ballgame,'' Knight said. ''Wisconsin really deserved
to win the game the way they came back. They played harder than we
did in the last 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin got just its second win over the Hoosiers in the
schools' last 37 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also may have ensured an NCAA tournament berth for
Wisconsin (16-12, 8-8 Big Ten), which beat a ranked team at the
Kohl Center for the fourth time this season. The game was
meaningless for the Hoosiers (20-7, 10-6), who will meet No. 25
Illinois on Friday in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're in,'' Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett said. ''Take
it for whatever you want ... but I think we've done enough this
year that we don't have to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 50-45 with 4:13 to play, Wisconsin held
Indiana without a point for four minutes while scoring nine
straight. With the score tied at 50, Linton made a reckless drive
into the lane, crashed into Lynn Washington -- and somehow scored,
giving the Badgers their first lead in 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He kind of took my legs out from up under me,'' Linton said.
''I wasn't really worried about the finish. I was worried about the
landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley added two free throws before Michael Lewis hit a
3-pointer with 12 seconds to play. After two more free throws from
Kelley, who had 10 points, Fife badly missed a 3-pointer and set
off the disputed ending.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin snapped a four-game losing streak against the
Hoosiers. The sixth-seeded Badgers open the conference tournament
Thursday against Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Guyton led the Hoosiers with 23 points, but he missed two
open jumpers and a free throw in the closing minutes of his final
Big Ten regular-season game. Kirk Haston had 14 points, just two of
which came after halftime as Indiana tightened up.
</P>
<P>
   Guyton hit a 3-pointer and a long jumper to give Indiana a 44-32
lead with 11:31 to play, but Duany Duany -- a Bloomington, Ind.,
native who wasn't heavily recruited by Knight -- responded with nine
straight points for the Badgers during a 13-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just thinking, it's now or never,'' Duany said. ''The
game, the NCAAs, all of it is on the line. We've got to get it
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was Knight's first in Wisconsin since he accidentally
shot a friend while hunting grouse in the northwestern part of the
state in October. Knight was cited for failing to report the
accident, which wasn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Wisconsin students wore hunters' orange to the game,
and the students chanted ''Please don't shoot me!'' in the first
half.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Declares Victory Over Unions  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- After his government effectively
thwarted an oil strike, President Hugo Chavez said Sunday he sought
the workers' best interests and invited them to join his campaign
against the country's labor bosses.
</P>
<P>
   During his weekly radio program ''Alo President,'' Chavez lashed
out at the unions, saying they are vestiges of a corrupt political
culture his leftist coalition is trying to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venezuela's oil workers have overthrown the corrupt union
bosses and this has transcendental importance in Venezuelan
history,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil workers went on strike Friday to protest the state-run oil
company's refusal to hold talks on a new collective labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   But they suspended the strike after only 11 hours when the
government published a decree effectively making the strike
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The decree requires unions to hold open elections instead of the
current system of party bosses hand picking union leaders. The
state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, claimed contract
negotiations could only take place with the new, democratically
elected union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Chavez insisted his actions against the petroleum
unions were done with the best interests of workers at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Venezuelan workers have to know this. I would give my life for
Venezuelan workers,'' Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office a year ago, Chavez, a former paratrooper who
staged a failed military coup in 1992, has decimated Venezuela's
traditional political parties and pushed through a new constitution
that eliminated the Senate and increased the power of the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Chavez has criticized both labor unions and the
news media. Critics say it's likely a pre-electoral strategy to
stir up mass support ahead of May 28 elections for congress,
governorships and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The new constitution requires all public offices to be renewed
through elections. Chavez, who enjoys popularity ratings of about
70 percent, is expected to win handily.
</P>
<P>
   Recent feuding inside Chavez's coalition intensified Sunday when
a leftist political party threatened to abandon the coalition,
angered over Chavez's Fifth Republican Movement's refusal to
compromise over candidates in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the Fifth Republic Movement in the oil-rich,
western state of Zulia withdrew its support for the re-election of
Gov. Francisco Arias, one of three former army officers who helped
Chavez stage his famous coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and the other two former coup leaders recently broke with
Chavez, saying the president is betraying the original
revolutionary goals of their rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OK's Medal for O'Connor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation Sunday
awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the ailing Cardinal John
O'Connor for his service to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has served the
Catholic Church and our nation with constancy and commitment,''
Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and
both houses rushed earlier to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of
his precarious health. The medal has been awarded to 250 people
including George Washington, the Wright Brothers and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, recuperating from brain tumor surgery last year, drew
applause from worshippers at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday. In
brief remarks at the start of the service, he called it ''a great
privilege'' to be present as Auxiliary Bishop William McCormack of
Manhattan filled in as celebrant.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, O'Connor, wearing his red cardinal's cassock,
sat behind the altar, periodically helped to his feet by an
assistant for prayers and hymns
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Joseph Zwilling said the 80-year-old archbishop was
''feeling better the last few days, but still weak and not able to
resume a regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor fell twice after his return to duty last October but
celebrated Mass regularly until two weeks ago. He suffers from
partial hearing loss and has difficulty reading as a result of his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said it was unlikely that O'Connor would celebrate
Mass on Ash Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In his award statement, Clinton recalled O'Connor's early days
performing parish work in his native Philadelphia, his service as a
military chaplain in Korea and Vietnam and his 16 years leading the
New York Archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether it was the soldier on the battlefield or the patient
dying of AIDS, Cardinal O'Connor has ministered with a gentle
spirit and a loving heart,'' Clinton said. ''Through it all, he has
stood strong as an advocate for the poor, a champion for workers
and an inspiration for millions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Ernest de Souza, the spiritual leader
of Jamaica's 500-year-old Jewish community, died of a heart attack
shortly after celebrating Sabbath services on Saturday. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer by profession, De Souza was best known in this
Caribbean nation of 2.6 million people as the spiritual leader of
the dwindling Jewish community. He had filled the post since the
last ordained rabbi left in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Jews first came to Jamaica with Spanish settlers in the early
16th century. Many were Marranos -- Jews who had converted to
Christianity during the Inquisition but practiced Judaism in
secret. The Jewish population here now numbers around 250, down
from more than 2,000 a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   De Souza published a number of books on the community, including
a pictorial history of Jews in Jamaica and a synagogue prayer book.
Paul Rene Doguereau
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Paul Rene Doguereau, a pianist and interpreter of
French music who lived here more than 60 years, died Friday in New
Jersey. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Angers, France, Doguereau studied piano with Marguerite
Long and composer Jean Roger-Ducasse. At age 15, he won the First
Prize in a competition at the Paris Conservatory. He had been
coached by Emma Bardac, the widow of French composer Claude
Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, he went to New York to study with Maurice Ravel,
developing a friendship that continued throughout the composer's
life.
</P>
<P>
   During his years in Boston, Doguereau founded the Peabody Mason
Music Foundation, endowed by his friend Fanny Peabody Mason. For
four decades, the foundation gave free concerts that featured such
artists as Glenn Gould, Maurizio Pollini, Alicia de Larrocha,
Dietrich Fischer-Diskau and Elly Ameling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Doguereau terminated the foundation and transferred the
$2 million endowment to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
Fred Hall
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. (AP) -- Fred Hall, whose fishing shows have drawn
thousands of anglers looking to buy equipment and learn from
experts, died Saturday of complications from heart valve
replacement and bypass heart surgery. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Hall died three days after he stopped by the Long Beach
Convention Center for the opening day of his longest-running annual
show, his son Bart Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a half-century as a show promoter, Hall created
''the largest celebration of fishing in America,'' said his son,
who took over the job of running the Fred Hall Fishing Tackle and
Boat Shows last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said his father created a niche that continues to attract
huge crowds of anglers.
</P>
<P>
   For his first show at a stadium in 1946, Hall decorated pillars
with bark and branches and covered the ground with sawdust dyed
green to look like grass, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall held shows in Chicago and San Francisco, but for the past
three decades had focused on Southern California, with annual shows
in Long Beach, Del Mar and Ventura.
Edmond Kaiser
</P>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Edmond Kaiser, a humanitarian
activist who founded several international organizations that
campaign on behalf of children, died Saturday in India. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Born to a Jewish family in Paris in 1914, Kaiser worked with the
French resistance during the war, and was condemned to death by the
Nazis for his actions. He survived and moved to Switzerland in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser formed the organization Terre des Hommes in Lausanne in
1959, which has operations across the globe to help children facing
poverty, illness and war.
Charles L. Knight II
</P>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Charles Landon Knight II, a horseman and
member of a prominent newspaper family, died Saturday of pneumonia.
He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was one of three sons of the late Akron Beacon Journal
and Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc. editor emeritus John S. Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Knight owned and operated Portage Newspaper Supply,
which sold printing and graphics supplies to newspapers.
</P>

Bradley, McCain Keep Campaigning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley are
fighting to stay alive as the presidential nomination races ahead for a
climactic multistate showdown Tuesday. Bradley advisers acknowledged today he
has little chance of loosening Vice President Gore's grip on every ''Super
Tuesday'' state. The McCain team held out hope for an election night surprise.
McCain today questioned whether George W. Bush is ''ready for prime time'' and
Democrat Bill Bradley suggested that voters can ''barely tolerate'' Al Gore.

Army Will Limit Overseas Duty

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Army policy that limits overseas duty to six months
for members of the National Guard and Reserve also will apply to active duty
soldiers, a spokesman said today. Reservists currently are deployed abroad for
up to nine months -- the maximum allowed by federal law. Active duty units
normally rotate after six months, but the service has set no official time limit
until now. Spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric
Shinseki will formally disclose the policy Tuesday.

Poor, Sick in Need of New Benefits

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers are bolstering the argument that Medicare
prescription drug benefit should go to the neediest senior citizens, as the
debate over who should be eligible continues. ''There is a core group of elderly
-- those who are poor and those who have chronic illness -- who have the
greatest need for a drug benefit,'' said John K. Inglehart, founding editor of
the policy journal Health Affairs, which published three new studies of
retirees' prescription costs and usage in an issue being released tomorrow. The
findings come as Congress and the Clinton administration wrestle over how best
to help elderly and disabled, who get health insurance under Medicare, pay for
drugs. Medicare provides no reimbursement for most prescriptions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker,
plans to buy a stake in Yamaha Motor Co., the world's
second-largest motorcycle maker.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota will pay music instrument maker Yamaha Corp., currently
the top shareholder in Yamaha Motor, about $92.6 million for a
stake of about 5 percent in the motorcycle subsidiary, the Nihon
Keizai financial newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota spokeswoman Hisayo Ogawa refused to comment on the size
or price of the automaker's planned share in Yamaha Motor. Yamaha
Motor spokesman Tetsuo Osumi said the companies would make an
announcement as early as Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Through a tie-up with Yamaha Motor, Toyota plans to strengthen
its overall group operations to better compete in global markets
with U.S. automakers General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the
Nikkei said.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which plans to enter the Formula One series car race as
early as 2001, considers Yamaha Motor a suitable partner for
developing and manufacturing sports car engines, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha Motor now supplies between 1,000 and 5,000 engines a
month to Toyota for use in its Supra model sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Yamaha Motor produced 2 million motorcycles. Only
Honda Motor of Japan makes more motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> Study Explores Teaching Hospitals  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two new studies offer conflicting views about
what happens to charity care when nonprofit hospitals are bought by
for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of three major teaching hospitals, researchers found
the institutions maintained their level of care to the poor, as
well as funding for education and research.
</P>
<P>
   But a separate study found government-owned hospitals were more
likely to reduce charity care when purchased by for-profit
companies, compared to those bought by nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies were being published today in the March/April issue
of Health Affairs, a public policy journal.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the difference in findings underscores the
difficulty in drawing broad conclusions about the impact ownership
status has on hospitals. Prior studies have found mixed results on
the effects of for-profit conversions, though the teaching
hospitals study is believed to be the first to examine the impact
on these types of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Communities need to be careful and pay attention to the
difference in values between for-profits and not-for-profits,''
said Dr. David Blumenthal, a Harvard Medical School researcher and
co-author of the teaching hospital study.
</P>
<P>
   For-profit companies have maintained that they provide better
service than not-for-profits because they run their hospitals more
efficiently and have more capital to invest in the latest
technologies and medical gear.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital ownership conversions were a major issue in the
mid-1990s when several public companies, particularly
Nashville-based Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., were on a nationwide
buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   But a downturn in hospital profits overall and the stock prices
of national hospital chains has impeded the trend in the past two
years. Columbia has been hindered by allegations that some of its
hospitals fraudulently billed for care given patients in federal
health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, at least seven major teaching hospitals have
been sold to for- profit companies. Critics feared each time the
sale would result in a reduction in the amount of charity care the
hospitals provide and in other programs that could cut into
profits.
</P>
<P>
   However, the teaching hospital study found the ownership change
did not affect the number of training programs, research funding or
money spent on caring for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised because I expected to find some erosion in
commitment to the hospitals' social missions,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The teaching hospital study analyzed the sale of three teaching
hospitals: St. Joseph Hospital of Omaha, Neb. to AMI Corp. (which
eventually became Tenet Healthcare Corp.), Tulane University
Hospital in New Orleans to Columbia/HCA and George Washington
University Hospital in Washington D.C. to Universal Health
Services.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the hospitals were able to preserve their social
missions was because they required the for-profits to abide by
certain rules as a condition of their sale, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Tulane, required Columbia/HCA to maintain charity
care at historical levels. As a result, about 5 percent of patients
admitted at Tulane in 1998 were uninsured, the same as before the
1994 sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible to work out arrangements, that at least for the
short term, preserve the social missions of teaching hospitals,''
Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of hospital conversions remain wary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe unprofitable services will get cut because a
for-profit company cannot afford to provide them,'' said Linda
Miller, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Volunteer Trustees
of Not-For-Profit Hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   She said once a hospital is sold to a for-profit it will change
ownership several times, which can affect operations.
</P>
<P>
   When any hospital is sold, Miller worries that for-profit
companies will take profits out of a community and fail to reinvest
in the hospitals' plant and equipment. ''These concerns are only
magnified at teaching hospitals because they are so technology
heavy,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The study of public hospital sales found that 60 percent of
government-owned hospitals that were sold to for-profit companies
saw at least a 15 percent decline in the level of charity care
provided, while just 23 percent of hospitals sold to nonprofits
showed a similar decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 of the 52 sales reviewed in the study, uncompensated care
increased at least 15 percent after the sale. Twelve of those
cases, or 86 percent, were sales to nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   The public hospitals study was conducted by researchers at the
Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University, who analyzed
52 public hospitals that were privatized from 1981 to 1995.

<HEADLINE> Daily News endorses McCain, giving him sweep of the press  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Republican Sen. John McCain completed a sweep of
editorial pages in the city's major newspapers on Sunday when the
Daily News endorsed him as its preferred choice in Tuesday's GOP
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has the courage to be bluntly honest in an America fed up
with politicians who quibble over what 'is' means,'' the Daily News
said. ''John McCain is the best thing that has happened to the
Republican Party since Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   The News called Texas Gov. George W. Bush ''the antithesis of
McCain,'' who after being upset by McCain in New Hampshire, has
''appeared determined to recoup his loss at any cost, even to his
own principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates remain in a dead heat for the New York primary.
In a New York Post/Fox 5 daily tracking poll, 43.4 percent of
Republicans supported Bush while 39.5 percent favored McCain. The
poll has a margin of error of 4.8 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, McCain won the endorsements of The New York Times,
Newsday and The Staten Island Advance. The New York Post and The
Albany Times Union endorsed McCain a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Guy V. Molinari, Staten Island borough president and McCain's
campaign chief in New York, called it ''a clean sweep,'' showing
that the papers ''recognized that John McCain has the personal
history, the character and integrity, and the message of reform
needed to lead our nation.''

<HEADLINE> Portugal Consul Body Believed Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police on Sunday found a body they
believe to be that of a Portuguese consul who has been missing for
several days.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the body hidden in the bushes off a freeway just
outside of the southern state Curitiba, 420 miles southwest of Rio
de Janeiro, said police chief Fauze Salmen.
</P>
<P>
   A maid reported Miguel Jose Fawor missing after she found his
home empty with the door open when she arrived for work Friday.
Inside, police found a bloody trail leading from an upstairs room
to the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor's Mercedes was earlier found abandoned in a nearby
neighborhood, a bloody towel and hood in the trunk, Salmen said.
</P>
<P>
   The hands of the body found Sunday were tied behind his back and
it looked as if he had suffered a hard blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Though police would not yet officially identify the body, his
maid identified the shoes and watch found on the body as belonging
to Fawor, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor lived alone and had been stationed in Curitiba for three
years.

<HEADLINE> Carnival Underway in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
By ANY CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- This year's Carnival, which got
underway in earnest Sunday night with samba groups celebrating
Brazil's 500-year history, promises to be the most expensive yet.
</P>
<P>
   The samba groups spent an estimated $13 million on this year's
Carnival, which celebrates Pedro Alvares Cabral's discovery of
Brazil on April 22, 1500.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who participate in the parades will realize how much
money the groups invested this year,'' said Rio mayor Luiz Paulo
Conde.
</P>
<P>
   The annual celebration is actually a hard fought competition
where on Sunday and Monday nights 14 topflight samba groups, known
as schools, fight it out for the honor of being judged champion.
</P>
<P>
   The schools with their hundreds-strong drum sections and
thousands of dancers are judged on their music, lyrics, floats and
costumes among other things.
</P>
<P>
   This year all the groups will address themes relating to
Brazilian history.
</P>
<P>
   Lower echelon groups paraded Friday and Saturday evening and
already the Carnival has claimed its share of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 15-year-old Isabel Cristina Silva was struck in the
thigh by a stray bullet while attending the parade with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's festivities also claimed the life of a police
officer, Francisco da Silva Santos, who was shot dead during an
argument with a man following a Carnival celebration on Rio's
upscale south side.

<HEADLINE> No.2 Tenn. 70, No.17 Miss. St. 67  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- With yet another Southeastern
Conference tournament title on the line, the Tennessee Lady Vols
found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Tennessee won its 10th SEC tournament title Sunday,
overcoming a 12-point deficit midway through the second half to
beat No. 17 Mississippi State 70-67 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're down by 12, we have every opportunity to just basically
quit,'' Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. ''That's when I called a
timeout. We had a little, I guess you call, prayer meeting on the
sideline. I told this team they didn't want to lose the way they
were playing.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a minute later, the Lady Vols went on a 12-2 run, and
Kyra Elzy completed the comeback with two free throws with 55.2
seconds left that put Tennessee (28-3) ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Fanning knew a Tennessee run was coming, and the
Mississippi State coach couldn't do anything to stop it. She tried
to stop it with a couple of timeouts to let her Lady Bulldogs
(23-7) regroup, but it wasn't enough with a Tennessee crowd of
10,687 cheering every basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''They fed off of that,'' Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our fans obviously they generate a lot of energy for us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has won four of the last five tournament titles, but
it looked like the Lady Bulldogs would add a third straight upset
victim in their first appearance in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State, which knocked off No. 12 Auburn and co-No. 2
Georgia to reach the title game, outshot the Lady Vols and led
56-44 with 8:01 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tennesee's Michelle Snow made a basket to start the spurt, and
Tamika Catchings took over with seven straight points. Gwen Jackson
tied it at 60 with 3:21 to go when she stole an inbounds pass under
Tennessee's basket, grabbed a rebound and scored.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were tied twice more before Elzy's free throws put
Tennessee ahead to stay. Angela Harris, who finished with 24
points, gave Mississippi State one last chance with her 3-pointer
with 9.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Semeka Randall sealed the victory with four free throws in the
final 14.9 seconds, the last at the 7.9-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings finished with 25 points to lead Tennessee, Randall had
17 and Snow 15.
</P>
<P>
   Subbing Elzy for freshman April McDivitt midway through the
second half was the big key for Tennessee. Mississippi State's
veteran guard duo of Angela Harris and Cynthia Hall got McDivitt
and freshman Kara Lawson into foul trouble and had no trouble
shooting over the shorter Lady Vols. Elzy's defensive prowess kept
Harris and Hall from penetrating.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to break it down whether Elzy's up there or whoever's
there,'' Fanning said. ''You've got to get to the interior of the
defense. Elzy guards you hard and makes it hard to see passes.''
</P>
<P>
   LaToya Thomas, the SEC's leading scorer as a freshman, nearly
carried Mississippi State to its first-ever tournament title. She
scored 25 points and started the Lady Bulldogs' 13-3 run to start
the second half with two quick baskets, but she fouled out with
3:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   ''She came out and basically held her team in it,'' Catchings
said of Thomas. ''When they needed a key basket, there she was.
What more can you say? She's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Nitra Perry added 12 points for Mississippi State, which had
been trying to become only the second team to win the tourney title
by playing four straight games.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 93, Heat 80  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Now everything is going the Lakers' way.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, the only player struggling during the team's winning
streak, found his game with 23 points and a season-high 10 rebounds
as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Miami Heat 93-80 Sunday for
their 15th consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are just the third team in NBA history to record two
winning streaks of 14 games or more in a season. They won 16 in a
row during December and January, and it seems likely they'll equal
that mark against the lowly Clippers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal added 17 points and 11 rebounds, Kobe Bryant
had 15 points and Ron Harper 14 points as four starters scored in
double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Alonzo Mourning returned after missing three games with
a sore left ankle and had 21 points and nine rebounds, but was
limited by five fouls. Jamal Mashburn added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's other three starters -- P.J. Brown, Tim Hardaway and Dan
Majerle -- combined for just 14 points, with Brown fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' defense held the Heat to 41.7 percent field-goal
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Rice came in against his former team without scoring in double
figures for three straight games, a first in his 88-game Lakers
career.
</P>
<P>
   But his struggles disappeared in the opening quarter when he
scored 13 points and Los Angeles shot a blistering 75 percent to
take a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The well-rested Heat, which hadn't played since Thursday, cut
their deficit to single digits when Mashburn scored six of their
eight points at the beginning of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami found mostly frustration in the period, even as the
Lakers' shooting cooled to 25 percent. Mourning picked up his third
foul, as did Majerle, and the Heat trailed 57-40 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Miami never made a serious run in the second half and wasn't
able to get within single digits the rest of the game. Two free
throws by Rice put the Heat down by 18 again before they scored the
final six points of the third quarter to trail 72-60.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Brown fouled out and Mourning's offensive
foul was his fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The other teams with two winning streaks of 14 or more in a
season were the 1946-47 Washington Capitols, who had streaks of 17
and 15, and the 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks, who had streaks of 22 and
16. ... The Lakers' 28 home wins are the most in the NBA. They're
also 12-1 at home against Eastern Conference teams. ... The Heat
dropped to 15-16 on the road. ... The teams played for the first
time since the 1997-98 season, when they split the series. The Heat
has lost six straight to the Lakers in Los Angeles . ... Heat coach
Pat Riley is the Lakers' career wins leader. He had a 533-194
record in nine seasons, including four NBA championships.

Gore Rails Against Bush TV Ads
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore joined Republican John McCain today
in railing against new television ads financed by friends of George W. Bush, as
the presidential nomination races ahead for a showdown Tuesday. ''If Governor
Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests on Tuesday, this will raise
serious questions about whether he did so fair and square,'' Gore said during a
speech in Cranston, R.I. ''We knew that Governor Bush was in the hip pocket of
the special interests. Now we find out what a deep pocket that is.'' Two Texas
brothers and prominent Bush supporters, Sam and Charles Wyly, are spending $2.5
million on ads attacking McCain's environmental record.

Israel Cabinet OKs Lebanon Pullback
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon's government welcomed the Israeli Cabinet's
decision today to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon by July, but said it
would prefer that the move come as part of a settlement to bring peace to the
last active Arab-Israeli war front. In 1985, Israel set up an occupied buffer
zone in Lebanon near the northern Israeli border to protect its border towns
from guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said since he took
office last May that he would withdraw, and Sunday's unanimous Cabinet decision
backed him up. The decision came as fighting raged in southern Lebanon.

Army Will Limit Overseas Duty
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Army policy that limits overseas duty to six months
for members of the National Guard and Reserve also will apply to active duty
soldiers, a spokesman said today. Reservists currently are deployed abroad for
up to nine months -- the maximum allowed by federal law. Active duty units
normally rotate after six months, but the service has set no official time limit
until now. Spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric
Shinseki will formally disclose the policy Tuesday.

Boeing Imposing Last Contract Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. declared today it will impose its most recent
contract offer on engineers and technical workers whose union has been on strike
against the aerospace giant for three-and-a-half weeks. Employees will be
notified Monday that they will receive the pay increases specified in the
company's Feb. 26 contract offer, officials said. Technical workers will receive
a guaranteed minimum increase of 2 percent, with some workers receiving more.
The total raises are capped at 5.5 percent. For engineers, the company will set
aside salary increases totaling 8 percent this year, with raises being doled out
from the fund on an individual basis.

   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- The United Arab Emirates signed an
agreement Sunday to buy 80 F-16 fighters and related equipment worth a total of
$6.4 billion from Lockheed Martin Corp. Company and U.A.E. officials announced
the deal at the Tridex 2000 Defense Exhibition here. The contract had been under
negotiation since May 1998 and was postponed several times. The 80 jets are to

Clinton OK's Medal for O'Connor

   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton signed legislation today awarding the
Congressional Gold Medal to the ailing Cardinal John O'Connor for his service to
the nation. ''For more than 50 years, Cardinal O'Connor has served the Catholic
Church and our nation with constancy and commitment,'' Clinton said in a
statement. The medal is the highest civilian honor awarded by Congress, and both
houses rushed earlier to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his precarious
health. The medal has been awarded to 250 people including George Washington,
the Wright Brothers and Mother Teresa.

Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose higher in early trading Monday, as the
Nikkei Stock Average gained 167.16 points at 20,094.70 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average closed down 31.99 points. Share
prices rose on Wall Street Friday after the U.S. Labor Department said the
economy generated fewer jobs in February than at any time in the previous nine
months, and that the growth of wages had slowed. That report helped allay
investor concern over U.S. inflation.

Lakers Beat Heat 93-80
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice found his game with 23 points and a season-high
10 rebounds as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Miami Heat 93-80 Sunday for their
15th consecutive victory. The Lakers are just the third team in NBA history to
record two winning streaks of 14 games or more in a season. They won 16 in a row
during December and January, and it seems likely they'll equal that mark against
the lowly Clippers on Monday night. Shaquille O'Neal added 17 points and 11
rebounds.

Teenage Girl To Be Tried For Murder
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- A 17-year-old girl accused of
killing 14-year-old Reena Virk in a savage attack by several teens
will be tried for second-degree murder in adult court this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Marie Ellard was 15 when she was charged with the murder
of the Victoria teen, who was attacked twice on Nov. 14, 1997, and
subsequently drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard, who is accused of participating in the second attack on
Virk, is the last of eight Victoria teens who were charged in
connection with the attacks on Virk.
</P>
<P>
   Six girls aged between 14 and 16 were handed sentences ranging
from 60 days in conditional custody to one year in jail for their
parts in the first attack on Virk. The girls were all tried as
young offenders and cannot be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Glowatski, 16 at the time of Virk's death, was tried in
adult court and found guilty last June of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Glowatski received an automatic life sentence but is eligible
for parole after seven years because he's still covered by the
Young Offender's Act. An adult convicted of the same crime would
not be eligible for parole for at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard spent four months in custody at a youth detention
facility before being released into the custody of her mother and
stepfather who live in a suburban Victoria community.

Striking Medical Lab Technicians Challenge Bouchard Government
</P>
<P>
   QUEBEC (AP) -- Striking medical lab technicians staged a
demonstration Sunday and said they would be still on the job if the
Quebec government put a real priority on health care.
</P>
<P>
   Francine Genest, president of the technicians' 4,200-member
professional association, said the lab techs' demands have been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The organization wants its members to get the same salary as
nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing to explain this refusal,'' Genest said at the
demonstration Sunday outside the office of Health Minister Pauline
Marois. ''It's a question of recognizing a profession.''

Canadian Broadcast Urges Catholics To Return To 'Ancient Truth'
</P>
<P>
   CHATHAM, Ontario (AP) -- Canada's Roman Catholic Church stepped
into the television age this week with three pre-Lenten programs
being carried on Vision TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Paul Andre Durocher urged Catholics to return to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some of us, returning means returning to a building we
haven't visited for a long time. For others, it means revisiting an
ancient truth,'' Durocher said in a taped program.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour-long installment was broadcast Sunday evening,
with the others to follow tonight and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Included in series venture ever were Cape Breton's Celtic
fiddler, Nathalie McMaster, and tenor Michael Burgess, a former
seminarian best known for his role as Jean Valjean in the stage
production of Les Miserables.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Mare Wins Santa Margarita  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Riboletta, a 5-year-old Brazilian mare,
held off Bordelaise by three lengths Sunday in the $300,000 Santa
Margarita Invitational Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta ran 1 1-8 miles on the sloppy track in 1:50 2-5 under
Corey Nakatani, who rode General Challenge to victory Saturday in
the $1 million Santa Anita Handicap. It was the mare's second
victory in the United States following a win an allowance race.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta paid $13.60, $6 and $2.20. At 5-1, she had the
second-longest price in a field reduced to five after Zante and
morning line favorite Keeper Hill were scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta, carrying 115 pounds, took the early lead but briefly
lost it to Gourmet Girl in the backstretch. Riboletta inched away
on the second turn, came out into the stretch and held on along the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   Bordelaise paid $4.20 and $2.20 and finished four lengths ahead
of favored Snowberg, who paid $2.10 to show. Ta Ta Be True and
Gourmet Girl completed the order of finish.
</P>
<P>
   The winning purse of $180,000 almost doubled the earnings of
Riboletta. She has a career record of 7-3-2 in 20 races.
</P>
<P>
   Riboletta was running in her third start for trainer Eduardo
Inda. She had been racing for Bob Baffert, the trainer of General
Challenge and Commitisize, who earlier Sunday took the $200,000
Arcadia Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ''This win is very important to me,'' said Inda, who picked up
his first win for owners Aaron and Marie Jones and his first at
Santa Anita in 20 attempts. ''She has won in South America on a
track like this and I though she'd love it. Corey rode her
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Arcadia Handicap, Commitisize, with Victor Espinoza
aboard, fended off a closing rally from Chullo. Commitisize paid
$10, $4.20 and $3.40, Chullo returned $3.20 and $2.60, and Sultry
Substitute paid $3.60 to show.

<HEADLINE> No.18 Purdue 71, No.5 Penn St. 63  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Katie Douglas scored 24 points, including
five 3-pointers, as No. 18 Purdue beat No. 5 Penn State to win its
third consecutive Big Ten women's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (22-7) overcame 25 turnovers to earn the conference's
automatic bid to defend its NCAA championship. Camille Cooper and
Kelly Komura, who had 10 of the turnovers, each scored 17 points as
the Boilermakers avenged two regular-season losses to the Lady
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State (26-4) trailed most of the game as it had its 10-game
winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers took a 12-2 lead as Penn State missed its first
four shots from the field and trailed only twice in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State took a 57-54 lead on a 3-pointer by Chrissy Falcone
followed by two free throws by Helen Darling, who led the Lady
Lions with 16 points and was the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas then tied the game for the final time at 57 with a
3-pointer and Komura's 3-pointer put Purdue ahead 60-57 with 4:28
to go. Two free throws by Darling made it 62-57 with 3:50
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, which had won its first overall Big Ten championship
in the regular season, reduced its deficit to three on two free
throws by Darling with 3:12 left and trailed 67-63 after Lisa
Shepherd's layup.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Lions had trailed by 10 points twice in the first half
when the Boilermakers had 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue led 32-26 at halftime with Penn State shooting just 27
percent (8-of-30). The Boilermakers had taken a 20-10 lead on a
3-pointer by Douglas with 12:28 left in the half. Penn State
responded with nine straight points as Purdue went more than five
minutes without scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, Cooper, Penn State's Andrea Garner and Tauja Catchings
of Illinois joined Darling on the all-tournament team selected by
the media.

<HEADLINE> Bradley and McCain campaign to stay alive  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting to stay alive, Republican John McCain
on Sunday questioned whether George W. Bush is ''ready for prime
time'' and Democrat Bill Bradley suggested that voters can ''barely
tolerate'' Al Gore, as the presidential nomination races head for a
climactic multistate showdown Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''A happy life,'' McCain replied, when asked what was in store
if he fared poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The two underdogs expressed confidence as they made the TV talk
show rounds, even as aides braced for the worst by quietly making
plans for dignified exits. Bradley advisers acknowledged he has
little chance of loosening the vice president's grip on every
''Super Tuesday'' state. The McCain team held out hope for an
election night surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of acrimony, McCain ruled out running as a
third-party candidate, and both underdogs said they could support
their rivals in defeat. McCain, stung by negative ads, qualified
his pledge to back the GOP nominee if it is Bush: ''I expect
Governor Bush to change. I expect him to run an entirely different
campaign than the kind that he's run in this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans compete Tuesday in 13 states for 613 delegates, and
Democrats battle in 15 states for 1,315 delegates -- more than half
the total each party requires of its nominees. Spanning from Maine
to California, the contests amounted to the closest the country has
ever come to a national primary.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley is foundering across the board, McCain is doing
well in New England but is threatened by the Texas governor
everywhere else:
</P>
<P>
   -- New York is close, with new polls giving Bush an edge.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush holds a yawning lead over McCain among California
Republicans, who award 162 delegates in the winner-take-all
primary. The Arizona senator could still win the state's nonbinding
popular vote, which would give him shaky platform to argue he is
the better general election candidate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush holds wide leads in Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Their battleground shrinking, McCain advisers believe he must
win New York, Ohio, all of New England and the nonbinding popular
vote in California to stay in the race. Campaign manager Rick Davis
called Ohio ''the sleeper story,'' because McCain must overcome a
25-point deficit in the polls to make his long-shot scenario a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in New York and Ohio, McCain unleashed a scathing
indictment of Bush's environmental record in Texas, as well as his
presidential campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're getting more and more like the Clinton campaign,''
McCain said in Cleveland, comparing the 1996 Clinton administration
fund-raising scandal to a $2.5 million ad campaign financed by Bush
supporters Sam and Charles Wyly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore joined McCain in railing against new television ads, which
criticize McCain's environmental record in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Governor Bush defeats John McCain in some of these contests
on Tuesday, this will raise serious questions about whether he did
so fair and square,'' Gore said during a speech in Cranston, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew that Governor Bush was in the hip pocket of the
special interests. Now we find out what a deep pocket that is,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor denied involvement in the ad campaign, but
refused to ask his allies to pull the ads, saying, ''That's what
free speech is all about.'' His spokesman, Karen Hughes, said
Gore's accusations had a ''ring of hypocrisy,'' given his
fund-raising record.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is running ads in New York state questioning McCain's
commitment to fighting breast cancer. McCain's sister suffers from
the disease, and Bush said last week that is ''all the more reason
to remind'' McCain of his record.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder if someone who would treat a situation like that is
ready for prime time,'' McCain said Sunday, his eyes narrowing as
he shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   He compared Bush to Steve Forbes, who picked apart Bob Dole's
Senate record in the 1996 GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of negative attack just shows that Bush wants to win
in the worst way,'' said McCain, who appeared on CBS's ''Face the
Nation'' and NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who appeared on CBS and ABC's ''This Week,'' said McCain's
position on breast cancer is documented on his Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was less critical of his rival than McCain, but passed
up a chance to say Gore was honorable. ''I think he distorted the
record,'' he said. ''I had hoped that we could get to an election
where people could be choosing between two politicians they esteem
as opposed to one they can barely tolerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged easing up on Bradley, if not dropping him
altogether from his stump speeches. But the vice president said
that didn't mean he assumes he has locked up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Two Bradley advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
aides have begun discussing among themselves possible settings and
themes of a speech announcing his departure from the race. The
advisers, who had not talked to Bradley personally, said he was
aware that his chances were slim and wanted to be ready with
dignified exit.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to campaign Wednesday in Colorado, regardless of
Tuesday's outcome, but Thursday has been set aside as ''a day of
assessment,'' said a senior adviser. McCain's entire senior
leadership has joined the traveling entourage in preparation for
meetings expected after Tuesday. Without California's delegates,
which McCain no longer expects to win, the discussions will almost
certainly include recommendations that he depart the race,
according to several advisers.

   ST. GEORGE, Ga. (AP) -- A 7,800-acre brush fire in dense pine
thickets near the Georgia-Florida border was declared 90 percent
contained Sunday night.

injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was reported Saturday afternoon and raged quickly out

<HEADLINE> Russia, SKorea Hold Naval Exercise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Former Cold-War enemies Russia and
South Korea will hold their first joint naval exercise in April,
Seoul's Defense Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is the latest sign of closer ties between the two
former adversaries. Russia's predecessor, the former Soviet Union,
established diplomatic relations with Seoul in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The one-week drill will involve naval ships and helicopters from
the two countries in a mock search and rescue operation of a
wrecked civilian ship in international waters, the ministry said in
a news release.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is expected to send a destroyer and an antisubmarine ship
for the drill to be held off South Korea's southeast coast, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea held a similar naval drill with Japan last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The drill is part of South Korea's efforts to promote military
cooperation with the world's major powers as a leverage against its
foremost enemy, communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea holds a number of joint military exercises with the
United States every year.
</P>
<P>
   The former Soviet Union was a longtime ally of North Korea but
their relations have cooled since Moscow recognized South Korea in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and South Korea have exchanged visits of their defense
ministers and other military leaders in recent years. In 1997,
Russia's missile cruiser Varyag, the flagship of the country's
Pacific Fleet, made a port call to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The joint naval drill comes as Russia is trying to pay back $1.7
billion it owes to South Korea with weapons. Russia so far has paid
back part of the debt with tanks and armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest arms-for-debt deal, Russia offers to sell South
Korea three diesel-electric submarines of the Amur class. The
2,600-ton submarine with a crew of 34 crew is known as one of
Russia's most sophisticated weapons.

   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Tammy Sutton-Brown had 12 points and seven
rebounds as No. 8 Rutgers beat Villanova 61-32 Sunday night in the
Big East tournament quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The 32 points scored by Villanova (15-14) was a record for the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Meets Sudanese Official  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- A U.S. envoy met with Sudan's foreign
minister Saturday in the first meeting between senior American and
Sudanese officials since 1998, the minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The office declined to comment on what was discussed during the
talks between the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, Harry Johnston, and
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   But the official Sudan News Agency said Ismail briefed Johnston
on the government's policies and positions. Johnston, who arrived
early Saturday, told the minister he had come to Khartoum ''with an
open heart and mind,'' the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail told the news agency it was ''important to review
bilateral relations between Sudan and the United States of America
and to overcome the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's four-day visit could signal a shift away from the
Clinton administration's long-standing policy of trying to weaken
Sudan's Islamic regime by isolating it.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Sudan and the United States, once Khartoum's
main foreign backer, have been sour since a 1989 military coup
brought an Islamic government to power.
</P>
<P>
   They further deteriorated in 1998 when the United States bombed
a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant it said was producing ingredients
for chemical weapons. The manufacturer said the plant made vaccines
and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has said Johnston will discuss ways of
encouraging Sudanese authorities to participate more constructively
in ending Sudan's civil war, press for greater protection of human
rights and seek reliable access for the delivery of humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2 million people have died since rebels in southern
Sudan, a mainly Christian and animist population, began fighting
for autonomy from the Muslim-dominated north in 1983. Intermittent
negotiations between the government and rebels in Nairobi, Kenya,
have failed to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, a former Democratic congressman from Florida, was
appointed special envoy to the war-torn African country in August.
</P>
<P>
   He also planned to visit a camp outside Khartoum for people
displaced by the war and hold talks with southern Sudanese leaders
as well as the minister of justice, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   One previous deterrent to a trip by Johnston was a
recommendation by the U.S. State Department diplomatic security
bureau that Khartoum was too dangerous for a U.S. official to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is now making an assessment as to whether it would be
safe for the United States to have a ''near continuous presence''
in Sudan after an 18-month period in which U.S. diplomats have
stayed away from Sudan because of security concerns, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston is due to leave Sudan on Tuesday.

Boeing Imposing Last Contract Offer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. declared today it will impose its most recent
contract offer on engineers and technical workers whose union has been on strike
against the aerospace giant for three-and-a-half weeks. Employees will be
notified Monday that they will receive the pay increases specified in the
company's Feb. 26 contract offer, officials said. Technical workers will receive
a guaranteed minimum increase of 2 percent, with some workers receiving more.
The total raises are capped at 5.5 percent. For engineers, the company will set
aside salary increases totaling 8 percent this year, with raises being doled out
from the fund on an individual basis.

Israel Cabinet OKs Lebanon Pullback
</SUBHEAD>

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon's government welcomed the Israeli Cabinet's
decision today to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon by July, but said it
would prefer that the move come as part of a settlement to bring peace to the
last active Arab-Israeli war front. In 1985, Israel set up an occupied buffer
zone in Lebanon near the northern Israeli border to protect its border towns
from guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said since he took
office last May that he would withdraw, and Sunday's unanimous Cabinet decision
backed him up. The decision came as fighting raged in southern Lebanon.

Osman Ismail's meeting with Harry Johnston on Saturday was the first encounter
between senior American and Sudanese officials since 1998, when the United
States bombed a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant it said was producing ingredients
for chemical weapons. The manufacturer said the plant made vaccines and
medicines. The United States has withdrawn its ambassador and imposed limited
sanctions on Sudan, accusing it of supporting terrorism and an appalling human

Church and our nation with constancy and commitment,'' Clinton said in a

houses rushed earlier to approve it for O'Connor, mindful of his precarious
health. The medal has been awarded to 250 people including George Washington,

<HEADLINE> Boeing Imposing Last Contract Offer  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE WELLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. declared Sunday it will impose pay
increases from its most recent contract offer on engineers and
technical workers who have been on strike against the aerospace
giant for three-and-a-half weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it's time to get back to work and start focusing on our
customers,'' said Alan Mulally, president of the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, at a news conference Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The union for 17,000 striking workers dismissed the action as an
attempt to get workers to cross picket lines and called it an
unfair labor practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not coming back until they sit down at the table with us
and negotiate this contract,'' said Tom McCarty, a member of the
engineering negotiating team, who was picketing with about 75 other
Boeing employees outside the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said employees on Monday will receive pay
raises specified for the first year of the company's Feb. 26
contract offer. Technical workers will get a guaranteed minimum 2
percent wage increase, with a pool representing a 3 percent
additional increase to be doled out selectively.
</P>
<P>
   The contract offer does not guarantee engineers an increase in
the first year. Performance-based raises will be granted from a
fund totaling a 5 percent increase, with another 1 percent for
those about to be promoted.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 2 percent increase was set aside for engineers in
critical skills areas such as software development and electrical
engineering, Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   The company will not impose other parts of the offer, however,
including reductions in life insurance benefits and some changes in
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Rogers, general counsel for the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace, said the union will file an
unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations
Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it's a move on Boeing's part to try and get
employees to cross the picket line and we believe it's going to be
monumentally unsuccessful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing declared an impasse Wednesday in contract talks as the
strike by 17,000 engineers and technical workers entered its fourth
week. The union said Sunday that it believes the declaration of an
impasse was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations broke down Feb. 27 despite the efforts of C.
Richard Barnes, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, and other federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   The union has sought more guaranteed pay raises and bonuses,
like those received by production workers represented by the
Machinists, Boeing's largest union. However, the company has
offered -- and now imposed -- mostly selective pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   The company delivered 27 aircraft to customers in February,
falling short of the 42 planes scheduled for delivery, Mulally said
Sunday. The company had delivered 47 planes in February 1999 and 33
in January, before the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   In Cape Canaveral, Fla., four Boeing electrical engineers walked
off the job last week to join other striking workers. Their
decision meant all 10 SPEEA-represented people stopped work on the
launch of a $1 billion defense satellite scheduled for April 9.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents about 22,200 Boeing employees, mostly in
Washington state but also in Kansas, California, Florida, Oregon,
Texas and Utah. About 63 percent are dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union had no strike fund earlier, the union and the
King County Labor Council have raised $160,000 since the strike
began. The union is also setting up a job bank, and has lists of
temporary contract agencies on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At least 40 union members have quit the company for new jobs
since the strike began, according to SPEEA. The union has urged
workers not to quit -- at least not until the strike is resolved.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 4, Flyers 3, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mariusz Czerkawski assisted on the tying
goal late in regulation and then scored in overtime Sunday night,
giving the New York Islanders a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Czerkawski scored on a wrist shot from between the hash marks
:59 into the extra session after setting up Jamie Rivers on the
power play with 2:55 left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, who had gone 72 games without a goal, scored his first
of the season on a slap shot from just inside the blue line after
taking a cross-ice pass from Czerkawski.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Scatchard and Olli Jokinen also scored for New York, which
rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win for the first time in nine games
(1-6-2) at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Jones and Simon Gagne scored power-play goals in the
second for Philadelphia. Gino Odjick, acquired last month in a
trade with the Islanders, also scored for the Flyers. It was
Odjick's first goal with Philadelphia and sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which did not record an overtime shot, fired 46 at
Kevin Weekes during regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   Scatchard gave New York a 1-0 lead, scoring his 11th goal at
8:58 of the first, after taking a pass from Sean Haggerty on a
brilliant 2-on-1 play.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has 10 points in 10 games, got the Flyers even by
scoring during a scramble from the right side of the net on a
power-play at 8:28 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne put the Flyers ahead 3:41 later, converting a rebound of a
shot from slot by Mark Recchi. It was the eighth power play goal of
the season for Gagne to lead NHL rookies. Recchi, who had two
assists, leads the league with 35 power-play points.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's two power-play goals snapped an 0-13 drought. The
Flyers lead the NHL with 61 man-advantage goals.
</P>
<P>
   Odjick scored in a scramble in front of the net to increase the
lead to 3-1 at 6:19 of the third after Weekes turned away shots by
Recchi and Gagne.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen made it 3-2 at 10:13 by deflecting Claude Lapointe's
shot from the point high into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defenseman Andy Delmore sprained his right knee after
colliding with New York's Ted Drury late in the second period.
Delmore was helped off the ice and Drury was given a holding
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were without center Keith Primeau, who was scratched
after warmups. Primeau, who fractured a rib on Feb. 12, returned to
action at Boston on Saturday after missing nine games.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Fears More Rain, Flooding  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With fears of heavy rain again
looming, authorities warned thousands of displaced Mozambicans on
Sunday against returning to low-lying areas to search for what
remains of their homes and belongings.
</P>
<P>
   As the swollen Limpopo and Save rivers receded, rescue workers
and aid officials said the risk of drowning had diminished. What
now faced flood survivors was the scramble for food and clean
water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rescue phase is coming to a close,'' said Ross Mountain, a
U.N. special envoy who spent two days flying over still submerged
areas of the southeast African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Relief efforts focused instead on distributing aid to desperate
survivors, many of whom were still only accessible by air, said
Brenda Barton, a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   Fights broke out in camps as survivors, ravenous and thirsty
after being stranded in trees and on rooftops for up to a week,
clambered for food.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 37 helicopters and 15 planes delivered aid on Sunday,
mostly in the Limpopo River valley, 125 miles northeast of the
capital, Maputo, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Another two helicopters were ferrying stranded people to
locations where relief groups were attempting to distribute the
emergency supplies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring South Africa, 32 airmen from McGuire Air Force
Base in New Jersey and Dover Air Force Base in Delaware arrived at
Hoedspruit air base on Sunday to set up aid operations for up to
600 American troops.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain said many survivors were ignoring the pleas of aid
workers and government officials and returning to flood-battered
areas, raising the possibility they may need to be rescued again if
heavy rains and flooding resume.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of Cyclone Gloria, which together with a steady,
two-week downpour caused the deluge, has been downgraded to a
tropical storm. The storm hovered over the Indian Ocean off the
coast of Mozambique on Sunday, and was expected to bring more rain,
Mozambican weather forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the relief effort was gaining pace, President Joachim
Chissano said the international community had been slow to respond
to the catastrophe, an allegation the U.N. envoy denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does take time to get helicopters from Europe. We need to
be realistic,'' Mountain said. More than $40 million had already
been pledged for emergency relief and reconstruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chissano said people affected by the floods would need to be fed
for at least 10 months, until they could grow new crops. He also
said a minimum of $250 million would be needed for reconstruction
and pleaded with Mozambique's creditors to forgive the country's
foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers said they expected the death toll from the disaster
to soar into the thousands as water levels dropped and revealed the
mud-covered remains of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hunger was the most pressing concern on Sunday. An
estimated 250,000 people were crowded into 64 ill-equipped camps,
mostly in southern and central Mozambique. Aid workers reported
they were running out of clean water, increasing the risk of a
cholera outbreaks. Instances of malaria were said to have tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Trivedy, of the British charity Save the Children, said
relief was finally starting to reach the Save River valley, 625
miles north of Maputo. An estimated 15,000 people were in urgent
need of aid, and French, German and U.N. planes were delivering
relief supplies to the previously neglected area on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trivedy said 5,000 famished people had congregated next to a
church in the coastal town of Nova Mambone. Between 4,000 and 5,000
more were requesting food at a church mission farther inland, while
about 1,600 had made their way to aid camps, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine British boat crews headed to the central town of
Beira to help deliver aid to flood survivors in the Save River
valley.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen crew members and four rescue boats from Dade County in
Florida were expected to start delivering aid Monday in the Limpopo
River valley.

Jet Skids Off Runway in California
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A Southwest Airlines 737 jet carrying an undisclosed
number of passengers skidded off the end of a runway Sunday and onto a nearby
street, nearly slamming into a gas station. At least one car was hit by the
plane, but it was not immediately clear if there was a motorist inside, FOX News
Channel reported. It was not immediately clear if there were any injuries. The
plane just missed a Chevron station and skidded to a halt on Hollywood Way,
blocking traffic. An eyewitness said about 75 passengers departed the plane.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting to stay alive in the presidential race, Democrat
Bill Bradley is foundering across the board, while Republican John McCain is
doing well in New England but is threatened by George W. Bush almost everywhere
else. The presidential nomination races head for a climactic multistate showdown
Tuesday. Bradley advisers acknowledged he has little chance of loosening the
vice president's grip on every ''Super Tuesday'' state. The McCain team held out
hope for an election night surprise.

Israel Cabinet OKs Lebanon Pullback
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Lebanon's government welcomed the Israeli Cabinet's
decision today to withdraw troops from southern Lebanon by July, but said it
would prefer that the move come as part of a settlement to bring peace to the
last active Arab-Israeli war front. In 1985, Israel set up an occupied buffer
zone in Lebanon near the northern Israeli border to protect its border towns
from guerrilla attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said since he took
office last May that he would withdraw, and Sunday's unanimous Cabinet decision
backed him up. The decision came as fighting raged in southern Lebanon.

Army Will Limit Overseas Duty

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new Army policy that limits overseas duty to six months
for members of the National Guard and Reserve also will apply to active duty
soldiers, a spokesman said today. Reservists currently are deployed abroad for
up to nine months -- the maximum allowed by federal law. Active duty units
normally rotate after six months, but the service has set no official time limit
until now. Spokesman Col. Edwin Veiga said Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric
Shinseki will formally disclose the policy Tuesday.

U.S. Envoy Meets Sudanese Official

   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan's foreign minister said Sunday he hopes the
visit of a special envoy from the United States will hasten normal relations
between the two countries, which have been sour for more than a decade. Mustafa
Osman Ismail's meeting with Harry Johnston on Saturday was the first encounter
between senior American and Sudanese officials since 1998, when the United
States bombed a Khartoum pharmaceutical plant it said was producing ingredients
for chemical weapons. The manufacturer said the plant made vaccines and
medicines. The United States has withdrawn its ambassador and imposed limited
sanctions on Sudan, accusing it of supporting terrorism and an appalling human
rights record. Sudan denies the charges.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice found his game with 23 points and a season-high
10 rebounds as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Miami Heat 93-80 today for their
15th consecutive victory. The Lakers are just the third team in NBA history to
record two winning streaks of 14 games or more in a season. They won 16 in a row
during December and January, and it seems likely they'll equal that mark against
the lowly Clippers on tomorrow night. Shaquille O'Neal added 17 points and 11
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels, Russians Clash  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALKHAZUROVO, Russia (AP) -- Rebels slipped past Russian lines,
moved down muddy slopes through a Chechen gorge, and clashed Sunday
with federal troops in the foothills -- despite Russian claims to
control the region.
</P>
<P>
   A group of at least 70 rebels fled mountain hideouts and had
almost reached the village of Komsomolskoye near the entrance to
the Argun Gorge when they ran into Russian troops, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers fled in panic. Many huddled for hours on a nearby
highway while Komsomolskoye and surrounding fields came under
intense artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the Russian military said it had killed several
rebels and forced the rest back into the mountains. Officials said
it was safe for residents to return. Several wounded civilians were
brought to a hospital in the town of Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-year of bombing and shelling Chechnya, Russia
claims to have occupied most of the separatist republic, including
former rebel strongholds around the Argun Gorge. But the Chechens
are still capable of launching guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guerrilla war is inevitable,'' Akhmet Zakrizhiyev, a
41-year-old resident of the village of Nizhiy Gerzel, said Sunday.
''We want peace on our land. They have no way out, talks will have
to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya has been plagued by crime and violence since the end of
a 1994-96 separatist war that left the republic with de facto
independence. Russian troops entered Chechnya again after
Chechen-based militants invaded the neighboring Russian republic of
Dagestan last August.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has managed this
war in Chechnya since Moscow launched it in September, has said he
would not hold peace talks. In a BBC interview aired Sunday, Putin
said that Russian victory was within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me that organized opposition is practically
impossible from this moment on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Chechnya, the military press center acknowledged Sunday
that the situation was ''being complicated by the fact that small
groups of rebels are moving into populated areas,'' according to
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of fighters tried to flee the Argun Gorge on
Sunday through a rough back road leading toward Komsomolskoye, but
was stopped by a column of troops hiking up the slopes in the other
direction, a Russian officer said. The officer, who would not give
his name, said the Russians suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   Federal casualties have mounted sharply in the last few days.
Top Russian commander Gennady Troshev said Sunday that 31
paratroopers were killed in an attack on Friday. A rebel ambush on
Thursday killed between 20 and 37 federal troops. Russian news
reports have cited even higher losses recently, but commanders have
denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Russian warplanes and artillery continued to target rebels
hiding in dozens of villages between the Argun and Vedeno gorges,
which cut south from Russian-occupied regions in the north to the
few remaining rebel-controlled territories in the mountains. The
military command press center said bands of rebels in villages
between the gorges were trying to establish communications to
coordinate a mass breakout into the lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The military command said six rebels had been captured in the
fighting near the Argun Gorge since Saturday, and 50 more people
were being held while they were investigated for ''membership in
bandit groups,'' Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces in Chechnya routinely seize fighting-age Chechen
men, accusing them of being militants. Many are sent to detention
camps, where inmates claim they are beaten and tortured to extract
confessions. Russian officials deny the torture allegations,
despite increasing international pressure to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (Russians) see a militant and a guerrilla in everyone. I
don't allow my husband to go out in the streets. I'm afraid he will
be detained,'' said Zhanna Kiorzayeva, 25, who sells bread at a
market in Chechnya's second-largest city, Gudermes.

<HEADLINE> US Troops Pitch Tents for Filipinos  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANISLAG, Philippines (AP) -- U.S. soldiers pitched tent shelters
Sunday to relieve overcrowding at evacuation centers where tens of
thousands of people have been living to escape a volcano that began
erupting last month.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster relief officials have been busy feeding more than
66,000 people and preventing diseases from spreading at the centers
in the wake of a series of powerful eruptions by Mayon volcano,
which remained relatively quiet for a fourth day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Working side by side with Filipino troops, about 30 U.S.
soldiers hammered tents into place while throngs of evacuees
watched in a clearing in Anislag village in Albay province.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military contingent, led by Navy Capt. Bob Harward,
brought the tents, bottled water, mats and 20,000 gas masks, funded
by a $418,000 donation from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The American soldiers were among more than 2,000 U.S. troops who
had joined the monthlong joint military exercises -- called
Balikatan, or ''shouldering the load together'' -- in the
Philippines that ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tied in with the Balikatan because the same counterparts
we have been training with, learning how to fight, can show their
flexibility in quickly transitioning into humanitarian
operations,'' Harward said.
</P>
<P>
   A convoy of army trucks brought the relief cargo from two U.S.
C-130 planes to Anislag. There, U.S. troops, Philippine soldiers
and police, some wearing yellow hard hats and orange vests,
unloaded the relief goods as smiling evacuees milled around.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said up to 3,000 people could be accommodated in the
tents.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said they would transfer some
of the evacuees sheltered in grade school buildings to the tents to
allow classes to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado denied newspaper reports that food supplies were running
low in the evacuation centers, citing as an example rice stocks in
Albay, which he said are good for another six months.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has allocated $525,000 for disaster
relief, mostly to buy food and medicine for evacuation sites in
Albay, about 215 miles southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Mayon, which is famous for its conical shape, began erupting on
Feb. 24, belching red hot rocks and ash high into the sky. Last
week, a series of powerful explosions rained ash on several
villages, forcing more people into evacuation centers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Corpuz of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
Seismology said it was still hard to predict what Mayon would do in
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The 8,118-foot Mayon has been restive since June. Its most
violent eruption, on Feb. 1, 1814, killed more than 1,200 people
and buried an entire town in mud.

<HEADLINE> Californians To Vote on Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The pastor of St. Andrew's
Presbyterian Church told his congregation Sunday that he welcomes
gay people into his church. But he doesn't want them marrying.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Huffman Jr. said he supports Proposition 22, the
controversial measure on Tuesday's ballot that would bar gay
marriages from official recognition in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Love the sinner, hate the sin,'' Huffman said. ''I am not
prepared to declare that what the Bible says is sin is no longer
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   With the election just two days away, churchgoers around
California struggled with how to vote on a measure that has
galvanized and divided the religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Mormon, Roman Catholic and evangelical Christian
churches support Proposition 22. Three Southern California bishops
-- Episcopal, Lutheran and Methodist -- issued a joint statement
opposing it, saying it could lead to discrimination. On Friday, the
Roman Catholic priest who heads the Los Angeles Archdiocese's
ministry to gays and lesbians also publicly opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman titled his sermon ''The Bible, Homosexuality and
Proposition 22.''
</P>
<P>
   ''God called his people to sexual purity -- a man and a woman
committed to each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Church elders at St. Andrew's voted last month to support
Proposition 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel, as Christians, we should be taking a stand on that, a
loving stand, and basically be supporting marriage between a man
and a woman,'' said Pam Metherell, 56, an elder.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was on the minds of 200 Mormons gathering at a
suburban Sacramento church for a monthly sacrament meeting. Church
member John Tennant urged the congregation to pray for Proposition
22's passage.
</P>
<P>
   In liberal San Francisco, a forum at an Episcopal church failed
to attract any proponents of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Mark Leno, who is gay, called the
proposition ''mean-spirited,'' pointing out that gay marriages
aren't allowed in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a completely bogus argument,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   California does not allow same-sex marriages, and that won't
change whether Proposition 22 passes or fails. The measure would
keep California from recognizing same-sex marriages allowed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No other state allows such marriages, but proponents argue
Vermont is close enough to make the initiative a necessary
preemptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   Measures similar to Proposition 22 have passed in 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot measure appears to have the support of voters, who
favored it by 13 percentage points in the latest Field Poll. The
margin of error was 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and
other prominent officials -- including President Clinton -- oppose
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Clergymen say marriage is central to organized religion. So
while religious leaders often refrain from weighing in on secular
politics, many are stepping forward now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be an abuse of my calling if I and others of my
calling failed to address this topic,'' Huffman said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Monday
morning in the absence of major market-moving news. Japan's
benchmark stock index edged higher.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.48 yen, down 0.18 yen from late Friday and
also below its late New York level of 107.87 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 43.55 points,
or 0.22 percent, to 19,971.09 at the end of the morning session. On
Friday, the average closed down 137.57 points, or 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar initially rose on the back of
Friday's U.S. stock rally, but later edged lower.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices rose on Wall Street Friday after the U.S. Labor
Department said the economy generated fewer jobs in February than
at any time in the previous nine months, and that the growth of
wages had slowed.
</P>
<P>
   That report helped allay investor concern over U.S. inflation
and diminished speculation over a possible interest rate increase
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar moved in a narrow range in early Asian trading Monday
as traders awaited fresh market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Economic Planning Agency will on March 13 release gross
domestic product data for October-December, a key indicator of the
nation's economic viability.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.78 yen, down
from 104.26 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rose supported by the Dow
Jones industrial average rise of 202.28 points, or 1.99 percent, to
10,367.20 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese average later pared some of its early gains on
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 1.49 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,685.00.
The TOPIX closed down 31.99 points, or 1.86 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in late morning trading. On Friday, it settled at 1.7900
percent and its price stood at 100.08.

<HEADLINE> Bush Planning More Fund-Raisers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush or his surrogates will
return to the fund-raising circuit this month to replinish coffers
drained by heavy spending, his finance chairman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans said the plan all along had been to raise more money,
but acknowledged it was made more necessary because of the
unexpectedly strong challenge mounted by Sen. John McCain..
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has scheduled five fund-raisers for March and
April, and is considering five to seven more, with a goal of
raising $5-10 million, said Evans.
</P>
<P>
   The events already scheduled will be in New York, New Jersey,
Michigan, Illinois and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on needs, the campaign may hold additional
fund-raising events before the Republican National Convention,
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor raised a record-shattering $70 million for
his campaign, but by Feb. 20 the campaign reported that was down
about $20 million cash on hand. By some estimates that figure has
dwindled to less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the campaign was not cash-strapped and that
additional fund-raising was always contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had always planned to go out in the spring to raise
additional money,'' Evans said. ''We didn't know how much.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Praise Each Other  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, sharing the stage with
fellow campaigner Hillary Rodham Clinton, told New Yorkers Sunday
that she was an accomplished woman long before her husband won the
White House -- or even the Arkansas governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of you may not know that her record of achievement and
commitment to excellence far antedates her service as first lady to
our country and first lady in Arkansas,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Mrs. Clinton appeared jointly at a Sunday night rally
at the 92nd Street YMHA, or Young Men's Hebrew Association. It was
only the second time since both became official candidates -- he for
the presidency, she for New York's open seat in the U.S. Senate --
that they appeared together on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been anyone who brought more integrity,more
intelligence, hard work, commitment and passion to the position of
vice president. There has never been anyone who has been more
effective for our country,'' Mrs. Clinton said in her glowing
introduction of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Adding that she wanted to ''say a personal word,'' the first
lady spoke of the team that he and his wife, Tipper, and she and
her husband, Bill, made in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, she said, is ''someone you can count on. He's there in the
good times and the not-so-good times. He's a friend, he's an
adviser, he's a counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   Flushed red in the face, Gore thanked Mrs. Clinton with a long,
tight hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before Bill Clinton was elected to office, Hillary Clinton was
already a distinguished attorney and soon was named one of the 100
best attorneys in the entire United States of America,'' Gore told
the audience of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Democrats to ''mobilize and work together'' for her
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''For 30 years now, she has been a fighter for children and
families and women and social justice and communities,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 1, Predators 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Guy Hebert made 33 saves for 26th career
shutout and Johan Davidsson scored hours after being promoted to
the NHL as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the Nashville Predators
1-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who has four shutouts this season, handed Nashville its
fifth straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks got some help on the game's only goal. Nashville's
Sergei Krivokrasov turned the puck over inside his own blue line
and Davidsson's shot from the left point got through Tomas Vokoun,
who was screened, with 2:50 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The goal ended a 42-game drought for Davidsson, dating to Dec.
9, 1998 when he scored twice against Vancouver. He has four goals
in 65 career NHL games and tallied nine goals and 30 assists in 55
contests this season for Cincinnati of the AHL.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim left wing Paul Kariya missed his seventh consecutive
game because of a bruised right foot, leaving the Predators free to
shadow Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 72nd time that Selanne has played without Kariya
since joining the Ducks in Feb. 1996, and the 30th time he has
failed to record a goal or an assist. In eight games without Kariya
this season, Selanne has been held pointless six times.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators, whose last six defeats have been by one goal,
have dropped 11 of 13. Nashville was shut out for the fourth time
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The loss capped a frustrating four-day stay in California for
the second-year expansion team. They built a 3-1 lead at San Jose
on Friday night, only to lose 4-3 after getting just two shots on
net in the final 35 minutes. The Predators lost in overtime to Los
Angeles on a goal that deflected off defenseman Drake Berehowsky's
stick.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Predators came to scoring was when Berehowsky
hit the right post with a one-timer midway through the first
period.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Sergei Fedorov scored the tiebreaking goal in the
second period and added a short-handed tally 10:01 later to send
the Detroit Red Wings to a 5-3 victory over the Dallas Stars on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Goals by Fedorov and Pat Verbeek in a 1:38 span of the second
period helped the Red Wings gain a split of the four-game season
series with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   After Fedorov made it 2-1 at 9:43 of the second, Verbeek, who
played for the Stanley Cup champions last season, gave the Red
Wings a two-goal lead with his 18th at 11:21. Verbeek came in on a
two-man break and fired Steve Yzerman's pass past Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov, playing his second game since a five-game layoff with a
thumb injury, helped the Red Wings improve to 4-1-1 in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas rookie Brenden Morrow's 13th goal at 14:04 of the second
trimmed Detroit's advantage to 3-2. But Fedorov's short-handed
tally at 19:22, his 19th goal of the season, restored the Red
Wings' two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Gavey notched a power play goal for the Stars with 16
seconds left in the second to make it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Brendan Shanahan scored his 34th goal into an empty net with
14 seconds left to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano scored his 342nd career goal in the first period,
tying him with Brian Bellows for the Stars' franchise record.
Modano also assisted on Morrow's goal to give him 800 career
points.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got the game's first goal, 4:41 in, when Modano converted
Jamie Langenbrunner's centering pass. Detroit tied it 1-1 at 12:01,
on the power play, when Nicklas Lidstrom's shot from the top of the
right circle got by Belfour, who was screened.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk returned to the lineup after
he missed one game with a left knee injury that was thought to be
much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas penalty killer Guy Carbonneau bruised his wrist in the
second period and did not return. The Stars were also missing
injured players Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Blake Sloan, Shawn
Chambers and Brian Skrudland.

   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Patrik Elias scored with 11:03 left in
the third period to cap the New Jersey Devils' rally from a
two-goal deficit for a 2-2 tie with the Calgary Flames on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Elias scored his team-leading 28th goal over Fred Brathwaite off
a pass from Scott Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   The goal came less than a minute after Martin Brodeur had closed
his pads to thwart Valeri Bure on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur preserved the tie in the waning seconds of regulation,
sprawling to stop a breakaway by Jarome Iginla with 10 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez had the best chance in overtime, getting a breakaway with
two minutes left only to have Brathwaite stick out his right pad to
stop the first shot as well as the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla extended his point streak to an NHL season-high 16 games
with an assist on Marc Savard's first-period goal. Iginla, who has
12 goals and 14 assists in the stretch, tied Gary Suter and Gary
Roberts for the Flames' franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott had the other goal for New Jersey, 2-5-1 in its
last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Morris scored for Calgary, unbeaten in five games (3-0-2).
Savard's goal extended his points streak to 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames pulled even with the San Jose Sharks for eighth place
in the Western Conference. Calgary also moved within two points of
seventh-place Colorado, setting up a key home game with the
Avalanche on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott made it 2-1 on a power play at 11:56 of the second.
Brendan Morrison beat Clarke Wilm on a faceoff and drew the puck
back to Arnott, whose slap shot from the blue line beat Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Morris put the Flames ahead 2-0 at 6:26 of the second when,
shortly after a Devils penalty, he fired a knuckler from the blue
line that went through a crowd and past Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey center Petr Sykora missed his third straight game
with the flu.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett had 21 points, 13 rebounds and
seven assists on a tender left ankle as the Minnesota Timberwolves
outlasted the Seattle SuperSonics 105-100 in overtime Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon had 20 points and 11 assists for Minnesota,
which blew a 20-point second-half lead, but won for the seventh
time in eight games. Malik Sealy added 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton had 34 points, including 17 during a fourth-quarter
surge for the SuperSonics, who lost for the fourth time in six
games. Payton added 12 assists and Vin Baker, playing in his 500th
career game, scored 20 to break the 9,000-point mark.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett briefly left at 2:18 of the third quarter when he
aggravated a left-foot sprain. It was the same scenario as Saturday
night, when Garnett left in the third at Milwaukee with the same
injury.
</P>
<P>
   With the Wolves' star in the locker room, Seattle made a furious
comeback. Trailing 77-61, Seattle used a 12-4 run at the start of
the fourth to close to 81-73. It was the closest the Sonics had
been since 10:08 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's two free throws at 5:02 brought Seattle to 83-80, but
Garnett was back to score the next three points.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Szczerbiak's sixth straight point, with 17.8 seconds left,
gave Minnesota a 92-88 lead. But Emanual Davis followed with a
3-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   After Sealy made two free throws, Payton hit a 3-pointer with
7.1 seconds left to tie it at 94. It was the first tie of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett missed a jumper at the end of regulation to send it into
overtime, in which he led Minnesota with four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves started the game on a 13-0 run, highlighted by
Sealy's one-handed fast-break dunk at 7:27.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, meanwhile, looked like a team playing its fifth road
game in seven nights. The SuperSonics missed their first six shots
and had four turnovers in the first six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon scored 13 points in the first quarter as the Wolves took
a 27-14 lead. Minnesota continued to dominate in the second, taking
a 52-35 lead into the break.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's 3-pointer with five minutes left in the third gave
Minnesota its biggest lead, 67-47.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota is 11 games over .500 for the first time in
franchise history. ... The Sonics return home to play Dallas on
Tuesday, following a 2-3 road trip. ... Despite the loss, the
Sonics have a 15-4 all-time record at Target Center. ... Garnett
returned with 7:47 left in the fourth. ... Szczerbiak celebrated
his 23rd birthday Sunday. ... Sam Mitchell missed his ninth
straight for the Wolves with a sprained left ankle. ... Minnesota

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Lamond Murray had 20 points and nine rebounds as
the Cleveland Cavaliers won their third consecutive road game with
a 100-92 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller had nine assists and scored nine of his 15 points
in the fourth quarter for the Cavaliers, who had lost 11 straight
road games before winning at Chicago, the Los Angeles Clippers and
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was only 5-for-16 from the field, but 9-for-11 from the
free-throw line, and Miller was 3-for-3 shooting in the final
quarter for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel had 20 points and 16 assists, and Chris Gatling
and Raef LaFrentz each had 16 points and 10 rebounds for Denver,
which has lost four straight to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers put the game away in the fourth quarter holding
the Nuggets to 32 percent shooting (7-for-22). Denver was scoreless
over the final 2:31 while Cleveland made 9 of 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Denver took a 77-75 lead into the fourth quarter, but Bob Sura
sank a 3-pointer and scored five points in the first 5:14 of the
quarter to give Cleveland an 87-85 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's five points, including a 3-pointer with 4:41 left,
got the Nuggets to 89-88, but Miller answered with two off-balance
shots, both in Van Exel's face to keep the Cavaliers ahead 93-90.
</P>
<P>
   After LaFrentz missed a 3-pointer, Sura found Shawn Kemp alone
for a breakaway dunk. George McCloud's basket made it 95-92 at
2:31, but Antonio McDyess and LaFrentz fouled out 16 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hit three free throws and Murray two in the last 1:19 to
seal the win.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 51-51 at the half, Kemp hit his first two
shots and two free throws early in the third quarter to give
Cleveland a 59-57 lead, but the Nuggets went to its reserves when
McDyess drew his fourth foul to go ahead 67-63 as Gatling scored
five points over three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   McCloud and Van Exel hit 3s to put the Nuggets ahead 77-72, but
a free throw by Andrew DeClercq and a jump shot by Danny Ferry cut
Denver's lead to two in the last minute of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Two early fouls on Kemp limited his playing time to seven
minutes in the first quarter, but Murray's nine points helped the
Cavaliers lead 27-22 after one quarter. Denver made only 9 of 29
shots and missed all four 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets' shooting picked up slightly in the second quarter,
but backup Keon Clark scored four points on two jump shots and
Gatling, another reserve, had five points to keep them within
striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel tied the game with a 3-pointer in the first half, and
18 seconds later, McCloud's two free throws gave Denver its first
lead -- 51-49 with 1:04 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Miller tied it with a reverse layup for Cleveland, which hit
only 7 of 18 in the second quarter, in the final minute before
intermission.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The teams didn't meet last season. ... Cleveland is 6-11 on
the second night of back-to-back games. ... Denver is 11-10 against
Eastern Conference teams. ... Denver had held five straight
opponents under 100 points. ... Murray is 10-for-17 on 3-pointers
in his last six. ... James Posey was back for Denver after missing
one game with a contusion in his right fibula.
