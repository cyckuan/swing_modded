<HEADLINE> Palestinian Envoy Criticizes Israeli Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to
Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh said today hardline Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's attempts to create a climate of war in the
middle east demonstrates his lack of understanding of the new
political world order.
</P>
<P>
Halimeh was commenting on possibilities of Israel resourting
to a military offensive against the Palestinian State to divert
attention from the current stalemate in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would be disastrous, he said, warning that "he
(Netanyahu) would be making a mistake if he starts a war."
</P>
<P>
"The time for war is over. What is required is to negotiate
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Early this week Palestinian President Yasser Arafat hinted
Netanyahu, who was swept to power last June, could resort to war
to break out of the current political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Halimeh appealed to the world to continue pressing Netanyahu
and convincing him that peace and co-existence were the only
options.
</P>
<P>
Halimeh also said the United States had lost its leverage over
Netanyahu, despite the fact it hosted last month's summit that
failed to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is like a ballet dancer trying to show
everyone how good it is at dancing yet achieving nothing. They
have completely lost influence over the issue," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Lions Wins Inaugural Professional Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tyrone Doleman scored first two
points of the Inaugural Men's Basketball Professional League in
China while former NBA player Mike McGee's had 33 points to lead
the hosts Beijing Lions to a 126-111 win over the Shanghai Nanyang
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In front of 4,000 fans at the Beijing Collegiate Gymnasium, the
slam dunk performances from American players of both teams became
the game's highlights of the match as those players contributed
most -- at least 80 percent -- in scoring and rebounds to their
respective team.
</P>
<P>
"We lost to them becaust their inside was too strong," said Yu
Yuanxi, caoch of the Shanghai Nanyang. "Their (American players)
socring and rebound ability is much better than us. If we could
stop them there we might have a chance to win."
</P>
<P>
Nanyang, which led by Guard Pay Kelly's 22 points, took a 25-21
lead after the first 12 minutes. But they trailed 45-51 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
The Lions took over the lead 27-25 at the 14th minute with
Doleman's layup under basket and then they never looked back.
</P>
<P>
Doleman scored 18 of his 32 points in the first half. But it
was McGee, who won the NBA champions in 1982 and 1985 when he was
representing the Lakers, to help Lions keep going ahead with five
of six three-pointers in the last 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jian was the top scorer among the Chinese players
involved in the match with 19 points, and his American teammate
Steve Leary added 18.
</P>
<P>
Former Chinese international Sun Fengwu, now head coach and
player of the Lions, led his Chinese teammates with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
The eight-team Men's Basketball Prefessional League will play a
home-and-away format with double rounds in the regular season and
best-of-four games format in the top four team play-offs.
</P>
<P>
The new league, which will conclude next February, will pose a
challege to the 12-team Chinese first division league which ends
next April.

<TEXT>

<P>
Washington, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking to quell controversy over the Democratic Party's
fund-raising practices, President Clinton Friday proposed to ban
political contributions by noncitizens and reiterated his support
for a range of other changes in campaign finance law that he
has endorsed in the past but never pressed hard for.
</P>
<P>
-- With two former Republican presidents in tow, Bob Dole began
the last march of his of his campaign Friday. Dole, in a new
proposal, also called for abolishing political action committees.
</P>
<P>
-- The FBI, exasperated by a lack of cooperation, has withdrawn
agents send to Saudi Arabia to investigate a terrorist bombing that
killed 19 Americans there, reflecting serious strains of relations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Aviation Administration ordered emergency tests
on all Boeing 737 airliners after a rudder control jammed in a lab
experiment.
</P>
<P>
-- Top officials of the Democratic National Committee
acknowledged yesterday that they failed to adequately scrutinize who
was giving them money but said they have taken steps to prevent
questionable contributions in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Telecommunications PLC is negotiating to buy MCI
Communications Corp. of the District in an estimated 20 billion
dollar deal that would rank as one of the largest mergers in history.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Boeing Ordered to Test Rudders on All 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 2 (Xinhua) -- All Boeing 737 airliners
flying around the world will be tested under the order of the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a laboratory experiment
shows problems on the rudder control system.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing company issued a service bulletin directing a test
of the rudder control system on each of the 2,700 Boeing 737s now
in service around the world within 10 days. Tests will be made
again each time a plane has flown 250 hours.
</P>
<P>
The FAA order, announced Friday night, was in response to a
recent finding by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
The NTSB tests found that the flow of unusually hot hydraulic
fluid into a chilled metal part could jam the 737's rudder.
</P>
<P>
With the finding, investigators are trying to get the answer of
the 737 crash in 1994. The USAir 737 crashed on September 8, 1994,
at Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The same mechanism might also explain the crash of a United
Airlines 737 in Colorado Springs in March 1991, whose cause is
also unknown, The New York Times said today.
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the planes suddenly plunged to the ground
without their pilots having reported any malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
But the FAA said the inspection order does not suggest that
rudder failure caused the crashes.

<HEADLINE> Lagardere Hits Out at Opposition to Daewoo Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Luc Lagardere, boss of the
Matra-Hachette group, today hit out at the growing number of
opponents to the sale of Thomson Multimedia, the civilian arm of
state-owned electronics giant Thomson, to South Korea's Daewoo
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
The plan to sell Thomson Multimedia to an Asian company has
raised strong opposition from left and right-wing politicians and
trade unions who are already angry at the government's plan to
sell the debt-ridden Thomson group to Matra-Hachette for a
symbolic one franc.
</P>
<P>
"There is a racist aspect that all the world has seen,"
Lagardere said in an interview with La Figaro newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He accused critics of being hostile to any newcomer to "the
playground for older pupils," even though big state companies
are losing money heavily.
</P>
<P>
Thomson is struggling under a 14 billion-franc (2.8 billion
U.S. dollar) debt. The government has recommended the state inject
2.1 billion dollars into the group and then dispose of it for one
franc to Matra-Hachette.
</P>
<P>
Matra-Hachette plans to sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo and
to combine its defense electronics arm, Thomson CSF, with Matra
Defense Espace already owned by Lagardere.
</P>
<P>
Lagardere said, "The Koreans have shown dynamism, an ability to
develop products for the public. They have created thousands of
jobs in Asia, the United States and Europe."
</P>
<P>
He said Daewoo was the only big electronics company that agreed
to put money into Thomson Multimedia. All potential European
purchasers had rejected the offer because of the group's dire
financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo has said that acquiring and recapitalizing the company
will initially cost about 10 billion francs (2 billion dollars) in
its first two years of ownership. It has also pledged to keep on
all the company's staff and create 5,000 more jobs in France in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist Party, some right-wing parties and many
trade unions, who are against the privatization plan are
especially opposed to the sale of Thomson Multimedia to an Asian
company. There are fears that the purchase would enable Daewoo to
penetrate the European and United States electronic markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Agence France Presse, Lagardere said today that
his group and Daewoo would invest more than 26 billion francs (5.2
billion U.S. dollars) in Thomson as soon as their takeover bid was
approved by the government.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Tourism Hit by Poor Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's once booming tourist
industry suffered a setback this year as the number of foreigners
visiting the country barely rose above last year, due to low
quality and high costs, local media said today.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign tourists arriving in Vietnam in 1996 is
estimated to only match the 600,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said 63 percent of those travelers who did come
to Vietnam left earlier than scheduled complaining of the high cost
and low quality of services.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance was attributed to management, specifically
the lack of qualified guides, dull travel itineraries and
unscrupulous competition between travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's largest city, Ho Chi Minh city was a notable
example. In 1995, the city earned 247 million U.S. dollars from 1
million foreign tourists and 1.2 million domestic travelers.
</P>
<P>
But in the first nine months of 1996, the city only recorded
earnings of 180 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism took off in Vietnam in the mid-1980s as the country
opened its doors to the outside world. The number of foreign
tourists to Vietnam has increased five fold for the past five
years while earnings have risen eight fold.
</P>
<P>
But, the news reports said, the country still needs to improve
standards of management and services if it is to match the
attractions of neighboring Thailand.

<P>
There is no question that it is an honor to be a member of the
Selection Committee, Qian said, attributing the smooth completion
of the organization work in setting up the Selection Committee to
the support and participation of the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Those not chosen as members of the Selection Committee due to
the limited number of positions are praiseworthy for their deep
feelings for the motherland and Hong Kong and for their spirit of
participation, Qian added.
</P>
<P>
On relations between the Central Government and the Hong Kong
SAR after China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong is
resumed, Qian noted that there are special stipulations in the
second chapter of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that no department of the Central Government or
provinces, regions, and municipalities will intervene in affairs
that are under Hong Kong's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Inland people in Hong Kong, including soldiers stationed there,
must abide by Hong Kong's laws, while people of Hong Kong who come
to inland areas should observe the laws here, too, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that neither side should judge or set demands on
the other with its own system and law as a standard or interfere
in the internal affairs of the other for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we meant in the past by the saying that 'well
water and river water do not get into each other'", Qian explained.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the resumption of China's exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong is a great event for the Chinese nation as a whole
in wiping out historical humiliation.
</P>
<P>
The prosperity of the motherland and the long-term stability
and prosperity of Hong Kong represent the common aspiration of all
Chinese people, including the Hong Kong compatriots, he said,
adding that "we are full confidence in looking to the future."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all members of the Preparatory
Committee will persist in their efforts and make further
contributions in "the great cause of greeting the return of Hong
Kong."
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the Preparatory Committee Wang Hanbin presided
over the closing ceremony today.

<HEADLINE> Everything in HK to Follow Law: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that everything in Hong Kong should be done
in accordance with the law after 1997. Everyone has rights and
freedom that are guaranteed by laws, and their actions must
conform to standards of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The laws he was referring to are Hong Kong laws, Qian pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
In his closing speech at the Sixth Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Qian said that, since Sino-British negotiations
started in 1982, the Chinese government has always dealt with the
Hong Kong question in accordance with the principle of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with the "Asian Wall Street Journal",
Qian said that he had noted that some activities in Hong Kong
after July 1, 1997 must comply with the "one country, two systems"
principle and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Some coverage of his remarks aroused concern among some people,
who mistakenly thought that some new statements had been made. In
fact, he noted, he had said that the Basic Law has stipulations
for every type of right and freedom of Hong Kong residents,
including the freedom of speech, the press, and publishing; the
freedom to associate, to assemble, to have a procession, and to
demonstrate; the freedom to form and join trade unions, and to
strike; the freedom of conscience; and so on.
</P>
<P>
Article 23 of of Chapter two of the Basic Law says that the
Hong Kong SAR will enact laws on its own prohibiting acts of
treason, secession, sedition, subversion of the Central People's
Government, theft of state secrets, and to prohibit foreign
political organizations or bodies from conducting political
activities in the region, and to prohibit political organizations
or bodies of the region from establishing ties with political
organizations or bodies in foreign countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Are these stipulations of the Basic Law self-contradictory? Of
course not. The Basic Law can only be implemented in a complete
way when it is completely understood," Qian stressed.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on freedom of the press, Qian said it
should certainly be protected by law, but stressed that "I don't
think spreading rumors and making personal attacks is some sort of
freedom of the press. The law does not explicitly prohibit
spreading rumors and making personal attacks, but at the same time
these things cannot be protected by the law."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, "the judgment of the right and the wrong
has objective criteria and each type of business must conform to
its professional code of ethics."

<HEADLINE> More Drug-Related Deaths Occur in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- A young man was found dead in a
central Athens telephone booth at the weekend and police have said
the death appeared to be drug-related.
</P>
<P>
"He was standing in the booth with the receiver hanging behind
his back," one eyewitness reported.
</P>
<P>
This case is just the latest in the long list of drug-related
deaths that have occurred so far this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's Public Order Ministry, the number of
deaths related to drugs in Greece this year through September 30
exceeded 160.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 120 have been reported in greater Athens area.
Another 11 deaths are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the total number of drug-related deaths in the country
was 176. In 1994, the figure stood at 146, in 1993 it was 78 and
in the early 1980s, the number of drug deaths did not exceed 10
per year.
</P>
<P>
Marina Papadi, a psychiatrist at a drug rehabilitation center
in Athens, told the local press that the dramatic rise in
drug-related deaths over the past six years was caused by several
factors, including the influx of poor quality drugs on the market
and easier access to drugs in general. She also said, "Drugs have
become a way of life for many young people."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are over 15,000 drug users in the
greater Athens area alone.
</P>
<P>
According to surveys conducted by the Greek Mental Health
Institute, most young people who become involved with drugs begin
taking them at a very young age. Specifically, the average age
that boys and girls start taking drugs is 15.5 years, while boys
start taking psychotropic drugs at the age of 14 and girls at 15.
The majority of these youths smoke marijuana and take pills before
switching to heroin.

<HEADLINE> MCI Expected to Merge With British Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 2 (Xinhua) -- MCI, the second-largest long
distance phone company in the United States, is expected to merge
with British Telecommunications, according to a report of the New
York Times today.
</P>
<P>
Executives from the two companies met at MCI headquarters in
Washington Friday to hammer out the final details of the merger.
If the acquisition is approved by the boards of both companies in
meetings today, it would be the first time that a foreign company
has taken control of a major American telephone company. Also it
would be the largest foreign takeover of any U.S. corporation, the
newspaper commented.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal, worth more than 22 billion U.S. dollars,
took place at a time of increasing demand for global
communications networks and when merger and acquisition are at a
record-setting pace throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
The British phone company, which has already owned 20 percent
of the MCI communications corporation since 1994, plans to buy the
remaining 80 percent. An outright merger would create a colossus
bestriding the Atlantic, with 38 billion U.S. dollars in annual
sales, 182,000 employees, 42 million business and residential
customers, and operations in 72 countries.
</P>
<P>
A BT-MCI deal would likely put pressures on other American and
foreign companies to forge new international parterships. But
analysts said that the bigger significance could be the new
financial influence that MCI would wield within the United States
as full-fledged competition breaks out in the local telephone
business.

<HEADLINE> BT Launches Biggest Deal in UK Corporate History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 2 (xinhua) -- British Telecom Friday night
launched the biggest takeover bid in British corporate history by
announcing that it was in talks with MCI, the American
communications giant, to seal a 14 billion pound (22.4 billion
U.S. dollar) deal.
</P>
<P>
The takeover, which would be the second biggest in world
history, would create a rival for American group AT/T as the
world's biggest telecommunications group.
</P>
<P>
BT is the UK's most successful privatized company, employing
128,000 people. One spin-off of the takeover will be that it will
take a stake in Rupert Murdoch's media empire News Corporation now
held by MCI through a series of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The merger was hatched in the greatest secrecy, and will be
voted on by the boards of BT and MCI over the weekend to be
followed by a formal announced early next week. Sources close to
the deal said Friday night that BT was "supremely confident" the
deal would go through.
</P>
<P>
News of the proposed takeover, 12 years after BT was privatized
by Margaret Thatcher's government, would cement its status as a
world power in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
A combined BT, whose stock market value is more than 22 billion
pounds (35.2 billion dollars), and MCI, which is worth l0.6
billion pounds (16.96 billion dollars), would easily rival AT/T's
market value of 34 billion pounds (54.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. telecommunications market has recently been
liberalized and deregulated by the Telecommunication Act l996
allowing much greater freedom in both local and long-distance
telephone services.
</P>
<P>
BT sources said it was this legislation which had enabled it to
put together the MCI merger. But a spokesman for the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission warned Friday night that it would take
several months to vet and approve the deal.

<HEADLINE> Sudan to Continue Friendly Relations with Uganda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sudan is determined to continue
friendly relations with Uganda under the peace agreement between
the two countries, Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammed
Taha said here today.
</P>
<P>
Taha made the remarks while meeting with his Iranian
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the talks
between the two sides focused on bilateral relations as well as
regional and international issues. They also discussed the latest
developments in Africa, Afghanistan and other troubled spots of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Taha underlined that Sudan was determined to implement the
provisions of the Iranian-brokered agreements between Sudan and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister asked for expansion of Iran's
cooperation with his country in electricity, road construction,
agriculture and oil fields.
</P>
<P>
In October, Sudan and Uganda reached an Iranian-brokered
formula to settle border disputes. The peace accord will be
officially signed by the foreign ministers of the three countries
in December.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda signed an agreement on normalizing relations
between the two countries following mediation by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during his trip to Africa in
September.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995 after it accused Khartoum of supporting rebels in the north
of the country.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with the visiting Sudanese foreign
minister, Velayati expressed hope that Iran's mediation would
bring stability and tranquility to east Africa. He stressed that
Iran will do its best to settle the existing problem between
Sudan and Uganda in an "honorable and fair" way.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Iran's readiness to boost Iranian-Sudanese economic
cooperation and to transfer its scientific and technical
experiences to Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Europe, S.Africa Consider Military Action in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 2 (Xinhua) -- European countries and South
Africa are planning a military-humanitarian action in eastern
Zaire to save more than 1 million refugees marooned in that area
where fighting is raging between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels
backed by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The French daily Le Monde said that European officials in
Brussels are pondering about the opportunity of an intervention in
the Great Lakes region to open a "human corridor" to rescue the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, France and Belgium will be the main contributors
to an intervention force, which can also be joined by other
African countries to be coordinated by the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean city of Goma Friday fell to the Tutsi Banyamulenge
rebels and all members of international humanitarian groups fled
the city today, leaving behind the refugees to a very dangerous
situation.
</P>
<P>
Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said today in
Brussels that such an action cannot succeed without the support of
African countries, according to the report by Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European Union envoy for the Great Lakes region Aldo
Ajello is intensifying contacts with African countries to use the
"Arusha mechanism" to help intervene in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Arap Moi has reportedly proposed to host a
conference to be attended by the heads of state in the region as
soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Some Iraqi Refugees in Iran Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran said today that more
than 10,500 Iraqi Kurdish refugees have returned to their home
country and another 75,000 still remain in the Iranian camps.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Husseini, Director General of the Interior Ministry,
said that Iran has provided all facilities, including foodstuffs
and other necessities, for the refugees who volunteered to return
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
In case the crisis continues in northern Iraq, he said, the
transfer of refugees from the buffer zone on border regions to
camps will be possible if only necessary facilities and credits
are provided by international organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran spent 70 billion rials (about 16.2 million
U.S. dollars) on construction of camps, erection of tents,
distribution of blankets, foodstuffs, garments and construction
of medical centers.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, only 15 billion rials (about 3.4 million
dollars) of this amount was financed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that at present 14 million dollars is needed to
construct shelters for the Iraqi Kurdish refugees currently
residing in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in
a recent meeting in Geneva has allocated 14.214 million dollars
for protection of refugees residing in Iran and 16.403 million
dollars for their return to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. does not allocate any budget to the
immigrants and refugees who are not accommodated at the camps.
</P>
<P>
The total credit allocated by the U.N. to the refugees
stationed at camps throughout the country stands at 43.513
million dollars next year, up by 8 million dollars compared with
that of the current year.
</P>
<P>
Out of 2.1 million refugees living in Iran, only 90,000 are
stationed at the camps, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides the credits allocated by international institutions,
more than 1 billion dollars of the general budget of the country
is spent on keeping the refugees.

CAIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are Business
Briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
to be held in Cairo on November 12-14 is a chance to promote
regional cooperation, Egyptian assistant Foreign Minister for
Economic Affairs Raouf Saad has said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will deal with the linkage between the peace
and economic development as well as businessmen role in economic
development, he was quoted today as saying by the local press.
</P>
<P>
He said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will inaugurate
the conference, adding that "Peace and Economic Development" is
the theme of the inaugural session of the conference, which
consists of 50 meetings to be held at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Saad noted that participants in the conference will make a
thorough examination of Palestinian economic woes.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The recent decision taken by the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) to ease controls on foreign currency deposits has
won applause from local bankers and gained momentum in Jordan's
financial market.
</P>
<P>
The moves were aimed at slashing foreign currency deposits
from 35 percent to 14 percent, easing restrictions on investing
those deposits and removing limits on foreign currency deposits
held by Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Previously, 35 percent of the total 3.4 billion U.S. dollars
of the foreign currency deposits in Jordanian banks were used to
be a mandatory fund to bolster the kingdom's hard-currency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
They also gave banks greater control over their short term
cash flow by introducing a degree of flexibility in the amounts
they are required to place every day with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank ruling allowed money in foreign currency
deposits to be invested in a wide range of financial
instruments, including margin trading and swaps, while banks were
only allowed to redeposit in U.S. dollar accounts in the past.
</P>
<P>
The currency liberalization measures, the first of its kind
since an economic crisis in 1988 when the kingdom imposed
restrictions on foreign currency dealings after finding itself
strained under 8.3 billion dollars in foreign debts accumulated
in the 1980s, has freed up to hundreds of millions of dollars
for investment.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian economy continues deteriorating
due to the continued closure imposed by Israel, according to a
U.N. report today.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) in the Palestinian
territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip declined nearly 20
percent between 1992 and 1996, said the report issued by Terje
Larsen, the U.N. special coordinator in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average unemployment rose from under 10
percent to the current rate of 30 percent because a large number
of Palestinian workers were barred from entering Israel to seek
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The real wage of the Palestinians has fallen about 20 percent
since 1995. The consumption declined about 10 percent due to the
rising unemployment and lower wages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- A technical committee which groups Syria, Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan and Turkey held meetings here today to consider

AMMAN -- The recent decision taken by the Central Bank of
Jordan (CBJ) to ease controls on foreign currency deposits has
won applause from local bankers and gained momentum in Jordan's
financial market.
</P>
<P>
The moves were aimed at slashing foreign currency deposits
from 35 percent to 14 percent, easing restrictions on investing
those deposits and removing limits on foreign currency deposits
held by Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
Previously, 35 percent of the total 3.4 billion U.S. dollars
of the foreign currency deposits in Jordanian banks were used to
be a mandatory fund to bolster the kingdom's hard-currency
reserves.
</P>
<P>
They also gave banks greater control over their short term
cash flow by introducing a degree of flexibility in the amounts
they are required to place every day with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The new central bank ruling allowed money in foreign currency
deposits to be invested in a wide range of financial
instruments, including margin trading and swaps, while banks were
only allowed to redeposit in U.S. dollar accounts in the past.
</P>
<P>
The currency liberalization measures, the first of its kind
since an economic crisis in 1988 when the kingdom imposed
restrictions on foreign currency dealings after finding itself
strained under 8.3 billion dollars in foreign debts accumulated
in the 1980s, has freed up to hundreds of millions of dollars
for investment.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Palestinian economy continues deteriorating
due to the continued closure imposed by Israel, according to a
U.N. report today.
</P>
<P>
The gross national product (GNP) in the Palestinian
territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip declined nearly 20
percent between 1992 and 1996, said the report issued by Terje
Larsen, the U.N. special coordinator in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average unemployment rose from under 10
percent to the current rate of 30 percent because a large number
of Palestinian workers were barred from entering Israel to seek
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The real wage of the Palestinians has fallen about 20 percent
since 1995. The consumption declined about 10 percent due to the
rising unemployment and lower wages, the report said.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- A technical committee which groups Syria, Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan and Turkey held meetings here today to consider
promoting electricity cooperation among them.
</P>
<P>
Syrian informed sources said the meetings were focused on
studying ways to implement a general trade agreement and
following up the execution of an agreement for linking the
electricity networks of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
The electricity networks of Syria, Jordan and Turkey are
expected to be linked together early next year, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
They said that the linkage of the electricity networks of
Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey is a prelude to the linkage
of the electricity networks of all Arab countries by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is suffering a shortage of electricity, pays
great attention to electricity cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria will start linking its electricity networks with Jordan
and Turkey at the beginning of next year and will finish doing
so by the end of the same year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the electricity lines and the transfer
stations due to be set up in Syria will cost 110 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks with Swedish Prime Minister (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of the talks, the two prime ministers briefed
each other on their domestic situations.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China, under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core,
has scored new achievements in various fields, including the
political stability and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Although there will be numerous difficulties encountered during
progress, China has the confidence to push forward the reform,
opening up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Li said that bilateral cooperation in various fields has
greatly advanced since the two countries forged diplomatic ties,
adding that Sweden is China's biggest trade partner in northern
Europe, and many Sweden-invested projects in China have been
profitable.
</P>
<P>
Businesses from the two countries will sign a number of
contracts and letters of intent, which, according to Li, will play
an important role in promoting bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's large-scale economic construction now
provides opportunities for the foreign business community,
including the Swedish, that China's policy for continuing to
attract overseas investment remains unchanged, and that China
welcomes more Swedish companies to conduct cooperation on the
basis of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that China values its relations with western and
northern European countries, including Sweden, and China believes
that these countries are a significant force for safeguarding
world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said China is glad to see that Sweden has become a
non-permanent member of the current UN Security Council, and that
China appreciates Sweden's policy on "one China."
</P>
<P>
China also appreciates Sweden's support for China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, and hopes that Sweden can continue
to play a positive role in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also exchanged opinions on regional and
international issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Race Debate Seems to Turn Around in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- After a bipartisan
parliamentary motion against racism on Wednesday, the public
support in Australia appeared to be turning against the
anti-immigration and anti-Aborigines' view of Independent MP
Pauline Hanson.
</P>
<P>
Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron today called for a lid
to be placed on the race debate, saying the issue was being
stirred up by a few "wackos" in the Australian community.
</P>
<P>
A survey taken after the parliament motion showed that support
for Hanson on talkback radio had declined from two-thirds to
one-third.
</P>
<P>
Herron said on the Nine Network's Sunday program this evening,
the debate about Asian immigration and government assistance to
Aborigines sparked by Hanson's maiden speech in the parliament had
gone on too long.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping up the issue is not going to help the Aboriginal
community, it's not going to help the Asian community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan motion put to the parliament by Prime Minister
John Howard and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, reaffirmed the
government's commitment to the right of all Australians to enjoy
equal rights and be treated with equal respect regardless of race,
color, creed or origin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia's tourism officials today called for a 25
million Australian dollars (20 million US dollars) rescue package
to repair any damage caused in Asian markets by the race debate.
</P>
<P>
They said that a number of Asian tour groups have already
canceled holidays in Australia because of the race debate.
</P>
<P>
The race debate was sparked by Hanson's maiden speech on
September 10, in which she warned that Australia risked being
swamped by Asians and called for an immediate halt to immigration
to help fight joblessness.

friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sweden is the first Western country to establish diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Persson said frequent exchanges of high-level visits between
the two countries have played an important role in promoting
mutual understanding and bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country appreciates China's support for
Sweden's non-permanent membership in the current UN Security
Council, and that Sweden expects to see the strengthening of
bilateral cooperation in the Council.
</P>
<P>
Persson said that China, with its political stability, rapid
economic development and established legal system, is prime for
attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bilateral economic and trade cooperation has
developed smoothly, and his current entourage includes many
important Swedish entrepreneurs, especially those from some
transnational companies.
</P>
<P>
These companies are involved in electricity generation,
automobile manufacturing, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals,
and they are willing to expand cooperation with China, Persson
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are broad prospects for bilateral
cooperation in the high-tech area.

Wen, also deputy director of the Science and Technology Leading
Group of the State Council, made the remarks at a meeting to mark
the 10th anniversary of the founding of the China Center of

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Outlines Plans for Future Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has outlined goals
for its economic expansion, which include new pillar industries,
further development of Pudong New Area, key infrastructure
projects, environment, housing and reform of state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources with the municipal government of this
largest metropolis of China said today that Shanghai has entered a
new period of economic development.
</P>
<P>
While promoting the development of existing industries, the
city will boost industries related to biological engineering,
medicine, environmental protection, and building materials.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Shanghai will step up information industry. It
will invest at least 45 billion yuan (5.4 billion US dollars) in
the sector in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the development of Pudong New Area, priority was
put on infrastructure in the first five years of 1990s. During the
remaining five years, the area will introduce some preferential
policies to quicken its development.
</P>
<P>
Business people from other parts of China are allowed to
participate in foreign trade business in the area, and overseas
businessmen are able to be engaged in financial, foreign trade and
bonded business.
</P>
<P>
Between 1996 and 2000, the entire investment in the city's
fixed assets will be no less than 1,000 billion yuan, about
one-third of which will be used in urban infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
At present, some airport, information, subway, railway, harbor
and highway projects are well under way.
</P>
<P>
To improve its environment in the course of economic expansion,
the city will put at least 40 billion yuan from this year up to
2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city will push forward the reform of its
state-owned enterprises, which will be revitalized through
strategic reshuffles by means of annexations, cooperation and
share-holding mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Enters New Era of High-Speed Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of China's largest
city said today that Shanghai has entered a new era of high
growth, thanks to the sharp increase in financial industries and
the steady growth of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi said today at an international consultation meeting
that Shanghai's economic growth rate has hit double digits since
1992, reaching 12.5 percent during the first nine months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this decade, the financial industry has
seen an annual average increase of 12.5 percent. The number
for the first nine months of this year increased to 18 percent
compared with the same 1995 period, 5.5 percentage point
higher than the city's GDP growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that a financial market system is being formed in
Shanghai with securities, monetary lending, foreign exchange and
insurance as its four pillars.
</P>
<P>
Of these, securities has been the most active; last year, its
business volume was over 310 billion yuan (more than 37 billion
U.S. dollars). The total volume of securities business from
January to September this year reached 457.47 billion yuan (over
55 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, there were 192 overseas-funded financial
organizations in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that after years of structural adjustment,
Shanghai's financial industry has become the backbone of the
city's economic development. The city's total industrial output
value from January to September this year increased by 15.4
percent, compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, high-tech industry maintained an increase rate of
over 30 percent. Automobile, electronic communication equipment,
iron and steel, and petro-chemical industries have claimed their
share of the market, and power station equipment made by Shanghai
occupies half of the national market.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that reform of state-owned enterprises in Shanghai has
been accelerated in the past few years. The state-owned
enterprises holding 80 percent state-owned property are
experimenting with the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 enterprises announced bankruptcy or merged with other
enterprises, while over 50 new large enterprises were
formed. Another 7,000 state-owned and collectively-owned small
enterprises were renovated under the cooperative holding system.

<HEADLINE> 660,000 Laid-off Workers in Shanghai Re-employed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 660,000 laid-off workers
in Shanghai have found new jobs during the past five years,
Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant achievement made by Shanghai in
transferring of workers among different trades during the process
of speeding up enterprise reform and readjusting the industrial
structure since the 1990s," Xu said at a meeting attended by 27
presidents and senior advisors from internationally-known
corporations.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the textile industry of China's largest
city has transferred 200,000 laborers out of the industry during
the past few years; at the same time, the service industry has
employed 100,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
"Even though great efforts have been made to re-employ more
laid-off workers, Shanghai is still facing great pressure," Xu
said, explaining that light industries, especially textiles, are
in the majority in the city, while the service sector remains weak.
</P>
<P>
Xu stressed that Shanghai must set up an effective system of
re-employment which includes policies, training and more channels
for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that with help from the municipal government, the
textile industry and other trades that need to transfer surplus
laborers have begun to set up re-employment service centers.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers will stay at the centers, rather than at home,
in order to receive job training and seek employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Re-employment is a major issue that has occurred in the
process of changing Shanghai's economic mode," Xu said, adding
that Shanghai plans to learn from the experiences of some
developed countries and regions that have faced the same
situation.

ISLAMABAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Democratic Front
(PDF), the coalition ruling party in Pakistan's Punjab province,

<P>
Eighty-five members from PDF delivered the requisition for

Chief Minister of Punjab today with the condition that he would
prove his majority in the 250-member provincial assembly within 10
days.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sixth G-15 Summit Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A three-day sixth summit of the
group of 15 developing countries (g-15) started here today with a
theme ''the current international trading system and prospects
for the promotion of trade among developing countries''.
</P>
<P>
Opening the G-15 summit here, Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said the Uruguay round accords created new rights and
obligations for members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, developing countries have faced formidable
obstacles in their efforts to domesticate the accords due to lack
of the requisite absorptive capacities, said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He launched a blistering attack on the WTO, saying the world
body is introducing new issues that threaten national sovereignty
while ignoring agreed principles that would improve the
international trading system.
</P>
<P>
An open, secure and predictable international trading system,
providing adequate access to export markets, is a key element in
sustaining the export-led growth of developing countries, said
the Zimbabwean president.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped this meeting will emerge with concrete
guidelines on increasing south-south trade.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, Indian Prime Minister h.d. Deve Gowda, Jamaican
Prime Minister Percival Patterson, and Senegalese Premier Habib
Thiam are among those attending the three-day trade promoting
summit.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, participants will assess the international
economic situation, discuss the promotion of south-south
cooperation and make significant strides toward strengthening
economic cooperation among its members.
</P>
<P>
Hosni Mubarak and Mahathir Mohamad also spoke at the opening
session of the summit which groups 16 developing countries
including Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Venezuela, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denies Locking on US Warplane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied a
U.S. statement that it had locked on a U.S. warplane patroling a
"no-fly" zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An official source from the Foreign Ministry was quoted by the
Iraqi News Agency as describing the U.S. allegations as totally
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The source added that no such incident had taken place in Iraqi
air space in the southern part of the country. He said that the
fabrication of such story is part of the U.S.-style propaganda in
the elections campaign.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq is fully committed to its own decision
on giving political actions a chance in response to a proposal by
several governments of friendly states, mainly Russia and France,
to handle the "illegitimate and illegal" no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said late Saturday that a U.S. Air Force F-16 fired
a missile at an Iraqi radar site after the jet was locked on
electronically while in the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zone imposed by the U.S and its gulf war allies in
southern Iraq was extended by the Americans after U.S. forces
launched two waves of missile attacks against military targets in
southern Iraq early September in retaliation for Iraq's military
intervention in the Kurdish-controlled northern area.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has decided to suspend its military
action against U.S. warplanes patrolling its no-fly zones in
accordance with the initiative of Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the U.S. air strikes Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein announced that Iraq no longer recognized the no-fly zones
imposed by the U.S. and its western allies and called on its air
defense forces to shoot the warplanes that violated Iraqi
airspace.

<HEADLINE> Mayor of Shanghai Solicits Advice from Entrepreneurs Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Xu Kuangdi, mayor of this
China's largest industrial and commercial center, said today that
Shanghai welcomes entrepreneurs from around the world to offer
suggestions to make Shanghai an international commercial and trade
center.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth time that Shanghai mayors held annual
meetings to seek advice from entrepreneurs worldwide on boosting
economic growth of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Shanghai saw rapid growth in its foreign trade,
and its commercial facilities underwent considerable improvements,
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total retail volume of the city's
consumer goods has been increasing by 23.8 percent every year
since 1990, and its import and export volume has been rising by
20.7 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
However, the weak linkage between the production and marketing
of goods turned out in Shanghai remains a critical problem
restraining the city's economic expansion, Xu noted.
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s to the 1970s, goods produced in Shanghai used to
take up 25 percent of market share in China's domestic market, now
the figure is only six percent.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, the phenomenon indicates that the economy in other
areas of China has achieved rapid development, on the other hand,
it shows that marketing methods in Shanghai are still not able to
meet the requirements of market economy, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the entrepreneurs can offer
successful experience to help reform and improve the city's
business operations.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 senior personnel from international corporations
in 12 countries attended the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, overseas entrepreneurs have provided valuable
suggestions to promote Shanghai's finance, urban communications
facilities, harbor construction, and the reform of state-run
enterprises.

He also urged the forestry department to plant more and cut
less trees, adding that Sichuan, located along the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River, should be more concerned with soil and water
erosion in the area.
</P>
<P>
After viewing the region's state-owned companies, such as
Panzhihua Iron and Steel Plant and the Changhong Electronics Co.,
Zhu said that these enterprises have many of advantages.
</P>
<P>
The keys to invigorating such enterprises are contingents of
good cadres and a spirit of self-reliance, he said, adding that
the success of these two companies is the result of their own hard
work, which proves that state-owned companies can be enlivened.
</P>
<P>
Changhong is located in an inland area where transport,
information and market conditions are not as good as those of
coastal companies, but it has become China's largest color TV base
by relying on arduous work, correct policies, good management and
constant technology development, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Technological transformation and annexing of other companies
also helped Changhong's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu criticized some companies for their poor management, and
pointed out that strict supervision is necessary to help companies
solve their problems.

<P>
CHENGDU, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Poor areas should list the
establishment of basic farmland and the elimination of food and
clothing shortages as priorities in the remainder of this century,
Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said during an inspection tour of
Sichuan Province from October 25-31.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, urged the
state-owned enterprises to improve management and raise economic
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
While visiting a poverty-relief project in Liangshan Yi
Autonomous Prefecture, Zhu said that the central government has
paid close attention to the situation of poor residents, and has
promised to basically eliminate poverty in China by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sichuan, a large agricultural province in
land-locked southwest China with a large ethnic minority
population, faces severe hardships caused by poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Though great changes have taken place since the founding of
New China in 1949, the province is still poor because of its
hostile natural environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the cadres in the prefecture for their efforts to
build farmland in the past years, noting that the efforts have
helped local residents improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
"The experience in the Liangshan prefecture showed us that
priority should be given to the construction of basic farmland in
order to solve the food and clothing problems in poor areas," he
said.

BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The selection committee to
choose Hong Kong's new government was formally announced yesterday
in Beijing, signaling the start of a new era for the principle of
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and the time when Hong Kong
people can be their own masters.
</P>
<P>
Elected at the just-closed Sixth Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), the Selection Committee, completely composed of
permanent residents from the region, will shoulder two
responsibilities: recommending the candidate for the Chief
Executive of the first SAR government, and electing members of the
Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The 400 Selection Committee members, who are from various walks
of life, will choose the candidate they trust based on the
majority opinion of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 governors have been appointed in the region, which
has been under British rule in the past century, without any
consultation with local residents.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's return to the motherland is approaching, the
Chinese government has stipulated a series of practical principles
and policies for the region, including "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Only with the implementation of these principles can the people
there genuinely obtain democratic rights, and make correct
decisions that will affect their lives in the future.

<P>
People will not forget how the Chinese government embodied the
principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" in preparing
for a smooth transition, since the signing of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong SAR had more members from the inland area than from Hong
Kong; the number was nearly equal for the Preliminary Working
Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
When the Preparatory Committee was established, only 37 percent
of the members were from the inland area, while more than 60 percent
were from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed Selection Committee is completely composed of
Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
One observer said that the principle of "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" is being put into practice gradually, laying
a solid basis for the comprehensive implementation of the
principle after 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the process of forming the Selection Committee, the
Preparatory Committee paid much attention to soliciting opinions
from the Hong Kong people, fully demonstrating the principles of
democracy, justice and openness.
</P>
<P>
When the Preparatory Committee was seeking advice on
formulating the specific method for the formation of the Selection
Committee, and receiving applications for the committee members,
it won the support and enthusiastic participation of the people
from various sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After repeated negotiations and discussions, the Selection
Committee members were elected by secret ballot at the Sixth
Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Significant Step Towards "Hong Kong People Governing Hong Kong" (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a broad view of the procedure used to form the Selection
Committee, this illustrates the principle of "catering to the
Hong Kong people and relying on them" that has been in place from
the beginning of the process as has been concluded by Chinese
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, Deng Xiaoping said, "There is a demarcation
line and criterion for the principle of 'Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong', which requires that Hong Kong should be
administered by the Hong Kong people with the Hong Kong patriots
as the mainstay."
</P>
<P>
All the members of the Selection Committee expressed their
willingness to support the "one country, two systems" principle,
and fulfil the committee's obligations of choosing the first Chief
Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
This will ensure the implementation of the principles of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
As for the composition of the Selection Committee, its members
represent a broad scope of industrial, commercial and financial
sectors; professions; labor, grassroots and religious groups;
former political figures, Hong Kong deputies to the National
People's Congress, and representatives who are Hong Kong members
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
The allocation of the number of seats and the composition of the
Selection Committee entirely follow the Basic Law and stipulations
of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also take into consideration the balance of each
sector, and reflect Hong Kong's image as an international city.

</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told Xinhua that

</P>
<P>
Velayati said that the two African countries should also
withdraw rebel forces, which are supported by the each other
side, from the common border.
</P>
<P>
He said that the main problem for the peaceful settlement is
the accusation of supporting the rebels from each other side.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which is expected to be signed here Monday,
also requires both Sudan and Uganda to withdraw refugees from
the common border, he added.
</P>
<P>

good cooperation and assistance of the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>

of Uganda, told Xinhua "Sudan should first withdraw the troops,
stop any intrusion into Uganda and stop military training of the
rebels they supported against us."
</P>
<P>
However, he said at the meeting that his country wants the
peace and tranquility with his neighbor of Sudan while claiming
no any territory ambition of other country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda would take practical gesture to implement
the agreement and like to see something meaningful from the
meeting here.

country attaches great importance to the settlement of their
differences between Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken practical measures to implement the agreement
in order to bring out security and peace between the two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "Search for peace is the top priority of the
Sudanese government. It would spare no effort to get solid peace
ground with the neighbor."
</P>
<P>
George Andrew, Foreign Minister of Malawi, said "this is the
last ministerial meeting of the four sides to settle the
problems between Sudan and Uganda. Messages taken from the two
teams indicate that they would like to have the conflict
settled."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "There is no reason why it should not be
settled."
</P>
<P>
In October, Sudan, Uganda and Iran reached a draft agreement
to settle border disputes between Kampala and Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Uganda had signed an agreement to normalize
relations between the countries following mediation by Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani during his trip to Africa in
September.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reportedly took effect and involved the
pullout of rebel forces from a 100-kilometer-wide zone on either
side of the Sudanese-Ugandan border.
</P>
<P>
Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan on April 24,
1995 after accusing Khartoum of supporting rebels in the north of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Sudan for its part accuses Uganda of backing rebel groups in
southern Sudan.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- China Light and Power Co.
Ltd. (CLP) and its long-term partner Exxon Energy Ltd. will
participate in the development of a gas-fired power plant project
in Shenzhen, the Chinese city bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed on the
Shenzhen 1,050-megawatt project, in which the two companies will
own 35 percent interest. The other investors are Shenzhen Qianwan
Electric Power Development Company Limited, Guangdong Electric
Power Holding Company, and Kanematsu Power (South China) Company
Limited.
</P>
<P>
The MOU is a basis for further feasibility studies and ongoing
discussion with all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, comprising three units of 350 MW
combined-cycle gas turbine, is expected to go into operation by
the end of the century. Taking natural gas as its main source of
fuel, the plant will be favorable to environment in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
CLP, a key electricity supplier in Hong Kong, hoped that the
Shenzhen project could absorb the excessive natural gas that could
not be consumed by Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO), a
Hong Kong-based joint venture of CLP and Exxon. CAPCO acquired gas
under a long-term supply contract from the Yacheng 13-1 gas field
in South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
CLP provides electricity to 1.7 million customers in Kowloon
Peninsula and its 30-year cooperator Exxon Energy is a subsidiary
of Exxon Corporation based in Texas, the United States.

400-member Selection Committee, whose task is to set up the first
government of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), hit the headlines of many local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po hailed the founding of the Selection Committee as an
unprecedented feat signifying that a democratic era of Hong Kong
people running Hong Kong has arrived.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee was formed Saturday in Beijing,
comprising 400 permanent Hong Kong residents from a wide variety
of sectors. The Committee is charged with the tasks to select the
first Chief Executive of the future HKSAR and members of the
Provisional Legislative Council by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The set-up of the Selection Committee is one of the most
important preparations to realize the idea of "governing Hong Kong
by Hong Kong people" and the principle of "One Country, Two
Systems", said the Chinese paper in its commentary. "It is the
first time in history that Hong Kong people enjoyed the democratic
rights of participating in government and political affairs, the
rights that were deprived of under the colonial administration,"
the paper commented.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao carried a commentary entitled "Fruits of Democracy,
and Brilliance of Wisdom", saying that the Selection Committee is
highly representative. The entity comprises representatives from
business circles, professionals, labor, grassroots and religious
sectors, and former political figures and local deputies of the
National People's Congress (NPC) and members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the belief that members of the Selection
Committee, who love China and love Hong Kong, would live up to the
expectations of Hong Kong people in selecting the first Chief
Executive and the provisional legislature.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Daily News said the formation of the Selection
Committee demonstrated the principle and spirit of "balanced
participation" from all sectors and classes of the Hong Kong
society, while the Tin Tin Daily commented that the process of
establishing the Selection Committee was open, fair and
satisfactory.

<HEADLINE> Kenya takes measures to reduce interest rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
decided to cut state domestic borrowing by 8.2 billion Kenyan
Shillings (about 146 million U.S. Dollars) before the end of the
year in a bid to reduce high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Although Kenyan banks have set their base lending rates
ranging from 23 to 26 percent, borrowers have to pay
under-the-table interest rates of 35 percent for their loans.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Nation newspaper today quoted Kenyan Minister for
Finance Musalia Mudavadi as saying that the reduction of state
borrowing would ease pressure on demand for domestic credit and
facilitate reduction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday night, the minister noted that
his government was concerned with the prevailing interest rate
structure which cannot stimulate investment.
</P>
<P>
In order to fill current budget gap caused by the reduction,
Mudavadi pointed out that the government intended to step up
revenue collection and improve surveillance to prevent evasion of
taxes, especially Customs Duty and VAT taxes.
</P>
<P>
Parastatal organizations had been directed to invest their
surplus funds in long-term government instruments while the
government would enforce strict quarterly reports by government
ministries, Mudavadi noted.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include sale of long-term bonds with floating
interest from January 1 next year.

LONDON, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Sunday times:
</P>
<P>
-- The National Health Service in Britain is facing its worst
financial crisis for nearly a decade, threatening to undermine the
government's success in reducing hospital waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's farmers will see 500 million pounds (800 million
U.S. dollars) wiped off their profits this year, a drop of 12.5
percent, which could put thousands of them out of business, says a
report by Midland Bank to be published this week.
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government's strategy for dealing with juvenile
crime has been branded ineffectual, inefficient and irrelevant to
the root causes, according to a report named Young People and
Crime by the Audit Commission, the independent body responsible
for achieving value for money in the public services.
</P>
<P>
Independent On Sunday:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Nationwide Anti-US Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran today staged nationwide
rallies against the United States to mark the 17th anniversary
of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by radical students
on November 4, 1979.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Tehran, about 10,000 students and
people from all walks of life held a rally in front of the former
U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Death to America," the crowd of men, women and
children burnt the American flags and effigies of Uncle Sam one
after another in yet another annual event to remind the nation
of the "evil acts of the U.S.," one speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's hardline Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri made
a harsh statement at the rally and called on the people to
continue their fight against U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States had suffered miserably in
every field of struggle against Iran in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told Xinhua "what our
people are doing today is a genuine action. This is based on the
strong will of our people to resist any domination by the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Although most of the demonstrators were organized to take part
in the rally, the anti-U.S. sentiments are still strong in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of the demonstrators this year seems less
than the previous year, which saw about half a million people on
the street.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, similar rallies were held in different cities
in the country to commemorate the occasion, according to a report
by the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran staged the
anti-U.S. demonstrations today on the background that the United
States endorsed a new sanction law to punish Iran for
"sponsoring terrorism" and now the U.S. declared its willingness
to hold dialogue with Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei rejected the call
by the American government officials and called on the whole
nation to struggle against the United States as a religious
duty.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1979, a group of university students calling
themselves "the students following the Line of Imam (Khomeini)"
took over the U.S. Embassy and from then began 444 days of
captivity of more than 50 American hostages. The hostages were
released on the eve of Ronald Reagan's entrance into the Oval
Office in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United States have remained hostile to each
other for 17 years. The United States now accuses Tehran of
"supporting international terrorism" and seeking nuclear
weapons. It even threatened to launch a military strike against
Iranian targets.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Says Philippines Ready for APEC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that his country has been ready for the upcoming
informal leadership conference of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made this remark when inaugurating a new passenger
terminal of the Subic Bay International Airport, which was rushed
in time for the holding of the APEC leaders' informal meeting in
Subic on November 25.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference after the inauguration rites that
the preparations for the meeting are nearly on track with the
completion of the passenger terminal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the President inaugurated an 8.8-kilometer expressway
between Subic and Manila, which was another major infrastructure
project in preparation of the APEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
The terminal, which was converted from a former U.S. hangar at
an expense of 12.6 million pesos (480,000 U.S. dollars), can
accommodate some 700 passengers and will further promote the
economic development in the Subic area, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ramos also made a brief inspection of the 21
villas prepared for the APEC leaders.

<HEADLINE> Ecomog Soldier Wounded in Taylor's Attack Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peacekeeping
Force operating in Liberia, known as Ecomog, said Saturday that
the Aide-de-Camp of Liberia's warlord Charles Taylor was not dead
in last Thursday attack on Taylor but was only injured.
</P>
<P>
Che Captain's condition has stabilized after the Ecomog
medical team successfully operated and removed the bullets from
his body, according to a statement signed by Biola Lawal, press
secretary to the Ecomog commander.
</P>
<P>
The Captain is recuperating at the Ecomog field hospital based
in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, and is in no way in Dange, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) was
attacked by gunmen when he got near his office on the sixth floor
of the executive mansion of the country's ruling Council of State
at around 10:00 Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Reports following the attack said the Nigerian officer
assigned by Ecomog as Taylor's Aide-de-Camp and three other
bodyguards were killed trying to protect Taylor.
</P>
<P>
In the statement the Ecomog press secretary called on
journalists to cross-check their information before reporting on
a matter related to the incident, which is under intensified
investigation by Ecomog.

BAGHDAD, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied a

The Pentagon said late Saturday that a U.S. Air Force F-16

Iraq has made no specific mention of U.S. claims that the jet
fired a missile on an Iraqi radar site.
</P>
<P>
A statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency quoted
an official source at the Foreign Ministry as saying, "These
American claims are absolutely baseless. No incident of any kind
took place inside Iraq's air space in southern Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Deadly Drug up S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Crack, the killing drug
from America, has begun its deadly work in South Africa, a weekly
magazine "Metro" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Just two years after the first report of its arrival in South
Africa, this cocaine's ugly twin sister is cutting a swathe of
death and degradation through every sector and corner of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The police admit they are guessing when they estimate the
number of crack smokers at 150,000 in Johannesburg and Pretoria
region alone.
</P>
<P>
It is a new market and the figure could be half, or even
double, but there is no doubt crack usage is increasing daily,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ian Ralph, the commander of the Johannesburg unit of the South
African Narcotics Bureau, likens the recent explosion of crack
availability and consumption to an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the number of users will top 500,000 within
a year, leading to an upsurge in crime by addicts desperate to
satisfy their insatiable habit, a wave that could make the
present crime rate look mild in comparison.
</P>
<P>
"It is already out of control," he said, adding "who can say
what will happen next"?
</P>
<P>
Crack smoking, known as free-basing, produces an intense
short-lived high which drug users describe as the ultimate
sensation.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that from Johannesburg to Cape Town, from
black township to working-class suburbs, rich, poor, black or
white, the crack attack knows no boundaries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: South Koreans Shocked by New Bribery Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 3 (Xinhua) -- A succession of bribery scandals
over the past couple of weeks has shocked South Korea and once
again reminded people of the seriousness of corruption deeply
rooted in the society.
</P>
<P>
Lee Yang-ho, who was defense minister until October 17, was
arrested on October 26 on charges of receiving 187,000 U.S.
dollars in bribes in April last year from Daewoo Heavy Industries
Company which asked for a state license to take part in an army
light helicopter project.
</P>
<P>
"How could he do that as the defense minister?" This is the
typical response of people, including President Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
Next came the disclosure of dubious links between Seoul City's
public transportation department and companies operating public
buses.
</P>
<P>
Four city officials were arrested in the past few days on
charges of taking several hundred thousand U.S. dollars in bribes
from bus companies in return for setting bus routes in favor of
the firms.
</P>
<P>
Public buses have been considered the "feet" of many Seoul
citizens, and therefore, the bus scandal may be more shocking to
ordinary people than the one involving the ex-defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Both President Kim Young-sam and Seoul Mayor Cho Soon may have
been disturbed to see their "clean-man" images undermined by
corruption scandals involving key aides.
</P>
<P>
The scandals have dealt a blow to the president and the mayor,
who have been pushing reform polices on the strength of the
"legitimacy" of their administration.
</P>
<P>
Kim likes to call himself the first "civilian president" in
more than 30 years. Cho takes pride in the fact that he is the
first popularly elected Seoul mayor in over three decades.
</P>
<P>
Upon inauguration in February 1993, President Kim vowed not to
receive money from businessmen and launched an extensive
anti-corruption campaign. As a symbolic gesture, he chose noodles
as the lunch menu at the presidential house.
</P>
<P>
Kim has also not played golf. He may have considered the fact
that the public looks askance at politicians and businessmen
enjoying golf.
</P>
<P>
It has been proven, however, that his clean-handedness alone
cannot root out corruption in officialdom and society in general,
as shown in the case of the former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's investigation has shown that Lee completely
disregarded the president's anti-corruption drive by accepting
bribes when he was serving as defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The corruption scandal involving Lee is not an isolated case.
There are other examples such as the case involving Chang Hak-ro,
a presidential secretary who was arrested earlier this year on
bribery charges.
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that Kim's reform drive has been
implemented rather whimsically, lacking a systematic method based
on laws.
</P>
<P>
The critics are also holding the president accountable for
appointing such an unqualified person as Lee to the post of
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
President Kim used to say that "personnel management is
everything." It was apparently meant to emphasize the importance
of appointing the right people in the right posts.
</P>
<P>
Many people are now voicing doubts as to whether he was
faithful to that principle, and opposition politicians are calling
for hearings for major government appointees.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Cho appears to be in more serious trouble than President
Kim. He appeared as though he was in great agony when he offered
an apology to citizens on October 31 over the bribery scandal
involving City Hall officials.
</P>
<P>
Cho has come under fire for failing to exercise control over
the city administration. A newspaper even charged that he spent
too much time lecturing and attending not-so-important ceremonies
outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
Local media and general public are now calling for a new
anti-corruption drive following the eruption of the latest bribery
cases.

commonwealth countries as well as Vietnam's admission to the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>

cooperation between Vietnam and Britain remains vast.
</P>

broaden its cooperation with and assistance to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>

of the return of 12,000 Vietnamese boat people who illegally fled

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Live Fairly Well: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will for the
first time in 16 years be able to live within its means through
non-lending revenue collection before the end of this financial
year, an international monetary expert said.
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper, Sunday Observer today quoted International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Resident Representative to Tanzania F. L.
Osunsade as saying here on Saturday that macro-economic
indicators in the Tanzania economy showed that despite non
complacency on economic restructuring proposed under its set of
conditionalities, things were moving on well.
</P>
<P>
Citing the case of revenue collection, Osunsade said after
restructuring the revenue collection organization, the government
was able to collect about 81.831 billion Tanzania Shillings
(136.385 million U.S. Dollars) during the first two months of the
budget of July and August, representing about 2.3 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The level of collection was far higher than the estimated
amount of 74.523 billion Shillings (about 124.205 million Dollars)
for the period, which also exceeded by 44 percent the collection
under the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year's revenue collection during the same period was only
56.5 billion Shillings (about 94.2 million Dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
During the following month of September, revenue collection hit
51 billion Shillings (about 85 million Dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF representative said given that the trend of revenue
collection is likely to increase rather than decrease as the tax
collection machinery stabilizes, the government would probably
have enough money for the 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
He extrapolated the likely revenue collection scenario on the
basis of the past two months collections of July and August as
follows:
</P>
<P>
Since the collection was 81.8 billion, up to June next year,
total collection is likely to reach about 550 billion Shillings
(about 916.7 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
This would be supplemented by the more than 100 million
Dollars grant which Tanzania receives from donors every year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government budget for the year 1996/97 is 760 billion
Shillings (about 1,267 million Dollars), leaving a likely deficit
of 140 billion (about 233 million Dollars), he said, adding that
this could be argumented by either the levels of revenue
collection or grants.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that the Tanzanian government is in abject
poverty, as people claim. Things are getting better with the
reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Osunsade said if the government reaches that target before the
year ends, problems of financial instability of public funds
which have been haunting the economy for about two decades will
have been solved.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 3 (Xinhua) -- HIV-infected boxer Tommy
Morrison scored an easy victory over fellow American Marcus Rhode
in a non-title heavyweight fight here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Morrison did not have any cut or bleed during the bout, which
was stopped by the referee after one minute and 38 seconds into
the first round. The HIV virus, which could cause the disease
AIDS, could be transmitted through blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
Rhode, a last-minute replacement for original opponent Anthony
Cooks, hardly had a solid punch upon Morrison. He was floored
three times.
</P>
<P>
Cooks was forced to pull out the bout after an arrest warrant
was issued for him by the United States police.
</P>
<P>
Morrison, a former World Boxing Organisation heavyweight
champion, had promised to stop the fight if he was cut or started
bleeding during the bout.
</P>
<P>
He is prohibited to box in most parts of the United States due
to his positive HIV test but could fight in Japan where there is
no such rules.

BELGRADE, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Five Russian peacekeepers were
wounded in a landmine explosion on Friday at northern Bosnia, a
spokesman for the multi-national peacekeeping force said today in
Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The five soldiers were carrying out a mission to inspect a
blast site along with a team of Russian peacekeeping unit when an
anti-personnel mine exploded, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
One of the five was in critical conditions and the other four
suffered mild injuries, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 49 peacekeepers have been killed in Bosnia
since last December when a mission of peacekeeping started in this
former Yugoslav republic for the implementation of the Dayton
peace accord, which brought an end to the Bosnian war. Many of
them died from injuries suffered from mine explosions.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the war, there are still some three million
land mines in this region, which are threatening the lives of the
peacekeeping soldiers and the local citizens.

MANILA, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government forces
will launch full-scale offensives on the last camp still held by
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Basilan province in
Western Mindanao Island, officials at the Southern Command said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the planned offensives would help the
government gain leverage in its coming peace talks with the MILF,
which will start this month to lay down their talking points. The
talks will discuss an immediate cessation of hostilities between
the government forces and the MILF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Army Col. Tony Santos, commander of the 5th Infantry Battalion
of the Southern Command in Barangay Batingan, Tipo-Tipo, said his
soldiers are waiting for immediate instructions to take the
Bagisong Camp in Parang, Basilan.

Santos said only about 30 MILF men remained in the camp and
some MILF splintered groups were trying to regroup but having a
hard time because of the mop-up operations by his battalion.
</P>
<P>
The government forces had taken the other three major MILF
camps in Basilan in their earlier offensives, sending the rebels
fleeing to hinterlands, forested areas and hidden crevices.
</P>

The MILF earlier attacked government troops, resulting in the
death of five soldiers and the wounding of several others.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Dealers Back in Business in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Heroin dealers are back in
business in Thailand after a six-month lull beginning in January
when drug warlord Khun Sa surrendered to the Myanmar government,
narcotics suppression officers said.
</P>
<P>
The price of a unit (700 grams) of No. 4 high-grade heroin
(90-99 percent pure) has stabilized over the past two months at
200,000-250,000 baht (8,000-10,000 US dollars), with steady
supplies in the hills of northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The price shot up to at least 300,000-400,000 baht
(12,000-16,000 US dollars) in March through May. In Bangkok, one
unit was able to fetch 775,000 baht (31,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
During that period, drug dealers, both old-timers and
newcomers, fought for territory formerly controlled by Khun Sa and
syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Officials met to debate how to help some 300,000 heroin addicts
suddenly forced out of the habit, as rehabilitation centers were
unable to accommodate all of them.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau was quoted
today by local daily the Bangkok Post as saying that the dealers
who have managed to carve out a share of the heroin trade are
mostly old-timers.
</P>
<P>
However, they form smaller groups, rather than comprehensive
network existing under Khun Sa.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft Thai police report on the latest drug
situation, political instability and economic hardship in
Thailand's neighboring countries continue to make them fertile
ground for drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Still a Problem in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Child labor is still a problem
in Thailand's labor force despite a decrease in child labor in the
country in recent years, according to a senior economist with the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The country still has as many as 1.6 million children under the
age of 14 who are out of school and most of them work under harsh
conditions, Sudhir Shetty of the World Bank's country operations
division told a recent seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Of the total number of children who remain out of school, 1.2
million did not attend junior secondary school and 400,000 did not
go to primary school.
</P>
<P>
Many in the former group, who are between the age of 12 to 14,
worked long hours, with the trend increasingly moving towards even
longer hours, Shetty warned.
</P>
<P>
The number of those children who work more than eight hours a
day has increased from 85 percent in 1985 to 92 percent in 1995,
and the ranks of those who work seven days a week have also risen
from 8 percent to 30 percent during the said period, said Shetty,
who cited information assembled from various sources.
</P>
<P>
Quoting statistics for 1993 of the Thai Ministry of Labor and
Welfare, he said about 46.5 percent of the roughly 30,000 children
employed in the establishments inspected were treated badly.
</P>
<P>
Shetty said two main reasons have kept children out of school
-- parents' lack of education and income, and the high cost of
education.
</P>
<P>
He said more than two-thirds of the children surveyed in a
study were exposed to dust, noise and chemicals at the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Common problems faced by employed children include hard work
under substandard conditions and violations of basic rights and
fraud concerning compensation and work arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Child laborers are often made to undertake risky tasks and work
with less than an hour's break per day, he quoted another survey.

<HEADLINE> Sporting Cristal Wins Peruvian Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Sporting Cristal became the
champion of the Peruvian soccer league on Saturday after the
country's soccer body awarded it a win for an interrupted match.
</P>
<P>
With still one round remaining, Sporting Cristal collected 64
points and could not be overtaken by closest rivals Alianza Lima
on 60 and Universitario on 57.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian Football Federation decided on Saturday to give
Sporting Cristal a nominal 2-0 victory over Universitario as the
result of last Sunday's game stopped at 1-1 by players' brawl and
pitch invasion by the crowds.
</P>
<P>
Universitario player Paolo Maldonado were suspended from
playing for 90 days while his teammate Jose Carranza was banned
for 60 days for their role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is a setback for the Peruvian national eleven,
which will meet Venezuela for a World Cup qualifier on November
10, as both Maldonado and Carranza are national members.

<HEADLINE> Asset Sales Called "Key to Reform" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- Liquidating State-owned assets
does not equal privatizing or losing them, today's China Daily
quotes a senior Chinese economist's words as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Liquidating and restructuring assets stock is the key to
State-owned enterprise reform, which is at a crucial point," said
Professor Gao Shangquan, former vice-minister of the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Gao, currently president of the China Society for Enterprise
Reform and Development, said some people mistakenly interpret
transfer of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) property rights as a
loss in State-owned property. However, he said, resources laying
in idle cause even greater waste.
</P>
<P>
At present, the value of assets stock belonging to SOEs totals
6,000 billion yuan (about 723 billion US dollars), most of which
is not allocated according to market demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Without success in SOE reform, achievements in other fields
such as building active markets will be in vain, Gao said, even
suggesting that inefficient SOEs threaten the establishment of the
new economic mechanism.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country has established markets on commodities,
technology, labour and production elements. About 95 percent of
consumer products are priced according to market forces.
</P>
<P>
But the market cannot live up to its potential in optimizing
resources since SOEs -- a major part of the State economic
structure -- do not yet fully function according to market norms.
</P>
<P>
SOEs have been the pillar of the national economy, supplying
the key products concerning people's daily life and the country's
fundamental interests. Although the proportion is decreasing, SOEs
still contribute to half of the country's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Gao said transfer of State-owned property, so long as it
observes the principle of the market economy, will not result in
privatization. It is the form of assets, not ownership, that is
changed.
</P>
<P>
Gao predicted that by 2000 a fairly reasonable management
mechanism could be established in most SOEs, with the government
turning from direct to indirect administration and an improved
social welfare system.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Return Storm Aid Marked with "Propaganda" to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government announced
today that it will return part of the food aid for victims of
Hurricane Lili to American donors as the goods were marked with
"counter-revolutionary propaganda."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Communist Party newspaper, Granma, today quoted a
government statement as saying that seven tons of the cargo, or 27
percent of the total, would be given back to the U.S. religious
group Caritas. The cargo was donated by mostly Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
The statement said part of the aid "is marked with propaganda
form counter-revolutionary elements and the extreme right."
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government would distribute goods not marked with
political slogans or biased messages, which amounted to 23 tons,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The goods would be sent to the most affected communities in the
provinces Villa Clara and Sancti Spiritus.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Hurricane Lili destroyed nearly 5,500 homes and
damaged 79,000 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua will be the first
Central American country to be included into the Special Program
of Food Security (PESA) of the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said a FAO official.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Canchon, FAO representative in Nicaragua, said PESA
will benefit some 500 small agricultural producers in the country,
mostly located in areas where governmental services in
technological extension and transference had been scarce.
</P>
<P>
He said FAO has made studies in Latin America to pick up
countries with a high productive potential and food scarcity, to
be incorporated to PESA, which was aimed at promoting the use of
microirrigation and organic fertilizers and insecticides, and the
diversification of agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the pilot project in Nicaragua will start in
May 1997 and last three years with an investment of approximately
3 million U.S. dollars, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Eight specialists in irrigation, soil management,
hydrographical basins, and reforestation will arrive in Nicaragua
next January to assess the country at a national level.

<HEADLINE> Selection Committee for HK Government Executive Hailed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- An article to be carried in
tomorrow's issue of "Outlook" magazine lauds the Selection
Committee for the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and the provisional legislature as
paving the way for the establishment of the first government of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was formed last weekend, consists of 400
permanent Hong Kong residents who were elected by the recent Sixth
Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive, the first in Hong Kong's history to be
chosen by Hong Kong people themselves, will be chosen through
local consultation, or through nomination and election after
consultation, the article says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that, during Britain's more than 150-year' rule
of Hong Kong, all 28 governors were appointed by the British Queen
without soliciting the opinion of the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When a "through-train" arrangement for the legislature was
sabotaged by the British side, the second plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee made a decision about establishing the
provisional legislature and charged the Selection Committee with
its formation, the article explained.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the Selection Committee broadly
representative, the Selection Committee panel of the Preparatory
Committee sought advice in Hong Kong last April with active
participation from local people, the article says.
</P>
<P>
After careful study and consultation, two major documents on
forming the Selection Committee were adopted at the third and
fourth plenary sessions of the Preparatory Committee, it says.

The Selection Committee is characterized by Democracy and
openness, the article says.
</P>
<P>
Many people came to the Hong Kong Office of the Secretariat of
the Preparatory Committee to get forms to apply for the job, the
article says. By the end of the application process, the
Secretariat had given out 22,106 forms. The number of applicants
was 5,798.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee, on
October 4 and 5, members put forth names of candidates from the
list of applicants. The chairman and vice-chairmen of the
Preparatory Committee then held a meeting on October 31, prepared
a namelist of candidates, and submitted it to the Preparatory
Committee's, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee shows that preparations for the Hong
Kong SAR are going smoothly, and that it was an historic step in
realizing the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
With the support of the majority of the people of Hong Kong,
the Selection Committee will fulfill its historic task of choosing
the candidate for the first Chief Executive and 60 members of the
provisional legislature, in accordance with the Basic Law, the
article notes.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian aviation has
registered 1,365 victims in 2,223 air accidents in the past 12
years, said a report of the Civil Aviation Department (DAC).
</P>
<P>
But among them, only 30 accidents occurred to jet aircraft of
different sizes.
</P>
<P>
The number of air accidents reached 242 in 1988. It has
decreased in recent years. Official projections put the number of
air accidents to 95 or 100 this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of accidents in the air has decreased,
collisions of aircraft on landing strips have increased.
</P>
<P>
The report said "there were 28 accidents on the ground in
1990," and four years later the number rose to 57.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Fokker-100 plane crashed in a densely
populated Sao Paulo neighborhood, killing at least 105
people. The crash was the worst air accident in the country in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> BOC to Observe Principle of Fair Play With HK After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China will observe
the principle of fair play in competition with Hong Kong
counterparts and work with them to ensure stable and prosperous
financial trade in the region, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The President of the BOC Wang Xuebing said Hong Kong's status
as an international financial center will be maintained and
enhanced in the future, beefed up by the Basic Law and the rapid
economic development in China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"The bright prospect also paves the way for broader contacts
between BOC and the financial institutions in the region," Wang
was quoted in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The BOC began business contacts with Hong Kong financial bodies
in the 1950s. The region has since become China's springboard to
the outside world and its most important international financing
center.
</P>
<P>
In establishing extensive contacts with financial institutions
in Hong Kong, BOC has been aided by its decades-long good
reputation, rich experience in international financial operation
and well-developed international branch network, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, BOC has agents in 19 local financial institutions
and 78 branches of foreign financial units in Hong Kong, with
business contacts covering all areas of finance.
</P>
<P>
Wang classified cooperation with Hong Kong banking institutions
into four parts:
</P>
<P>
--Exchange and cooperation in commercial banking and investment
banking operations have been expanding.
</P>
<P>
-- As one of the three cash issuers in Hong Kong, BOC has given
full support to administrative efforts of the Hong Kong financial
authorities and has actively participated in banking regulation
and coordinating the performance of Hong Kong financial bodies,
establishing a prominent position in the region's financial circle.
</P>
<P>
-- Frequent exchanges of senior executive staff between BOC and
Hong Kong financial institutions promote links between China's
inland and Hong Kong before the central government resumes the
exercise of sovereignty over the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Contacts between BOC's overseas branches and Hong Kong
financial bodies are also expanding.

<HEADLINE> Harvest Inspires Ambitious 1997 Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture has
set an ambitious target of increasing the grain yield by 2.5
million tons next summer, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The target anticipates the summer grain acreage to reach 31.33
million hectares next year, with per-hectare yield growing by 75
kilograms on average from the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
The summer grain yield hit an all-time high this year for the
second year in a row -- more than 110 million tons, up 3 percent
from last year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
Output of early rice in the countryside reached 44 million
tons, an increase of nearly 1.8 million tons from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Ministry analysts said that expanded farmland across the
country has contributed greatly to the grain harvests this year,
which are expected to go beyond 480 million tons despite floods
and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
They said that if harvests next year follow the recent
agricultural development pattern, hopes of realizing a grain
output of around 500 million tons by the turn of this century will
be fueled.
</P>
<P>
To hit the target, the ministry is expecting to establish a
national reserve fund to anticipate any tie-up in
agriculture-earmarked credits from Chinese or foreign financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks are being asked to diversify credits designated
for agriculture in order to cater to varying financial needs of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Increase in the country's agricultural investment should not be
smaller than growth in State revenue, and the sectors of industry,
services, and scientific and technology research are all expected
to make contributions to agricultural growth in the coming years,
ministry officials noted.

<P>
SARAJEVO, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Alija Izetbegovic, Chairman of
the Bosnian Presidency, said on Saturday that he looks forward to
a more active participation of China in Bosnia's peace process and
economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic expressed the hope during his meeting with Liu
Guchang, Director of the European-Asian Department of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry, who was heading China's first official
delegation to visit Bosnia since the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Liu, on behalf of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, congratulated Izetbegovic on his election as Chairman of
the Bosnian Presidency and wished him new successes in
consolidating the peace and re-building the economy.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that the Bosnian government is grateful to
the Chinese people and leaders for their support to the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and
that it highly appreciates China's fair and constructive
principles and stance on issues concerning Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
It is his hope that as a big country, China should be more
actively engaged in the peace process and economic reconstruction
of Bosnia, Izetbegovic said.
</P>

JERUSALEM, November 2 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people
gathered tonight in the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv to mark the
first anniversary of the assasination of former premier Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The huge crowd of people blocked main routes to the square
where participants, including many school teenagers, held candles
and Rabin's portrait in memory of the great man who was shot
there last November 4 by a radical Jew.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's widow Leah Rabin, in her emotional address to the
crowd including Tel Aviv Mayor Ronny Milo and U.S. Ambassador
Martin Indyk, appealed for the nation to continue seeking peace
which she described as her husband's legacy.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mayor Milo paid tribute to Rabin, saying
"he would be forever remembered as a great man by Israeli people."
</P>
<P>
The memorial service also featured moving performances by
several leading Israeli singers and music bands, who also paid
tribute to Rabin for his contribution to the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's rally is the latest in a series of memorial
services which began since October 24, the first anniversary
according to the Jewish lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of memorial services were held throughout the
country on the day to mark the first political assassination in
the Jewish state that is deeply divided by the peace process
championed by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a monument marking the spot where Rabin was
assassinated was unveiled in Tel Aviv. Rabin's family attended
the ceremony held at the site near the City Hall, which would be
lit 24 hours a day by underground lighting.

Meanwhile, the army headquarters in downtown Tel Aviv, known
since the beginning of the state as the Kirya, has been renamed
Camp Rabin after the late premier.

On Monday, a cornerstone will be laid for a monument to be
erected, and a plaque will be unveiled renaming the military
compound. Leah will also unveil a bust of Rabin, who had spent
many hours in the headquarters both as Chief of Staff and as
Defense Minister.
