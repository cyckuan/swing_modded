RED SOX WIN SERIES WITH A 12-8 VICTORY OVER INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The American League Championship Series will be a
shuttle showdown pitting a team without a World Series championship
since World War I against a team without a World Series
championship since last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, wild cards, damaged goods and heartbreakers
for decades, earned the right Monday night to move on to face the
powerful defending champion New York Yankees, whom they have never
faced in a post-season series. They did it with a 12-8 victory in
Jacobs Field over the Cleveland Indians, their third victory in
three days, to win the series by three games to two.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary heroes this time were Troy O'Leary, who knocked in
seven runs with two home runs, and Pedro Martinez, who came back
from a back injury to pitch six innings against a team that scored
1,009 runs this season, the most in half a century. In that span,
Martinez gave up no runs and no hits while striking out eight. It
was the first time a team has won a first-round series after
trailing by 0-2 since Seattle did it to the Yankees in 1995. In the
final three games, the Red Sox outscored the heavy-hitting Indians
by 44-18.
</P>
<P>
   No rational baseball fan would give the Red Sox a chance against
the talent-laden Yankees, who have rested since Saturday night and
have a pitching staff filled with starring starters. Except for
Martinez, who cannot pitch until Game 3, Boston has no dependable
starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, Monday night's starter, was hit hard for the
second time this series and driven from the mound in the second
inning. The second-best starter in this series was Ramon Martinez,
Pedro's older brother, who has just come back from shoulder surgery
and pitched much of the season in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Red Sox fielding skills are questionable. Their
best position player, Nomar Garciaparra, is playing despite pain in
his right wrist that idled him for one game in this series. But
baseball is not always a logical or rational game. Sometimes, as it
was in the last six days, it can be strange and wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   The four-of-seven-game series against the Yankees begins on
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. The winner will meet either the
Mets, the National League wild card, or the Braves in the World
Series. This is the first time both wild cards have advanced to the
league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third inning, the two teams had combined for
15 runs, half as many as they scored on Sunday night in Game 4, a
23-7 Red Sox victory in Fenway Park that evened the series at two
victories each. But on Monday night, the runs were more evenly
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians led by 8-7. The Red Sox tied it at 8-8 in the top of
the fourth on a sacrifice fly by John Valentin, his second rbi of
the night and his 12th of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez entered to start the bottom of the fourth. He had
pitched four innings in Game 1 here, but left with muscle pain in
his back. Generally considered the best pitcher in baseball,
Martinez went 23-4 with a 2.40 earned run average and 313
strikeouts. Before the game, Manager Jimy Williams had hinted that
his star might come out of the bullpen. ``He feels a lot better,''
Williams said. ``He's had a steady progression of feeling better
the last three days. So, I mean, that's a good sign. Can he pitch
is probably what you really want to know. I really think he can.
You know, we have to find the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   In his initial inning, Martinez retired the side in order. But
the middle batter, Kenny Lofton, left the game in pain, with a
dislocated left shoulder, which he injured while diving into first
base after grounding out to Mike Stanley with Martinez covering.
Although Lofton had only 2 hits in 16 trips to the plate in this
series, he was a .301 hitter in the regular season and he is a
speedy leadoff man and is one of the better center fielders. Lofton
was taken to a local hospital to stay overnight for X-rays and
observation.
</P>
<P>
   The radar gun showed Martinez throwing his fastest pitches in
the range of 90 to 95 miles an hour. In the middle innings, the
game changed character, settling into a duel between Martinez and
Sean DePaula of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a two-run home run in the first inning off
Saberhagen and another in the third off Derek Lowe. In the previous
four games, Thome had two home runs and six rbi. For the Sox,
Garciaparra had a two-run homer in the first off Charles Nagy and
O'Leary had a grand slam off Nagy in the third.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the sixth, Martinez had thrown three scoreless
innings, walking two batters but striking out four in that span.
The lusty cheering, so frequent earlier, had subsided, and the
45,114 Cleveland fans broke only occasionally into spasms of
nervous pleading with Martinez in command.
</P>
<P>
   But they were frequently on their feet, wringing their hands.
Although much is made of the Red Sox not winning the World Series
since 1918, the Indians also have a long championship drought,
since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the seventh, the Indians brought in Paul Shuey,
their third pitcher. After Indians Manager Mike Hargrove ordered
Garciaparra walked intentionally for the second time in the game,
O'Leary responded exactly the same way, for the second time: with a
home run. This one, also on the first pitch, scored only three
runs, giving the Sox a lead of 11-8. O'Leary's seven rbi tied him,
at least temporarily, with Valentin and two other players for the
record for rbi in a single game in post-season play. Valentin tied
the record the night before.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, Martinez retired the side in
order, recording two strikeouts, the last pitch at 94 mph, and the
only sound to be heard was a kind of hush.

FARMER CHOOSES USC

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC received one of its highest-profile basketball
commitments in years Monday night when shooting guard Desmon Farmer
selected the Trojans over Marquette.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer (6-foot-4, 195 pounds), who plays for Northwestern High
School in Flint, Mich., was rated the No. 2 shooting guard in the
country last spring by recruiting-analyst Bob Gibbons. He was rated
the 24th-best prospect overall in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the top pure shooters in the country,'' Gibbons
said. ``He could step in and have a chance to be Freshman of the
Year in the Pac-10. This clearly is an impact recruit for (USC
coach) Henry Bibby.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's stock fell when he injured his knee and missed last
summer's camps and tournaments. Farmer said he tore the upper part
of his anterior cruciate ligament but that it was less severe than
normal ACL injuries and he will play for his high school team this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back playing already,'' he said. ``This is my last month
of rehabilitation. A lot of schools backed down. USC stayed with
me. I feel comfortable around the coaches and the players. I can
get my degree and get to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was also being recruited by Michigan, Syracuse and New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer averaged 20.3 points and 7.9 rebounds last season. He
plays at the same high school as former USC shooting guard Anthony
Pendleton, who played for the Trojans in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   USC remains in the running for two other high-profile players:
6-10 forward Jared Jeffries, rated the No. 7 player in the country
by Gibbons, is down to Duke, Indiana and the Trojans. And last
weekend, 6-9 forward Herve Lamizana, among the top 30 players in
the country, visited USC.

the fourth on a sacrifice fly by John Valentin, his second rbi of
the night and his 12th of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez entered to start the bottom of the fourth. He had
pitched four innings in Game 1 here, but left with muscle pain in
his back. Generally considered the best pitcher in baseball,
Martinez went 23-4 with a 2.40 earned run average and 313
strikeouts. Before the game, Manager Jimy Williams had hinted that
his star might come out of the bullpen. ``He feels a lot better,''
Williams said. ``He's had a steady progression of feeling better
the last three days. So, I mean, that's a good sign. Can he pitch
is probably what you really want to know. I really think he can.
You know, we have to find the right spot.''
</P>
<P>
   In his initial inning, Martinez retired the side in order. But
the middle batter, Kenny Lofton, left the game in pain, with a
dislocated left shoulder, which he injured while diving into first
base after grounding out to Mike Stanley with Martinez covering.
Although Lofton had only 2 hits in 16 trips to the plate in this
series, he was a .301 hitter in the regular season and he is a
speedy leadoff man and is one of the better center fielders. Lofton
was taken to a local hospital to stay overnight for X-rays and
observation.
</P>
<P>
   The radar gun showed Martinez throwing his fastest pitches in
the range of 90 to 95 miles an hour. In the middle innings, the
game changed character, settling into a duel between Martinez and
Sean DePaula of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a two-run home run in the first inning off
Saberhagen and another in the third off Derek Lowe. In the previous
four games, Thome had two home runs and six rbi. For the Sox,
Garciaparra had a two-run homer in the first off Charles Nagy and
O'Leary had a grand slam off Nagy in the third.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the sixth, Martinez had thrown three scoreless
innings, walking two batters but striking out four in that span.
The lusty cheering, so frequent earlier, had subsided, and the
45,114 Cleveland fans broke only occasionally into spasms of
nervous pleading with Martinez in command.
</P>
<P>
   But they were frequently on their feet, wringing their hands.
Although much is made of the Red Sox not winning the World Series
since 1918, the Indians also have a long championship drought,
since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the seventh, the Indians brought in Paul Shuey,
their third pitcher. After Indians Manager Mike Hargrove ordered
Garciaparra walked intentionally for the second time in the game,
O'Leary responded exactly the same way, for the second time: with a
home run. This one, also on the first pitch, scored only three
runs, giving the Sox a lead of 11-8. O'Leary's seven rbi tied him,
at least temporarily, with Valentin and two other players for the
record for rbi in a single game in post-season play. Valentin tied
the record the night before.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, Martinez retired the side in
order, recording two strikeouts, the last pitch at 94 mph, and the
only sound to be heard was a kind of hush.

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the AFL-CIO's endorsement hanging in the
balance, President Clinton did his vice president a big favor
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed several calls over the weekend to nudge labor
leaders into supporting Al Gore's candidacy for the Democratic
nomination. Douglas Dority, president of the Food and Commercial
Workers Union, said Clinton telephoned a mutual friend to lobby for
the union's support, a crucial swing vote needed to secure the
labor federation's important endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had already endorsed,'' Dority said, ``but President
Clinton's take was that the spin was such that if we didn't do it,
it would look like we were against Gore, which we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called John Sweeney, the labor federation president, to
offer any other help he needed to win an endorsement of Gore. And
the president called to lobby J.J. Barry, president of the
800,000-member International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear how much Clinton's calls will affect the
outcome, they were the final steps in an intense effort by the Gore
campaign _ and the White House itself _ to win labor's support for
the vice president with an endorsement that the AFL-CIO is expected
to approve on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To line up labor's support, Clinton appeared at a dinner last
Thursday honoring the Teamsters' president, James Hoffa. And in
recent weeks the White House has moved to limit imports of
low-priced steel, part of an effort to placate the powerful United
Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   In August Clinton and three Cabinet members traveled to the
AFL-CIO's executive council meeting in Chicago, and the president
set up a task force to look into the loss of manufacturing jobs. He
told labor leaders he took those steps on the recommendation of
Gore, who had just met with eight union presidents who wanted the
administration's help in saving factory jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's full-court press is one of several factors
that have put Gore on the verge of grabbing the the biggest plum so
far in the early months of the 2000 presidential campaign. Equally
critical, many labor leaders said Monday, were the vice president's
record on labor issues as well as the need for Sweeney to prove
that he could unite the federation around Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore and his rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley, have battled
over the labor endorsement, with Bradley urging union leaders not
to rush to make an endorsement so early.
</P>
<P>
   The labor endorsement is a boon to candidates because the
AFL-CIO has 13 million members, prints millions of leaflets and
mobilizes thousands of union members to get out the vote and
operate phone banks.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Dority said the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union decided to back Gore for a reason that was haunting
many of Gore's labor supporters: If Gore did not gain an
endorsement from the labor federation it would be construed as a
devastating setback to the vice president at a time when Bradley's
strength seems to be growing each day.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's most outspoken supporter in labor, Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, said, ``There was a real fear that if we didn't have an
endorsement here for Gore, it would have cut him off at the
knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, even though it was clear that Gore was the
favorite of organized labor, it was looking iffy whether the
AFL-CIO would endorse him at its convention this week. Some union
leaders were pushing for a delay, in hope of wresting more
concessions from Gore and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Sweeney was so discouraged that he told aides he might
not put an endorsement up to a vote at the convention because
several pivotal unions were not making the movement toward Gore
that he expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime early Friday, AFL-CIO officials said, Sweeney decided
to stick his neck out and push hard for an endorsement even though
he was uncertain he could muster the needed two-thirds majority of
the 700 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Sweeney said he decided to work hard to line up
backing for the vice president because he believed that Gore has
been a good and loyal friend to American workers and that Gore was
going to be the Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, union officials said, saw that Gore nearly had the
two-thirds needed, and he was confident that if he pushed for an
endorsement, that would move several fence-sitting unions toward
backing Gore, enabling the vice president to clinch the two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Sweeney spoke out for an endorsement on Friday,
several fence-sitting unions other than the Food and Commercial
Workers announced that they would back an AFL-CIO endorsement of
Gore. Those unions were the Office and Professional Employees
International Union, the Laborers International Union of North
America and the National Treasury Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO, the
Service Employees International Union, gave Sweeney assurances this
past weekend that it would back an endorsement if its vote was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   For many union leaders, there was another big concern, that the
AFL-CIO and Sweeney would be weakened and embarrassed if the labor
federation did not endorse Gore at the convention, when Sweeney was
such an outspoken supporter of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there wasn't an endorsement, it would have hurt John,''
McEntee said. ``The guy worked so hard for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many union leaders interviewed said that the question always was
not whether they were going to endorse Gore, but when. Several
opposed an early endorsement because they said their members were
not yet paying attention to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members weren't mentally prepared to talk about the
presidential election,'' said Dority of the Food and Commercial
Workers' Union. ``We thought it would be better to wait until
closer to the election. But we saw that not endorsing at this time
might send a message that we're against Gore, and we didn't want to
be seen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up involvement from the White House and the Gore
campaign came only after many labor leaders had complained that
Gore had not given them enough one-on-one attention. At the same
time, Bradley was calling the leaders two or three times a day,
union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials said that they were receptive to the
argument Gore has been making recently that he has fought for union
issues for a long time while Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 and
has been viewed as doing little for labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley's been out of the Senate now for how long?'' asked
William Burga, president of the Ohio affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
``Gore stayed in there. I think that means something.''
</P>
<P>
   But several union officials, most notably the presidents of the
Teamsters and the autoworkers, said there should be no rush for the
AFL-CIO to make an endorsement because they thought holding off
might wrest more concessions from candidates. Other union officials
argued against an early endorsement because the Gore campaign was
in disarray and Bradley was coming on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, the Sweeney aide, said, ``Because it was early, because of
the atmosphere _ is the Gore campaign falling flat? _ because
Bradley was doing a good job of reaching out, people got into this,
maybe we should just hang back. Why rush? Nobody was saying we
prefer Bradley over Gore. John's reaction was: That's not a
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   For labor officials like Sweeney, loyalty is an important
factor, and they have seen Gore speak out for years on labor's
issues, ranging from the minimum wage to a patients' bill of
rights. At two recent meetings of the AFL-CIO's executive
committee, the vice president won rave reviews for defending
workers' right to organize and for condemning corporations that
violate the law by firing workers who support unionization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been very much in the fray with us, on education,
on health, on children's issues'' said Sandra Feldman, president of
the American Federation of Teachers. ``Over the years he's been
with us very steadfastly.''

WHEN IT'S ISLANDERS VS. RANGERS, IT'S ALWAYS INTENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Despite all the new faces on both benches, the
Rangers-Islanders rivalry remains as intense as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Rangers showed they were the more talented team
Monday night, but the New York Islanders fed off emotion and the
boisterous, sold-out home crowd at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The game appeared headed into overtime after the Islanders came
back to tie the score late in the third period, but the Rangers got
a controversial goal from Stephane Quintal with less than three
minutes remaining and escaped with a 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Quintal's game-winner, scored at 17 minutes 14 seconds, on a
slap shot from the point, slid past the Islanders' goalie, Felix
Potvin, who was bumped. The Islanders argued that it was the
Rangers' Kevin Stevens who made the contact, but replays showed
that it was in fact Jamie Heward, the Islanders' defenseman, who
rammed Potvin. The contact was just hard enough to slightly spin
Potvin as the puck entered the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stevens didn't interfere,'' said Rangers coach John Muckler.
``He was interfered with by their player, and he pushed him away
from the goalkeeper. But Stevens didn't touch the goalkeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The game went out of control in the third period as emotions
boiled over. It began with the ejection of the Islander defenseman
Rich Pilon for repeatedly cross-checking Stevens from behind in
front of the Islanders' goal. Then, moments later, Darren Langdon,
the Rangers' enforcer, stuck out his leg and tripped the Islanders'
captain and best player, Kenny Jonsson.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon was promptly jumped from behind by the Islanders giant
defenseman Zdeno Chara, who attempted to pound Langdon's head into
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just an ongoing thing for the last 10 years,'' Stevens
said of his battles with Pilon Monday night. ``He plays hard but
sometimes he gets carried away.''
</P>
<P>
   One might expect that the rivalry would lack the intensity of
matches in recent years because both teams were overhauled during
the off season. The Rangers have 11 new players; the Islanders have
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But game was intense, from start to finish. The players were
quickly caught up in the emotion of the rivalry, and they fed off
the crowd's energy.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 minutes were especially entertaining. The opening
period featured everything a good hockey game is supposed to have _
hard hitting, a couple of scraps and several good scoring
opportunities for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks started early. Steve Webb of the Islanders slammed
into the Rangers' Manny Malhotra behind the visiting net, opening a
cut on Malhotra's face. Malhotra left the game briefly to get
stitched up.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was just the start of the physical play. Moments
later the Islanders' rugged defenseman Rich Pilon was hit with a
roughing penalty for giving Stevens a facial with his glove. And
the rough stuff escalated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game, every night should be like that,''
Muckler said. ``I don't think it's dead. The Islanders worked very
hard. They are a young hockey club and they are going to get
better. We were well prepared for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Heward tied the game with a power play goal at 12:34 of the
third period. Pinching in deep, Heward took a pass from Mark
Lawrence just outside the crease and beat Rangers' goalie Kirk
McLean to the far post, tying the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 2-1 lead in the second period on goals by
Kevin Stevens and Todd Harvey, and they spent the rest of the night
trying to hold onto that advantage, which they eventually lost late
in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The game settled down in the second period as the Rangers, who
outshot the Islanders 25-14 through two periods, grabbed a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens opened the scoring early in the period, rifling
the puck toward the net, where it deflected off Tim Connolly's
skate and past Felix Potvin at 2:00. Then, Todd Harvey made the
score 2-0 at 7:25, knocking in a rebound to give the visitors a
commanding 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders did not fold, instead regaining some of their
earlier momentum midway through the period. Buoyed by the
outstanding play of Felix Potvin, and the ineptness of the Rangers'
struggling power play, the Islanders cut their deficit to 2-1 on a
goal by Brad Isbister at 9:42.
</P>
<P>
   Theoren Fleury scored the Rangers' final goal into an empty net
with 23 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because we worked so hard,'' said the
Islanders' Gino Odjick. ``But you can't make those kinds of
mistakes in the final minute.''

GORE FINDS ARIZONA FRIENDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By JOHN KAMMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Just before the nation's largest labor organization
issues its weighty endorsement, Vice President Al Gore cruised
through one of the least unionized states offering him self as the
candidate most willing to fight for working families.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore, who expects to receive the AFL-CIO endorsement on Oct. 13,
when that group votes at its national convention, told reporters
during a visit to a construction site in Phoenix that he is
``hopeful'' the union nod will be his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know yet,'' Gore told reporters when asked whether he
was confident of the endorsement. ``I'm hopeful, but I don't have
the official word.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Oct. 11, AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal
told report ers in Los Angeles that Gore had received the necessary
two-thirds majority of the organization's execu tive council over
the weekend. The vice president is scheduled to address the Los
Angeles convention after the endorsement vote on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he was campaigning in Arizona, Gore said he
believes the eventual party nominees will fight for the state in
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arizona is going to be a battleground state in the
election of November 2000,'' said Gore, who is facing an
unexpectedly tight race with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley
for the Democratic party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of people here _ not only Democrats,
but also independents and moderate Republi cans _ who don't want to
put our economic prosperity at risk, and they are a little
concerned that the Repub lican Party is drifting farther and
farther to the right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made the remarks after attend ing a fund-raiser that broke
a record for the amount of money raised by state Democrats for a
non-Arizona Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The event, held at Eddie Matney's restaurant on Camelback Road,
eas ily pushed Gore's Arizona state fund-raising total past the
$250,000 mark _ far surpassing the $126,000 reported by Bradley at
the end of the July campaign finance reporting pe riod.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used the fund-raiser to highlight his supremacy in the
en dorsement game. Among those who have signed on with Gore are 28
Democratic state lawmakers, three supervisors from two counties,
three councilmen from two cities and three mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore retains a wide lead in Arizona _ the most recent
survey by Arizona State University pollster Bruce Merrill showed
him ahead 42 percent to Bradley's 22 percent _ experts say Bradley
has been closing on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Local pollsters suspect Gore's lead has shrunk appreciably in
recent weeks as the vice president has struggled to present himself
as a charismatic leader who could beat the GOP front-runner, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate's more sprightly im age was on full display Oct.
11 as he schmoozed with local schoolchildren, issued off-the-cuff
remarks at his fund-raiser and later made an im promptu stop at a
local construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in the morning at Sky Harbor International Airport,
Gore bounded down the stairway from his airplane at the Lincoln J.
Ragsdale Executive Terminal and was greeted by half a dozen
dignitaries led by U.S. Rep. Ed Pastor, Arizona's only Democrat in
Congress, and Janet Napolitano, Arizona attorney gen eral.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also met by representatives from unions, civil-rights
organiza tions, Hispanics, the clergy, senior citizens, veterans
and others.
</P>
<P>
   A disabled World War II veteran who identified himself as
73-year-old Duke Wellington of Glendale stood among welcomers with
the aid of a walker and held high the only homemade Gore sign in
evidence, although there were numerous pro fessionally printed
versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one who has done anything for us,'' Wellington
said of Gore's support for veterans' issues. Republican
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain ``signed on to have a
cutback in veterans' bene fits,'' he contended.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials in attendance in cluded Maricopa County
Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox and Phoenix-area lawmakers Sens. Mary
Hartley and Chris Cummiskey and Reps. Leah Landrum and Carlos
Avelar.
</P>
<P>
   Among others on hand were six leaders of Local 99 of the United
Food and Commercial Workers, whose international union endorsed
Gore on Oct. 10; Ray Arvizu, the newly elected president of the
U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Ramon Gomez, leader of the Na
tional Civil Rights Movement; the Rev. Oscar Tillman, outgoing
presi dent of Arizona's branch of the National Association for the
Ad vancement of Colored People; and the Rev. Benjamin Thomas,
pastor of Tanner Chapel A.M.E. Church.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore used a tour of Kenil worth Elementary School in
central Phoenix, where overcrowding has forced students to
transform a media room into a classroom, to highlight his proposal
for a national school construction policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting his now trademark tan-col ored suit, Gore examined a
cluster of classrooms under construction at the school, then
attended a sixth-grade class, where he grabbed a micro phone and
kneeled before students, asking and answering questions in
Oprah-like fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate also showed off his bilingual abilities, answering
some questions in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``By investing more and building more classrooms and hiring more
teachers, we can reduce the number of students in each classroom,''
Gore told the 45 students in Arcelio Martinez's class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a question of money; it's a question of
standards and reforms. But it cannot be done without money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the students that he was responsible for helping to
push through federal subsidies for Internet services in low-income
school dis tricts, a program he boasted was ``the biggest infusion
of federal money into the public schools ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the children appeared less interested in Gore's policy
positions than in grilling him about his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the country accommodate your need for food?'' one student
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. My family and I buy our own food,'' Gore answered.
``Thank you for asking, though.''
</P>
<P>
   A second student asked Gore how much money he made, and a third
informed the vice president he wanted him as a father, ``so you can
give me some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had no response.
</P>
<P>
   The class also inquired about Gore's preferred car model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeeps,'' Gore said, managing to stay on message. ``I like
American cars. Made by the UAW (United Auto Workers).''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore visited the construction site of a
building at 24th Street and Camelback, where he shook hands with
about 30 members of the local construction, electrical and
pipe-fitting unions.
</P>
<P>
   During a picture-taking session with the hard-hat-wearing
workers, Ron Harvey, an electrician, yelled out, ``Kick McCain's
butt!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Republican Party has ever shown any interest
in organized labor at all,'' Harvey, a Gore supporter, said. &QL;

HULL HEADS DELEGATION TO MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
Gov. Jane Hull heads to Mexico City on Oct. 12 to seek top support
for her guest worker proposal, which she says would combat illegal
immigra tion while easing U.S. labor short ages.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hull, who has been in office since 1997, will be making her
first trade and protocol visit with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo. The labor program is just one of many Arizo na-focused
proposals she plans to discuss during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hull grabbed headlines from her counterparts at the
Border Governor's Conference in Tijuana, Baja California Norte, by
declaring that Arizona would be an ideal place to test an updated
version of the braceros program that was begun in the 1940s as a
way to ease war-re lated labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue I want to keep at the forefront,'' said Hull,
who is sched uled discuss her idea with Zedillo; Rosario Green,
Mexico's secretary of foreign relations, and federal immi gration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd like (their) support.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull will lead a 40-member delega tion that includes Arizona
business chiefs and state agency heads who will be included in a
series of meetings with cabinet ministers and top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among the subjects topping Hull's agenda for her Oct. 13 talk
with Zedillo are:
</P>
<P>
   - Arizona's push to establish the CANAMEX trade corridor _ a
four-lane highway system stretching from Mexico City across the
border at Nogales and continuing north to Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   - A plan to allow U.S.-secured fi nancing for real estate and
other investments made in Mexico by U.S. companies and citizens.
</P>
<P>
   - Opportunities to increase ex changes of faculty and students
among Arizona and Mexican uni versities, as well as increase collab
oration in business, science and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day trip is the latest in a string of pilgrimages to
Mexico City by governors from U.S. states as far from the border as
Florida, Idaho and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   As a border-state governor, Hull says she's well aware of how
shifts in Mexico's economy and government policies affect Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   For example, border towns have been shaken in recent years,
first by the peso devaluation in December 1994, which sharply
reduced Mexi can spending, and lately by spiraling illegal
immigration through Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   But proximity to Mexico has benefits as well. Since 1991, Mexico
has been Arizona's No. 1 trade partner, with exports to Mexico
skyrocketing since the North American Free Trade Alliance took
effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, roughly 19 percent of Arizona's foreign exports,
worth about $2.7 billion, were sold to Mex ico, according to
Stephanie Turner, Mexico liaison for the Arizona De partment of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and her delegation will be getting a first-hand look at a
Mexico in transition. The trip comes just as the presidential
campaign season has begun.
</P>
<P>
   Under Zedillo, the ruling Institu tional Revolutionary Party has
loos ened its former steel grip on Mexico's politics. For the first
time, the president is relinquishing his option to hand-pick his
successor. Instead, the party will hold a pri mary to determine its
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last presidential election in 1994, the country's two
leading opposition parties also have gained strength, a change
expected to in crease the competitiveness of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also has continued to open up Mexico's economy to
privati zation and foreign investment. Plans to dismantle the
Federal Utility Commission, which controls electric power for the
country, is an item of great interest to the heads of the Arizona
utilities traveling with Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Hull hopes to further her Mexico agenda by touring
the Arizona border with Jesus Reyes Heroles, Mexico's ambassador to
the United States. She also plans to follow up on invitations to
hold trade meetings with the governors of Sinaloa and Jalisco
states early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hull says she intends to keep Mexico on her permanent agenda,
but some critics say she was slow to turn her attention south of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to her predecessor, Fife Symington, who cultivated
close ties with his Sonoran counterpart and vigorously defended
Mexico in na tional debates, Hull has been less vocal about Mexican
issues until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Symington met first with Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas,
in 1993 and had three visits with Zedillo between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has met Zedillo briefly in March, when he stopped at Puerto
Penasco for the groundbreaking of a Rocky Point resort being built
with Arizona investment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her election to her own term as governor last
November, she received a letter of congratulations from Zedillo
inviting her to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said she has been busy with state issues and unable
to find time to travel to Mexico City until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a little while to get down there, with the way I
came into office,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's policy adviser on Mexico, Margie Emmermann, who also
served Symington, said Symington was forced to take a prominent
stand on Mexican issues because he served at a time when Mexico was
besieged by crisis, including the peso devalua tion and Congress'
questions about Mexico's fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hull has been in office, how ever, the Mexican economy has
been rebounding and U.S. relations have been on the upswing. As a
result, Emmermann says, events have not pushed Hull to the
frontlines on Mexico issues.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, says Gail Howard, director of economic development for
Ari zona State University, Hull has qui etly continued support for
cross-border partnerships since she replaced Symington as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Governor Hull hasn't been quite as public as Governor
Syming ton was, but certainly the activity level hasn't slowed
down,'' said Howard, one of the authors of the Arizona-Sonora
strategic economic development plan.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hull says she hopes her trip to Mexico will stoke
the fires of NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be able to go and sit down with the president
of Mexico about how we continue to keep NAFTA alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the VIPS traveling with Hull are CEOs and top executives
of a cross-section of Arizona companies, ranging from Art Martori,
a Phoenix businessman whose Mazatlan resort development represents
the largest private Arizona investment in Mex ico, to the
family-run Active Screw &AMP; Fastener from Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send the message that NAFTA is for everybody by
taking a balance delegation,'' Em mermann said. ``We want people to
understand that you don't just sell, you buy, and you don't just
have investment going in, you have invest ment going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the delegation include the presidents of the
Univer sity of Arizona and ASU and executives from the state's
three largest utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Emmermann anticipates that some voters may question a governor's
international venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is one of many states visiting Mexico,'' Emmerman
said. ``I think it's important that people here recognize that.
It's competetive now. We just can't sit back and let other states
try to gain ground on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to be outdone in Mexico by Iowa, it would truly be
a sad thing,'' she said. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE PROTEGE FINALLY MASTERS THE MENTOR 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ During the warm-up before the New York
Jets' 16-6 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Monday night, Bill
Parcells sauntered over to talk to Tom Coughlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill's big on that,'' Coughlin said. ``He'll invariably have a
story to tell you. He'll have something good to say about your team
or about a problem he's having with his team. It's usually straight
talk. No ulterior motive. No con. You can trust in Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Coughlin does.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fifth season as the Jaguars' only coach, Coughlin is
a summa cum laude graduate of the Parcells School of Design and
Motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em a good design,'' Parcells has often said, meaning a
game plan, ``and get 'em to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Coughlin learned in three seasons as the New York
Giants' wide receivers coach under Parcells from 1988 to 1990, when
he earned a Super Bowl XXV ring. He took that knowledge to Boston
College as head coach for three seasons and then to the expansion
Jaguars, who with a 4-1 start. loom as a Super Bowl XXXIV
contender.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar protege-mentor coaching story in the National
Football League. Don Shula, Bill Walsh and Weeb Ewbank learned from
Paul Brown. Dan Reeves and Mike Ditka learned from Tom Landry. Marv
Levy learned from George Allen.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night, Coughlin the protege finally mastered
Parcells the mentor after three losses _ by 34-24 to the Jets in
last season's American Football Conference division playoffs, and
two in 1996 to Parcells's New England Patriots, including that
season's AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to read Bill's mind,'' Coughlin said Monday in a
telephone interview. ``I know his philosophy, he knows mine.
There's no mystery how either one of us is going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Coughlin's philosophy developed during those three
seasons on the Giants' staff after two years on the Packers' staff
and two on the Eagles' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a wide receivers coach,'' Parcells recalled.
``I didn't know much about Tom, but Marion Campbell, who had been
his Eagles coach, mentioned him to me. I met him in Mobile at the
Senior Bowl. I spoke to him for only 10 minutes, but I said to
myself, `I like this guy.' He's Irish Catholic, and so am I. He was
at Rochester, and I was at Hastings. We both paid our dues. He just
needed an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 53, Coughlin had been a young head coach at Rochester
Institute of Technology from 1970 to 1973, just as Parcells had
been a young head coach at little Hastings College in Nebraska in
1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Bill,'' Coughlin remembered, ``every fiber of
his being was about winning and the entire concept of everyone
being involved and understanding the big picture. There was no
selfishness. None of the assistant coaches was ever allowed to get
away with talking about `my position this, my position that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you made a mistake and made a comment that was not team
oriented, you were going to pay for it. He was going to fire away
at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always knew where you stood with Bill in every
circumstance. You didn't need a conference at the end of the season
to sit down and have Bill Parcells tell you what he thought about
you. He told you every day. That was a quality I'd never been
around, and I was appreciative of that. He was not an easy man to
work for, but it was a fun experience for me. I'd never been around
a winner on the professional level before. I learned about the
lengte season, the highs and the lows, the consistency
factor, the going to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, Parcells, who had been the Giants' defensive
coordinator before succeeding Ray Perkins as head coach in 1983,
was thought of mainly as a defensive strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he'd come into our offensive meetings with three or four
ideas that sometimes I would look at him and wonder,'' Coughlin
said. ``But in the game when we did exactly what he thought about
doing, we were successful at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody else on the Jets now or on the Giants then, staff
or players, Coughlin was a verbal victim of Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sarcasm, his sense of humor,'' Coughlin said with a smile.
``When he starts with you, you know it's not going to be your day.
He's going to start on you and he's going to go down through your
players. Some of it was humor and some of it was to get a point
across.''
</P>
<P>
   That point, of course, was how to win the game. And on Monday
night, Tom Coughlin did.

DALAI LAMA HONORS WORKERS FOR FREEDOM

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dalai Lama's message to a packed audience at
the Stephen S. Wise Temple was as constant and humble as his
trademark maroon and saffron robes, even in the midst of opulence
and celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual leader of Tibet _ and the movement to free it _
told the audience to keep up the support that might end Chinese
occupation of his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that support and speaking on behalf of people who
suffer injustice is, in fact, the practice and essence of
spirituality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of a four-day tour of the Los Angeles area,
the Dalai Lama presented Light of Truth awards to three recipients
for their work toward the freeing of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   He drew the spectrum of his American admirers _ limousines and
luxury cars mixed with older-model compacts with ``Free Tibet''
stickers outside the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Canyon resident Ken Greenberg likened the Dalai Lama's
presence to what must have been commanded by Mohandas K. Gandhi,
the Indian independence leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nice thing is he doesn't have to say too much. I
think the medium is the message,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The Light of Truth Award has been given annually to celebrities
such as Martin Scorsese and Richard Gere and activists for their
work publicizing Tibet's plight.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the recipients included American Himalayan founder
Richard Blum, Hugh Richardson, the only Western diplomat in Tibet
from 1936 to 1947 and Danielle Mitterand, widow of the former
French president and leader of her own human rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   She was introduced by actress Sharon Stone at the Monday night
event attended by Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Vice President
Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   After the awards, Blum expressed the same optimism as the Dalai
Lama that their goal is coming closer to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see it yet but there's a real internal struggle
going on (in the Chinese government),'' Blum said. ``But the
hard-liners still have the upper hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama is scheduled to speak Wednesday as part of
Pasadena's Distinguished Speaker Series.

SPEEDY DUCKS BITE SHARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Give the Anaheim Mighty Ducks a five-on-three
man advantage twice in a one-minute span and their speed is bound
to be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne, who had one goal and no assists in the Ducks'
first three games, had three assists in this one. Add to the mix a
TV replay judge who takes a goal away from the opposition and the
result is an Anaheim victory. At least it was on Monday, when the
Ducks were both opportunistic and fortunate in beating the San Jose
Sharks 5-3 before an announced crowd of 13,571 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Olausson and Oleg Tverdovsky scored power-play goals
with a two-man advantage in a 53-second span, giving Anaheim a 3-1
lead after the first period. A goal by Marty McInnis at 2:40 of the
second gave the Ducks a 4-1 lead and knocked Sharks goaltender Mike
Vernon out of the game. At that point, momentum was all on the side
of the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it took some tight checking and consistent defense to help
the Ducks hold on for the victory after a shaky second period in
which San Jose appeared to tie the score at 4-4 until Ron Sutter's
goal was disallowed following a review.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Sharks 18-4 in the final period for a
38-25 overall advantage. The period's only goal was an empty-netter
scored by Steve Rucchin with two seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for the Ducks to hold onto the lead built around
two power-play goals late in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1-1, San Jose's Mike Ricci was sent to
the penalty box for holding at 17:08. Then at the 18:07 mark, Owen
Nolan was sent off for bowling over Ducks goaltender Guy Hebert.
Given a 5-on-3 advantage, it took the Ducks only 58 seconds to
score when Olausson beat Vernon with a low slap shot from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   That goal released one Sharks player from the penalty box, but
Vincent Damphousse was sent in following the goal on a delayed
penalty for obstruction. Handed another 5-on-3 power play, the
Ducks made the score 3-1 when Tverdovsky beat Vernon with a
one-timer from deep in the right faceoff circle at 19:55.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our 5-on-4 still needs a little work, but when you
give us a 5-on-3 . . .'' Ducks left wing Paul Kariya said. ``I'm
just glad we're getting better creating scoring chances 5-on-5.''
</P>
<P>
   Then at 16:30, Hebert gave up a short rebound of a shot by
Sutter and the puck landed at his feet in a pile of bodies just
outside the crease. The puck trickled across the goal line, but
after a review of the play it was determined that Sutter had kicked
the puck into the net and the goal was disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a quarterback taking a couple hits,'' said Hebert.
``I made the save, watched the puck fall loose, and the next thing
I knew my face was in the snow with a guy on top of me and all hell
breaking loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, acquired from Phoenix in the off-season, had a goal
and an assist.

TIME WARNER TO REPORT RISE IN PROFITS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Media giant Time Warner Inc. is expected to
report sharply improved third-quarter earnings Wednesday despite a
significant downturn in its music business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expect Time Warner to
report profits of 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of 6 cents
a share in the year-ago period. Schroder &AMP; Co. has projected cash
flow -- reflecting profits before interest, taxes and amortization
and a key measure for debt-heavy companies like Time Warner -- will
rise 3.7 percent to $1.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cable operations, including TBS, TNT, CNN and the Cartoon
Network, should continue to generate impressive results with cash
flow gains around 20 percent. Strong ratings have enabled networks
to boost advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Premium cable networks HBO and Cinemax, cable systems and
publishing operations will post cash-flow gains around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are less enthusiastic about filmed entertainment, which
includes TV production, and forecasts range from a small decline in
cash flow to single-digit gains. Syndication revenues from
``E.R.,'' ``Friends,'' ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ``The Drew
Carey Show'' should boost results. But Warner Bros. and New Line
movies have been lackluster, including ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' ``Mickey
Blue Eyes,'' ``Detroit Rock City,'' ``Chill Factor'' and ``Iron
Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Music cash flow could decline by more than 20 percent due partly
to softness in key foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner stock has risen more than 200 percent in the last
four years and peaked at $78.25 in April. It closed Monday down
$1.50 at $63.813 despite a ``buy'' rating from Jeffries &AMP; Co.,
which began coverage with an $85 target for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which has extensive operations at Warner Bros. in
Burbank, is expected to release the earnings report before the
market opens Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This time, the war metaphors often used in football were
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Players suffering from cramps were helped off the field like
wounded soldiers by their teammates, many of whom were walking on
unsteady legs themselves. The winning and losing locker rooms
looked like field hospitals as some players were hooked to IVs to
replenish fluids, while others stretched out on the floor or on
training tables, too weary to move or talk. When they could summon
the energy, they peeled off their uniforms in slow motion,
grimacing from the aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours after the AFC playoff game between the San Diego
Chargers and the Miami Dolphins began in the oppressive heat and
humidity in Miami's Orange Bowl, Rolf Benirschke kicked a 29-yard
field goal to give the Chargers a dramatic 41-38 victory in one of
the more memorable playoff games in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers didn't win this game, however, as much as they
survived. They squandered a 24-0 first-quarter lead and trailed the
Dolphins 38-31 in the fourth quarter, tying the score with only 58
seconds remaining in regulation. They wasted their first
opportunity to win in overtime when Benirschke missed a relatively
easy 27-yard field-goal attempt, and escaped defeat when the
Dolphins' Uwe von Schamann had two field-goal tries blocked.
</P>
<P>
   One was by Kellen Winslow, the Chargers' All-Pro tight end, who
did yeoman service on special teams. As the game wore on, the muggy
conditions took their toll on the future Hall of Fame receiver, who
fought off leg cramps to catch 13 passes for 166 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks for both teams were as hot as the weather. Dan
Fouts of the Chargers passed for 433 yards and three touchdowns,
while Don Strock of the Dolphins threw for 403 yards and four
touchdowns. One came on the last play of the first half, ``the hook
and lateral'' devised by Dolphins coach Don Shula. Strock completed
a 15-yard pass to Duriel Harris, who lateraled to Tony Nathan
trailing the play. Nathan ran 25 yards for a touchdown, cutting the
Chargers' lead to 24-17 and changing the momentum of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers survived, but a week later, they faced new
adversity. They lost the AFC Championship Game to the Cincinnati
Bengals in a game played in frigid Riverfront Stadium, where the
wind-chill factor was 40 degrees below zero. nn

JAGUARS BEAT JETS, 16-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A New York Jets team still searching for
its identity could hardly afford the lapses it committed on Monday
night against the Jacksonville Jaguars, a quality club.
</P>
<P>
   There was no consistent running and no clutch passing (at one
point the Jets were 1 for 10 on third-down plays), and despite an
effective defense, there simply weren't enough points scored to
prevent still another defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's 16-6 victory sank the Jets' record to 1-4,
keeping them in the basement of the highly competitive American
Football Conference East. They are the only club in the five-team
division with a losing record and the only one without a victory
over a divisional rival. The Jaguars improved to 4-1 and moved into
a tie with Tennessee for the AFC Central lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as poor an offensive performance as we've had in
a long time, maybe ever since I've been here,'' said Jets Coach
Bill Parcells, who is in his third season with the team.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out, though, that the Jets were still in the game
late in the fourth quarter because of their defensive efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early in the season,'' Parcells said. ``I know it's
slipping a little bit now, but I'm just not ready to give in to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   You know the Jets are in trouble when Jaguars tight end Kyle
Brady, a former Jet, is running neck and neck in catches with
Keyshawn Johnson for much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly the Jets' failure to convert on third down _ they
did it only twice in 14 attempts _ reflected a team with hardly any
thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mirer averaged just over 4 yards a pass play, his 19
completions on 38 attempts good for a mere 164 yards. Although
Johnson led receivers with 8 catches for 94 yards, his two longest
gains came on a final, failed drive in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Brady finished with five catches for 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' final chance to mount a drive for a tie came with less
than four minutes remaining when they found themselves 98 yards
away. But a pass to Eric Green on fourth-and-6 from the Jets' 6
wasn't held, and the Jaguars took over and kicked a final field
goal to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells speaks of the Jets' diminished margin for error since
the series of injuries that has transformed this club from one of
the most high-scoring, innovative teams to one that looks at times
as if it is just trying to get by.
</P>
<P>
   With the injured Vinny Testaverde, Leon Johnson and Wayne
Chrebet out of the lineup, that margin for error was squeezed on
Monday night. There were plays that made the Jets often look
distracted: the inexperienced Robert Farmer bobbled a kickoff in
the end zone, and Corey Sawyer saw a punt bound past him that
turned into an 83-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a swarming Jets defense did its best to chase Mark
Brunell, the Jaguars quarterback, who was escaping time and again.
Often, though, he was forced to throw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell's faked handoffs, his scampering ability and his
left-handed passing had the Jets' defense on its heels early. The
Jaguars went on a 13-play drive that consumed nearly six and a half
minutes and ended with James Stewart's 3-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets had gone three and out in their opening series on short
runs. But Johnson soon took advantage of the rookie cornerback
Fernando Bryant. The 6-foot-3-inch Johnson, who had a 5-inch height
advantage on Bryant, snared a 16-yard Mirer pass. But the drive
failed.
</P>
<P>
   So did most of what the Jets attempted in the opening half. A
Mirer pass intended for Quinn Early bounced off his hands, bounced
off Johnson and wound up being snared by the Jaguars' Blaine
McElmurry.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville got a 32-yard field goal by Mike Hollis, who was
brought close enough by Kyle Brady's 10-yard reception.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Stone took the ensuing kickoff 43 yards to midfield for
the only exciting Jets play of the half. It helped set up John
Hall's 33-yard field goal with less than two minutes remaining,
cutting the Jacksonville lead to 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollis increased the lead again early in the third quarter
with a 44-yard field goal after Reggie Barlow beat Marcus Coleman
for a 32-yard pass play with Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer's problems were hardly unexpected. The Jaguars came in
having stopped opposing quarterbacks from completing a pass more
than 50 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   That statistic was punctuated in Monday night's third quarter:
Mirer threw three passes and completed only one, for 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets got another field goal from Hall in the fourth quarter,
a 42-yarder, to move within 7 points at 13-6. That score was
significant for Hall. It was his longest field goal of the season
and came from the general distance that has given him problems
throughout his career. He had converted less than half his attempts
from the 40 to the 49.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night marked the only time this year that Parcells would
coach against a former assistant _ unless Jim Fassel of the Giants,
who play the Jets on Dec. 5, is considered.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells hired Fassel as the Giants' quarterback coach back in
1991, shortly after the team won the Super Bowl. But Parcells quit
in the spring for health reasons, and Fassel never coached under
Parcells in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jaguars Coach Tom Coughlin, other former assistants to
Parcells who made it as head coaches were Ray Handley, who
succeeded Parcells on the Giants; current Jets assistant head coach
Bill Belichick, who ran the Cleveland Browns, and Chris Palmer, a
one-time assistant at New England, who now coaches the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, who has molded the Jaguars in his image much as
Parcells has done with the Jets, was the Giants' receivers coach
for three seasons in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells came in with a winning record of 5-1 against his former
assistants: His Patriots were 2-1 against the Belichick-coached
Cleveland Browns, and 3-0 against the Coughlin-coached Jaguars,
including two playoff victories. Under Parcells, of course, the
Jets defeated the Jaguars in the divisional playoffs last January.

L.A. SEES SPURT IN FILM PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After lagging behind the 1998 pace in seven of
eight months, activity increased in September in Hollywood
entertainment production outside studio lots, an industry agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall for-profit production in September rose 6.1 percent to
the equivalent of 2,679 days, reflecting a 15.5 percent gain in
movie work and an 81 percent jump in commercials, although TV
activity fell by 14.4 percent and music video work dropped by 3.9
percent, according to the Entertainment Industry Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But since activity already was fading fast in September of 1998,
the increase last month failed to get it back to the 1999 pace. The
year-to-date production rate lagged by 6 percent overall -- by 12.7
percent in feature films and by 9.7 percent in television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a continuation of the same trends of flat
production,'' said EIDC chief Cody Cluff. ``There are no real
surprises since there were sharp fall-offs at this time last year.
TV has been a bit sluggish coming back from hiatus.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said runaway production to lower-cost locales that have
aggressively offered tax breaks, such as Vancouver and Toronto, has
put a damper on Hollywood production of made-for-TV movies, while
studios have been holding down costs and cutting back on the number
of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of this year looks very much like more of the same,''
said Cluff, whose agency obtains the permits for the producers in
80 percent of the off-lot film and video work in Los Angeles
County. ``Commercials should be fairly strong, TV will be strong,
and features may be up slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Major features being shot at Los Angeles area locations include
Eddie Murphy's ``The Nutty Professor 2''; ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' a
car-thief action project with Nicolas Cage; Cuban missile crisis
drama ``13 Days'' with Kevin Costner; ``Bounce'' with Ben Affleck
and Gwyneth Paltrow; an untitled Cameron Crowe project with Frances
McDormand; ``One Night at McCools'' with Paul Reiser, Matt Dillon
and Liv Tyler; and ``Coyote Ugly,'' a Jerry Bruckheimer project.
</P>
<P>
   Several studios plan to close for a longer-than-usual holiday
break at the end of this year, possibly to give themselves more
time to deal with potential Y2K problems. But Cluff said he doubts
the coming of the millennium will have much impact on production
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1997, off-lot activity in Los Angeles soared
before declining in 1998 and this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect next year to look very similar, with a lot of
episodic TV shot in L.A. and a reasonable level of pilot
activity,'' he said. ``We'll see the same low-budget
movies-of-the-week going to Canada. I don't expect to see a
resurgence of features because of the budgetary pressures. We'll
also see lower-budget independent projects filmed at a higher
rate.''

TWO STARS SHINE BRIGHTLY IN PAC-10 GLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As far as can be determined, there is no
coaching-controversy angle for Washington's game Saturday against
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devils coach Bruce Snyder never succeeded Rick Neuheisel.
Nor has he publicly complained that the Washington coach cheated.
He has never coached a Seattle team, as did Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Snyder has not bellyached about Neuheisel's contract,
sideline dress, singing, hair color, play calling or substitution
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Absent these talking points, for the first time in Neuheisel's
rookie year at Washington, we are left with a plain old college
football game between two plain old football teams, one 3-2 and the
other 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. That means this week's stories are about ... players?!
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, too. The Pac-10's two best will be at Husky
Stadium: ASU running back J.R. Redmond and UW quarterback Marques
Tuiasosopo.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, arguments can be made for Stanford wide receiver Troy
Walters and UCLA wide receiver Danny Farmer. But, please, no
arguments for defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the Pac-10 is this year, the defense by conference
members could not be more embarrassing if played in orange fright
wigs, oversize shoes and red noses.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this stat: USC leads the conference in scoring defense
at 24.2 points given up per game. For perspective, that's nearly a
touchdown worse than the highest number since the league began
keeping the stat in 1954: The '97 ASU team surrendered 18.5 points
a game.
</P>
<P>
   For further perspective, the famed Arizona ``Desert Swarm'' in
1992 has the Pac-10 record low at 8.9, followed by the '92
Washington unit's 9.2.
</P>
<P>
   For a conference whose leaders traditionally used to give up
only a couple of touchdowns a game, the '99 defenses are rubble
where once were walls.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about defenseless defenders. In Redmond and
Tuiasosopo, there is some serious star power in a league that is
otherwise nearly lights out.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who is recovering from a shoulder separation Saturday
against Notre Dame, was a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate who
led the Pac-10 last year in all-purpose yards, including 254
against Washington in the 42-38 loss to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Neuheisel: ``There's reasons why he's considered a top-10
pick in the NFL draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of Tuiasosopo are slightly more elusive, though far
more influential in the UW season. The fact is that teams can load
up to stop Redmond, as Notre Dame did last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Loading up to stop Tuiasosopo is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington's line and running backs deserve credit for
some of the improvement in the offense _ the Huskies have averaged
almost 39 minutes of possession time in their three consecutive
wins _ Tuiasosopo's versatility has made it difficult for defenses
to do anything but play Washington straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo made the point well Saturday on the opening drive
against the Beavers. Running the option around the right side, he
kept the ball until three defenders were taking him down. Then he
flipped a long, dangerous pitch to running back Willie Hurst, who
one-handed the ball behind him and scored from 41 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of ``no-no! ... yes-yes!'' play that makes
football coaches familiar with the acronym EKG. It's also the kind
of play that defines stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Marques thinks he can make that play, then I think it's a
good decision,'' Neuheisel said. ``That's why you recruit big-time
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Snyder put it, ``I think he's a really amazing performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo's deftness with the option is no real surprise. What
has improved this season is his sometimes suspect throwing.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting on 58 percent of his passes with seven touchdowns
and five interceptions. Partly because of a lack of speed at wide
receiver, Tuiasosopo is still not throwing deep _ his longest
completion is 36 yards _ but he's also only a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe he can be a very talented drop-back
quarterback on Sundays,'' Neuheisel said, referring to an NFL
future.
</P>
<P>
   But early on, it was what he wasn't doing in the mental game
that left Tuiasosopo aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to the team for my poor play in the first two
games,'' he said, referring to losses to BYU and Air Force. ``I
wasn't doing everything I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   He bumped up the work load in practice _ more film study, route
practice with receivers and playbook self-tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responses to every situation had to be cleaner and
faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results are most obvious in the fourth quarter. Through five
games, he has 28 completions in 40 attempts for 338 yards and four
TDs, with one pick. He also has rushed for 62 yards, giving him 400
yards of total offense in final periods.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of those accomplishments contribute to
controversies about coaching. It just makes for entertaining,
winning football, a consolation prize for which Huskies fans must
learn to adjust.

BRUCE RITTER, 72, DIES, LED COVENANT HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Bruce Ritter, who founded a shelter for
runaways in 1969 and then resigned under pressure as its president
in 1990 after being accused of financial and sexual improprieties,
died Thursday at his farmhouse near Decatur, N.Y. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin L. Meyers, the director of the Meyers Funeral Home in
Delmar, N.Y., said that the cause of death was cancer. A private
memorial Mass was held Saturday at Ritter's farmhouse. Meyers, who
did not attend the service, said Ritter had contacted him nearly a
year ago to make funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Ritter founded Covenant House in the Lower East Side of
Manhattan as a shelter for runaways. By 1989, the organization had
become an immensely successful international charity, with programs
in 15 cities in North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Covenant House, which at its height served as many 25,000
youths, began to founder in late 1989 when two men accused Ritter
of having had sexual relations with them when they were teen-agers.
He was later accused of misusing Covenant House money.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter denied the accusations of both financial and sexual
misconduct, and Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said
there was not enough evidence of financial misconduct to charge him
with a crime. Ritter resigned in February 1990, saying in a
prepared statement: ``The controversy that has surrounded me for
the past three months has made it impossible for me to lead
Covenant House effectively. Therefore, after a great deal of
thought and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that in the best
interests of Covenant House and, most especially, for the
well-being of thousands of street kids, I should resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ritter was born John Ritter in Trenton, N.J., on Feb. 25,
1927, taking the name Bruce in 1947 when he entered the Order of
Friars Minor Conventual. He was ordained in Rome in 1956 as a
member of the Franciscan order. It was unclear on Monday night
whether he remained with the order.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1990 profile of Ritter, The Los Angeles Times reported that
he had done all of his work for his doctorate except publish his
dissertation. By all accounts, he was regarded as an excellent
teacher in the theology department at Manhattan College in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   With permission from his Franciscan superiors, Ritter made his
way to the East Village in 1968 with a passionate but unformed
determination to help the poor and the homeless. Hugh O'Neill, a
former student of Ritter's at Manhattan College, described Covenant
House in those days _ an apartment for six children who had asked
Ritter for shelter during a winter storm _ as just a ``crash pad
for runaways.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his resignation, Ritter had kept a low public profile and,
as his private memorial Mass indicated, only his closest friends
were allowed knowledge of his illness or his death.

EVEN PARCELLS CAN'T SAVE THIS SEASON FOR THE JETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Recently, Bill Parcells privately
fretted that the season was one of the most disastrous and painful
of his coaching career. Then, at about 10:20 p.m. on Monday, as the
Jacksonville Jaguars jumped to a 10-0 lead over the New York Jets,
effectively ending the game, things got worse for the all-world
coach. His season became as dead as the artificial turf at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' season is over. It's dead. And not even a miracle
worker like Parcells can revive it.
</P>
<P>
   The man who put the knife to Parcells's throat with
Jacksonville's 16-6 victory was his good friend, Tom Coughlin,
coach of the Jaguars. The two men are buddies, but this is
business.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin may have done Parcells a favor, putting him out of his
misery fairly early in what promises to be a frustrating season for
the Jets. This is a bad year for an American Football Conference
East team to start its first five games with just one victory like
the Jets have done. That is because there are three probable and
four possible playoff teams in Buffalo, Miami, New England and
maybe the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are not offensively equipped to compete with their
division neighbors. What was once unthinkable is now a reality. The
Jets are the worst team in the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. The Bills have one of the most dangerous offensive
players in the league in Doug Flutie. (The Jets have Rick Mirer.)
The Dolphins have Dan Marino and Cecil Collins. (The Jets have Rick
Mirer.) The Patriots have Drew Bledsoe, and the Colts have Peyton
Manning, two outstanding passers. (The Jets have you-know-who.)
</P>
<P>
   In order to bounce back from a 1-4 start, New York would need a
strong passer. Having wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson in the arsenal
isn't enough. Running back Curtis Martin isn't enough. As Marino
showed on Sunday against Indianapolis and Flutie showed against
Pittsburgh, quarterback play often makes all the difference in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is not one of those difference makers. He is incapable of
leading the Jets on a winning steak of five or six games, which is
what the team would need just to keep up with the Joneses. Or even
the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Parcells, calling the plays on offense, does
not trust Mirer. On New York's first offensive series, Mirer did
not throw a pass, a conservative and curious move for a team in
such a dire situation. Mirer might not be any good, but to not have
him throw one pass on the opening series? What kind of tone does
that set for an offense?
</P>
<P>
   Mirer's longest pass completion of the first half was 16 yards.
Parcells mostly restricted Mirer to short throws and screen passes.
Last week against Denver, which had yet to win a game, Parcells,
figuring he had nothing to lose, let Mirer throw downfield more.
This game, Parcells pocketed the deep routes.
</P>
<P>
   It did not take long for the Jaguars to take advantage of the
Jets' dreary offensive situation. New York's defense played hard,
but without any chance offensively, Jacksonville began to wear New
York down. The first touchdown drive went 61 yards in 13 plays. The
Jaguars' second scoring drive ended with a 42-yard Mike Hollis
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   So with over five minutes left in the first half the Jaguars had
a 10-0 lead. For most teams that is not an insurmountable number,
but for the Jets it is. They had already lost.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer is not the kind of player, like Flutie, for example, who
gets tougher as the situation darkens. As the Jets fell further
behind, 13-3 in the third quarter, Mirer's throws got sloppier,
picking up a wobble here and there. One third-down pass sailed a
foot over Johnson's head, causing the emotional wide receiver to
curse angrily as he walked toward the Jets sideline. Mirer finished
the game having 19 completions for 164 yards on 38 attempts with 2
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the Jets now is what will this season do to
Parcells? Maybe, he can salvage an 8-8 finish _ if that happened
he'd deserve coach of the year. A much more likely scenario is four
or five victories. That, of course, would tear up the coach inside,
but would it inspire him to return for another shot, or cause him
to walk away in frustration?
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' season may be done, but all is not lost. Like the
turf, all the Jets will have to do this off season is tinker.
Quarterback Vinny Testaverde will return from his injury, and later
this season Wayne Chrebet will be back. The Jets can reload and
make a legitimate championship run.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a long way away. Until then, brace for an ugly
season. &QL;

 CLOSS BATTLING TO STAY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Finally realizing his NBA career may be on life
support, Keith Closs is attempting to make the necessary
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to treat every day like my last day,'' said Closs, a
7-foot-3 enigma now entering his third NBA season after
masquerading as a potential shot-blocking fiend for the Lakers'
entry in the 1997 Summer Pro League at Long Beach State. That
performance convinced former Clippers coach Bill Fitch the team
would be wise to sign Closs to a multi-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie under Fitch, he played 740 minutes spread across 58
games. In the lockout-compressed season of 1999, Closs' confounding
disinterest earned 87 minutes in 15 games for Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Closs, who's on the books for $1.6 million this year and a club
option for another $4 million over two additional seasons, is
candid about the history of his NBA production.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't prepare myself the last two years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``A sour attitude and immaturity.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that when Closs' number was called, his lack of
dedication to getting stronger (he may exceed 215 pounds if his
last meal included dessert) allowed opposing centers to push him
around.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first week of Clipper basic training this season, the
agile lefty has shown signs of competence. In a recent scrimmage,
he grabbed 15 rebounds, and even scored 15 points as an innocent
bystander while some slick passing was being committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm doing so-so,'' said Closs, who realizes he needs
to take many steps forward before being considered a legitimate
backup center. ``Everyone says I'm playing well. But there's still
a lot of room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had to deal with that sour attitude and immaturity
last season, has chosen to wait before turning cartwheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been coming on time and doing the things he's supposed to
do,'' Ford said. ``Hopefully, it will continue.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wright's place, time: &UR; !off! &LR;  When free agent Lorenzen Wright
priced himself out of the Clipper market, his subsequent
sign-and-trade deal with Atlanta yielded two future first-round
draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   It also cleared a path for Brian Skinner, a second-year Clipper
who has the size (6-9, 250), strength and lunch-pail approach to
take Wright's minutes as the backup center/power forward.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive off-season work, Skinner - the team's choice
with the 21st pick in the 1998 draft - appears ready to make an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's going to have to give us minutes,'' Ford said. ``He's
going to have to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   In 258 minutes over 21 games last season, Skinner produced 2.5
rebounds and 4.1 points per game. Those numbers should grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to be more of a force,'' said Skinner, who also is
aware of his job description. ``I'm a role player, someone who does
all the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   Having NBA experience followed by a full training camp is a
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This biggest difference this year is that I've learned to slow
the game down,'' said Skinner, who admitted to feeling like he was
caught in a whirlwind as a rookie. ``It feels slower now; I can see
things develop.''
</P>
<P>
   So can teammate Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a very important part of this team,'' Taylor
said of Skinner. ``It looks like his skills have caught up to his
body. Brian's always going to be in great shape. He's one of the
strongest guys in our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Veteran point guard Eric Murdock, acquired from
New Jersey in exchange for Johnny Newman (who was acquired from
Cleveland in the Lamond Murray deal) injured his left ankle in
Sunday night's scrimmage and will miss tonight's exhibition opener
vs. the Golden State Warriors at the San Jose Arena. ... Ford is
expected to start the same five that finished last season - Troy
Hudson and Eric Piatkowski in the backcourt, with Tyrone Nesby and
Taylor at forward, and Michael Olowokandi in the middle.

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Starting in 2001, the University of Houston will no longer be the
lone Texas school in Conference USA. Texas Christian University is
leaving the Western Athletic Conference to join C-USA in all sports
two years from now.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In other action taken by the 14 C-USA presidents Monday in New
York:
</P>
<P>
   Southern Methodist, considered a possible defector from the WAC
with the Horned Frogs, was not issued an invitation to join C-USA.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida, a C-USA member in all other sports, was added as
a football member starting in 2003. It will become a Division I-A
independent two seasons before that and likely will play several
C-USA schools in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina, already a Conference USA football member, will
compete in all other sports starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the presidents' decisions, C-USA will have a
14-team basketball conference and an 11-team football conference.
Commissioner Mike Slive indicated no additions are planned in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about SMU, which reportedly initiated discussions with the
conference before TCU, Slive said, ``The board (of presidents) has
finished its consideration of expansion for the moment.'' But,
added Slive, ``You never say never.''
</P>
<P>
   UH president Arthur Smith again referred to the obvious
advantages to the Cougars of adding another Texas school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a significant effect in reducing travel costs,
and it is a school our fans can easily travel to,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cougars football coach Kim Helton: ``It is an honor to have
another Texas institution playing football in our conference, and
it is exciting to revive this rivalry. The addition of South
Florida brings even more credibility. I believe this expansion
solidifies us as one of the toughest football leagues, top to
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Slive noted that until they become full-fledged league members,
the conference will provide ``scheduling help'' for South Florida
in football and East Carolina in basketball and other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Once all 14 schools are in place, the most likely basketball
alignment will consist of two divisions of seven schools. Each
would play its division rivals home-and-home, with four games
against teams in the other division making a total of 16 conference
games. The addition of SMU would have resulted in an unwieldy
15-team basketball league, although the resulting 12 football
members would have fostered a natural two-division alignment and
league championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Slive indicated a football playoff is not an urgent concern at
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the board or the athletic directors felt that (a
football playoff ) was a driving force in our thinking,'' Slive
said. ``Rather, it is, How do we best deal with our market, and how
do we make football and basketball grow? We're a league that has
made a marriage of football and basketball work, and this doesn't
change that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Slive declined to reveal financial details, TCU reportedly
will pay a $2 million entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   Adding TCU gives the conference a presence in the nation's
seventh-biggest TV market (Dallas-Fort Worth), but neither TCU nor
SMU seems to produce large audiences. The Frogs, however, have had
more successful football and men's basketball programs of late.
Last season's Sun Bowl win over Southern Cal under new coach Dennis
Franchione was TCU's first bowl victory in 41 years. And Billy
Tubbs has coached the Frogs to a 101-56 basketball record in five
years, including one NCAA Tournament trip and two NIT appearances
over the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Slive described the additions to a league that is in its fourth
football season and approaching its fifth basketball season as
``part of our continued growth in a rational, reasonable way. There
were some important parts of the country we want to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   With TCU headed to its third conference in a seven-year period
(since the dissolution of the Southwest Conference was announced),
Rice president Malcolm Gillis said: ``We are quite pleased SMU is
staying in the WAC. This is pretty good news. There was a view that
both might go (to C-USA). I never thought that, because I couldn't
see how they (C-USA) would want two schools in one TV market.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU athletic director Eric Hyman referred to the advantages of
playing in a conference based in the Central and Eastern time zones
without a direct reference to the WAC's problems with media
attention in the western United States. Said Hyman, ``The
association with Conference USA enhances our brand identification
and places TCU in a position to take advantage of the marketing of
the entire institution. TCU's vision is to have a nationally
prominent athletics program, and that vision is the driving
influence behind our future membership in C-USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Copeland, SMU's athletic director, began discussions with
C-USA more than a year ago. The Mustangs will move into their new
$56.5 million, 32,500-seat football stadium next year.
</P>
<P>
   Said Copeland, ``We just need to strengthen our own program and
the WAC.''
</P>
<P>
   East Carolina has done that in short order, hiring Bill Herrion
from Drexel and spending $12 million to improve its basketball
arena as part of a $50 million upgrading of facilities in the last
five years. The Pirates currently compete in the Colonial Athletic
Association in all sports but football, where they are ranked No.
23.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida, largely a commuter school in the Tampa-St.
Petersburg market, has 36,000 students and averaged more than
30,000 in football attendance in its first two seasons. Lee Roy
Selmon, the pro and college football Hall of Famer, launched the
Bulls' highly successful fund-raising effort for the football
program.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Rockets coaches finally had to kick Cuttino Mobley off the court.
It was the offseason, his time. But he was working so hard, pushing
himself so relentlessly, that he was wearing out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The guy plays every day,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``He's a guy we had to tell (to) take a little time off this
summer to recharge himself. He got a little bit stale.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley just couldn't bear to remove himself from the floor. He
was too quick for the defenders who would make their way to the
Westside Tennis Club pickup games of NBA players. His shot was too
sure. Teammates had begun to clear out for him, even in the
relatively unstructured world of pickup basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing ball,'' Mobley said. ``That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley finally banished himself from the Westside court for a
few days. But when the Rockets reconvened last week for training
camp and Monday's return to their usual workout facility, there was
no letup. He was too quick for most defenders. His shot was sure.
Teammates cleared out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you play, the more mentally tough you get,'' Mobley
said. ``It's getting easier for me. I'm more comfortable with what
I'm doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard. I worked on everything. I worked to mold myself
into a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Mobley has become a different player than he was
as a rookie last season. He was confident then _ ``I've always been
confident,'' he says _ but the swagger seemed almost affected, as
if he had to announce his intention of making it in a league that
had allowed him to be drafted in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he seems no less confident but more self-assured,
more grounded. His play, while still explosive, has been
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just maturity,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He is growing as a
player. It's all been there. That's what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, meanwhile, have grown around Mobley, and every
change seems to have benefited him as if designed only for him.
</P>
<P>
   The trade to acquire Steve Francis assured the planned move of
Mobley from point guard to off guard.
</P>
<P>
   With Francis and Shandon Anderson in the backcourt, the Rockets
became determined to run, fitting Mobley's high-speed talents.
</P>
<P>
   And because they had to deal Michael Dickerson to land Francis,
even the acquisition of Anderson did not take away Mobley's
opportunity to play the shooting-guard position that better suits
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuttino is playing great,'' forward Charles Barkley said.
``He's at his more natural position now, the two guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't see but out of one eye when he plays the point. He's
a better scorer than a passer, plain and simple. He's got retinitis
pigmentosa. When he dribbles the ball at the point, he can't see.
But he's a better scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mobley's vision is fine. But Barkley was not
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be a reason he was missing all those wide-open
guys,'' Barkley insisted. ``Something had to be wrong with his
eyesight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley, as he did throughout his rookie season as one of
Barkley's favorite targets, quickly responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't see on `D' at all,'' Mobley said. ``It was
retinitis both-eyes-atosa.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley does not deny, however, he was out of position last
season as the Rockets' starting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had confidence, but you play at different levels at
different positions,'' Mobley said. ``I've always been a two, a
scorer. I'm back at my real position. I'm sure I improved, but I'm
at my natural position. It gives me the opportunity to be more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a learning experience. It helped me to be better
prepared. It will help me a lot at the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said the Rockets always knew Mobley was better
suited to off guard. He needed Mobley at the point last season and
asked him to do the best he could. But as a shooting guard, Mobley
can be a weapon, one of the reasons for the Rockets' rampant
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``At point, the matchup is with a smaller guy that can stay in
front of him more,'' Tomjanovich said. ``When he had his big games
early, it was as a two. I think he's a tough matchup for a two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really attacking the basket. He is sort of ending up in
an iso situation. He gets those openings in the offense, and he's
really attacking. Putting him at point guard sort of neutralized
his strength _ that's being a very good ball-handler at the two.''
</P>
<P>
   But as strong as that part of his game might be, Mobley might be
even more effective in the open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fits his strength,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He's an
open-court guy, a great runner, great endurance. He attacks the
basket aggressively, but he sets that up with the outside shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mobley, ``I think I have the advantage because I'm a real
quick two. It should be a lot of fun, especially with Steve and
Shandon with me. It's a lot of fun playing with guys that want to
run up and down.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Cowboys' devastating loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday
took a back seat to concern for a teammate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news Monday was as good as they could have hoped as the
Cowboys learned receiver Michael Irvin had returned to Dallas and
is expected to be able to play again sometime this season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin suffered trauma to his spinal cord when his helmet slammed
into the artificial turf as he was being tackled during the first
quarter of Sunday's 13-10 Dallas loss at Veterans Stadium. Irvin
was on the ground for 10 minutes and was eventually strapped to a
stretcher and sent via ambulance to the spinal unit of a
Philadelphia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin spent the night in the hospital but was able to walk out
Monday afternoon. He wore a protective collar around his neck but
was able to make the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will see specialists in the Dallas area. There is no
timetable for his return, but it is not believed to be a
career-ending injury. Irvin, who has missed games because of
suspension, has not missed a game with an injury since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really too hard to tell how long he's going to be out
right now,'' Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said. ``We're optimistic
that Mike will be back this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in Philadelphia discovered swelling and herniated disks
in two spots in Irvin's spinal cord, one injury to the C3-C4
cervical vertebrae, the other farther down in the C6-C7 vertebrae.
The latter is thought to be a pre-existing condition not related to
Sunday's injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin will undergo an MRI Wednesday, which will be compared
to one made immediately after the injury. Doctors will then be able
to evaluate if the swelling has been reduced. Irvin is on
medication to help alleviate that swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they got a pretty good picture of everything he
incurred,'' Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin reported some numbness, particularly in his hands,
immediately after the hit. He never lost consciousness or suffered
paralysis, though he complained of neck pain. By Monday, he had
full motor functions intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons he's being released as early as
today,'' Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will definitely miss Monday night's contest in New York
against the Giants. The Cowboys will not speculate further.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Mills replaced Irvin after the injury and caught two balls
for 16 yards. Jason Tucker and Jeff Ogden also filled in, Tucker
catching one pass for six yards. The Cowboys will also use rookie
Wane McGarity, who has been on the inactive list for the past two
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense, which had 191 yards in the first half,
managed only 109 in the second, largely because of the lack of a
passing game. Quarterback Troy Aikman completed 21 of 39 attempts
for only 177 yards, with two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   With Irvin out of the game, the Eagles were able to key on
Rocket Ismail, taking away the Cowboys' deep threat. Ismail caught
a game-high seven passes for 88 yards, 25 on a reception early in
the fourth quarter. Aikman's next-longest completions of the
afternoon were a pair of nine-yarders, one to Emmitt Smith for a
touchdown, the other to tight end David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, their attention goes to Rocket at that time,''
Aikman said. ``But they did a nice job of getting underneath our
intermediate stuff and forcing us to come underneath. And that's
fine. Those things happen, and there's nothing wrong with that. We
just didn't establish anything. Rocket did as well as he could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has been a great player for this organization for a
long time. He's made a lot of big plays in a lot of big games.
We're going to miss his presence, and we'll miss his competitive
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he will explore the possibility
of adding another receiver if doctors determine Irvin will be out
for several weeks. Former Cowboy Alvin Harper has already made his
interest in returning to the team known. Harper, who has been out
of the NFL since the end of the 1997 season, was at Valley Ranch
working out for the coaching staff last week.

<P>
   DALLAS _ On Aug. 9, Robert Pack's beeper was mysteriously
``blowing up'' with one 911 message after another. Soon afterward,
his mother telephoned from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What had the Pack household in an uproar was a ``New York Post''
story that said the Mavericks' point guard had been arrested in
Harlem, N.Y., in the wee hours of the morning and charged with
harassment and criminal contempt for violating an order of
protection against an ex-girlfriend. The story went on to say that
Pack arrived at the woman's home at 3:20 a.m. and started shouting
threats at her.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the story is that Pack was nowhere near
Harlem. He had been at his mother's home in Houston the night
before, and caught a flight back to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation, it was discovered that another man _
Anwar Bostick of West Orange, N.J. _ had been posing as Pack. The
damage done to Pack's name and reputation is still being assessed
by Pack's lawyer, Anthony Hilliard, who is out of the country and
couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>

   ``We're trying to get to the point of me being exonerated from
everything that he's possibly done as Robert Pack, including
getting married,'' Pack said. ``From my understanding, he married a
girl last December, and he supposedly met her in August as Robert
Pack. So we know for at least a year, he's been saying he's Robert
Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   What Pack doesn't understand is how a mixup such as this could
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBostick\S doesn't resemble me at all, that's the crazy
thing,'' said Pack, a dark-skinned African-American. ``I haven't
met him, but from my understanding he's a light-skinned guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is he was able to wine and dine women with
limousines, and they would think he could do that from being a
professional player. But before they knew it, he would either have
their credit cards and was doing some things with it. That was
tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the impersonation succeeded as long as it did was it
occurred when the NBA had locked out its players in a labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBostick\S had the perfect alibi with us being locked out and
him being able to entertain the women during that period of time,''
Pack said. ``He knew he didn't have to be on the road, and he
didn't have to be at practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they caught him, and he's been arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack signed as a free agent with the New Jersey Nets on July 31,
1996, and was involved in a nine-player trade that sent him to the
Mavericks on Feb. 17, 1997. He never purchased a home in New Jersey
and said having his name dragged through a police report for
something he didn't do has cause irreparable harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just left my mother's house \Rin Houston\S on a Sunday
night for a family dinner, and I had to come to Dallas because I
wanted to do my workout schedule,'' Pack said. ``Then she called me
and said, `Baby, you said you were catching a plane and you were
going back to Dallas.' I said, `Yeah, I told you that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then she said, `They've got you in New Jersey harassing some
woman.' She knew it wasn't me, but I know deep down it hurt her
immediately to see my face coming across the ``New York Post'' with
a picture in there saying something that she knew I wouldn't have
possibly done.''
</P>
<P>
   Pack said women need to be more skeptical when guys say they are
professional athletes. He also said the incident has forever
changed his life, and that a lawsuit will likely be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny when you watch TV shows, or movies, where people's
identities have been stolen,'' Pack said. ``You see that and you
sit back and wonder, `Man, that's tough; that would be terrible to
go through.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it actually hits home, and to be a part of it, it was
devastating. And I don't think the whole thing is over.''

COWBOYS LOOK TO OTHER RECEIVERS AS IRVIN SIDELINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The prognosis for Cowboys wide receiver Michael
Irvin to play again this season is excellent. Precisely when he
will return has not been determined, but the Cowboys anticipate he
could be out as long as six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who suffered a spinal contusion that resulted in fluid
and swelling of the spinal cord after being driven to the turf
head-first during Sunday's 13-10 loss at Philadelphia, was released
yesterday from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital after being
held overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones sent his private jet to take Irvin's
wife, Sandi, from Dallas to Philadelphia yesterday morning to be
with her husband. The plane returned both of them to Dallas late
yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is premature as to when he will return to the field,'' said
Jones, ``but based on everything that has been done so far, and
these were among the best spine specialists in the world, we are
optimistic that Michael will return this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be coming back to Dallas this soon unless
everything was positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will wear a collar to stabilize his head and neck for at
least a week. The 33-year-old receiver will be definitely be out
for Monday night's game against the New York Giants at The
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has all his motor skills after experiencing some numbness
and loss of feeling in his extremities while lying motionless on
the Veterans Stadium turf for nearly 20 minutes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for Irvin's return will begin to be defined when
the spinal cord swelling subsides. He is on anti-inflammatory
medication to reduce the swelling, according to Cowboys trainer Jim
Maurer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael will be \Rsidelined\S for awhile,'' said Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey. ``How long we don't know yet, but it will be for
awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cowboys source said it could be as much as six to eight weeks.
Irvin has not missed that many games since he sat out the first
five of the 1996 season due to a drug suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Gailey explained what the Cowboys will be missing
without Irvin in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there was a great deal of confidence and a great
relationship between Troy \RAikman\S and Mike on that one side,''
Gailey said. ``And the great season Rocket \RIsmail\S was having,
and the threat he was bringing on the other side, created a great
balance for our passing attack. We're going to have to find a way
to keep teams off balance and not allow them to take away one
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, who leads the Cowboys with 20 catches for 376 yards,
benefited in the first four games while opponents focused double
coverage on Irvin. Gailey figured that double coverage was going to
swing to Rocket's side and open up some play-making opportunities
for Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Those opportunities now will probably fall to veteran Ernie
Mills and rookie Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   Mills became a go-to receiver last season when he caught 28
passes for 479 yards, four touchdowns and a 17.1 yards-per-catch
average. As part of the tandem replacing Irvin, Mills will likely
be used in more a possession role, running the third-and-eight
routes.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, the rookie from Texas, brings speed and quickness to
the mix. He has been inactive the past two games behind former TCU
reciever Jason Tucker, who is more versatile, according to Cowboys
coaches. But McGarity's quickness off the line could lead to some
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and second-year receiver Jeff Ogden will continue to play
in the Cowboys' four-wide offense. Aikman showed some confidence in
Tucker by looking for him in the fourth quarter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys will not look outside to sign a receiver
such as former Cowboy Alvin Harper, who worked out for the team
last week, right now.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly, one player cannot replace Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has made a lot of big plays in a lot of big games for
us,'' Aikman said. ``We'll miss his presence. We'll miss his
competitiveness. Hopefully, it's only two weeks. But we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was ``upbeat and laughing with his wife,'' yesterday,
according to Jones. Maurer said that Irvin earlier was heavily
sedated and immobilized to ensure his comfort overnight at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has done well,'' Maurer said. ``He has been on some
medication to help with the swelling that has occurred in his neck.
\RThe biggest concern\S is probably the subsiding of the fluid and
general symptoms that he might incur _ neck stiffness, soreness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Dossett, a Cowboys team physician, will evaluate
Irvin tomorrow, but Maurer said even then, because of the spinal
cord swelling and the early stage of the injury, a prognosis for
his return might not be known until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority is Michael's health,'' Gailey said. ``We're
fortunate ... it's not like not like he will be out forever or will
never play again.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ By all accounts, Astros fans are either hurt, sad, angry
or frustrated, or some combination thereof, depending on the time
of day and the alcohol content of the beverage in front of them.
They want answers, accountability. They're tired of talk. They're
demanding results.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they've become just like Braves fans.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is relative, isn't it? There may be three people here
outside the Atlanta organization who thought the Braves' beating
the Astros was a big deal, worthy of a champagne body spritzer. The
Mets' arrival for the National League Championship Series,
Atlanta's eighth since 1991, hardly elicits more than a loud scoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets?'' Braves fans are saying. ``Didn't we teach them a
lesson already? Didn't we just finish using their ugly mugs to drag
the infield?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets? Forget about it. Bring us the Yankees, and then
we'll get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves may be baseball's undisputed team of the decade, but
that's based on regular-season consistency, not postseason magic.
Remember, they have exactly one more world championship than the
Astros do, and they haven't gone to the World Series the last two
years, either, losing first to the rent-a-Marlins and then to the
plucky Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans, by and large, are bored with the Braves. The Tomahawk
Chop is passe. Ted and Jane hardly turn heads anymore. Greg Maddux,
Tom Glavine and John Smoltz might as well be Curly, Larry and Moe
except to the most hard-core faithful. As for Chipper Jones, what's
he got to be so chipper about?
</P>
<P>
   Hit the ball, chump.
</P>
<P>
   It's show-us-the-money time in Atlanta. Enough talk; give us the
walk. Perhaps the worst thing the Braves could have done this
season is to win 103 games despite a run of illness and injury
almost equal to what the Astros endured. See, it kept expectations
normal, which is to say Atlanta must win the World Series or be
branded a big bust.
</P>
<P>
   New York's AL pinstripes, not its NL pinheads, are the challenge
the Braves are expected to meet head-on. The Mets are the
undercard, practically beneath their contempt, if you'd heard Bobby
Cox's boys dissing them _ with good reason _ last month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tough-talking wild cards come in with the same
nothing-to-lose attitude the Marlins and Padres possessed before
them. Since things tend to even out over the long haul in baseball,
New York's losing nine of 12 to the Braves this year, including
five of six during a 10-day September swoon, may be bad for the
Atlantas now, given how October tends to bring out the insecurity
and self-doubt in them.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston series couldn't have provided much of a lift. The
Braves know they were lucky to escape the Astros unharmed. Only
Kevin Millwood, the upstart member of the Fab Four starting
rotation, pitched impressively, and only Brian Jordan swung a
heroic bat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's little in the matchups to suggest the Mets stand
a chance. New York wouldn't even have made the playoffs if
Cincinnati hadn't found a way to lose two of three in Milwaukee on
the final weekend. Bobby Valentine is the greatest also-ran manager
since Gene Mauch, and his team was plotting a mutiny until its
fortunes suddenly turned at the last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the Mets showed something in beating the 100-game winners
from the desert. But the Diamondbacks were really just a puffed-up
expansion team with deep pockets playing in a division full of
overpaid underachievers. They weren't ready to be here, and now
they are gone.
</P>
<P>
   For the Braves, the NLCS has practically become their
birthright. However, their experiences in same haven't been
especially life-giving. Tonight's starter, Maddux, for example, is
3-6 with a 3.96 ERA in league championship play. Glavine's vitals
are 3-8, 3.93. His eight defeats are a record for the round.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz alone (6-2, 2.58) has been routinely exceptional in the
NLCS, yet elbow problems made a mess of his latest season, and the
Astros reaffirmed his vulnerability Saturday with their too-little,
too-late rally.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was magnificent with his one-hitter against Houston
after a breakthrough regular season. But this is his first
postseason, and as the pressure mounts, his inner strength will be
challenged accordingly. Playoff-wise, he remains a bit of an
unknown quantity.
</P>
<P>
   We favor the Braves to win because they are the Braves, but we
view them with extreme suspicion nonetheless. A superior team to
this one lost three in a row to San Diego a year ago, then bowed
out in six, dropping all three at home by batting .140 and scoring
only two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ran Atlanta's Turner Field postseason losing streak
to four last week before Millwood stopped the bleeding. So,
honestly, a Mets victory wouldn't be that amazin'.

MODANO, SYDOR FEEL READY TO GO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mike Modano remembers sitting in his hospital
room, not too long after being told by doctors that he was very,
very lucky not to be paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck happened to you?'' Modano asked.
</P>
<P>
   His eye blackened and bloody, scrapes lining his temples, Sydor
looked worse than a groggy and sore Modano felt.
</P>
<P>
   Now, only 10 days removed from that scene, Modano and Sydor were
once again talking yesterday. Of how the heck they've managed to
return so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Both players participated in full-contact drills yesterday at
practice, including getting bumped and banged and tested, and said
they felt good enough afterward to play again. So coach Ken
Hitchcock said he expects them to be in his lineup when the Stars
play San Jose at 6:30 tomorrow night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could've been it for both of them ... ,'' Hitchcock said,
stopping himself before he ventured into a very, very scary land of
what ifs. ``What we got away with was the best-case scenario
because it could've been much worse with both players. You catch
breaks individually and collectively, and this was one we caught
breaks on with both guys.''
</P>
<P>
   What-ifs remain a scary territory of contemplation for Modano
and Sydor.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor suffered a hairline fracture to his left eye socket after
being punched repeatedly in the back of the head by Anaheim winger
Jim McKenzie. He had blurred vision and swelling, and if the
swelling continues he might not play tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Modano suffered a broken nose, ligament damage in his neck and a
mild concussion after crashing awkwardly into the boards when
Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei pushed him from behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been a lot worse,'' Modano said. ``I've heard that
every day since.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical wounds basically have healed, though.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional aftershocks remain to be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think myself lucky so much as Mike,'' Sydor said.
``Mine was a freak thing. Mentally, I'm not going to change my
game. I'm going to still play in people's faces. But I think
mentally for Mike that's a big thing, and that's where he's got to
be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he isn't sure what he's going to be feeling. A
little nervous, a little excited, a little tentative all rolled
into a big ball of apprehension when he steps onto the ice for a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any injury you come back from you want to get out
there and get involved as soon as you can, if that means taking a
hit or seeing how you stand up in traffic or the physical part of
the game,'' Modano said. ``I think everybody who comes back from
injuries, knees or shoulders, after that first big hit or first big
play that you kind of feel you are back and ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And to be honest, he'd like to get that out of the way on his
first shift.
</P>
<P>
   The hits will be the big tests for Modano and Sydor. They felt
great last week, but they were skating around like two friends at
Rockefeller Plaza at Christmas. Yesterday, when Stars defenseman
Derian Hatcher was casually bumping them, was another test.
</P>
<P>
   And he's on their team.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine when Sharks defenseman Gary Suter comes flying in
trying to send them flying into the boards. It's the reason that
Sydor said he's not going to return until he's for sure he's 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want another hit or another blow and then make it
worse, that's for sure,'' said Sydor, who will be wearing a visor
to protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Grant Marshall, who returned after breaking a bone
in his neck earlier in his career, said the key is just coming to
terms with getting hit again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that if I wanted to pursue playing hockey, I had to
know if I could go or not go,'' Marshall said. ``So the next game I
was available to play and doctors said I could play, I forced
myself to play and go out there and take a hit and hit somebody.
And if it hurt or if I was going to be gun shy, then I knew I was
never going to play hockey again.''
</P>
<P>
   The test likely comes for Modano and Sydor tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I get right in there and play the way I played,''
Modano said. ``I can't picture myself, visualize myself, playing
any other type of game than the way I play. It's fast and really
uptempo, and a lot of times you crash into the end boards or lose
your balance and go tumbling.''

MARTINEZ RESCUES RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Pedro Martinez wasn't supposed to play the rest of
the series after straining a muscle in his back in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary might as well not have been playing; he had just
two hits in 16 at-bats in the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, though, are in the American League
Championship Series for the first time since 1986 because of the
heroics of the injured pitcher and the inept batter.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the bullpen, Martinez didn't allow a hit in the
final six innings, and O'Leary hit two home runs and drove in seven
runs as the Red Sox defeated the Cleveland Indians, 12-8, at Jacobs
Field last night, completing an improbable comeback from a 0-2
deficit to win the American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the playoffs,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``You
can have three-game winning streaks in the playoffs. You see it
during the course of the season. Does it happen very often? No. But
we fought out of that 2-0 hole. A lot of people contributed.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contributions in the deciding game came from O'Leary
and Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary hit a grand slam in the third inning, rallying the Red
Sox from a 5-2 deficit, and a three-run home run in the seventh to
break an 8-8 tie. Both home runs came after the Indians
intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra, Boston's best hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like that all year because of the player he is,''
O'Leary said. ``Sometimes I respond, sometimes I don't. Tonight was
a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was an unlikely hero. He was hitting .118 in the series
after striking out in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, on the other hand, was expected to provide heroics.
But not this way.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series began, those few people who gave the Red Sox
half a chance to upset the Indians did so because of Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The slender right-hander is the acknowledged best pitcher in
baseball after going 23-4 with a 2.07 earned-run average and 313
strikeouts during the regular season. After working Game 1, he
would come back in Game 5 and pitch the Red Sox into the next
round.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario seemingly ended when the strained muscle that
knocked him out after four innings of the opener looked serious
enough to end his _ and the Red Sox's _ season.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to play catch Saturday, but had to call it quits after
a handful of slow tosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I tried to pick up a ball I was in pain,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried again Sunday and lasted a little longer, but didn't
look ready to pitch in an over-40 game, let along a big-league
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Williams announced before the game that Martinez
felt much better and might be available.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was greeted with no small amount of skepticism.
If Martinez was better, why in the world didn't Williams start him?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it looked like a ploy to throw off the Indians, perhaps
an attempt to disrupt Indians manager Mike Hargrove's strategy,
when first starter Bret Saberhagen and then reliever Derek Lowe
were pounded for a combined eight runs in the first three innings
as Martinez watched from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez jogged to the bullpen to warm up, and entered the
game in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave until he was carried off by his teammates after
striking out Omar Vizquel to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back felt a little tighter in the last few innings,'' he
said. ``But the adrenaline at that point, and knowing we had the
lead, kept me going. I wasn't going to let go. I decided I was
going to be out there as long as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Six no-hit innings by Martinez normally wouldn't be that
remarkable, not even against a powerful Indians lineup that scored
1,009 runs during the regular season and already had scored eight
when he entered the game. Martinez is that good.
</P>
<P>
   The way he did it last night, though, was unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez usually relies on a darting, exploding fastball that
reaches the upper-90 mph range, complemented by an outstanding
changeup and a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   But the back injury had robbed him of his best stuff. His
fastball never got out of the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of a power pitcher, he became a crafty right-hander,
a Greg-Maddux-at-his-best clone. His effectively used his off-speed
pitches, the curve and changeup, and mixed in his fastball to keep
the Indians off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't throw my fastball the way I wanted,'' he said. ``I
just tried to hit my spots.''
</P>
<P>
   He still somehow managed to strike out eight in his six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was outstanding,'' Hargrove said. ``His velocity wasn't
used to what we were seeing, but his off-speed pitches were good.
He pitched. He made his pitches when he needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he did, and because O'Leary hit the two home runs, the
Red Sox completed the incredible comeback. nn

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The New York Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays each have
won a pair of World Series in the 1990s. But ask anyone about the
team of the decade, and the answer will roll off their tongue with
a deep southern accent.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have been a model of consistency over the
last 10 years, winning eight division titles and appearing in the
National League Championship Series for the eighth consecutive time
(there were no playoffs in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1990 _ when Cincinnati bumped off Pittsburgh _ has the
NL pennant been up for grabs without the Braves having a hand in
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1900s reach their end, a quick tally seems appropriate
with regard to the Braves' status as the team of the decade: four
trips to the World Series, one championship less than the Yankees
or Blue Jays. With the Yankees' hopes still alive for a third World
Series title (all since 1995), perhaps the team-of-the-'90s title
is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves get another crack at solidifying their case beginning
tonight when they host Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against
the New York Mets at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won as many as we would have liked to, but what the
heck,'' Braves pitcher John Smoltz said. ``This is what you play
for, what you go to spring training for _ to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares if we're the team of the decade or not? All we care
about is that we've got a chance to win again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets normally aren't in the business of doing favors for the
Yankees, but they would be more than happy to assist their Big
Apple neighbors on this one.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any team the Mets harbor more animosity toward than
the Yankees, it's the Braves. The feeling is mutual. The Mets and
Braves get along about as well as Santa Claus and the Grinch that
stole Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers all but gift-wrapped the NL East Division title
for the Braves by losing nine of 12 games against their rivals,
including five of six over the last 10 days of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the Braves pronounced the Mets dead after that stretch.
And while the Mets survived on life support until the very end,
they ultimately rose from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who won the NL East by seven games, entered the
postseason with the look of a team that was supposed to be there.
The Mets looked like a team that was lucky to be there.
</P>
<P>
   But both dispatched their Division Series opponents with ease to
set up this showdown.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how clean the slate is, memories of being manhandled
by the Braves in the regular season must be lingering somewhere in
the back of the Mets' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Braves? Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you throw out the records,'' said Braves manager Bobby
Cox, falling back on a tired cliche. ``I guess nobody ever believes
the managers when they say that, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the type of assessment only a fellow manager could
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're due for some good things to happen to us against this
club, and I think they know it, too,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in fate claim destiny is on the Mets' side. If
they get past the Braves and the Yankees win the American League
pennant, the Subway Series so many were predicting in March would
become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   On the NL side, the Braves might have a thing or two to say
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is 0-0,'' said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones,
who almost single-handedly forced the Mets to the brink of
postseason elimination. ``The first team with four wins is going to
the World Series. They're riding a lot of momentum, and they've
been playing well for the last month.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it would be an upset if the Mets won the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations are that they've pretty much handed it to us
all year,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said of the Braves.
``We're going in as the underdog without much to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are much higher for the so-called team of the '90s.

WHO WILL PITCH FOR RED SOX? (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Jimy Williams' hair was still dripping from the
celebratory champagne after his Red Sox won this series when the
first question came about the next one.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to pitch against the Yankees, Jimy?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to turn your rosters in when? Wednesday?'' he said.
``What is today? Monday? We'll just savor this moment right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams indeed wanted to enjoy the moment after his team
completed its 0-2 comeback against the Cleveland Indians. And he
usually is loathe to look more than a few minutes into the future.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to it than that. The Red Sox pitching staff is
in disarray after surviving the Indians, and the thought of who
might pitch against the New York Yankees in the American League
Championship Series is something he doesn't want to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who is going to pitch,'' Williams said. ``Someone
is going to pitch, though. I'm being very honest, and I'm not
trying to evade the question or hem and haw around, because I
really don't know at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Game 1 starter won't be staff ace Pedro Martinez, who threw
97 pitches in six innings of relief last night. OFFENSIVE EXPLOSION
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were given up for dead when they left Cleveland
after losing the first two games, but their offense got them off
life support. After scoring just five runs in the first 22 innings
of the series, they pounded Indians pitching for 44 in the final
22.
</P>
<P>
   ``An MVP for this series?'' Williams said. ``I'd have to say it
was the whole team. Maybe that sums it up.'' PASSING THE CHARACTER
TEST
</P>
<P>
   Even though his team lost last night, letting the Red Sox
complete the comeback from the 0-2 deficit, manager Mike Hargrove
was proud of the way the Indians responded after being pounded in
Game 4, 23-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians scored eight runs in the first three innings before
being shut out the rest of the way by Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this ballclub came out and showed a lot of
character,'' Hargrove said. ``Some stuff I read questioned the
character of this club, and I think that was answered tonight. We
got our butts handed to us, and we came out and played tonight. We
made the Red Sox play to win.'' LOFTON INJURED
</P>
<P>
   Indians center fielder Kenny Lofton left the game after
dislocating his left shoulder in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton hit a sharp grounder to first baseman Mike Stanley, who
stopped it with a lunge to his right. Lofton and Red Sox pitcher
Pedro Martinez raced for the bag, and Lofton went into a dive when
he was a couple of steps away.
</P>
<P>
   He slid hard over the base, and stayed down in obvious pain. He
had to be helped to the clubhouse, where the diagnosis was made.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton was replaced by Dave Roberts. PITCHING WOES
</P>
<P>
   Indians pitchers Dave Burba and Steve Reed are bothered by
strained flexor pronators in their right forearms, making them
unavailable last night.
</P>
<P>
   Burba had to leave after four innings of his start against the
Red Sox in Game 3 because of pain in his forearm. The arm had been
bothering him for about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Reed pitched 11/3 innings in Boston's 23-7 victory in Game 4,
and allowed eight runs on seven hits and a walk. THE LAST WORD
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox outfielder Troy O'Leary, on looking forward to the first
two games of the ALCS at Yankee Stadium: ``Now we have to go on and
play the Yankees in the jungle.'' nn

AFTER THE HANDSHAKES, TCU WILL DO NICELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For TCU, now comes the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   Blending into the new neighborhood. Keeping the lawn trim.
Trying to keep that ornery dog, Billy Tubbs, from barking all
night.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck on that last one.
</P>
<P>
   Bound for Conference USA, in just 19 months the Horned Frogs can
put Fresno and San Jose in their rear-view mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal. It's just that in the stripped-down Western
Athletic Conference, the Frogs were destined never to fit in. If
you don't believe that, you probably didn't stay up until the wee
hours three weeks ago, watching TCU lose to Fresno State and
wondering why anyone should care.
</P>
<P>
   In the WAC, it always seems to be half-past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   In Conference USA, TCU should be able to forge easier
friendships at reasonable hours. The WAC's showcase games usually
get squeezed in just before Conan O'Brien. C-USA, on the other
hand, is made up of schools from places that TCU alums have
actually been to.
</P>
<P>
   What do Memphis, Tulane, Houston, Cincinnati, Alabama-Birmingham
and Louisville have in common with TCU? A lot, when you think about
it.
</P>
<P>
   They are schools whose athletic programs have enjoyed periodic
success, even though several are private universities toiling in
the shadow of Big State U. In addition, Tulane, Houston,
Cincinnati, St. Louis, Marquette, North Carolina Charlotte and
DePaul have carved market niches, however modest, in communities
where the headlines tend to be dominated by professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The C-USA family is an intriguing coalition of up-and-comers and
those-were-the-days-ers. The feeling here is that there won't be
many TCU followers who won't get stoked about a road trip to West
Point, home of Army. Tulane offers the Frog Faithful the Superdome
and a weekend in New Orleans. And Southern Miss has slain enough
football giants in its lifetime to capture even the most casual
fan's attention.
</P>
<P>
   In Tubbs' case, he won't have to worry about the strength of his
annual basketball schedule. Cincinnati, Louisville, DePaul and UAB
will give Tubbs' tournament politicking some instant ballast.
</P>
<P>
   In the WAC, there was always the chance that the Frogs could get
ambushed down some lonely, avocado-lined highway. It's been a lot
more than four time zones that have separated Hawaii and TCU.
</P>
<P>
   The Frog Faithful, no doubt, are distressed by the news that
rival SMU was not invited into C-USA.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. For maybe two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just a matter of odd numbers, as they said, that
prompted C-USA presidents not to extend a welcoming hand to Stan
and Muffy University. But think about it. Is there anything about
SMU that makes you think the Ponies will ever be perennial gridiron
powers again?
</P>
<P>
   This is not your daddy's SMU. This SMU likes to think of itself,
rightly or wrongly, on the same terms as Vanderbilt, Princeton and
_ dare we say it? _ Harvard. To a coach trying to win in today's
college football, that means it's always going to be
third-and-long.
</P>
<P>
   When the Southwest Conference split, TCU felt the rump-kick to
get its act together. The Committee of 100 helped carve a vision
for the school's athletic future. Hiring Tubbs was huge. Hiring _
and then re-signing football coach Dennis Franchione _ may have
been even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The word is that TCU never blinked when it mentioned that there
might be a sizable ``entrance fee'' to join Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   For the Frogs, it's going to be a long way from the dark day
when the old SWC split apart. Tubbs and Franchione will be able to
tell recruits about the new league's TV contracts with Fox and
ESPN. They'll be able to promise them games in big-TV markets like
Chicago, St. Louis, Tampa, Houston and Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be a league that the Frogs can win in. There won't be any
backfields of fleet Californians to chase. Franchione will be able
to look a recruit in the face and tell him he'll probably go to a
bowl game during his four years.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part will be blending in. Shaking new hands. Letting
the C-USA presidents know that they made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is going to be mutual.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The American League Championship Series will be a
shuttle showdown pitting a team without a World Series championship
since World War I against a team without a World Series
championship since last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, wild cards, damaged goods and heartbreakers
for decades, earned the right Monday night to move on to face the
powerful defending champion New York Yankees, whom they have never
played in a post-season series. They did it with a resilient 12-8
victory in Jacobs Field over the Cleveland Indians, their third
victory in three days, to win the series in an upset, three games
to two.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary heroes this time were Troy O'Leary, who knocked in
seven runs with two home runs, and Pedro Martinez, who came back
from a back injury in a relief role to pitch six hitless and
scoreless innings against a slugging team that scored 1,009 runs
this season, the most in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out eight despite his throwing muscles
tightening as the night wore on. He credited the adrenaline of the
big moment. In the ninth inning, he ran to the mound, grabbed the
ball and stood there impatiently waiting for his catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let go,'' Martinez said. ``I decided I had
to be the one who had to be out there. I had to be out there as
long as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a team has won a first-round series after
trailing by 0-2 since Seattle did it to the Yankees in 1995. In the
final three games, the Red Sox outscored the heavy-hitting Indians
by 44-18. O'Leary, who went 0 for 5 on Sunday night in a 23-7
victory in Boston, hit both home runs after Cleveland pitchers
intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra. ``Sometimes, I respond,
sometimes, I don't,'' O'Leary said. ``Now, we'll just have to go on
and play the Yankees in the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   No rational baseball fan would give the Red Sox a chance against
the talent-laden Yankees, who have rested since Saturday night and
have a pitching staff filled with starring starters. Except for
Martinez, who cannot pitch until Game 3, Boston has no dependable
starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, Monday night's starter, was hit hard for the
second time this series and driven from the mound in the second
inning. The second-best starter in this series was Ramon Martinez,
Pedro's older brother, who has just come back from shoulder surgery
and who pitched much of the season in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's going to pitch,'' said Jimy Williams, the
Boston manager. ``I'm not trying to hem and haw and evade the
question. I really don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Red Sox fielding skills are questionable. Their
best position player, Nomar Garciaparra, who hit a two-run home run
on Monday night, is playing despite pain in his right wrist that
idled him for one game in this series. But baseball is not always a
logical or rational game. Sometimes, as in the last six days, it
can be strange and wonderful, and teams can seem to be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, speaking of the group, said: `` We have _ what's that
word you want to say? _ camaraderie-type thing. We've got a lot of
heart on this team. Pedro showed it. He came out, he was hurt and
he pitched today like the Cy Young winner that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said this, his voice softened and his face took on a look
of total sincerity and gratitude. Martinez responded: ``Thank you.
Just like you. You looked like mvp's today, the team, to me, all of
you are mvp's.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a pair of two-run home runs for the Indians, who
have not won the World Series since 1948 but have qualified for the
playoffs as Central Division winners the last five seasons. Mike
Hargrove, their manager, said: ``We got out butts handed to us last
night and our guys came out tonight and showed up to play, and it
just didn't happen for us. We made the Red Sox play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-of-seven-game series against the Yankees begins on
Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium. The winner will meet either the
Mets, the National League wild-card team, or the Braves in the
World Series. This is the first time both wild-card teams have
advanced to the League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third inning, the two teams had combined for
15 runs, half as many as they had scored on Sunday night in Game 4.
But on Monday night, the runs were more evenly distributed. The
Indians led by 8-7. The Red Sox tied it at 8-8 in the top of the
fourth on a sacrifice fly by John Valentin, his second rbi of the
night and his 12th of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez entered to start the bottom of the fourth. He had
pitched four innings in Game 1 here, but left with muscle pain in
his back.
</P>
<P>
   Generally considered the best pitcher in baseball, Martinez went
23-4 with a 2.40 earned run average and 313 strikeouts. In his
initial inning, Martinez retired the side in order. The radar gun
showed Martinez throwing his fastest pitches in the range of 90 to
95 miles an hour. In the middle innings, the game changed
character, settling into a duel between Martinez and Sean DePaula
of the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the sixth, the lusty cheering, so frequent
earlier, subsided and the 45,114 Cleveland fans broke only
occasionally nervous pleading with Martinez in command. His six
hitless innings were the second longest in the post-season, next to
Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the seventh, the Indians brought in Paul Shuey,
their third pitcher. After ordered Garciaparra walked intentionally
for the second time in the game, O'Leary responded exactly the same
way, for the second time: with a home run. This one, also on the
first pitch, scored only three runs, giving the Sox a lead of 11-8.
O'Leary's seven rbi tied him with Valentin for the record for rbi
in a single game in post-season play. Valentin had done it the
night before. &QL;

CANNING CARTS MEANS CITY OF CANS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _Third Street as it cuts through SoMa and over
the Lefty O'Doul Bridge is Tin Can Alley.
<P>
   It's the main artery for a small army, pushing shopping carts
loaded with cans and bottles through San Francisco's new boomtown,
past the new Giants ballpark and to a recycling center just across
Mission Bay.
</P>
<P>
   (Yes, the cans are aluminum, not tin, and Third Street is hardly
an alley, but grant me a little poetic license, OK?)
</P>
<P>
   What happens next week when Willie Brown's supermarket-cart
rescue task force starts executing the mayor's orders to confiscate
the carts from the homeless?
</P>
<P>
   What will be the impact on the recycle guys, and on the mountain
of cans and bottles they pluck off the streets every day?
</P>
<P>
   It's a symbiotic relationship, these people and the city. They
are like the birds that hop around the rhino's back, eating the
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take away our bread and butter and we can't recycle, we
can't make no money,'' says Mike, on a nonunion lunch break with
JoJo, a fellow recycler, on the sidewalk on Harrison, a couple
blocks off Tin Can Alley.
</P>
<P>
   The cops will hand out plastic bags to replace the carts. Mike
and JoJo chuckle at the thought of trying to lug 200 pounds of
bottles and cans in a bag, three or four miles to the center. From
Market Street to the center is already a two-hour schlepp. And the
Lefty O'Doul Bridge is currently closed for repairs, which adds a
long detour.
</P>
<P>
   A full cartload of cans and bottles nets you  &LR; $4 to $5 at the
recycling yard, and a hard worker can bring in a couple loads a day
_ ``Three loads, if you're desperate,'' Mike says.
</P>
<P>
   These are the lazy homeless people you often hear about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't break into cars, we don't mess with anybody,'' JoJo
says. ``All we want is to be left alone, make money and do a little
panhandling on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike says, ``Let me go on record saying we don't steal these
carts. They're at the recycle place. You leave one, take another,
they're all over. We don't steal 'em from the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike is wearing a baseball cap with the logo of Norcal Waste
Systems. The company motto is stitched on the back of the cap:
``Together Everyone Achieves More.''
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE VULTURES: In the Marin Independent Journal, a call for
volunteers at the Falkirk Cultural Center:
</P>
<P>
   ``Help is needed in the tattoo parlor of the dead, the lost
pirate's room, and the mad scientist's lab.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks like Al Davis is recruiting front-office staffers again.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF DEAD and haunted projects: A note in Monday's column
questioning the 49ers' commitment to keeping the team in town and
building a new stadium drew a call from Sam Singer, agent for
Denise DeBartolo York, 49ers owner-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium-mall project is stalled, but not necessarily
dead,'' Singer said. ``Denise is very committed to making it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer says John York, Denise's husband, has personally scouted
four new NFL stadiums in preparation for the San Francisco project.
And both sides of the DeBartolo clan are working hard to finalize
the deal that will give Denise the 49ers, three racetracks and
corporate headquarters in Ohio, and give brother Eddie DeBartolo a
ton of stock and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   What about the stadium-mall plan, to which city voters pledged
to contribute $100 million?
</P>
<P>
   Singer says the agreement with the city doesn't specify mall,
but a ``revenue-producing'' part to the stadium. ``Could be mall,''
he said, ``or fill-in-the-blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Foto-Mat?
</P>
<P>
   RETIREMENT is doing strange things to the mind of Rod Stewart _
the former attorney, not the former ``Hot Legs'' rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving in our rural areas,'' Rod muses, ``I ponder this
ancillary of the probability theory: If an infinite number of
rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an
infinite number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway
signs, they will eventually produce all the world's great literary
works in Braille.''
</P>
<P>
   STEAMING UNDER the Golden Gate on Saturday for Fleet Week, the
aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln's radar tower came within 10 feet
of clanging into the bottom of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians on board the Honest Abe marveled at the crew's
calculations of the clearance-by-a-whisker. Alas, an inside source
says nobody bothered to make any such calculation, that the safe
passage under the bridge was a matter of pure luck. And maybe the
weight of the well-fed civilians on board.
</P>
<P>
   RIP TIX, SUPES SAY: Supervisor Gavin Newsom is picking up
support for his proposal to make San Francisco a friendlier place
by having meter maids rip up tickets if scofflaws return to their
cars while tickets are being written.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, be kind to meter cheaters who are hogging a rare parking
space while you and I circle the block like losers in a game of
musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I used to walk five years ago,'' says Scott Lepich, ``I
no longer can because of increased car traffic, people parking on
the sidewalks and in driveways while they pick up a soda or drop
off the dry cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the meter maids save their bonhomie for us meter-feeding
saps.
</P>
<P>
   MORE FLEET WEEK: Waiting to board the Larkspur Ferry at the
Embarcadero, an elderly British gentleman flinched when the Blue
Angels screamed several feet overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christ,'' he said, ``it's like bloody Dunkirk.''
</P>
<P>
   IF JERRY FALWELL and his sexual spin doctors get you
straightened out, so to speak, what does that make you? A
recovering homosexual?

SCHOOL TESTING FIRMS FACE INCREASED SCRUTINY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By NANETTE ASIMOV 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  It was a screwup of monumental proportions, one that robbed
thousands of children of their summer.
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 students in New York City spent summer vacation in
the classroom this year after they were erroneously told that their
test scores were so low they would be held back a year if they did
not attend summer school. Someone at the testing company had pushed
the wrong button, and the scores came out wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmarish situation could easily happen in California _
especially if the company that scored this state's standardized
test slips up again. This summer, 90,000 students in 44 school
districts received the wrong scores; 60,000 students were told
their numbers were lower than they really were.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only mistake by the test's publisher, Harcourt
Educational Measurement. The company, which is not the same as the
one that caused the errors in New York, also blended the scores of
English-language learners with those of fluent English speakers,
making it appear that the English learners' scores had doubled in
one year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the publisher, state educators and Gov. Gray Davis are
under pressure to avoid more mistakes as California moves into a
new era of high-stakes testing _ creating an exam that high school
students will have to pass before receiving a diploma and using
scores from the statewide Stanford 9 exam to develop the most
extensive school-ranking system in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring blunders sounded an alarm in California this summer,
and the state Department of Education is preparing to look closely
over Harcourt's shoulder when the company scores next year's tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process will be very different, with full-scale
monitoring,'' said Bob Anderson, manager of the academic standards
office in the Department of Education. ``We will be watching every
step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the department was unable to act as a watchdog
because it held no contract with Harcourt. Instead, each of the
state's 1,100 school districts had a separate contract with
Harcourt _ a system rejected by state lawmakers this year.
</P>
<P>
   As California relies more on tests to judge children _ and
schools _ here is what is at stake:
</P>
<P>
   -- State takeovers of schools: Using the scores from last
spring's Stanford 9 test, the state has already identified 430
schools with below-average scores. Those schools must now design
and carry out an improvement plan. If their scores do not get
better in two years, administrators can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   -- Public scrutiny: Starting in December, the state is supposed
to use Stanford 9 scores to assign each school a ranking of 1 to
10, with 10 being a top performance. A second 1-to-10 ranking will
compare schools with those with similar students by income level
and English skill.
</P>
<P>
   -- Student retention: Now that the state is requiring school
districts to end ``social promotion'' _ the practice of promoting
students who have not mastered the skills of the current grade _
districts could use the Stanford 9 exam to help identify students
for summer school or retention.
</P>
<P>
   -- Withholding a diploma: The state Board of Education is
expected to adopt an ``exit exam'' by October 2000, testing for
English and mathematics. State law requires that the test be given
for the first time to the class of 2004 _ this year's
eighth-graders _ and that students start trying to pass the test in
10th grade.
</P>
<P>
   California is one of dozens of states using testing to hold
districts accountable for low performance and to establish
consequences for schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger of unintended consequences _ like forcing
thousands of New York children to sweat through summer school
unnecessarily _ have Californians scrambling for a fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for unintended consequences increases as you
attach higher and higher stakes to a test,'' said Gerry Shelton, a
testing expert with the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true if there is pressure on the test
publishers to provide lots of data quickly, he said _ not only test
scores, but results broken down by ethnicity, gender, income and
language skill.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially true in California this year, when Harcourt
found itself with less than three weeks to score 4.3 million exams
_ the largest testing load in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt delivered the tests late to 136 districts. A domino
effect set in, and by June 1, when all 4.3 million tests were due
at the publishing company for scoring, many had not arrived. By
June 8, most were in.
</P>
<P>
   The delay meant the company had only three weeks to score the
tests, create subreports, verify data and give everything to the
state to check and ensure accuracy before posting results on the
Internet by a June 30 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   It did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the statewide posting of scores was delayed three
more weeks while the Education Department and the company tried to
untangle scoring errors for English language learners, charter
school students and students in year-round schools.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to ease the tight schedule and eliminate the 1,100
separate contracts, state lawmakers passed AB366. The bill, which
Gov. Gray Davis signed Friday, extends the Internet posting
deadline to July 15 and authorizes a single contract between the
Education Department and Harcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get some relief from that,'' said Jack Dilworth, a
Harcourt executive. ``It will give us time to check things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dilworth said the company not only needs more time to check
things, but also needs to check them better. So Harcourt is
conducting an internal audit, beefing up its data-verification
procedures, improving its computer programs and hiring a liaison to
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the company's work and the new law, even advocates of
the push for accountability have concerns about using a single test
to make important judgments about children and their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry that we're in danger of putting too many eggs in one
basket,'' said state schools superintendent Delaine Eastin. ``This
(Stanford 9) test is designed to do certain things, and if we try
to make it do too much, some kids may get hurt along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Demersseman, president of the California School Boards
Association, agreed. ``We have to be careful and make sure that we
don't hurt kids by holding them back based on inaccurate, invalid
test scores or increase our dropout rate because the standards we
set are so incredibly high,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 report of the National Academy of Sciences on appropriate
uses of tests supports the view that teachers should judge the
competency of would-be graduates by looking at students' overall
high school performance, the kinds of classes taken, academic
portfolios and other clues that provide a broader picture of each
student than one test can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We issued very strong cautionary language against making
graduation decisions on the basis of a single examination,'' said
Mike Feuer, who headed a committee that wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral of this whole story is one that we have been trying
to teach for a long time,'' he said. ``Testing is imperfect and
inexact, and the consequences to children in school can be quite
dramatic.''

FEDERAL APPEALS COURTS IN CRISIS _ JUSTICE IS DELAYED

<TEXT>
<P>
   According to Alliance for Justice, a nonprofit public interest
advocacy group in Washington, D.C., five of the 11 federal circuit
courts of appeal are facing judicial emergencies because of
unfilled vacancies on the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in those federal appellate courts with a number of vacant
judgeships must take up the cases that would be given to new
appointments _ if they were ever confirmed. The increased workloads
mean decisions on cases in those overloaded federal appellate
courts take more much time. Justice is delayed _ as much as three
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Some of President Clinton's nominations to the federal bench
have taken even longer than two years to be confirmed or denied
confirmation by the Senate after hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the committee's recommendations. And some
of the president's nominations to fill a judgeship have come only
after more than two years of a vacancy. Justice is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan Citizens for Independent Courts, an offshoot of
The Century Foundation's Constitution Project headquartered in the
nation's capitol, blames both the president and the Senate
Judiciary Committee for the delays that have created this judicial
crisis. After a task force studied the situation, Citizens for
Independent Courts issued a report in September entitled ``Justice
Held Hostage: Politics and Selecting Federal Judges.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, judicial nominations have slowed down
considerably since President Carter's term in office. He took an
average of 240 days to nominate a federal judge; President Reagan
took 254 days; President Bush took 296 days; Clinton takes an
average of 315 days. Justice delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also points out that same tardiness from the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which must recommend confirmation or not, and
the Senate, which votes on the nomination. During the 96th Congress
(Carter was president), it took an average of 90 days to confirm or
deny a nomination. During the 100th Congress (Reagan), it took an
average of 144 days to confirm a nomination; during the 102nd
Congress (Bush), it took 138 days. But for the 105th Congress
(Clinton), it took an average of 201 days to confirm or deny a
nomination to the federal judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   From vacancy to nomination to confirmation in Carter's day took
an average of 330 days _ less than 11 months. In the last session
of Congress, it took Clinton and the Senate an average of 516 days
to fill a vacancy on the federal bench _ approximately 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the number of federal lawsuits filed in a 17-month
period. And there aren't sufficient numbers of federal judges to
handle the workload. It means delays. It means it is likely that
clerks, not judges, are doing a great deal of the work and
analyzing cases they don't have the experience or the legal
foundation to bring to bear.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting phenomenon came to light while the data was being
gathered and analyzed for the report: It takes the Senate nearly a
month longer to confirm female nominees than male nominees. And it
takes two months longer to confirm or deny judicial nominees who
belong to racial minorities. Those figures shouldn't surprise
anyone _ the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate itself are
very nearly ``white male only'' clubs. Is it any wonder then that
fewer than 20 percent of federal judges are women? And less than 17
percent are from minorities?
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a new litmus test working in the Senate. It
has nothing to do with judicial philosophy or judicial temperament;
it's based upon gender and race.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate rejected the nomination of Missouri
Supreme Court Judge Ronnie L. White to a federal district court in
his state. His credentials are impeccable. He was the first black
to be named to the Missouri high court. In June 1997, Clinton
nominated White to a federal judgeship. White waited over two years
to be denied. The vote was down party lines: 54 Republicans against
confirmation, 45 Democrats for confirmation. Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., led the opposition to White's confirmation, complaining that
law enforcement groups in Missouri were against White because he
dissented too often in capital punishment cases.
</P>
<P>
   If race wasn't the reason the Senate rejected White's
confirmation to the federal bench, and his dissent in capital
punishment cases was the reason, it is still the wrong reason _ the
incredibly wrong reason. We cannot have an independent judiciary if
senators let law enforcement groups determine how they will vote on
the confirmation of judges.
</P>
<P>
   If judges were to become the stooges of police departments, it
would be the end of freedom as we know it. In those countries where
the judiciary is the servant of the police or the military, a
dictatorship exists or is in the process of arising. Civil rights
and civil liberties are clubbed and shot down in the streets. And
die there.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that the report and recommendations issued by the
Citizens for Independent Courts are read and thoughtfully
considered. We've had enough of making the federal judiciary a
political football, to be kicked around by senators and presidents.
</P>
<P>
   There are citizens waiting for some relief from the federal
courts, waiting for money owed to them, waiting for a corporation
to clean up its pollution, waiting to get the rights guaranteed to
them under the Constitution _ waiting for some sense of justice.
</P>
<P>
   There are many judicial nominees waiting to be confirmed or
denied. The Senate needs to pressure the Senate Judiciary Committee
to hold hearings and move on the nominations. The people are
waiting.

   Teaching hospitals, the crown jewels of American medical
education and research, are facing historic financial difficulties
as the result of cutbacks in the federal Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts were part of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that helped
produce the first balanced federal budget since 1969. But the
achievement of the BBA has come at a severe cost to Medicare
health-care providers, such as nursing homes, home health agencies,
therapists and teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to their complaints about the Medicare cuts in the
1997 BBA, Congress and the Clinton administration are expected in
the next several weeks to restore some of the funding. The proposed
restoration is known in Congress as the ``BBA-fix.''
</P>
<P>
   In a package of stories and photos being filed today, Hearst
Newspapers examine the impact, the politics and the history of
teaching hospitals _ and their financial problems stemming from the
Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The stories include profiles of five teaching hospitals, as well
as an overview of the Medicare debate and a look at the other
interest groups seeking a share of the ``BBA-fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors wishing a two-day series may consider this lineup:
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE: The story slugged TEACHING-HOSPITALS and one or more of
the hospital profiles.
</P>
<P>
   DAY TWO: The story slugged MEDICARE-LOBBYISTS and one or more of
the hospital profiles.

<P>
   TEACHING-HOSPITALS (Washington) _ Already battered by the
transition to cost-conscious managed care in the 1990s, the
nation's 400 premier teaching hospitals could lose their life
support if Congress fails to restore diminishing Medicare payments,
their advocates say. Congress and the Clinton administration are
now weighing whether to restore some of those cutbacks. By DAN
FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-LOBBYISTS (Washington) _ Teaching hospitals aren't the
only health-related groups lobbying Congress for relief from the
Medicare cuts that the lawmakers and President Clinton imposed two
years ago in the drive to balance the federal budget. Also seeking
their share of an expected restoration of Medicare dollars are
nursing homes, home health care agencies, managed care providers
and physical, occupational and speech therapists. By JUDY HOLLAND
and DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY-HOSPITAL (Albany, N.Y.) _ Highly specialized services
like neonatal care have helped improve the odds for premature
babies over the past decade. But such intensive medical care comes
with a cost. And doctors and hospital administrators at the Albany
Medical Center believe the decreasing subsidies for teaching
hospitals is putting research, training and sophisticated care _
especially for the poor _ at risk. By SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON-HOSPITAL (Houston) _ For the first time in recent
memory, Methodist Hospital is losing money on its day-to-day
business operations. Methodist, one of the nation's largest
private, nonprofit hospitals and a teaching hospital for the Baylor
College of Medicine, will end the year in the red, due mainly to
federal cutbacks imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. By
CAROL CHRISTIAN.
</P>
<P>
   SAN-ANTONIO-HOSPITAL (San Antonio) _ Lisa Ochoa calmly completes
her rounds in the busy emergency center of University Hospital and
confides: ``I've been in this system for seven or eight years and
every year it gets harder. It's mainly because they're so many of
them,'' she says, motioning toward patients, ``and so few of us.''
Unwittingly, the graduate medical student described a main concern
for teaching hospitals dealing with the Balanced Budget Act of
1997. By NICOLE FOY.
</P>
<P>
   SAN-FRANCISCO-HOSPITALS (San Francisco) _ Concerned about
looming Medicare cuts and intense local competition, the University
of California at San Francisco and Stanford University decided two
years ago to merge their four hospitals into a private, non-profit
corporation. Their marriage has been rocky, however. By ULYSSES
TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE-HOSPITAL (Seattle) _ The federal government's budget
balancing act of 1997 looks like the AIDS virus _ a slow-acting,
unseen agent that will eventually erode the ability of teaching
hospitals affiliated with the University of Washington to rebound
from even the smallest wound or challenge. ``Any kind of a cut here
gets more quickly into the muscle and bone,'' says Robert
Muilenberg, executive director of the University of Washington
Medical Center. By TOM PAULSON.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-BIAGGI (Bronx, N.Y.) _ Mario Biaggi, a former New York
cop-turned-congressman who fought for the elderly during his 20
years on Capitol Hill, says he now knows first-hand about holes in
the nation's safety net for the aged. At 81, Biaggi, has received
hundreds of hours of physical and occupational therapy, nursing
care and help from home health aides since his health started
slipping in February. That assistance has been cut because of the
reductions in Medicare payments brought on the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997. By JUDY HOLLAND.

   1. WHY THE PRESS LOVES JOHN MCCAIN, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is miles ahead in the very first contest of the 2000
campaign: the press primary. Journalists go weak in the knees
around the guy. Why do the hacks love McCain? You could start with
our admiration for a quality not many of us possess: physical
courage. McCain isn't just a war hero, he's a Faulknerian
character, in a very different sense than Bill Clinton is. And I
think that at this point, even those of us who think Clinton has
been a good president hunger for a successor more deserving of our
respect.

</P>
<P>
   Outside of recent African immigrants to the United States, there
are virtually no black Americans of purely African descent, which
is to say no black people who lack white ancestry, left in this
country. Four centuries of race mixing have had a similar impact on
Americans who define themselves as white. Convincing estimates show
that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had some African
ancestry. How did so much ``black'' blood get into so many
``white'' people?

   3. THE BUSH TRIANGULATION STRATEGY, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   The media's understanding of George W. Bush's
``triangulation''--that he is trying to ``distance himself from the
GOP's right wing'' and ``stake out the middle ground'' between two
extremes--oversimplifies the game. Bush isn't positioning himself
on a straight line between Bill Clinton and the congressional GOP.
He is venturing into a third dimension, rejecting the whole
Washington debate, and defining his contest with Al Gore along a
new axis.

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the $123 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when
it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric. Why hasn't the
U.S. adopted the metric system?

<P>
   TODAY'S PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   The NYT, LAT and WP each lead with the latest development in the
White House's attempt to stave off a Senate defeat of the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty--President Clinton's
submission of a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asking
him to postpone his planned floor vote on the treaty. The papers
report Lott's reaction: the letter isn't enough--Clinton must also
agree not to bring the treaty back to the Senate until January
2001. Which, so far, Clinton has not agreed to do. USAT plays the
story on page 9, leading instead with its latest poll (undertaken
with Gallup and CNN) showing that Bill Bradley is 21 percentage
points closer to Al Gore than he was in the paper's last survey a
month ago, and that Bush would beat both Democrats. The only expert
quoted in the story says Gore/Bradley is headed toward a
``toss-up'' and that Bush seems to have his party's nomination
``wrapped up.'' (The story saves the number of people
polled--976--for the last sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   The WP's account of Clinton's letter to Lott makes it seem that
the fate of the treaty is genuinely up in the air, whereas the
LAT's first paragraph suggests a deal may be in the works that will
avoid the treaty's certain defeat. Ditto the NYT, which says (even
in its headline) a ``plan'' is in the works that will achieve just
that. But even the Times see a lot of brinkmanship yet to come and
admits a vote could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody explains that ratifications (which is what the Senate
is contemplating) by the 44 perceived nuclear capable countries is
required to make it effective. But the NYT helpfully adds that
Russia and China have signaled that they will ``take their lead''
from the Senate vote. The Times also does the best job of
explaining the politics in play right now, noting that 1) Lott is
``tiptoeing'' between a majority of Republicans who although
probably against the treaty, don't want to give the U.S. a
diplomatic setback on the one hand and hard-liners in his party on
the other who want to kill the treaty at all domestic and
international costs; and 2) Senate Minority Thomas Daschle has to
contend with a minority of Democrats who want a vote now so that
once defeated, the treaty becomes a viable campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the LAT does better on the big picture, explaining that
Lott's additional demand for postponement until 2001 is designed
precisely to immunize Republicans from the treaty during the 2000
election. And although everybody notes that President Clinton
signed the treaty two years ago, it's the LAT that explains where
it's been since then: bottled up in Sen. Jesse Helms' Foreign
Relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT and WP front the likelihood that today (or one day soon)
will mark, for the first time ever, the planet's population
totaling 6 billion. The thrust of the stories--and of a WSJ op-ed
(and of a NYT ``Week in Review'' takeout a few weeks ago)--is that,
in the shadow of the dizzying number there is non-Malthusian news.
It's noted that thanks to education efforts and the wider
dissemination of birth control, the population growth rate in most
places is about half what it was a generation ago. (The Post by the
way, makes the point that this fact doesn't show that books like
``The Population Bomb'' were nuts--it was because of such alarms
that experts and governments started attacking the growth rate
problem.) The main storm cloud the Post sees is that food
distribution (not food supply, which is generally adequate) needs
to improve, while the LAT wonders if governments will continue to
stay on top of reproductive ``care.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ runs a fine feature about the military's obstinate
attachment to anti-Soviet era big ticket weapons systems and its
concomitant failure to fully tap the potential of newer, smaller
ideas. This is no clich?-spouting editorial, but rather a long
detailed narrative of what's become of unmanned aerial drones in
the hands of the Pentagon in the past 20 years. The primary problem
has been that traditional weapons advocates in uniform have seen
drones as threats. For instance, in the Navy, so the story
explains, the plan to develop unmanned bombers ran into the
formidable opposition of the carrier admirals. The upshot is that
the Pentagon is still spending only millions on this idea, compared
to say, the $3 billion it wanted for the next Air Force fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The WP reports inside that last week the U.S. military's
Atlantic Command held a formal ceremony where it was renamed the
Joint Forces Command. The change involved new banners and command
insignia and new stationery. But the regional area of
responsibility--the Atlantic Ocean--remains basically the same. The
point of the name change is to emphasize the importance of the
various U.S. service branches working together. But it's a real
lapse for the Post not to have told the readers what the non-change
change cost taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT fronts a Frenchman leading the revolt against McDonald's
in his country. And off a front-page picture, the WP inside reports

   1. WHY THE PRESS LOVES JOHN MCCAIN, by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is miles ahead in the very first contest of the 2000
campaign: the press primary. Journalists go weak in the knees
around the guy. Why do the hacks love McCain? You could start with
our admiration for a quality not many of us possess: physical
courage. McCain isn't just a war hero, he's a Faulknerian
character, in a very different sense than Bill Clinton is. And I
think that at this point, even those of us who think Clinton has
been a good president hunger for a successor more deserving of our
respect.

   2. AMERICA IS A LOT LESS WHITE THAN IT LOOKS, by Brent Staples
</P>
<P>
   Outside of recent African immigrants to the United States, there
are virtually no black Americans of purely African descent, which
is to say no black people who lack white ancestry, left in this
country. Four centuries of race mixing have had a similar impact on
Americans who define themselves as white. Convincing estimates show
that by 1950 about one in five white Americans had some African
ancestry. How did so much ``black'' blood get into so many
``white'' people?

   3. THE BUSH TRIANGULATION STRATEGY, by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   The media's understanding of George W. Bush's
``triangulation''--that he is trying to ``distance himself from the
GOP's right wing'' and ``stake out the middle ground'' between two
extremes--oversimplifies the game. Bush isn't positioning himself
on a straight line between Bill Clinton and the congressional GOP.
He is venturing into a third dimension, rejecting the whole
Washington debate, and defining his contest with Al Gore along a
new axis.

   4. WHY HASN'T THE U.S. GONE METRIC? by Matt Alsdorf
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, the $123 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost when
it veered off course and burned up in the Martian atmosphere. NASA
revealed the cause: One part of the orbiter's navigation system was
speaking in English units and another in metric. Why hasn't the
U.S. adopted the metric system?

<P>
   TODAY'S PAPERS
</P>
<P>
   The NYT, LAT and WP each lead with the latest development in the
White House's attempt to stave off a Senate defeat of the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty--President Clinton's
submission of a letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott asking
him to postpone his planned floor vote on the treaty. The papers
report Lott's reaction: the letter isn't enough--Clinton must also
agree not to bring the treaty back to the Senate until January
2001. Which, so far, Clinton has not agreed to do. USAT plays the
story on page 9, leading instead with its latest poll (undertaken
with Gallup and CNN) showing that Bill Bradley is 21 percentage
points closer to Al Gore than he was in the paper's last survey a
month ago, and that Bush would beat both Democrats. The only expert
quoted in the story says Gore/Bradley is headed toward a
``toss-up'' and that Bush seems to have his party's nomination
``wrapped up.'' (The story saves the number of people
polled--976--for the last sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   The WP's account of Clinton's letter to Lott makes it seem that
the fate of the treaty is genuinely up in the air, whereas the
LAT's first paragraph suggests a deal may be in the works that will
avoid the treaty's certain defeat. Ditto the NYT, which says (even
in its headline) a ``plan'' is in the works that will achieve just
that. But even the Times see a lot of brinkmanship yet to come and
admits a vote could come as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody explains that ratifications (which is what the Senate
is contemplating) by the 44 perceived nuclear capable countries is
required to make it effective. But the NYT helpfully adds that
Russia and China have signaled that they will ``take their lead''
from the Senate vote. The Times also does the best job of
explaining the politics in play right now, noting that 1) Lott is
``tiptoeing'' between a majority of Republicans who although
probably against the treaty, don't want to give the U.S. a
diplomatic setback on the one hand and hard-liners in his party on
the other who want to kill the treaty at all domestic and
international costs; and 2) Senate Minority Thomas Daschle has to
contend with a minority of Democrats who want a vote now so that
once defeated, the treaty becomes a viable campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the LAT does better on the big picture, explaining that
Lott's additional demand for postponement until 2001 is designed
precisely to immunize Republicans from the treaty during the 2000
election. And although everybody notes that President Clinton
signed the treaty two years ago, it's the LAT that explains where
it's been since then: bottled up in Sen. Jesse Helms' Foreign
Relations committee.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT and WP front the likelihood that today (or one day soon)
will mark, for the first time ever, the planet's population
totaling 6 billion. The thrust of the stories--and of a WSJ op-ed
(and of a NYT ``Week in Review'' takeout a few weeks ago)--is that,
in the shadow of the dizzying number there is non-Malthusian news.
It's noted that thanks to education efforts and the wider
dissemination of birth control, the population growth rate in most
places is about half what it was a generation ago. (The Post by the
way, makes the point that this fact doesn't show that books like
``The Population Bomb'' were nuts--it was because of such alarms
that experts and governments started attacking the growth rate
problem.) The main storm cloud the Post sees is that food
distribution (not food supply, which is generally adequate) needs
to improve, while the LAT wonders if governments will continue to
stay on top of reproductive ``care.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ runs a fine feature about the military's obstinate
attachment to anti-Soviet era big ticket weapons systems and its
concomitant failure to fully tap the potential of newer, smaller
ideas. This is no clich?-spouting editorial, but rather a long
detailed narrative of what's become of unmanned aerial drones in
the hands of the Pentagon in the past 20 years. The primary problem
has been that traditional weapons advocates in uniform have seen
drones as threats. For instance, in the Navy, so the story
explains, the plan to develop unmanned bombers ran into the
formidable opposition of the carrier admirals. The upshot is that
the Pentagon is still spending only millions on this idea, compared
to say, the $3 billion it wanted for the next Air Force fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The WP reports inside that last week the U.S. military's
Atlantic Command held a formal ceremony where it was renamed the
Joint Forces Command. The change involved new banners and command
insignia and new stationery. But the regional area of
responsibility--the Atlantic Ocean--remains basically the same. The
point of the name change is to emphasize the importance of the
various U.S. service branches working together. But it's a real
lapse for the Post not to have told the readers what the non-change
change cost taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT fronts a Frenchman leading the revolt against McDonald's
in his country. And off a front-page picture, the WP inside reports
on the egg-throwing protest by French chefs in Paris against a new
tax structure they feel hurts traditional cuisine and aids fast
food. These are interesting sorts of stories, but one has to wonder
if there isn't another reason why they are staples of the big
dailies: to help justify having reporters stationed in France,
which although a great place to live, produces virtually no real
news.

TEACHING HOSPITALS STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE MEDICARE CUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (Photos available on the Wieck database)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already battered by the transition to
cost-conscious managed care in the 1990s, the nation's 400 premier
teaching hospitals are facing the removal of their life support if
Congress fails to restore diminishing Medicare payments, their
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliated with 125 medical college residency programs, these
hospitals are centers of cutting-edge medical research as well as
training grounds for future generations of physicians. Their
history is rich with medical breakthroughs such as organ
transplants and open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Even though teaching hospitals make up less than 1 percent of
the nation's 5,000 hospitals, they host 40 percent of the neonatal
intensive care units, 53 percent of the pediatric intensive care
units and 70 percent of the burn units. They provide 44 percent of
all care for the most impoverished patients.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are at the vortex of a pitched battle in
Congress over whether to restore some of the $112 billion in
Medicare cuts that were made by the landmark Balanced Budget Act of
1997. That law was acclaimed for eliminating the federal budget
deficit for the first time since 1969. It also succeeded in halting
the rise in Medicare spending, which rose just 1.5 percent last
year, compared with 11 percent annual growth since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides federal health insurance to 34 million senior
citizens and five million disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the White House grapple over plans for federal
spending for fiscal year 2000 that began Oct. 1, they appear likely
to restore at least some of the Medicare cuts. The questions are
how big any restoration would be and which programs would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are not alone in seeking a Medicare
transfusion from Congress. Home health care agencies, nursing
homes, managed care health plans, and occupational, physical and
speech and hearing therapy groups all are vying for the same
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Competing priorities _ defense and Social Security, for instance
_ make the size of any ultimate ``give back'' uncertain. Teaching
hospital advocates are pinning their hopes on legislation
introduced by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., which would
prevent further cuts from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The final details are likely to be hammered out by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed spending $7.5 billion over 10
years on a Medicare fix. Senate Finance Chairman Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., proposes spending $1 billion to $1.5 billion next year. The
issue has become part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign
in New York _ home to 122 teaching hospitals and 12 medical
schools, more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the debate over teaching hospitals is a case study
in what happens when politics and social policy collide in
Washington. It also raises broader questions over how far the
federal government should go in shoring up the U.S. medical
education system at a time when managed care is leveling health
care costs and when medical economists worry about an over-supply
of some medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have teaching hospitals, you're certainly not
going to have cutting edge state-of-the-art medicine,'' said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., among those leading the charge on
Capitol Hill. Failure to shore up teaching hospitals will lead to
``more deaths and we'll have a sicker population,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Balanced Budget Act, the basic Medicare formula for
payments to all hospitals was cut $71 billion over a five-year
period, 1998 to 2002. Among the cuts that hit teaching hospitals
the hardest:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Indirect Medical Education,'' worth about $4 billion
annually, was slashed 29 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Disproportionate Share'' payments to hospitals with a heavy
caseload of the poorest patients were reduced five percent over
five years. Two-thirds of those payments went to teaching hospitals
and were worth $4.5 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Medical Colleges, which is urging
Congress to freeze the Medicare reductions, says about 30 percent
of teaching hospitals are now in the red. By 2002, if Congress does
nothing, 50 percent will be losing money, the AAMC says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are huge, huge hits,'' said Dr. Jordan Cohen, the
association's president.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Medicare cuts compounded a teaching hospital financial
problem already very much in gear. Managed care plans view teaching
hospitals as overly expensive. These plans drive hard bargains in
terms of payment rates and sometimes steer patients away from major
academic medical centers altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As teaching hospitals began feeling managed care's pinch, they
came to rely more heavily on Medicare's special funding streams.
Once those began drying up last year, many hospitals faced deep
financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Some academic medical centers have turned to the Hunter Group, a
St. Petersburg, Fla.-based consultant group for help in cutting
costs, often resulting in unpopular staff layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One Hunter client, the University of Pennsylvania Health System,
which runs four teaching hospitals in Philadelphia, lost $90
million in 1998 and expects to lose at least $150 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the gigantic hospital and medical school system with
18,000 employees eliminated 1,100 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kelley, Pennsylvania Health System CEO, said the
hospitals were being eaten away by an ``invisible cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it break even,'' he said. ``But we won't be the
creators of the future of medicine the way we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detroit Medical Center, a seven-hospital system affiliated with
Wayne State University, lost $106.1 million in 1998 and $93.2
million in the first seven months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hunter Group client, the Detroit system in January cut
2,000 positions from its workforce of 18,600.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of so many employees has had a devastating impact on
the hospitals, according to workers and officials of Local 79 of
the Service Employees International Union, which along with another
union represents 2,800 workers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very short staffed,'' said Deborah Clark, a housekeeper
at the center's Sinai-Grace Hospital. Because of layoffs, Clark
worked 28 straight days in August and September and now sometimes
cleans up to 27 rooms and bathrooms daily, double the pre-layoff
number.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, about 18,000 teaching hospital jobs _ eight
percent of the total in the city _ were lost between 1994 and 1998,
according to the Greater New York Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide study by the group found that New York's teaching
hospitals and medical colleges spend $21 billion annually and
employ over 250,000. They generate $1.85 billion in tax revenues
for New York state and $1 billion for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching hospitals to New York are the same as oil wells to
Texas and silicon to California,'' said the association's
president, Kenneth Raske.
</P>
<P>
   Many large institutions have been forced to merge, including
Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital and New York Hospital in New York
City and the teaching hospitals of the University of California at
San Francisco and Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities are getting out of the hospital business.
George Washington University, which runs a medical school in
Washington, sold its hospital to Universal Health Services Inc., a
for-profit hospital chain. Others teaching institutions such as
Mount Sinai Medical Center-University Circle in Cleveland are
canceling residency programs altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for teaching hospitals say that if the cuts continue,
the hospitals might not be able to put the genie back in the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like a light switch,'' said Cohen of the AAMC.
``You can't turn these places off and then say `Oh, we went too
far, let's turn them back on.' You lose staff, you lose the
expertise, and you lose the ability to sustain the momentum for
these very complex and important programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAMC is spearheading a joint lobbying effort in Congress to
support Moynihan's bill that would freeze cuts to Medicare's
Indirect Medical Education funding at current levels.
</P>
<P>
   The group is sponsoring an advertising blitz. ``If Medicare cuts
continue,'' one ad warns, ``about the only place you'll find a
teaching hospital with the latest advances in medicine will be on
`ER,''' the popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the AAMC is playing what it considers to be its
trump card: Enlisting medical school deans and hospital CEOs to
plead the case of teaching hospitals before key senators and House
members from their home states.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, A. Wallace Conerly, dean of the medical school at
the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has flown to
Washington to visit his old family friend and fellow Mississippian,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The AAMC has no organized political action committee, the legal
apparatus for groups and corporations collecting and disbursing
candidate donations. But its chief ally, the American Hospital
Association, is a major player in the campaign finance world. The
AHA's PAC forked over $1.07 million to candidates in the 1998
election cycle, the 12th largest amount among trade groups,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   During the same time period, the AHA also gave $103,000 in
``soft'' money to Republican Party committees, and $64,600 to
Democrats, according to Common Cause, the campaign finance watchdog
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not chopped liver,'' said AHA vice president Richard
Pollack, the group's chief lobbyist. ``We're trying to pull as many
levers as possible. Do PACs provide access? Yes. Do they buy votes?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said the group is investing over $10 million to get
hospitals a break out of this year's congressional budget tussle.
The effort includes the advertising campaign, flying groups of
hospital executives and employees into Washington, and making sure
the issue is publicized in key primary states such as New Hampshire
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The AHA's lobbying effort emphasizes issues of concern to all
hospitals, not just teaching hospitals. But the two coordinate
their efforts closely along with the National Association of Public
Hospitals, the Federation of American Health Systems (which
represents for-profit hospitals) and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against them are a potent alliance of health system
skeptics and key members of Congress, many of them conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, teaching hospitals _ especially the larger
academic medical centers _ are dinosaurs that haven't adjusted to
the managed care era. They question whether taxpayers should
subsidize all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the questions you have to ask is does it make sense for
a single metropolitan area to have six academic medical centers?''
said Gail Wilensky, chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission, established by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act to
advise it on Medicare issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of teaching hospitals' problems stem from
Medicare cuts, and how much from managed care, said Wilensky.
Either way, she added, they have resisted market pressures that
have affected all other elements of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching hospitals hired a lot of faculty and expanded
aggressively in the 1980s,'' she said. ``They haven't done very
extensive, aggressive audits (to trim waste). It's certainly very
hard to say there isn't more they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the House Ways and
Means subcommittee that oversees Medicare, characterized the
typical major teaching hospital as ``a big downtown `ER' hospital
that doesn't represent the direction in which medical care is
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added that he has no problem with some teaching
hospitals getting help from the government, possibly separate from
Medicare.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teaching hospitals aren't the only health-related
groups lobbying Congress for relief from the Medicare spending cuts
that the lawmakers and President Clinton imposed two years ago in
the drive for a balanced federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting for their share of an expected restoration of
Medicare dollars are nursing homes, home health care agencies,
managed care providers and physical, occupational and speech
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and independent analysts, such as the Congressional
Budget Office, acknowledge that some federal health programs were
slashed too deeply when Medicare was cut by $115 billion, a key
element of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (the BBA.)
</P>
<P>
   This realization is fueling a push for Congress to restore some
of the cuts as the lawmakers write spending bills for the new
fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The new funding is referred to in
Congress as the ``BBA-fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the different groups vying for restoration of
Medicare funds have been making their cases in congressional
hearings and in the hallways, armed with industry surveys and
heart-wrenching anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Solid data is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   The agency that runs Medicare, the Health Care Financing
Administration, is still gathering information to measure the
effect of the cuts _ many of which have yet to take hold. Because
the data isn't yet in, some key lawmakers are leaning toward a
short-term fix, such as one that would restore funds over one or
two years.
</P>
<P>
   As this high-stakes lobbying campaign rages, campaign
contributions have flowed from those jostling for a share of
returned Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled American Health Care Association, which
represents the nation's nursing homes, ponied up $722,580 to House
and Senate candidates in the 1997-98 election cycle, federal
records show. Smaller players, such as the National Association for
Home Care, shelled out $37,000 in that period, federal records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals boast that they don't even have a political
action committee, preferring to position themselves above the
fund-raising fray.
</P>
<P>
   Financial heavy hitters such as managed care plans also fork
over large donations in soft money, the unlimited contributions
that are supposed to go toward issue advocacy and party building,
as opposed to individual candidates. The nation's 10 largest
managed care plans shelled out $560,250, in 1997-98, according to
Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the five main interest groups jockeying for more
Medicare funding:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OCCUPATIONAL, PHYSICAL AND SPEECH THERAPY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays physical, speech and occupational therapists to
help elderly or disabled people regain muscle strength, walk,
relearn how to swallow or speak, or how to dress or eat, often
after a stroke or an injury.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The 1997 Balanced Budget Act capped Medicare payments
for speech and physical therapy for each patient at a combined
total of $1,500 a year, and also limited occupational therapy to
$1,500 a year, except at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cuts, only occupational and physical therapists in
business for themselves had an annual Medicare limit of $900 per
patient. Therapists working at nursing homes, rehabilitation
centers and physician's offices weren't capped.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: Medicare payments to outpatient therapy providers had
been growing 25 to 35 percent a year from 1990 to 1996, according
to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYISTS: The three major therapy-related groups, known as
the Tri-Alliance, are represented by:
</P>
<P>
   --Patrick Cooney, 31, a former congressional staffer, is chief
lobbyist for the American Physical Therapy Association, with 70,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   --Jim Potter, 37, a former staffer for the American Medical
Association, is director of government relations for the American
Speech-Language Hearing Association, with 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   -- Christina A. Metzler, 47, a 15-year veteran of lobbying on
health issues, represents the American Occupational Therapy
Association, with 60,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Cooney says the cuts are forcing some seniors to
ration their care because they are afraid of busting the limits. He
says the combined cap on physical and speech therapy forces elderly
and disabled people to make a cruel choice: ``They're asking a
patient to either walk or talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzler says many patients now get their occupational therapy
from untrained aides because they have exceeded the spending
limits. She also says about 30 percent of occupational therapists
report layoffs or lost jobs since the Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer therapists, means less therapy, means less healing for
the patients,'' Metzler says.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Therapists want no limits on Medicare spending for
the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   About one in seven Medicare beneficiaries needing rehabilitation
therapy will exceed the caps this year, according to Stephanie
Maxwell, a senior analyst at Congress's Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the
Senate Special Committee on Aging, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and
Reps. Richard M. Burr, R-N.C., Jim McCrery, R-La., Frank Pallone,
D-N.J., and Ben Cardin, D-Md.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; NURSING HOMES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 nursing homes across the nation care for 1.6 million
elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: Before the 1997 cuts, Medicare reimbursed nursing
homes for such high intensity services as chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Now nursing homes get a fixed amount per patient from Medicare
for room, board and medical treatment, which averages about $230 to
$300 a day, depending on a patient's medical condition.
Rehabilitation therapy in nursing homes also was capped at between
$1,500 and $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: While Medicare payments to nursing homes rose 33
percent a year from 1990 to 1997, the number of patients increased
about 10 a year, according to the Medicare Patient Advisory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYISTS: Bruce Yarwood, 57, a former nursing home manager,
is the key lobbyist for the American Health Care Association,
representing 12,000 nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, and Vic Fazio, former veteran Democratic congressman
from Sacramento, are lobbyists for the Alliance for Quality Nursing
Home Care, representing 12 of the nation's largest nursing home
chains.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Yarwood says many nursing homes are cutting out such
services as dialysis, chemotherapy or ventilators because Medicare
doesn't pick up enough of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare cuts have hurt the nursing home industry. One of
the nation's largest nursing home chains, Vencor, with about 300
homes in 46 states, filed for bankruptcy protection in September.
Sun Healthcare Group, a national chain with 385 homes, is in
default on its debt, and several regional nursing home chains are
faltering financially.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Nursing home advocates want Medicare to cover costs
for the sickest patients who require the most costly treatments.
They also want an across-the-board increase in Medicare funding.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, Pete V. Domenici,
R-N.M., Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANAGED CARE PLANS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many managed care plans, such as HMOs, contract with Medicare to
provide health coverage to elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The 1997 Balanced Budget Act lowered Medicare payment
rates to these plans, which receive a fixed payment for each
patient, regardless of the patient's medical needs. To stop HMOs
from preferring relatively healthy patients, the federal government
decided to pay higher rates for sicker patients and lower rates for
healthier ones. The result: HMOs get fewer Medicare dollars.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: At the time of the cuts, CEOs of some managed care
organizations were being paid annual salaries of $5 million to $15
million. Recently, federal auditors have said Medicare was
overpaying managed care providers who contract with Medicare. These
Medicare-managed care plans care for 16 percent of Medicare's 39
million enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Karen M. Ignagni, 45, a veteran staffer of the
A.F.L-C.I.O, was criticized as a turncoat six years ago when she
left the labor organization and went to work as president and chief
lobbyist for the American Association of Health Plans, a trade
association for the managed care industry.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Ignagni says managed care plans that serve Medicare
beneficiaries have dropped 720,000 enrollees because the plans
don't find them profitable. She says managed care plans ``have
become the pinata of health care.''
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Health plans want Medicare payments to managed care
plans to grow in step with traditional Medicare spending, rather
than the annual 1/2 percent reductions scheduled through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS:
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla, and Peter Deutsch, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME HEALTH CARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Home health care, commonly known as the ``visiting nurse''
program, is the federal Medicare benefit that pays for nurses,
aides and therapists to provide part-time care in the homes of ill
elderly or disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: Before the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Medicare didn't
limit the number of home health visits but set the cost of a
nursing visit, for example, at an average of $101. The 1997 cuts
forced that down to an average of $87.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare cuts also put a lid on the amount that home health
care providers could spend on average for each patient each year.
Annual spending limits generally range from $1,200 to $8,000, based
on what the provider spent on patients in the past.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: When Congress made the cuts, home health care was the
fastest growing part of Medicare, expanding an average of 25
percent a year from 1990 to 1997, according to the Government
Accounting Office. There also had been several scandals involving
home health providers squandering federal funds on such items as
gourmet popcorn, turkeys and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Val J. Halamandaris, 56, the son of a Utah Coal
miner, is the president of the National Association of Home Care,
the industry's largest trade association, with about 6,000 members.
Halamandaris was counsel to the Senate Special Committee on Aging
and the House Select Committee on Aging for a total of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Halamandaris says the 1997 Medicare cuts have
prompted the closing of more than 2,486 or one-quarter of the
nation's home health agencies, which are private businesses or
hospitals that provide home care.
</P>
<P>
   More are expected to fold because they have overspent caps
imposed by Congress and now must repay the federal government. The
closings have left a growing number of rural counties and poor
urban areas without home health care, says Halamandaris.
</P>
<P>
   Many providers are turning away patients who need the most
intensive and chronic care (the most expensive ones), he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cuts, the number of people receiving home health care
has fallen from 3.5 million to 3 million, according to estimates by
the association. Many of those who no longer receive home care have
landed in hospitals, nursing homes or are cared for by family
members, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Home health advocates want Congress to head off an
additional 15 percent cut slated for next Oct. 1 and they want no
limits on reimbursements for taking care of the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, Christopher ``Kit''
Bond, R-Mo., Jim M. Jeffords, R-Vt., and Reps. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
and John E. Peterson, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TEACHING HOSPITALS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's teaching hospitals receive about $9 billion a year
from Medicare to train medical residents and help cover the higher
cost of their traditionally sicker and poorer patients.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 slashed the Indirect
Medical Education payment, a fee added to each Medicare payment to
subsidize the cost of more intensive treatment for the severely
ill. The fees were cut by 29 percent over five years through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, which go to
institutions that serve unusually large numbers of poor people,
were cut by 5 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Balanced Budget Act also capped the number of residents
allowed at teaching hospitals at 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   THE BACKDROP: At the time of the cuts, many of the nation
largest teaching hospitals had 28 percent profit margins for
Medicare hospitalized patients. The new Medicare rules have shrunk
these margins, forcing mergers, staff cutbacks and the decisions by
some universities to sell their money-losing hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Richard M. Knapp, 58, who has a PhD in hospital
and health administration from the University of Iowa, is the chief
lobbyist for the American Association of Medical Colleges, which
represents 400 major teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Advocates say more than 40 percent of the major
teaching hospitals in this country will be losing money by 2002.
Financial troubles are causing devastating cutbacks in medical
research and jeopardizing the education of the nation's future
doctors, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Teaching hospitals want to eliminate any further
cuts to the Indirect Medical Education and to the Disproportionate
Share Hospital payments.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the key House Ways and Means
panel.

TEACHING HOSPITALS PROVIDE SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Born at 23 weeks, Baby K. almost didn't make it
and her twin sister died. Too young to breathe on their own, such
preemies face an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right on the edge,'' said Dr. David Clark, the
director of the Children's Hospital at Albany Medical Center, where
Baby K. has spent the past 10 weeks in a full-service neonatal
intensive care unit, the only one of its kind in a 25-county region
of northeastern New York.
</P>
<P>
   These units, with access to sophisticated technology and
experienced medical staff, have helped improve the odds for
premature babies over the past decade. But such intensive medical
care comes with a cost. Albany Medical Center, like other teaching
hospitals, is struggling to pay for neonatal and other highly
specialized services as it grapples with federal budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Congress authorized higher Medicare payments for
teaching hospitals because of the costs they incur in training
graduate medical students, conducting research and operating
state-of-the-art technology. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 cuts
those subsidies by between $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion for the
five-year period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two years of the act, Albany Medical Center lost
about $11 million in Medicare reimbursements. That figure is
expected to climb to $45 million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Medical Center, which employs 6,409 full- and part-time
employees, has been able to operate in the black, despite the lost
revenue. Over the past three years, it has sought to save money by
leaving 165 positions unfilled, by implementing across-the-board
budget cuts and by consolidating administrative offices.
</P>
<P>
   The medical center, with its $445 million annual operating
budget, also has been looking at new sources of revenue, including
expanding its lucrative out-patient surgery department and by
seeking more federal research grants.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Albany Medical Center has seen its slim operating surplus
get even smaller over the past five years. Administrators are
increasingly nervous about how to save money without cutting into
the programs that have helped define the center's mission as a
place for research, quality medical education and advanced medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these budget cuts from the BBA continue, I don't know where
the money is going to come from,'' James J. Barba, president and
board chairman of the Albany Medical Center, said of the Balanced
Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Although the medical center has no plans to eliminate programs,
Barba has not ruled out that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of reduced services at teaching hospitals has
prompted an outcry from some hospital and industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no vision at all as a nation where we're going as a
health care system,'' said Daniel Sisto, president of the
Healthcare Association of New York.
</P>
<P>
   With studies showing that for every dollar spent on teaching
hospitals, the state gets a $3 return in research money and
economic development, Sisto believes the federal cuts are
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are government subsidies being trimmed but some private
insurance companies have gone bankrupt, leaving hospitals to foot
the bill for unpaid claims. Others are late making payments or
frequently dispute bills, adding to the financial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The particular vulnerability of teaching hospitals is that
they have special missions that non-teaching hospitals don't have
... and for which the reimbursements that are now available are
simply becoming inadequate,'' said Dr. Jordan J. Cohen, president
of the Association of American Medical Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the stress at Albany Medical Center is the growing
cost of caring for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the medical center provided about $18 million in free
care, up from $15 million five years ago. While all hospitals are
required to care for patients regardless of their ability to pay,
Albany Medical Center tends to get those uninsured patients who are
sickest and who have the largest bills.
</P>
<P>
   In New York alone, the number of uninsured has grown to 3.2
million people from 2.4 million in 1986. More than 700,000 of the
uninsured are children, including Baby K, who was born at Albany
Medical Center in early August.
</P>
<P>
   The financial problems presented by the federal budget act have
been compounded in New York by the state Health Care Reform Act of
1996. That law also eliminated some government reimbursement for
charity care, graduate medical education and bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything asked of us ... yet the federal and
state governments are still saying cut more, cut more,'' Barba
said.

BAYLOR'S TEACHING HOSPITALS FEAR CUTS IN THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times
 By CAROL CHRISTIAN  
 c.1999 Houston Chronicle   HOUSTON _ For the first time in recent
memory, The Methodist Hospital in Houston is losing money on its
day-to-day business operations. The 80-year-old institution is one
of the nation's largest private, nonprofit hospitals and the
primary adult teaching hospital for Houston's Baylor College of
Medicine. Last year, the hospital that serves as home base for
world-renowned heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey netted $24 million
on its business operations. This year the hospital will end in the
red, due mainly to federal funding cutbacks imposed by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That law reduced Medicare reimbursements to all hospitals and
will cut Methodist's funding by a total of $127.3 million over five
years. By comparison, Methodist's annual Medicare reimbursement in
1997 was $190 million, according to Peter W. Butler, president and
chief executive officer of Methodist Health Care System, which
includes The Methodist Hospital. For 2002, the hospital can expect
$178 million from Medicare _ $36.5 million less than it was slated
to receive under previous legislation, Butler said. ``Hospitals are
facing financial pressures for a variety of reasons, but the
most-often cited reason, as is the case with Methodist, is federal
funding cutbacks of the Balanced Budget Act,'' Butler said. In the
past, Congress authorized higher Medicare payments for teaching
hospitals because of the costs they incur in training graduate
medical students, conducting research and operating
state-of-the-art technology. The Balanced Budget Act cuts those
subsidies by between $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion for the
five-year period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   So far the cutbacks have not affected patient care at Methodist,
Butler said. For Methodist and other teaching hospitals, the cuts
could mean fewer medical residents accepted for training, a move
that could affect not only patient care in the short term, but
health care on the whole for years to come, hospital administrators
said. Dr. Ralph D. Feigin, president of Baylor College of Medicine,
said the reduction in medical residents accepted for training could
begin as early as 2000. Baylor has about 950 residents, most of
whom are allocated among Methodist and six other Baylor primary
affiliated teaching hospitals. Some residents, such as those in
orthopedic and plastic surgery, rotate among all seven.
</P>
<P>
   Feigin said hospital administrators are particularly concerned
about funding for training residents in primary care areas other
than family practice and internal medicine. This includes
obstetrics/gynecology and pediatrics. Feigin said the refrain has
been the same: ``We don't know if we're going to have the money to
be able to train specialists.'' For now, Methodist's income from
investments is offsetting the current federal cutbacks, but
long-term losses are on the horizon, Butler said. Butler came to
Methodist in 1997 from Detroit's Henry Ford Health System; before
that, he worked at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in
Chicago. ``I've been in the business now 25 years, and I've never
seen anything like this in terms of the financial challenge,''
Butler said of the fiscal squeeze on teaching hospitals. Of the
$127.3 million that Methodist is losing, $30 million represents
cuts in federal reimbursements for the hospital's medical
education. ``It's not like non-teaching hospitals are getting off
the hook,'' Butler said. ``It's just that there's an added burden
on teaching hospitals.'' As a teaching hospital, Methodist has
about 200 residents _ doctors who have completed medical school but
are still in training. Texas requires physicians to do at least one
year of residency before they can be licensed. Most doctors also
pursue ``board certification'' in a speciality indicating they have
been trained to the highest standards in that field. Training for
the certification exams can add up to seven years to a physician's
academic career. It is more expensive for hospitals to train
specialists than primary-care physicians, not just because it takes
longer, but also because more types of faculty members are needed.
For example, training a cardiovascular surgeon might involve 10
subspecialties such as interventional catheterization, regular
catheterization, echocardiology, exercise physiology, and others.
Methodist has no plans now for reducing the number of residents or
reducing residents' salaries, Butler said. The average salary for
first-year medical residents at Houston hospitals is $34,000, which
equals the national median _ half are lower and half are higher,
Feigin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cut people's salaries here, you wouldn't attract
residents,'' he said. ``You wouldn't have to worry about cutting
slots; the whole program would dry up.''

BUSY TEACHING HOSPITAL JUGGLES DOLLARS TO SUSTAIN SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE FOY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It's a typical busy afternoon in the emergency
center of University Hospital and Lisa Ochoa is struggling to keep
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, in her third year of an internal medicine residency,
races from room to room, checking charts and vital signs. Despite
the hectic pace, she is calm and collected when talking with
patients.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after finishing her rounds and paperwork, Ochoa
collapses into a chair and confides: ``I've been in this system for
seven or eight years and every year it gets harder. It's mainly
because they're so many of them,'' she says, motioning toward a
patient waiting room, ``and so few of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa said she knows little about the Balanced Budget Act of
1997. But unwittingly, she has just described a main concern for
health providers dealing with the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Congress authorized higher Medicare payments for
teaching hospitals because of the costs they incur in training
graduate medical students, conducting research and operating
state-of-the-art technology. The Balanced Budget Act cuts those
subsidies by between $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion for the
five-year period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Rountree, chief financial officer of the University
Health System in San Antonio, bluntly described the effect on her
operation: ``This is cause for great alarm for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with a predicted loss of about $10 million in Medicare
reimbursement payments through 2000 and other shrinking revenues,
the University system is reducing the number of residency
positions, cutting staff and discharging patients earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For Ochoa, that means caring for more patients. For patients, it
can mean longer waits, shorter stays in the hospital and more
costly care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work long hours and all that, but it's really the patients
who have no money who are feeling the brunt of it,'' Ochoa said.
</P>
<P>
   The University system, the primary teaching base for the
University of Texas Health Science Center, provides research and
training, but also is a main medical care provider for indigent
people in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The federal subsidy for the teaching hospitals involves Medicare
support for every medical resident. The University Health System
expects that for the period between 1998 and 2000, it will lose
about $800,000 in payments for graduate medical education.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the number of residency positions has been reduced
from 328 to 300 in the past two years, and Rountree said she could
not rule out the possibility of more cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the health program for people 65 and over, gives
subsidies to teaching hospitals to provide graduate medical
training and care for the poor. These medical education payments to
the University system are expected to drop from $8.4 million in
1997 to $5.7 million in 2000, Rountree said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that there isn't a need to control costs in
health care,'' said Dr. James Young, dean of the Health Science
Center's medical school. ``But somehow, some way, the message needs
to be conveyed to Congress: `Stop, you've gone too far.'''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's teaching hospitals have been urging Congress to
change the Balanced Budget Act to protect their research and
education missions. They are urging that the reductions in Medicare
payments be frozen at current levels rather than continuing to
phase in deeper cuts, as the act now requires.
</P>
<P>
   Although the University system is operating in the black, the
local taxes it receives to care for the indigent are nearly $12
million short of the actual cost of treating those patients. In the
past, it has juggled money to cover those deficits, but that is now
threatened because of shrinking revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the budget crunch, University faces cuts in state
Medicaid funding meant to compensate for caring for a
disproportionate share of uninsured patients. In 1998, the system
received about $34 million for that responsibility. Next year's
payment is about half that amount, or $16 million, Rountree said.
</P>
<P>
   A windfall from the state's settlement of a lawsuit with the
tobacco industry has helped soften the federal and state cuts,
providing $20.9 million this year alone. Overall, the hospital's
1999 budget stands at $375 million, with a surplus of $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The University system has cut its overall staff in the past two
years from 3,800 to about 3,400, increasing the pressure to do more
with less, Rountree said. And the budget crunch has cut the fund
for medical technology and equipment nearly in half, from $14.5
million to $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Davis, medical director of the emergency center at
University, said the strain on the system is evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budgets are so tight we're going to have to really pick
and choose as to what technology and staff positions are absolutely
necessary,'' he said. ``But when you look at it, we're extremely
fortunate with what we have now.''

BAY AREA TEACHING HOSPITALS FIND THEIR MERGER IS A ROCKY ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Concerned about looming Medicare cuts and
intense local competition, the University of California at San
Francisco and Stanford University decided two years ago to merge
their four hospitals into a private, non-profit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Their idea was that the Bay Area's two major academic medical
centers could compete in the marketplace and cut costs better
together, even though they are 30 miles apart. The marriage has
been rocky, however, and the joint venture named UCSF Stanford
Health Care lost $73 million in the just-ended fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 jobs are being cut, a hospital is closing, and
fingers are being pointed in many directions.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the blame is being assigned to the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997, which lowered Medicare formulas that once rewarded
teaching hospitals for the extra costs of training doctors and
treating complex cases. The Balanced Budget Act cuts those
subsidies by between $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion for the
five-year period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare makes up $390 million _ or 26 percent _ of revenue at
UCSF Stanford. This year, the hospital system will lose $28 million
in Medicare revenue, with the cuts slated to increase each year
until 2002. At that point, the system will be down $46 million
compared to what it would have received under the old formula.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the system with a annual budget of $1.5 billion,
expects to lose $169 million over a five-year period from the
formula changes.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare cuts aren't solely that cause of turmoil at UCSF
Stanford Health Care. Mismanagement, overspending, frozen Medicaid
payments, and an extremely competitive managed care environment
have also hurt the 2-year-old merger.
</P>
<P>
   Besides job cuts, the losses have led UCSF Stanford officials to
close the emergency room and all in-patient services at one of its
four hospitals, UCSF/Mount Zion Medical Center in San Francisco. It
has the highest proportion of Medicare patients of any of the
system's hospitals, and was blamed for the majority of its losses.
</P>
<P>
   The closure, set for the end of this year, only added fuel to
the controversy swirling around the troubled merger. Both partners
are re-thinking the marriage and may take steps to separate some or
all of their functions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of California, which owns half of
the system, believe the cuts in Medicare have played a large role.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a movement nationally to undermine and destroy the
strong medical enterprise this country has built up,'' UC President
Richard Atkinson told UC Regents recently in discussing the
merger's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In that same meeting, UCSF Chancellor Michael Bishop said the
federal budget has been balanced on the backs of academic health
centers, and extensive restructuring and downsizing are inevitable.
The hospitals may even fail, he said, a prospect he finds
``intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lee, former UCSF chancellor and a former assistant
secretary of health, said the big problem is the environment in
which the hospital system operates.
</P>
<P>
   In California, academic medical centers are hurting badly in a
medical economy where a cutthroat managed care system has pushed
monthly premiums per member paid to hospitals for private insurance
to under $90 per month.
</P>
<P>
   But in Wisconsin, where the average monthly payment is $115,
teaching hospitals have been able to absorb the Medicare cuts
without tremendous strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impacts are felt in an area that's competitive with a lot
of managed care,'' Lee said. ``When you've got that, you're in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that the cuts will hurt the medical training
that goes on in the hospitals. UCSF trains about 950 residents each
year at the UCSF Stanford hospitals. At Stanford's medical school,
about 350 residents are trained at the hospital system.

SEATTLE-AREA TEACHING HOSPITALS SAY THEY ARE ALREADY LEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At Harborview Medical Center, the Balanced Budget Act
of 1997 looks like the AIDS virus _ a slow-acting, unseen agent
that will eventually erode the teaching hospital's ability to
rebound from even the smallest wound or challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will absolutely devastate Harborview and other such
hospitals over the next decade,'' said David Jaffe, executive
director of Harborview, the Pacific Northwest's regional trauma
center. ``There is no way for us to adjust to these cuts in
Medicare and remain viable for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Congress authorized higher Medicare payments for
teaching hospitals because of the costs they incur in training
graduate medical students, conducting research and operating
state-of-the-art technology. The Balanced Budget Act cuts those
subsidies by between $2.9 billion and $7.1 billion for the
five-year period from 1998 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already operating at a very lean level,'' said Robert
Muilenberg, executive director of the University of Washington
Medical Center, who said the hospital's margin right now is about
3.1 percent and expected to decline to near zero by the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of a cut here gets more quickly into the muscle and
bone,'' Muilenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW Medical Center and Harborview, a teaching hospital for
the UW, expect to be harder hit by the cuts because of the
additional costs of medical education, research and caring for more
of the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how the UW already gets disproportionately
squeezed by federal payment schedules, Dr. John Coombs, vice
president for medical affairs, pointed to reimbursement for medical
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New York receives about $194,000 per medical
resident per year, Coombs said, while the UW receives only $44,000
per resident per year from Medicare's Graduate Medical Education
fund.
</P>
<P>
   New York's reimbursement rate was arrived at years ago, largely
based on hospitals' existing expenses, Coombs said, which has had
the unintended effect of rewarding those hospitals that operate
most inefficiently.
</P>
<P>
   That formula doesn't even come close to reflecting today's
costs, Coombs said, and these new across-the-board reductions in
payments mean the UW will experience nearly a 30 percent cut in
Medicare payments for graduate medical education over the next five
years _ a reduction of $38 million, from $131 million to $93
million.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Greenawalt, president of the state hospital association,
says the cuts have much more of an effect in actual dollars in the
Northwest than it does on the eastern seaboard because this region
already has an efficient, low-cost system that avoids duplication
of services.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City, they have too many hospital beds and
actually could do with one or two fewer hospitals,'' Greenawalt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital administrators everywhere are predicting doom and
destruction from the cuts in Medicare reimbursements. That's
particularly true in the case of teaching hospitals. They are
asking Congress to freeze cuts in Medicare, rather than continuing
to phase them in, as the act now requires.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the case made by the teaching
hospitals. The skeptics include Richard Keck, vice president for
business development at Swedish Hospital Medical Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every hospital's going to get hit by this,'' Keck said. ``In
fact, I'd say the bigger impact is going to be on smaller and rural
hospitals because of their smaller operating margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutions like the UW Medical Center and Harborview already
receive higher reimbursements, such as through Medicaid and
additional sources of government funding such as research grants
and contracts that aren't available to private hospitals like
Swedish, Keck said. And the UW competes directly in the health care
marketplace with Swedish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical research and education mission of the University
of Washington is a crown jewel for this region and it deserves our
support,'' Keck said. ``But their hospital is just another hospital
... and we should all have to play by the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   He contends that medical schools don't necessarily have to
operate their own hospitals to continue to do medical education and
research. The University of Minnesota, Keck noted, recently got out
of the hospital business and instead trains doctors in
collaboration with other area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Coombs said the notion that the UW hospital should be viewed as
``just another hospital'' in a competitive marketplace fails to
take into account the fact that the hospital is integral to the
UW's research and teaching missions.
</P>
<P>
   And Jaffe said there's no debate that Harborview will be hurt by
the Balanced Budget Act, Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harborview's bottom line is essentially break-even right
now,'' Jaffe said. With the coming cuts in Medicare, he said,
Harborview will bleed nearly $20 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these cuts, the very foundation of our system is
threatened,'' Jaffe said. By the time the public notices the true
cost of cutting Medicare, he lamented, it will be too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could take decades to recover,'' he said.

FORMER LAWMAKER COMPLAINS CONGRESS CUT FUNDS FOR CARE HE NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRONX, N.Y. _ Mario Biaggi, a former New York
cop-turned-congressman who fought for the elderly during his 20
years on Capitol Hill, says he now knows first-hand about holes in
the nation's safety net for the aged.
</P>
<P>
   At 81, Biaggi, a widower, suffered a broken hip last May and has
difficulty walking because of multiple bullet wounds he received
during his 23-year-career on the police force. He also suffers from
an irregular heart beat.
</P>
<P>
   He trembles as he stands with both hands on his metal walker and
complains that he can't pull on his own stockings. He depends on
others, such as the concierge of his building, a home health aide
or a friend, to button his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Biaggi has received hundreds of hours of physical and
occupational therapy, nursing care and help from home health aides
since his health started slipping in February.
</P>
<P>
   But Montefiore Medical Center, a Bronx teaching hospital that
provides those services, says Biaggi could lose them because of
Medicare cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress sliced Medicare by $112 billion in 1997 as part of
a plan to balance the federal budget, it put new limits on the
services that home health agencies can offer. Biaggi has already
busted the $4,900 average annual limit that Montefiore can spend on
patients under the new Medicare limits.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Montefiore has spent more than $18,500 on
Biaggi's home health care and has had to balance that cost against
expenses for other patients with fewer health problems, says Susan
Schulmerich, the program's executive director at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have too many Biaggis,'' she says. ``If you have too
many Biaggis, you get killed. There's going to come a point where
we're going to have to discharge him (from the home care program)
and he won't have anyone to exercise him,'' Schulmerich says.
Without such help, she adds, he could ``lose his muscle strength''
and become ``dangerous to himself, and the likelihood of him
falling again (would be) very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Biaggi is one of an estimated million elderly and disabled
people who are facing curtailed therapy or nursing services in
their homes because of Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Biaggi says he has lobbied his former Capitol Hill colleague,
Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, to restore funding for home health
care.``I say, `Charlie, do it for me,''' Biaggi says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the Clinton administration are scrapping over
federal spending for the 2000 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
Lobbyists for teaching hospitals, nursing homes, home health
agencies and physical therapy groups are vying for a share of
restored Medicare spending now being considered by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Biaggi sees it as ``ironic'' that he championed causes of the
elderly during his congressional career but now fears a future
without adequate care in his old age.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls the 1970s and '80s when he joined the late Rep.
Claude Pepper, D-Fla., in investigating abuses in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now he fears he may end up in one.
</P>
<P>
   Living alone in a modest apartment in the upscale Riverdale
section of the Bronx, Biaggi says his income consists of Social
Security and pensions from his 23 years in the New York Police
Department and 20 years in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   He says he can't afford to pay the $152 that a physical
therapist charges for each home visit or the $52 a day that a home
health aide would cost to help bathe and dress him and prepare his
food.
</P>
<P>
   Biaggi resigned from Congress in 1988 after he was found guilty
of illegally receiving $1.8 million in stock and cash from Wedtech
Corp., a South Bronx tool and die shop, for which he had sought
government contracts. He was sentenced to eight years in jail but
was released after 26 months because of a worsening heart condition
and nerve damage in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   He was also convicted of accepting an illegal vacation from
Meade H. Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader, in
exchange for seeking to arrange government contracts for a client
of Esposito's insurance firm. Biaggi drew a two-and-a-half year
sentence in that case.
</P>
<P>
   He insists he was innocent in both cases and says fines and
legal expenses zapped his finances. Speaking of his fear that he
might someday forced to move to a nursing home, he says it would
``damage the psyche,'' and cause him to lose ``my zest for life.''

 &HT;    Electric titans clashed over electrocution
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We owe the electric chair, Florida's
most shocking piece of furniture for the past 75 years, to an
elderly New York drunk who happened to touch the terminals of an
electrical generator in Buffalo on Aug. 8, 1881.
</P>
<P>
   The old toper died instantly. Purely by chance, his lightning
demise was witnessed by Dr. Albert Southwick, a dentist and former
steamboat engineer. Southwick was so struck by the lightning
swiftness and apparent painlessness of the death that he described
the episode to a friend, New York state Sen. David McMillan.
McMillan had the ear of Gov. David B. Hill, who asked the New York
Legislature to consider how the new force of electricity might
replace hanging as a method of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, 1888, the legislature passed a law establishing
electrocution as the state's method of execution. The law directed
the state Medico-Legal Board to look into the best way of
implementing the new method of execution.
</P>
<P>
   A macabre economic feud between two prominent inventors, Thomas
Alva Edison and George Westinghouse, played an important role in
developing the electric chair. James E. Penrose traces the
controversy in his ``Inventing Electrocution,'' a 1994 article in
the journal, ``American Heritage of Invention and Technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Edison nor Westinghouse was interested in humane capital
punishment. Instead, both fought to have their preferred type of
current adopted as the national standard for electricity. Millions
of dollars were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Edison favored direct current (DC) as an energy source.
Westinghouse believed alternating current (AC) was cheaper, more
efficient and did not require the thick copper wiring DC current
needed for conduction. Because copper was so expensive in the late
19th century, Edison decided to attack Westinghouse on another
front: He would prove AC current was dangerous, even lethal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1887, Edison set out to discredit AC current by inviting
reporters to a public demonstration at his laboratory in West
Orange, N.J., during which he lured a number of dogs and cats onto
a metal plate wired to a 1,000-volt AC generator. The animals were
electrocuted, and the press gave the grisly demonstration extensive
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   So: AC or DC? The board appointed by the New York legislature
turned to a couple of Columbia University scientists for a
solution.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, 1888, Dr. Harold Brown and his assistant, Dr. Fred
Peterson, administered a series of DC shocks to a large
Newfoundland mix dog. The voltage was gradually increased to 1,000
volts, and the dog remained alive, though clearly in great pain.
Then Brown administered a coup de grace with a jolt of just 330
volts of AC current.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, 1888, Brown and Peterson electrocuted two calves and
a 1,230-pound horse. The New York Times' account of the experiment
ends with the observation that ``alternating current will
undoubtedly drive the hangmen out of business in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 12, Brown and Peterson submitted their report to the New
York board. They urged electrocution be carried out with the victim
sitting in a chair, rather than floating in a tank of water or
strapped to a rubberized table. It is a macabre might-have-been:
The thought that we might be discussing ``the electric tank'' or
``the electric table'' today, instead of the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The two experimentalists also recommended using AC current.
</P>
<P>
   Furious at the bad publicity, inventor Westinghouse wrote a
letter published in The New York Times Dec. 13, 1888, accusing
Brown of acting ``in the interest and pay of the Edison Electric
Light Company.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late. In March 1889, Brown met with Austin
Lathrop, superintendent of New York prisons, to arrange for
purchase of Westinghouse AC generators to power the electric chair.
Because Westinghouse refused to sell directly to the prisons, the
state resorted to subterfuge to acquire three generators for about
$8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first man to be electrocuted was William Kemmler, who, on
March 29, 1889, killed his lover, Matilda ``Tillie'' Ziegler, with
an ax in Buffalo. Ironically, Buffalo was then known as the
``Electric City of the Future.'' Kemmler was sentenced to death two
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Inventor Westinghouse was so desperate to avoid having his AC
current associated with death that he paid for legal appeals for
Kemmler on the grounds that electrocution was cruel and unusual
punishment, a debate that continues in Florida to this day. Edison
and Brown both testified that it was painless and humane. Kemmler
lost two appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The first electric chair was designed in 1890 by Edwin R. Davis,
an Auburn Prison electrician. It closely resembles the modern
version. Davis tested it with large slabs of meat.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 6, 1890, Kemmler was electrocuted in the chair at Auburn
Prison. The first jolt did not kill him. A second was administered,
and he was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man never suffered a bit of pain,'' said executioner's
assistant George Fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong men fainted and fell like logs on the floor,'' wrote a
reporter for the New York Herald.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have done better with an ax,'' fumed George
Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   But electrocution was the wave of the future. In 1896, Ohio
introduced electrocution, and in 1898, Massachusetts followed suit.
New Jersey was 1906, Virginia in 1908 and North Carolina in 1910.
Soon thereafter, at least 20 states were using electric chairs,
making it by far the most popular means of execution. At Sing Sing
alone, 614 men were electrocuted before New York abolished the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only four states still use the chair: Florida, Georgia,
Alabama and Nebraska. More and more states have switched to lethal
injection, among them Kentucky and Tennessee within the past year.

 &HT;    A high-voltage discussion: How the chair kills
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Though the electric chair is designed to
kill, not injure, the same processes are at work whenever anyone
gets an electric shock, be it lethal or non-lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond causing tremendous cell and nerve damage, electric shocks
scar and change the brain in ways doctors still don't understand.
Survivors lose short-term memory, forget multiplication tables,
suffer pain for years afterward. Often the post-shock symptoms, or
sequelae, take months to manifest themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When executed criminals are taken to the District 8 Medical
Examiner's Office in Gainesville and autopsied, they show two
distinctive postmortem traits. First, there is a burn on the calf
of the leg where the ground plate of the electric chair made
contact. Second, when the skull is sawed open and the top is popped
off with a tool known as the Virchow skull-breaker _ it looks like
a large key _ there is a pudding-like mass of coagulated blood atop
the brain.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foremost experts on electricity's effects on the
human body is Dr. Raphael Lee of the University of Chicago. Lee,
who was awarded a MacArthur ``genius'' grant and used it to acquire
a Ph.D. in electrical engineering on top of his medical degree,
spoke at a special conference given at Tampa General Hospital in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The power of man-made electricity can be far more devastating
than natural lightning, Lee explained, because the contact lasts
longer. Power lines carry an average of 7,000 to 10,000 volts.
</P>
<P>
   The electric chair, by contrast, only applies 2,000 volts to its
occupant. Volts measure the potential force of an electric charge
from source to ground _ a bucket of water poured off a cliff will
have more force than a bucket of water tipped over on level ground.
Amperes, or amps, measure actual electrical current and are
dependent on the size of the voltage, and the length and
connectivity of the wires and switches through which the current
passes.
</P>
<P>
   A small vacuum cleaner's motor may only use 3 amps of
electricity. A large, heavy, janitorial vacuum cleaner may use 9 to
11 amps.
</P>
<P>
   Males begin to feel electric shocks at 1 milliamp, Lee explains.
Females sense current at half a milliamp. Why? It is not that women
are more sensitive, it is that their fingertips tend to be smaller,
and the charge is thus concentrated in a smaller area.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 16 milliamps, the muscles of the forearm go into spasm.
This is the `no-let-go threshold,''' Lee said. It happens because
flexor muscles in the hand are so much stronger than extensor
muscles. Both are paralyzed, but the inertia of the more powerful
flexor muscles overrules the weaker extensors, so the hand grips
the source of the electricity in a helpless, clamped claw.
</P>
<P>
   If the charge is 60 milliamps or more, there is enough
electricity to cause a lethal arrhythmia in the heart, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 1.5 milliamps, you see direct destructive effect on the
submembranes of the muscles and nerves,'' Lee continued. The human
body encased in skin has a resistance equal to 750-1,000 Ohms, from
hand tip to foot tip, the doctor said. But, said Lee, once the skin
is burned through, ``the body basically acts like a bag of saline
solution.'' It is an extremely good conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The epidermis is 200 microns thick. Anything over 200 volts
breaks through the epidermis and opens a window in the skin. The
skin is burnt away in a millisecond.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 10 amps, which is the level in most electrical accidents,
you get injuries to the skin, skeletal muscles, nerves and
endothelial cells of blood vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   The protocol for execution in Florida's electric chair calls for
three bursts of electricity. The electrocution cycle is two minutes
or shorter in duration. In the last five executions, an average of
about 2,000 volts and 9 to 10 amps were administered in the first
burst of electricity, lasting eight seconds. The second jolt is 4
amps and 650 volts, delivered for 22 seconds, and the third 10 amps
and 1,500 volts for four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   District 8 Medical Examiner William Hamilton, who has performed
autopsies on 30 executed men, including serial killer Ted Bundy,
testified in writing before the Florida Supreme Court during this
summer's inquiry into whether the electric chair constituted cruel
and unusual punishment, as Death Row inmate Thomas Provenzano
argued.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's opinion, summarized in the court's decision: ``The
delivery of 10 amps to the human body with the path of the current
being from the head to the leg results in immediate death,
immediate loss of consciousness, immediate massive depolarization
of the nervous system, and a rapid rise in the temperature of the
internal tissues in the path of the current ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The path of current would be from the top of the head through
the brain and brain stem, through the center of the body, and then
exiting through the electrode on the leg.'' Hamilton testified that
immediate death would also result if the current were only 4 amps.
</P>
<P>
   Electroshock therapy may offer a clue whether the electric chair
causes pain, said another expert, Dr. B.J. Wilder, professor
emeritus at the University of Florida in neurology and
neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   Wilder testified that during electroconvulsive (electroshock)
therapy, in which the brain is stimulated with electricity to
produce a controlled convulsion, 250 to 300 milliamps, or 250/1000
to 300/1000 of 1 amp, is used. Wilder testified that electrical
currents of this level cause the patient to lose consciousness, and
that upon regaining consciousness, the patient does not report any
pain.

 &HT;    Florida Supreme Court rules 'Old Sparky' chair is not a torture
device
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For three quarters of a century now,
doomed prisoners have sat down in a certain oaken chair, in a
certain room at the Florida State Prison outside Starke, never to
rise of their own volition again. Thursday marked the silver
anniversary of the electric chair in Florida, a form of execution
that spits sparks in our minds and consciences.
</P>
<P>
   Flames, smoke, gasps, groans and sudden effusions of blood have
all accompanied the grim proceedings in the chair, known as ``Old
Sparky'' to inmates and free citizens alike. The 1923 chair,
hand-carved by inmates, was retired in May. But its circuitry,
including the console and the three original hand-thrown
knife-switches, has been moved to the successor-chair and is still
used after all these years.
</P>
<P>
   How did we get here?
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1923, executions in Florida were performed locally,
usually by hanging, within the various counties where the condemned
had committed their crimes and been sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1848 and 1922, there were 223 legal hangings in Florida
_ including a slave named Celia, who was hanged in Duval County on
Sept. 22, 1848, for the stabbing death of her master, Jacob Bryan.
Perhaps the last local hanging in Florida was held on Feb. 24,
1922, in Alachua County.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, the Florida Legislature changed the method of execution
to electrocution, which New York had been using since 1890. Inmates
at the Florida State Prison carved the heavy, three-legged chair
from oak. The very next year, at 2:48 p.m. on Oct. 7, 1924, Frank
Johnson of Duval County became the first man to die in it. Johnson
was executed for the December 1923 murder of Atley B. Terrell, a
locomotive engineer, during a train robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Florida has executed 240 people by electrocution.
The state has conducted nine triple executions, three quadruple
executions and 21 double electrocutions. On March 23, 1942, four
men were executed in just 53 minutes, according to Death Row
records. At the time, Prison Superintendent L.F. Chapman called the
rapid-fire executions ``terrible but necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The last double execution was on the morning of May 12, 1964,
when Die Dawson of Gadsden County and Emmett C. Blake of Bay County
were executed 28 minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   An electrocution is an unspectacular event, says retired
corrections officer Lt. E.E. Griffis of Raiford, a 38-year veteran
of the prison system. Griffis has attended several executions. His
son, John, another corrections officer, shaved serial killer Ted
Bundy's leg so it would make cleaner contact with the base plate of
the electric chair when Bundy was executed on Jan. 24, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much to it,'' the elder Griffis said. ``Their
chest swells up, and they lunge up against the straps. And their
fists ball up and slobber comes out of their mouths and their leg
swells under the ground plate. After a while, I quit going. They
all looked the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, several ghastly executions have called the
electric chair into question again. In 1990, Jessie Tafero's head
caught fire when a cellulose sponge was used to improve the contact
between the electrode and his scalp, instead of a sea sponge. In
1997, a foot-high tongue of fire erupted from Pedro Medina's head,
and earlier this year Allen Lee Davis was heard to gasp and moan
during his execution, the first in the state's new oaken chair.
Davis, who weighed over 300 pounds, also suffered a nosebleed that
may have begun before the knife-switch was thrown.
</P>
<P>
   But after hearing expert testimony from both sides, the Florida
Supreme Court ruled Sept. 24 that the chair was not a torture
device and did not violate the stricture against ``cruel and
unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Execution inherently involves fear, and it may involve some
degree of pain. That pain may include pain associated with affixing
straps around the head and body to secure the head and body to the
electric chair. However, any pain associated therewith is necessary
to ensure that the integrity of the execution process is
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's conclusion: ``Execution by electrocution in
Florida's electric chair as it exists in its present condition as
applied does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment, and
therefore, is not unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Old Sparky'' is hidden away today in a storage
room at the Florida State Prison at Starke, according to Department
of Corrections communications director C.J. Drake. When the chair
was retired, corrections officials received two offers to acquire
it for display: one from Tallahassee entrepreneur Devoe Williams
and the second from the Bradford County Historical Museum in
Starke. Both were declined, on the advice of the Museum of Florida
History.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electric chair, which was used in Florida through much of
this century, is unquestionably of historical significance to the
state. This execution device has been the center of some of the
most publicized debates over the death penalty in the last 30
years, including the execution of such well-known felons as
Theodore Bundy. Its historical significance is not only to the
state of Florida, but since capital punishment is a widely debated
issue, exists on a national level as well. While the need to
preserve this object is clear, its exhibition on the other hand is
controversial. At the present time, the exhibition of Florida's
electric chair may not be appropriate,'' wrote William Pfeiffer,
assistant secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a piece of furniture,'' Drake said. ``The electrical
apparatus associated with it, the console and switches and so on,
have been installed on the new chair. All that is left is an old
oak chair in storage.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Sparky was, in fact, falling apart. Engineers reported that
the chair's seat and left rear leg were cracked and that its left
arm was ``weak and very loose,'' and likely to snap off. One screw
was missing. ``We can conclude that it will fail in the near
future,'' the state's consultants reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was replaced in the dead of night last May by a new, sturdier
chair, also made of oak. This chair was fashioned by guards, not
inmates, at the Florida State Prison shop. The new chair has the
same veneer as its predecessor, though its two back legs are
slightly angled toward the rear.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: Last words, last meals and the bizarre handiwork of
`The Fry Guy'
</P>
<P>
   Though final meals for the condemned are supposed to cost no
more than $20, the rules are sometimes stretched. Michael Alan
Durocher, executed in 1993, requested five pounds of jumbo shrimp
for his final repast _ and got them, even though they cost $40. In
the shadow of the chair, most inmates usually ask for steak,
sometimes for steak and lobster. Those scheduled to be executed in
the morning get a standard breakfast of steak and eggs too, but the
steak is always cut up beforehand, as knives and forks are not
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Florida resumed executions on May 25, 1979, John
Spenkelink was the chair's first guest. Spenkelink is alleged to
have quipped: ``Capital punishment: Them without the capital get
the punishment.'' On the morning of his death, a popular disc
jockey on WAPE in Jacksonville known as ``The Greaseman'' played
the sound of frying bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among murderer Ted Bundy's personal effects, gathered up after
his execution on Jan. 24, 1989, was a bottle of suntan lotion, the
kind that works without sunlight. Prison officials theorized that
Bundy, who escaped from prison in Colorado before making his way to
Florida, was hoping against hope to escape from Death Row and
camouflage his prison pallor. Bundy refused his steak-and-egg
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gerald Stano, 46, was electrocuted on March 23, 1998. A serial
killer who preyed on prostitutes, runaways and teenaged girls,
Stano wolfed down a Delmonico steak, baked potato with sour cream
and bacon bits, French bread, salad with bleu cheese dressing, a
half gallon of mint chocolate chip ice cream, and two liters of Dr.
Pepper. His last words: ``Know that I love you all and cherish your
love. Thanks for staying with me when people ridiculed you. I am
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida is third in the nation in the number of executions
since 1976. Texas leads with 189. Virginia is second with 70, and
Florida has executed 44 people since capital punishment was
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   _ A tongue of fire a foot high spurted from Pedro Medina's head
when he was executed on March 25, 1997. Medina had been convicted
of stabbing an elderly woman who helped him. Florida's Attorney
General Bob Butterworth, responding to the botched execution,
commented: ``People who wish to commit murder, they better not do
it in the state of Florida, because we may have a problem with the
electric chair.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the 53 jurisdictions in the United States _ the 50 states,
the District of Columbia, the federal court system and the military
_ all but 13 have the death penalty. Besides the District of
Columbia, these states have abolished capital punishment: Maine,
Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Iowa, North
Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giuseppe Zangara, prisoner No. 24996, was executed on March
30, 1933, and is buried in the potter's field behind Union
Correctional Institution. His metal name-plate is misspelled
``Zangana.'' Zangara was an unemployed bricklayer who almost
changed world history when he tried to assassinate President-elect
Franklin D. Roosevelt in Miami on Feb. 15, 1933. He missed, thanks
to an alert woman in the crowd who jostled his arm at the last
second. The shot killed Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak instead. Zangara
was tried, convicted and executed in just over five weeks. His last
words: ``Push-a da button.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A woodworker calling himself ``The Fry Guy,'' from Newell,
N.C., is offering full-sized replicas of Florida's electric chair

 &HT;    Healthy kids owe this doc a huge debt
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dr. David Martin was a man who cared
about kids, a man who fought for public health, a man who tried to
mask his compassion for the underdog with a tough exterior. But it
only partially hid his tender heart. Cathy Cohn first met him in
the 1980s when Dr. Martin started Healthy Mothers/Healthy Babies
Coalition, the organization Cohn is now head of.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn had always admired him. How could you not? She loved this
man's great mind, his vision, his ability to spot a social problem
and nail it right then and there. She'd even been privvy to his
wonderful twinkling smile a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   But when she read his obituary in the newspaper this week, it
got to her in a way she'd never expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, it has inspired me so much. I'm going to
carry it around with me. You talk about people wanting to make
their mark on this Earth. This was a man who did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Martin was 85 years old when he died at Hospice
Monday. He was frail. He was sick. But at his memorial service
Wednesday night, no one talked about that. They talked about a man
who went to Duke University on a tennis scholarship in 1931, then
turned it down two years later so he could study medicine under the
man who founded the prestigious Duke Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered the young doctor who was the only pediatrician
in town during World War II. A man who delivered babies to black
women when no one else would. He drove to Pahokee to take care of
migrant children and fought for public polio clinics. He preached
infant immunization and got properly outraged _ and properly busy _
when infant mortality rates soared in the county. He started a
seizure clinic for people with epilepsy and promoted the use of
pediatric nurse practitioners in health clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Then he retired and helped found Healthy Mothers/Healthy Babies,
an organization that helps new mothers pre- and post-natal. What
started on a shoestring and a whim in 1986 now has a $2 million
annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Dr. Martin did what so many of us only dream of
doing. He looked at the world, listened to his conscience and then
helped the children.
</P>
<P>
   Andi Levine first met him in 1963 when she was a new nurse,
fresh out of college. The doctor with the big heart and big
expectations was her mentor for the next 36 years. ``He gave me
confidence and he gave me courage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andi Levine was there for the final months of the old doctor's
life. He would call. ``I want to see you,'' the dying man would say
to his old nurse. So she'd go over. She'd walk into the doctor's
bedroom, careful to veil the emotion from seeing him frail and
alone in that bed. She'd kiss his forehead. She'd take his hand.
</P>
<P>
   And then they would talk. Two old friends in the twilight of a
man's life.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just any man.
</P>
<P>
   And his was not just any life.

 &HT;    Personal Social Security estimate will give workers a clearer
view
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal retirement system is coming to your
mailbox, and it wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding: In the next year, most American workers over 25 will
get an individual estimate of how much retirement money to expect
from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Social Security Administration's way of telling you
what to expect _ and what to worry about _ as you plan your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   All estimates are based on past earnings and current law.
Clearly the numbers will be closer to reality for people who plan
to retire in a few years than for those who yearn to retire in a
few decades.
</P>
<P>
   But at any age, you can get some good from the statement. Here's
how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Your retirement benefit. The statement shows whether you have
qualified for a monthly payment and how much it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Your estimates could be off the mark if your future income
changes drastically in the future.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the level of benefits may well decline, or at
least stop growing, as more and more baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a starting point as you begin to figure your future
needs and where the money is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other benefits. The statement also shows the disability
payment you would receive if you were out of work before retirement
and the benefits certain survivors would receive if you die this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of younger Americans have little or no
information about these benefits,'' said Social Security
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   Since many workers don't have disability insurance at work and
haven't bought their own life insurance, knowledge of these federal
benefits is important. Bear in mind that 30 percent of today's
20-year-olds will suffer some disability before they are 67.
</P>
<P>
   _ Early or late retirement. You'll learn your normal retirement
age when you're eligible for the full benefit. That ranges from 65
to 67, depending on the year you were born.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute
showed that 59 percent of Americans believe they will be eligible
for Social Security earlier than the law actually allows. Those who
want to retire early are more likely to believe _ erroneously _
that they will be entitled to benefits early.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also shows how much you will be eligible for at
age 62, at normal retirement age and at age 70. For some, rewards
for working longer will be significant. ``We hope this will help
people start thinking about when their income will be adequate to
retire,'' said Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking your records. You'll get a table of your recorded
earnings, for Social Security purposes, for each year. If there are
mistakes, you have a chance to get them fixed. The statement lists
a phone number to call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting started. The estimates will demonstrate that Social
Security is a foundation, not a full retirement plan. Apfel hopes
the statements will stimulate workers, particularly the young, to
begin assembling their own retirement resources.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that a wake-up call is the most important point.
``What most Americans will probably discover is that Social
Security alone will not be enough,'' said Don Blandin, president of
the American Savings Education Council. ``They will need to take
additional steps to secure their financial future.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipients: Workers over 25 who are not now receiving Social
Security benefits. That's 125 million people.
</P>
<P>
   _ What it says: How much each recipient might receive in
retirement and disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing: Expect to receive a statement three months before your
birthday. The first statements go out this month, to people with
January birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your record: Social Security's version of your past income, on
which your benefits will be based.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your contributions: There's an estimate of how much you will
pay into the system over a full career.
</P>
<P>

retirement ages or changing future income, go to www.ssa

 &HT;    God is asked for patience, a cure
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I was sitting in church among
Alzheimer's sufferers and their spouses, wondering if Alzheimer's
patients worship.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, their caregivers pray to heaven for strength to carry
on.
</P>
<P>
   And just as certainly, according to the Rev. Doug Fountain,
Alzheimer's families have spiritual needs that too often are not
met in traditional houses of worship. Fountain, who leads an
Alzheimer's support group out of Epiphany Lutheran Church in
suburban Lake Worth, had announced that at 12:30 p.m. on Oct. 3, he
would lead an interfaith service for Alzheimer's families.
</P>
<P>
   The service began, with Fountain beaming avuncularly at the 11
couples before him, his smile of welcome flooding the sanctuary and
lapping against its doors. He began not with a prayer or hymn, but
with a simple pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to make this service as pleasurable and
spiritually fulfilling as possible, whatever your faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasurable? I wondered. What if half the congregation took a
notion to wander off? As for spiritually fulfilling, how can that
be assured when Your God and My God might be strangers?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here,'' the pastor continued, ``to worship the one God,
our Lord, our father. You and I are one together in God.''
</P>
<P>
   And so we were. We sang ``Amazing Grace,'' ``How Great Thou
Art,'' and ``Just a Closer Walk With Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   I am not a worshiper, just a wonderer, and yet during the chorus
of ``Just a Closer Walk With Thee,'' my eyes brimmed as I recalled
that it was my mother's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The church got very quiet when Fountain spoke. He had, he said,
spent some time looking through Scriptures with Alzheimer's
families in mind, and he came up with something from Genesis right
off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord God said it is not good for man to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony probably escaped few of the caregivers, who lose
companionship even as their spouses' demands pile on.
</P>
<P>
   A woman one pew in front of me and to my left slipped her arm
around her husband's shoulders and adjusted his collar. Then, with
her fingertips, she caressed the hairs on his neck. I shivered.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fountain continued, God sought a companion for Adam, and
brought one forth with elective surgery. Eve walked beside Adam,
Fountain continued, ``two fleshes become one, bound inextricably
together.''
</P>
<P>
   God, the optimist.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Eden world, Fountain noted somberly, ``Things happen
to the flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   The children leave, and where life once promised to become
simpler, a time to enjoy blessings, a stranger named Alzheimer
moves in, stealing the loved one by degrees, leaving the caregiver
bereft, yet weighted down with responsibilities. And alone.
</P>
<P>
   So it sometimes seems to the beleaguered spouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord is my refuge and strength,'' said Fountain, quoting
the psalmist. ``We come to him now in worship and praise and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what of those times we get angry _ angry at God?'' the
pastor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then he answered: Sometimes it helps to get mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at God,'' he told the congregation. ``You know what? The
Lord doesn't turn his back on us. At these times, he asks us to get
back to where you belong, back to your faith. We can rejoice even
in the midst of difficulty, in the midst of suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, said Fountain, the best way to get through a bad patch is
by laughter, with the support and fellowship of people facing the
same hardships. This lesson he said he learned among the members of
the Alzheimer's support group he counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't lived,'' he chuckled, ``until you've gone to the
Deli-House at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning and just listened to
these folks laughing and cutting up.''
</P>
<P>
   The clergyman closed with a prayer, taking requests. What was it
they wished from God? Only they could tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vaccine to cure this terrible disease,'' a female caregiver
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience!'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have patience,'' Fountain observed. ``Let's pray that the
cause of the need for patience be lifted, that a medical cure be
found.''
</P>
<P>
   As the service came to a close, it occurred to me not once was
there a disturbance, and I mentioned it to the pastor afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect that there would be,'' he said. ``But you must
understand that even when there isn't a problem, the caregivers
worry that there will be, and they retreat into themselves. Here,
they don't have to fear embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   I stood aside, waiting for the couples to pass the pastor.
Usually, it was difficult to tell who was the caretaker and who was
the Alzheimer's patient. Only then did I begin to understand the
anxiety of the caregiver. One moment, the loved one is gentle and
composed, seemingly normal, and a moment later there might be an
outburst or loss of bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   As the last couple walked toward the parking lot, Fountain
favored me with another of his total immersion smiles and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, they don't have to be afraid. We provide them a safe
place.''Ron Wiggins writes for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm

 &HT;    So-called presidential material is mockery of representative
system
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Presidential politics has turned into amateur
hour.
</P>
<P>
   A cast of impostors has crashed the gala and gained more
attention than deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer demonstrates that all one needs is a mailing list and
Puritan ideology to become a presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan shows that all one need do is work a bellicose word
processor.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes demonstrates that all one needs is a Fortune _
oops, wrong magazine.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Jesse (the Id) Ventura can become governor and
talk about presidential aspirations, when Donald Trump and Warren
Beatty can surmise that the nation needs them, when Oprah Winfrey
has to demur and say she has a real job _ entertainment mogul _ and
no time to be the vice president Trump wants her to be, what we
have is a masquerade ball.
</P>
<P>
   Are we getting what we deserve?
</P>
<P>
   George Bush has a resume that is heavy on references and light
on accomplishments. At least he has held an elective office.
Elizabeth Dole, who has held some meaty jobs but no elected office
she didn't marry, appears to be running chiefly on the fact that
she can hold a microphone and walk at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   There are non-pretenders running, people who, like Bush,
actually have won an election, negotiated with a governing body,
examined omnibus budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But there are damn few.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, Buchanan, Trump, Beatty, Dole, Bauer. Not a stint as
county commissioner among them.
</P>
<P>
   All there is is talk. Apparently that is enough.
</P>
<P>
   America should be disgusted, as more and more in Minnesota are,
by Ventura and his position. The disgust should have nothing to do
with what Ventura has said in Playboy or any other venue since his
election. (Give him a venue, he'll talk.) It should have to do with
what little he did to serve the commonweal before he talked his way
into the center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura deserved credit for charisma (of course, give credit
also to a Democrat and a Republican as compelling on-air as a
Mylanta milk shake.) Jesse rode to victory on more than the
nose-ring vote. He won regular Joes without body ornaments. On the
basis of what?
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of refreshing banter, eye-contact,
throw-the-rascals-out exuberance. Observers came expecting a freak
show. They saw a skilled barker. He really connected _ like Oprah
on the tube, like Beatty on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   There's a peculiar reaction in the wake of Jesse's comments in
Playboy, among other things, trashing organized religion and
dismissing the Tailhook scandal: Credit is given to him for being
candid. He didn't tell us what he thought we wanted to hear. He
told us what he was really thinking. Suddenly, that's enough. All
we want is a shock jock at the mike. Give it to us. Talk dirty to
us. We'll love you for it. We want a leader with a 1-900 number on
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   And if you think this is reserved for the Reform Party, whose
search for a standard-bearer sounds like medication roll-call at
the state hospital, you missed last week's convention of the
hard-right National Federation of Republicans. There, Forbes,
Buchanan, Bauer and Alan Keyes bashed Bush for saying that there
might be reasons for government beyond invasive holy wars on
personal choices (which, let's be clear, sound OK to Bush as well.)
</P>
<P>
   Keyes got an ovation calling for abolition of the income tax.
Forbes, who won the convention's straw poll, called for an
elimination of all individual taxes beyond a 17 percent flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they got an ovation. But they could say things like this.
They've never negotiated a government budget. They've never had to
compromise a day in their lives, never had to find a coalition to
break a stalemate, never had to yield the floor to someone with a
differing opinion, never had to reason with a diverse constituency,
never had to make anything work in the complex, agonizingly messy
forum of representative democracy. Yeah, let's elect one of them.

 &HT;    Personal Social Security estimate will give workers a clearer

 &HT;    Tomlin revisits the stage complete with alter-egos
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Growing up in Detroit in the early '50s,
precocious Mary Jean Tomlin loved to put on shows, imitating the
female stars she would see on the television set her blue-collar
family could barely afford. By the end of the '60s, she was a
sensation on national television on ``Rowan &AMP; Martin's Laugh-In,''
adopting her mother's first name and amusing the country with such
acutely observed, comically exaggerated characters as telephone
operator martinet Ernestine and a philosophical, smart-mouthed
5-year-old named Edith Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Tomlin graduated to Broadway in 1977 with a one-woman show
called Appearing Nightly, then returned in 1985 with a cosmic
monologue called ``The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the
Universe,'' a time-tripping journey of comic consciousness-raising
that she brings to the Kravis Center on Thursday in an expanded
version. Once more she inhabits a gallery of universal misfits,
from bag lady Trudy who talks to extraterrestrials to a punk-haired
teenage performance artist named Agnus Angst to Paul, a disco-era
reject now torn between health food and cocaine, and many more, all
unexpectedly intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that Tomlin's chosen route to stardom has
been submerging her personality into her characters. After all,
about the only thing Tomlin hasn't done, onstage or off, is talk
about herself. And that's exactly how she likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been rigidly secretive, but I try to protect as much
privacy as I can, rather than just being co-opted by the tabloids
or by the press in general,'' she says, pleasantly but firmly.
``Somehow, you just have to protect yourself, in some way, from so
much, uh, tabloidization, is all I can say. I'd rather do my work
and express myself in my work and have people decide from that what
they think of me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth, as Edith Ann would conclude with a
tongue-vibrating raspberry.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin has been venturing beyond her own characters in recent
years, joining the ensemble of the CBS television series ``Murphy
Brown,'' from 1996 through 1998, as the FYI team's sadistic boss,
Kay Carter Shepley. And this year, she gained attention in the
Franco Zeffirelli World War II movie, ``Tea With Mussolini,''
playing a wisecracking lesbian archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   Both were lucrative enough that Tomlin, 60, feels able to treat
herself to a return to the stage. ``Yeah, it's been a long time,''
she concedes. ``I thought it was good to let people see I can still
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew she wanted to hit the road with a concert tour, she
just didn't know what to perform. Limbering up before student
audiences at the University of Southern California, she got the
best responses when she dipped back into the theatrically inventive
Search, written for Tomlin by her longtime personal companion and
professional collaborator, Jane Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the point that Jane is truly the writer,''
says Tomlin. ``I really don't have that capacity. I can understand
it and intuit it and, thank God, I can perform it to some degree,
but if you put me in a room with a thousand monkeys, it still
wouldn't spring forth.''
</P>
<P>
   They met in 1971 when Tomlin saw a teleplay by Wagner about an
inner-city kid and contacted her for help in conceiving a comedy
album for Edith Ann. The album, ``And That's the Truth,'' won a
Grammy and they have been a writer-performer team ever since,
through the highs of ``Search'' to the lows of ``Moment by
Moment,'' a 1971 bomb with John Travolta that Wagner directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that was extremely tough, of course, although we didn't
know it at the time,'' says Tomlin. ``Whenever you're making a
movie, you never know you're making something that's going to fail
miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   At USC this spring, Tomlin and Wagner began reweaving the
threads of ``The Search,'' looking for new epiphanies. ``We started
kind of experimenting with the characters, sort of where the end of
the century has taken them and stuff like that,'' explains Tomlin.
``As I started working on it, it seemed richer than it ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin is well aware that, like a singer whose audience wants
favorite hits rather than new, unfamiliar tunes, her Kravis
audience may really want to hear what Ernestine, Edith Ann or
perhaps lounge lizard Tommy Velour have to say as the millennium
approaches. And such is Tomlin's new ease with herself that she
suggests she just might oblige such a request. ``See, Lily's a
character in the play and always has been,'' she says. ``Lily's
just another character that Trudy time-travels to visit. So she
could visit Lily at any time in her career,'' Tomlin says with a
raucous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ernestine, the sour-faced embodiment of our worst phone fears,
has not been so visible since the breakup of Ma Bell. ``Well, she
just doesn't have the kind of autonomy she had at the phone
company,'' Tomlin says with a touch of remorse. ``The divestiture
kind of ruined Ernestine's life, really.'' Still, she thinks aloud,
surely Ernestine could amuse herself by ``slamming,'' stealing
subscribers without customer knowledge. ``Yeah, she could get her
hand in there,'' Tomlin says.
</P>
<P>
   As to Edith Ann, whether or not she makes a guest appearance in
``The Search,'' she may have her own television series one day.
``We've made this life-sized Edith Ann puppet that's just
wonderful,'' says Tomlin. ``Her eyes and tongue are radio-operated.
I wanted the other characters to be able to relate to Edith and
these puppeteers just fell in love with the idea.'' So far though,
Tomlin hasn't had time to develop such a series, or as she puts it,
``I haven't gone out there and tried to get her a job, but I'm
going to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has she gotten very far on CBS' offer to put together a TV
show for herself. ``I mean, I'm supposed to be developing a pilot
and we work on that from time to time and try to come to terms with
the network.'' The problem is what Tomlin and Wagner find funny
usually makes the network suits nervous. ``It depends on what
they'll let you play with, you know,'' says Tomlin. ``Like I want
to do something a little bit wacky and there may not be a place for
it on the network.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she is out on a 29-city concert tour where she can be
her own boss. ``I mean, theater is theater and that's why I'm
always drawn to it,'' she says with a rush of enthusiasm. ``And the
wonder of it, the goosebump experience, we wanted to give the
audience the goosebump experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In a theater, she can ignore the pressures to aim low and be
crass, preferring humor that gives the audience credit for some
intelligence. ``That's what always pleased me, that kind of
exploration of the culture and culture types, how we relate to one
another,'' says Tomlin. ``A kind of humor that's more embracing,
rather than divisive or ridiculing. It's like when people would do
mother-in-law jokes, I would rather do the mother-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   As she gets excited talking about ``The Search,'' Tomlin begins
talking faster, and her tendencies toward psychobabble win out.
``Most audiences, I mean, they have a tremendous experiential
moment in the theater with ``The Search.'' The idea was, the
passion and the desire was, to make this a kind of transcendent
experience where everyone was united _ even if it was only for a
flash, you had that sense of connectedness and a kind of
affirmation of your dignity as a species.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh, right, Lily.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the occasional benefit appearance, it has been more
than a decade since Tomlin has been onstage, since she won a Tony
award for her tour de force whirlwind performance in The Search,
besting such heavyweight actresses as Jessica Tandy and Rosemary
Harris. Lately, though, if you mentioned her name to
twentysomethings, they'd be likely to identify her as ``that new
cast member on 'Murphy Brown.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably,'' she says, ``if that. That's why I like presenting
``The Search'' now, a chance for that generation to see it. It's a
chance for them to see what I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlin had turned down other sitcom opportunities but said yes
to ``Murphy Brown'' because ``it was a show that was winding down.
And I thought, well, it can give me a chance to see what it is to
really do that kind of episodic TV. And truthfully, it was one of
the highlights of my career, on a personal level.'' Perhaps it was
all those years doing solo shows, but she got a kick out of playing
with others. ``Nothing great happened for me critically or
anything, but I loved being with those actors.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that ``Murphy Brown'' completed production on a
Friday and the next day she got a call from Zeffirelli to meet with
him about a role in his next movie. But the role of Georgie in
``Tea With Mussolini'' was originally sketchy and tangential, so
Tomlin almost turned it down. ``I said, `But Franco, Ruth Gordon
once said if you can tell a story without a character, then don't
accept that part.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian filmmaker said, ``Darling, I'll write it for you,
I'll make it better. We'll make up the part. You must come to Italy
and spend the summer with us and we'll make it happen.'' With the
occasional ad-lib from Tomlin, Zeffirelli built up the role and
allowed Tomlin a memorable Tuscan adventure alongside such
formidable co-stars as Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and
Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it all started coming together, who could possibly have
said no?'' asks Tomlin. ``I would have done it, I suppose, if it
was a silent role.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that performing alongside those revered
British actresses wasn't an emotional roller coaster. ``Oh,
intimidating, thrilling, exultant, terrifying, cry in your room, so
afraid Maggie is going to reject you. With Maggie, it was like I
was 14 years old again with an autograph book.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, she is still a kid, still Mary Jean Tomlin, even if she
did turn 60 last month. Any philosophical thoughts on that
milestone? ``No, other than that it doesn't seem possibly true,''
she says soberly.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her what is still left to achieve and she'll say, ``Well, I
guess peace of mind.'' In fact, the years have sanded Tomlin's
edges. She is far removed from the militantly political woman who
refused to appear as Ernestine on ``Laugh-In'' opposite Martha
Mitchell, the outspoken wife of Richard Nixon's attorney general,
or to be photographed with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what a little jerk I was,'' says Tomlin. ``I did the
same thing with John Wayne,'' the staunchly right-wing movie star.
``I'd give anything now to have that picture with John Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's Tomlin is less driven, less hard on herself and others.
``I think there's a lot to that, in terms of just being more
accepting of what comes around. More forgiving, in a way, of
yourself and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth.

 &HT;    Personal Social Security estimate will give workers a clearer
view
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal retirement system is coming to your
mailbox, and it wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding: In the next year, most American workers over 25 will
get an individual estimate of how much retirement money to expect
from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Social Security Administration's way of telling you
what to expect _ and what to worry about _ as you plan your
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   All estimates are based on past earnings and current law.
Clearly the numbers will be closer to reality for people who plan
to retire in a few years than for those who yearn to retire in a
few decades.
</P>
<P>
   But at any age, you can get some good from the statement. Here's
how:
</P>
<P>
   _ Your retirement benefit. The statement shows whether you have
qualified for a monthly payment and how much it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Your estimates could be off the mark if your future income
changes drastically in the future.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the level of benefits may well decline, or at
least stop growing, as more and more baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a starting point as you begin to figure your future
needs and where the money is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other benefits. The statement also shows the disability
payment you would receive if you were out of work before retirement
and the benefits certain survivors would receive if you die this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of younger Americans have little or no
information about these benefits,'' said Social Security
Commissioner Kenneth S. Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   Since many workers don't have disability insurance at work and
haven't bought their own life insurance, knowledge of these federal
benefits is important. Bear in mind that 30 percent of today's
20-year-olds will suffer some disability before they are 67.
</P>
<P>
   _ Early or late retirement. You'll learn your normal retirement
age when you're eligible for the full benefit. That ranges from 65
to 67, depending on the year you were born.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute
showed that 59 percent of Americans believe they will be eligible
for Social Security earlier than the law actually allows. Those who
want to retire early are more likely to believe _ erroneously _
that they will be entitled to benefits early.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also shows how much you will be eligible for at
age 62, at normal retirement age and at age 70. For some, rewards
for working longer will be significant. ``We hope this will help
people start thinking about when their income will be adequate to
retire,'' said Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Checking your records. You'll get a table of your recorded
earnings, for Social Security purposes, for each year. If there are
mistakes, you have a chance to get them fixed. The statement lists
a phone number to call.
</P>
<P>
   _ Getting started. The estimates will demonstrate that Social
Security is a foundation, not a full retirement plan. Apfel hopes
the statements will stimulate workers, particularly the young, to
begin assembling their own retirement resources.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that a wake-up call is the most important point.
``What most Americans will probably discover is that Social
Security alone will not be enough,'' said Don Blandin, president of
the American Savings Education Council. ``They will need to take
additional steps to secure their financial future.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   _ Recipients: Workers over 25 who are not now receiving Social
Security benefits. That's 125 million people.
</P>
<P>
   _ What it says: How much each recipient might receive in
retirement and disability benefits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing: Expect to receive a statement three months before your
birthday. The first statements go out this month, to people with
January birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your record: Social Security's version of your past income, on
which your benefits will be based.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your contributions: There's an estimate of how much you will
pay into the system over a full career.
</P>
<P>

retirement ages or changing future income, go to www.ssa

 &HT;    Go Fish: How to feng shui all on your own
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mae Chin Williams, a feng shui
consultant based in Ohio, has reduced the 3,000-year-old Chinese
art of placement into a 65-card deck called the Feng Shui Card
System. If you can play Go Fish, Mae Chin promises, you can feng
shui your home or office in a jif.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to test the cards _ which retail for $14.95 at places
like Borders and Amazon.com _ on my own home, an old Dutch Colonial
housing myself, my husband, a 16-month-old baby and two fat cats.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is, you start at the top of the deck and select the
cards that apply to your house's layout, which direction it faces,
etc. Then you follow the suggestions on the card for making feng
shui improvements, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The cards include many of the common-sense aspects of feng shui
decorating, such as putting furniture where it creates a pleasant
flow rather than at awkward angles. But you'd have to be a true
believer to set up an aquarium with eight red fish and one black
fish as a means of creating ``successful energy flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Locate the direction of the main entry of your home with the
compass: The card system includes a plastic compass, about the size
of a nickel, which was not reliable. But, hey, I live on the South
Florida grid pattern and would have to be a complete idiot not to
know that my entry faces west. (And if I didn't know, I could pick
up The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui ($18.95, MacMillan).
</P>
<P>
   _ If the front entrance faces west, you may have many children:
So says the card. The card never went through labor. The card also
says ``west represents the metal element (and) metal represents the
possibility of creating a large family.'' I decide this could be
true if A.) a big chunk of metal bops me on the head and I
hallucinate that I'm Ethel Kennedy or B.) The metal happens to be
gold bullion, magically appearing on my doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does any large tree overshadow and/or block your main entry
view or path? Apparently, this obstructs positive energy from
entering the home, which is a problem, because four acacia trees
line our driveway and extend their brittle, leaf-dropping branches
right over the entryway. The card says it's OK to chop these down,
but doesn't offer a solution if the trees happen to belong to your
84-year-old neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Does your home have any extensions? We have a new deck on the
east side of the house. The card says an eastward extension
``brings energy that is good for raising children.'' The cards are
mocking me!
</P>
<P>
   _ Is your staircase in direct alignment of the main entry and
does the staircase divide two living areas? Yes. This splits the
energy, the card says, meaning that one of the rooms will rarely be
used. In our case, it's the dining room, which is used, justor its intended purpose. (Is it bad feng shui to change diapers on
your dining table?) The card suggests putting a floor plant on the
staircase landing to correct the energy flow. A couple of plants on
top of a table will have to do, because our fattest cat, Cato,
likes to eat plants left on the floor, then vomit. I don't know
about diapers on the dining table, but that can't be good feng
shui.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decorating with antiques or used furniture is not recommended:
Well, bring me a Dumpster. The card explains that antiques and used
furniture can carry with them the bad karma of a previous owner,
transferring it to your home. But I happen to like antiques.
Although, I must admit, it now feels a little weird to own a
mattress that once belonged to a friend of mine.
</P>
<P>
   His cat died on it.
</P>
<P>
   My energy suddenly feels negative.

 &HT;    Finding the right feng shui consultant
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Practicing feng shui falls into two
categories: the do-it-yourselfers and those who hire help. The more
than 200 books in print can help if you want to go the self-taught
route, but choosing a feng shui consultant is a little trickier,
especially now that it's trendy, says Nancilee Wydra, founder of
the Feng Shui Institute of America near Vero Beach and a feng shui
consultant since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   There are no industry standards or licensing in feng shui
(although Wydra is working to establish these). There are no
professional associations to call for member referrals. And while
some people study feng shui for years, others take weekend
workshops and call themselves consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people just started feng shui yesterday,'' she warns.
``The public has to be careful. It can be snake oil or the best
thing you've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wydra offers these tips for hiring a consultant:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask what school of feng shui the consultant follows to help
choose someone most compatible with your ideas and beliefs. Tibetan
Black Sect Buddhist feng shui, for example, is close to the
traditional Chinese feng shui and follows Eastern philosophies.
Pyramid School, which Wydra founded, uses more Westernized ideas,
while Compass School and the Four Pillars are linked to Chinese
astrology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find out how much studying the consultant has done. Ask
whether he or she attended a program, how long it was, and whether
there was a mentoring program. The more detailed the course of
study, the more knowledgable the consultant. Be wary of someone who
asks only for your birth date in order to conduct a consultation _
their advice will skim the surface of feng shui, Wydra says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for references from the current year and the two previous
years. This lets you check customer satisfaction while learning how
long the consultant has been working.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to pay about $60 to $150 per hour for the consultant,
and expect the consultation to take up to 3 hours.

   Does your home need a little Feng shui?

   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's how you can tell feng shui has
gone mainstream:
</P>
<P>
   It's now a verb.

   As in, ``I feng shuied my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``network'' and ``dialogue'' before it, feng shui has hit
the big time, so popular that it's not only the ancient Chinese art
of placement, but the act of placement.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? You can look it up in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,
which added the two-part word just last year, along with other
popular words such as ``gazillion'' and ``buffalo wings.''
Webster's says feng shui (pronounced ``fung shway,'' literally
meaning wind-water in Chinese) is only a noun, but try telling that
to its legions of practitioners, consultants and authors.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet search turned up more than 200 books on the subject,
and three separate feng shui workshops have been held locally in
the past two weeks, drawing hundreds of people. Even the folks who
bought O.J. Simpson's Brentwood mansion used a feng shui consultant
to get rid of any negative energy left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've missed the feng shui bandwagon, it is, according
to Webster's, ``a Chinese geomantic practice in which a structure
or site is chosen or configured so as to harmonize with the
spiritual forces that inhabit it; also: auspicious orientation,
placement or arrangement as determined by feng shui.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the way your house sits on its lot, the
direction the doors face, where you put your furniture, where you
hang your art, what kinds of symbolic decorations and colors you
use _ all of these things, and more _ can affect your moods,
health, relationships and financial success.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui has been around for more than 3,000 years, but its
burgeoning popularity in the West, experts say, is a side effect of
our hectic, stressed lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ties in with spirituality,'' says Carol Cannon,
president of Environmental Placements Inc., a Delray Beach firm
specializing in feng shui for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are seeking (spirituality) and seeking harmony and
calmness and peace in their lives. It's just another way to help
make your life more positive.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Cheryl Carpentier of Stuart decided to give it a try.
Carpentier, owner of The Cabinet Gallery and vice president of the
National Kitchen and Bath Association's South Florida chapter,
recently held a feng shui workshop for local NKBA members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes you a better designer only improves what
you're offering your client,'' says Carpentier, who designs custom
kitchens. ``I think there's a lot of principles in feng shui that
are useable.''
</P>
<P>
   Principles such as not having your back to the kitchen entrance
when you work at the kitchen island or stovetop. This is less
welcoming to others in the room and, in the case of the stove, can
be dangerous if you're startled when someone comes up behind you.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Carpentier says, she probably wouldn't go so
far as performing a ``clearing'' for a client. In feng shui,
clearings are done to eliminate negative energy by saying a prayer
or waving burning sage over the area, Cannon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I going to go out and do that? No. I think my customers
might wonder about me,'' Carpentier says. ``I work with builders a
lot and I can't imagine them taking me seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite feng shui's popularity _ and many of the common-sense
design philosophies it uses _ it can raise eyebrows for some of the
near-religiosity surrounding it, Cannon says. She primarily follows
Tibetan Black Sect Buddhist feng shui, a traditional type rooted in
Eastern philosophies.There are several other feng shui styles,
including the Compass School (which uses strict compass directions)
and the Four Pillars (linked to Chinese astrology).
</P>
<P>
   Such links to spiritualism make some people wary. One of
Cannon's clients, the o a large South Florida company, swore
Cannon to secrecy after she performed feng shui at the company's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more open about their belief in feng shui, such as
Health Communications in Deerfield Beach, publishers of the
``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' books. Their headquarters, plus the
home of president Peter Vegso, were ``feng shuied'' by Cannon. She
is also working with the developers of the new Spa Atlantis in Fort
Lauderdale to apply feng shui principles to several new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a progressive company and we're open to new ideas and
new (ways) of doing business,'' says Health Communications
spokeswoman Kim Weiss. ``(The feng shui) is definitely a point of
conversation. There are believers and skeptics, but we have a high
percentage of believers. There are plants where there weren't
plants and mirrors that make the space seem bigger. The place is
very livable now.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss cites the example of a large column in one part of the
office that Cannon determined was ``blocking the positive energy.''
They covered it with mirrors to make it seem to disappear and the
department nearest the column became much more productive, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, feng shui's success lies largely with the person
using the space, says Nancilee Wydra, founder of the Feng Shui
Institute of America in Vero Beach and the most-published American
author of feng shui books. Her Sept. 26 workshop in Delray Beach
attracted 126 people, ``from 23-year-old boys with their baseball
caps on backward to 80-year-old couples,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feng shui isn't about place,'' she says. ``It's about the
human experience of place.''
</P>
<P>
   Wydra created the Pyramid School style of feng shui, a type that
diverges from traditional Chinese feng shui to account for the
differences between Eastern and Western cultures. (For example,
Chinese feng shui often uses talismans like the octagon-shaped
bac-gua mirror, which reprsents the ``I Ching,'' or all possible
combinations of masculine and feminine forces in the world. These
icons hold little meaning for Americans, who may prefer talismans
important to them, such as family photos.)
</P>
<P>
   But, she says, to truly reap the benefits from any style of feng
shui, a person must approach it with an open mind. Like the placebo
effect in medicine, the positive act of believing that something
will work can make good things happen. And besides, feng shui
devotees point out, it does no harm to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe something is going to work, then that belief
means you're already 50-percent there,'' Wydra says. ``When you
have belief, you're far more likely to achieve your goals than when
you don't.''

 &HT;    A natural `Miss Hathaway' learns to live with it
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Soon after her days on ``Laugh-In,''
Lily Tomlin made the transition to film. Some of her thoughts on
her movie roles:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Nashville'' (1975) _ ``It was a great break for me, because
at that time very few people crossed over from television, and
especially someone like me who was doing such characters as
Ernestine. People thought that's who I was. And of course (director
Robert) Altman never watched television. I only found out later
that that part had been written and conceived for Louise Fletcher.
At the time, I just thought I was very lucky to get it. It was my
first film and I got nominated (for an Academy Award).''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``All of Me'' (1984) _ ``That's one of my favorites, because I
think it's a really funny, charming movie. At first, I wasn't going
to take the part, because there was a certain lack of consciousness
about some things. Because my character was so aristocratic and
autocratic, but in the bed scene, when I'm in (Steve Martin's) body
when he's with Victoria (Tennant), in the script he was slapping
her. I said, `That's going to look awful.' So we finally worked it
out that he spanked her, so it was just silly and playful.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' (1993) _ ``That's one that
surprised me. I turned it down at first. I didn't want to be Miss
Hathaway, you know? Even my mother called me, `Oh, I heard you're
going to be Miss Hathaway. You're just going to be perfect.' And I
would think, `I'm not Miss Hathaway. That's all there is to it.'
And of course, I must have been Miss Hathaway, because I actually
got many of my best reviews ever for a movie. So my maturity allows
me to accept this now.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Flirting With Disaster'' (1996) _ ``That's another one of my
big favorites. I read the script so many times and every time I'd
read it I would laugh out loud. It was pretty popular in the big
cities, in the East and the West, but the middle of the country
didn't like it. They don't like hand-held camera.''

 &HT;    Feng shui in a hurry: Top 10 tips from the experts
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Chinese art of feng shui is more than 3,000 years old, and
trying to figure out all its symbols and meanings sometimes feels
like it might take that long. We asked several local feng shui
consultants to boil it down. Here is their condensed list of tips:
</P>
<P>
   1. Clear out the clutter. ``Clutter accumulates dead energy,''
says Nancilee Wydra, founder of the Feng Shui Institute of America.
``It congests us, makes us unable to do things.'' Her rule? If you
haven't used it or worn it in 18 months, chuck it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Position your bed and desk so you don't have your back to the
door. ``It makes you vulnerable,'' says Carol Cannon, president of
Environmental Placements, a firm that specializes in feng shui for
corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   3. Create places for conversation, such as two chairs at right
angles. People tend to talk to each other more in this position
than if they face each other or sit side-by-side. Ideally, this
area is in a ``technology-free'' part of the house where you ban
TVs, telephones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   4. Create a place to eat that is honored and doesn't feel empty.
If you have a big dining table but usually only two people for
dinner, sit together (at right angles) at one end of the table and
create a display of art and candles at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a ``power wall'' in your living room that is a
representation of what you want out of life. This is the wall
opposite the main entrance to the room. At feng shui consultant
Wendy Victor's home in Palm Beach, Fla., the power wall is over the
fireplace mantle, where her husband, Mike, placed a tranquil
painting of a boat on a lake. The painting reflects the beauty and
peacefulness the Victors strive for in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   6. Engage the senses. People feel good outdoors because all of
their senses are affected. Inside, use flowers, the movement of a
flickering candle, the sound of water running in a tabletop
fountain and other objects to keep the house from feeling sterile.
</P>
<P>
   7. Embrace nature by filling your home with live healthy plants
or clean silks.
</P>
<P>
   8. Use all the rooms of your house. If you don't use a room,
change its purpose so you will. ``If you don't use it, you become
underpowered,'' Wydra says.
</P>
<P>
   9. Don't forget the outside of your house. ``Get in a car and
let a friend drive you back to your house. If you approach it from
a point where you can just look at it, instead of focusing on the
road, you might see some dead (plants) or other outside clutter,''
Cannon says.
</P>
<P>
   10. And don't forget the garage, if that's where you usually
enter your home. ``Honor that space as you would the front door,''
Wydra says. Wendy and Mike Victor have done this by covering the
interior walls of their garage with a mural of plants, birds and
animals.

 &HT;    NUTS &AMP; BOLTS: Steam shower or sauna? Looks like a dead heat
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Some reader questions fall completely outside my
area of expertise. For today's questions on saunas and vinyl
siding, I spent about a week on each, looking through books,
surfing the Web and talking to experts on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I haven't been completely stumped yet.
</P>
<P>
   E.B. of Trotwood, Ohio, plans to have a house built, and he
wants to include either a home sauna or a steam shower. He wanted
to know the advantages and disadvantages of each, including health
benefits, costs, energy consumption and so on.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Solution: Saunas are small rooms with wooden benches that
usually have a heater mounted on the wall or in a corner. They
provide dry heat, but in most you can toss a little water onto
stones on top of the heater to add humidity to the air. Steam
showers are shower stalls that are watertight from floor to
ceiling. A steam generator, usually placed in a nearby room or
closet, produces steam that is pumped into the sealed shower stall
through nozzles. Saunas and steam showers do essentially the same
thing, and choosing one over the other is mostly a matter of
personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sean Convery, medical director of the Miami Valley Sports
Medicine Center, said saunas and steam showers both open your
pores, make you sweat and relax your muscles and joints. Convery
said some people feel steam helps their sinuses and skin, but he
knows of no clinical studies backing up that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Saunas and steam showers both take some getting used to, so they
should be used for 10 minutes or less at first. Avoid them
altogether if you have a history of heart problems or high blood
pressure or if you're pregnant. Prepare for the intense heat by
drinking three to four glasses of water beforehand. Move slowly
when you're ready to leave. The heat can make you dizzy if you're
not used to it. Saunas and steam showers don't help you lose
weight, they don't draw impurities out of your body and, although
they may ease cold symptoms temporarily, they don't shorten a
cold's duration.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Cyrus, assistant sales manager of a Watson's store in
Cincinnati, said he sells steam-shower systems for about $3,500 to
$4,500. Installation costs vary with the amount of plumbing work
that must be done and the elaborateness of the shower stall.
Portable sauna units that come in two halves that a homeowner can
snap together in 10 minutes sell for about $3,600. One of the most
popular models Cyrus sells is a 5-by-7-foot sauna that sells for
about $4,700. The energy consumption of a sauna or steam shower
varies with the size and efficiency of the heater or steam
generator.
</P>
<P>
   ADDING NEW SIDING TO AN OLD HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   R.P. is rehabilitating an old house and wants to put vinyl
siding on the exterior walls. The problem is the old walls are in
less-than-perfect shape. The walls are sided with traditional
overlapping wooden slats, and many of the slats are cracked or
damaged. Some have holes through which insulation was previously
added. R.P. wants to know whether he should use a house-wrapping
material such as Tyvek or if he should apply something like tar
paper commonly used in roofing to seal the house before installing
the vinyl siding.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Solution: Representatives of New Haven Construction, a
housing-rehabilitation specialist, and All Seal Home Improvement, a
siding specialist, both said foam boards are the backing of choice
for vinyl siding on an old house. All Seal Vice President Bill
Stacy said 1/4-inch foam board adds a layer of insulation while
providing a level surface underneath the new siding. ``It makes the
siding look better if it's attached to a flat foam board,'' Stacy
said. A synthetic house wrap or tar paper might be acceptable, but
not preferred. Stacy said any wrap with a metallic or shiny surface
should be avoided because it can trap heat under the vinyl and
damage the installation.

 &HT;    Chevrolet refines a meal ticket
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although not particularly noticeable on the road, the
Chevrolet Cavalier really stands out when General Motors and the
rest of the auto industry look at the bottom line: The Cavalier is
Chevy's best-selling sedan. Its 1999 sales through September were
up 7 percent from last year to 217,345 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, the Cavalier had sales totaling 256,099, making it No. 6
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, GM doesn't want to do anything radical to its volume
leader, so the 2000 Cavalier gets some exterior tweaking _
body-color trim and repackaged taillamps _ and some mechanical and
interior refinements. The noticeable changes include making air
conditioning standard on all five models and _ finally _ switching
the heater/AC controls and radio so that the stereo is on top of
the center dash stack and therefore easier to reach and operate.
The General scores ergonomic points for this.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note, too, that the radios are significantly
improved, with power bumped to 50 watts. The upgraded ones have the
Radio Data System, which allows traffic and weather bulletins to
interrupt the use of the radio, cassette and CD players to keep
drivers well-informed.
</P>
<P>
   Prices have evolved a bit, too _ upward, of course. The base
Cavalier coupe is $13,066, the base sedan is $13,165, the LS sedan
is $14,710, the two-door Z24 is $16,270 and the Z24 convertible is
$19,735.
</P>
<P>
   In-town and interstate driving in an LS sedan and a Z24 coupe
prove that both Cavaliers remain people-friendly, for the most
part. They seem solid enough with sound overall ergonomics _ not
just those relating to the stereo and heater/AC _ and fairly good
seats with good interior room for what are subcompact cars.
</P>
<P>
   A new safety feature is the traction control system available
with the automatic transmission. It operates when the Cavalier is
in drive, but is switched off when the shifter is changed to a
lower gear, a useful feature if the car becomes stuck in snow or
mud.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic transmission is about as smooth as they get in
cars in the Cavalier category _ competitors include the Ford
Escort, Honda Civic and Dodge/Plymouth Neon. Neither the base
2.4-liter four-cylinder engine (115 horsepower at 5,000 revolutions
per minute) nor the twin-cam version (150 hp at 5,600 rpm) is
overwhelmingly strong, but they manage, respectively, 135 and 155
pounds-feet of torque. Push it, and the stronger four-banger gets
the 2,600-pound Cavalier to 60 mph in a respectable eight seconds
or so.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin's fairly quiet most of the time _ brisk acceleration
brings in the usual engine and exhaust noise _ and visibility is
good. Brake and steering feel is good _ the sportier Cavaliers can
be real fun to drive _ and the instrumentation and controls are
like the seating _ competent, but not extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   The overall balance of standard features, utility, economy and
last-a-while styling is good, and that, quite simply, explains the
success of the steadily evolving Cavalier.

 &HT;    Chevrolet refines a meal ticket
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although not particularly noticeable on the road, the
Chevrolet Cavalier really stands out when General Motors and the
rest of the auto industry look at the bottom line: The Cavalier is
Chevy's best-selling sedan. Its 1999 sales through September were
up 7 percent from last year to 217,345 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In '98, the Cavalier had sales totaling 256,099, making it No. 6
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, GM doesn't want to do anything radical to its volume
leader, so the 2000 Cavalier gets some exterior tweaking _
body-color trim and repackaged taillamps _ and some mechanical and
interior refinements. The noticeable changes include making air
conditioning standard on all five models and _ finally _ switching
the heater/AC controls and radio so that the stereo is on top of
the center dash stack and therefore easier to reach and operate.
The General scores ergonomic points for this.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note, too, that the radios are significantly
improved, with power bumped to 50 watts. The upgraded ones have the

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I was sitting in church
among Alzheimer's sufferers and their spouses, wondering if
Alzheimer's patients worship. Certainly, their caregivers pray to
heaven for strength to carry on. And just as certainly, according
to the Rev. Doug Fountain, Alzheimer's families have spiritual
needs that too often are not met in traditional houses of worship.

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Dismissed as a yawner of foregone conclusions,
the Republican presidential primary grind has suddenly mutated into

party. George W. Bush is still the inevitable nominee, but he has
stirred the party's hard right to anxiety and likely to action.
(Teepen, Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.

<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ At a time when Jesse (the Id)
Ventura can become governor and talk about presidential
aspirations, when Donald Trump and Warren Beatty can surmise that
the nation needs them, when Oprah Winfrey has to demur and say she

president Trump wants her to be, what we have is a masquerade ball.
Are we getting what we deserve? (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Dr. David Martin was a

   FENG-SHUI _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In case you've missed the
feng shui bandwagon, it is, according to Webster's, ``a Chinese
geomantic practice in which a structure or site is chosen or
configured so as to harmonize with the spiritual forces that
inhabit it; also: auspicious orientation, placement or arrangement
as determined by feng shui.'' In other words, the way your house
sits on its lot, the direction the doors face, where you put your
furniture, where you hang your art, what kinds of symbolic
decorations and colors you use _ all of these things, and more _
can affect your moods, health, relationships and financial success.
Feng shui has been around for more than 3,000 years, but its
burgeoning popularity in the West, experts say, is a side effect of
our hectic, stressed lives. (Graulich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

A DIRECTIVE OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Sydney Pollack looks back on a directing career highlighted
by films as varied as the mountain man saga ``Jeremiah Johnson,''
the romance ``The Way We Were'' and the comedy ``Tootsie,'' what he
sees is love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to make a film that doesn't have a love
story of sorts in it,'' Pollack said in a phone interview from New
York, where his latest film, ``Random Hearts,'' was having its
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all relationship movies in one way or another, no
matter what the form. They can be Westerns like `Jeremiah Johnson'
or action pictures like `Three Days of the Condor,' but the nerve
at the center of each is always romance. Even a comedy like
`Tootsie' is still a love story.''
</P>
<P>
   Was this a conscious choice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all _ at least, not at first,'' Pollack said. ``It's
become a conscious thing, but not because I'm trying to imitate
myself. It's just that my affinity for love stories has been
written about often enough that I say to myself, `I guess it's
true.' Why is that? Why do I make so many love stories?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. But while I don't mind seeing a movie without a
love story because it only takes up a couple hours of my time, I'm
pickier when it comes to making movies. That's two years of my
life, and I know I'll get bored with the process if there isn't an
interesting relationship at the story's core.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship at the center of ``Random Hearts'' may be the
most complex Pollack has ever attempted to depict. Based on Warren
Adler's 1984 novel, it's about a police officer (Harrison Ford) and
a U.S. Representative (Kristin Scott Thomas) who lose their spouses
in the crash of a jetliner. The two are drawn together when they
realize his wife and her husband were having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult one to crack,'' Pollack said. ``The way
these people meet is not conducive to a love story. But that was
the thing that fascinated me. The trick was to figure out a way to
get this couple together.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, a love story stands or falls on the basis of
obstacles. From `Romeo and Juliet' to `Dr. Zhivago' to `Brief
Encounter,' it is the degree of impossibility of the lovers getting
together that creates tension. And I don't think I could have found
a premise as challenging as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Pollack said, Ford's and Scott Thomas' characters would
have little in common. But here they are bound together by grief at
the loss of a spouse and by rage generated by betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we always had to ask is which would take
preference _ grief or rage?'' Pollack said. ``When sex happens to
these people, it isn't really love. It happens in this unplanned,
desperate way that is inappropriate and humiliating for both of
them. It's more about rage, grief and the need for revenge than it
is about lust. All these feelings pile up until they spill over.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's known primarily as a director, Pollack has in
recent years found himself in front of the camera, first as Dustin
Hoffman's flustered agent in``Tootsie,'' then as a man with a huge
midlife crisis in Woody Allen's ``Husbands and Wives,'' and most
recently as a rich, amoral hedonist in Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes
Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started my career as a kind of fifth-rate actor,'' he said.
``I made my living by teaching acting, actually, from the time I
was 19. But I never did anything that was great shakes as an actor.
It's a good thing I became a director or I'd have starved.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Random Hearts'' he plays a very contemporary character, a
political media consultant who knows all about spin control,
innuendo and image building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I cast myself is that I work cheap,'' Pollack
confided. ``I'd spent all my money on Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really enjoyed this character. He's an absolute cynic,
very much a product of the '90s political system. He's the guy who
lives by the sound bite, the focus group, the
say-anything-to-get-elected mentality. But he's not really a bad
guy because he lets you know up front that this is how he
operates.''

 &HT;    New drug arrives in time for flu season
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Early indications suggest the flu season will
arrive sooner and hit harder this winter than in normal years. On
the bright side, though, doctors will be able to battle influenza
with a newly approved prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always speculation as to whether the numbers are going to
be high,'' says Greg Rozelle, director of the personal health
division for the Combined Health District of Montgomery County,
Ohio. ``But there's a little bit of a difference in the vaccine
ar. When the strains change, more people tend to get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials are predicting flu to strike four weeks
earlier than usual because of a strain that infected people on
Alaskan cruise ships the past two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle has seen no cases confirmed with laboratory tests so far
this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too soon for people to get their vaccines, Rozelle
says. They're becoming available at county health departments,
senior centers, clinics, doctor's offices and many drugstores and
supermarkets will offer them. Medicare covers flu shots for its
elderly and disabled beneficiaries, who are the people most in need
of receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People over 65, people with chronic medical risks and health
care workers dealing with people at risk should be vaccinated every
year,'' Rozelle says. ``It's especially important for diabetics and
people with chronic heart, kidney or respiratory problems.
Influenza can lead to serious complications including pneumonia,
and every year a few deaths are attributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flu is blamed for 20,000 deaths a year in the United States,
with as many as 50 million contracting the virus. Its most common
symptoms are sudden high fever, headache and upper respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got the flu, it knocks you off your feet,'' Rozelle
says. ``You're not going to be coming in to work sniffling to the
boss, `Man, I'm sick.' You're going to be home in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as stomach or intestinal flu, Rozelle
says, although other viruses cause diarrhea and abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to recognize flu symptoms early because the new
drug, Relenza, can diminish the effects of both A and B types of
influenza if treatment begins within the first two days of
symptoms. The drug is inhaled through the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The flu strains that this year's vaccination inoculates against
are A/Beijing, A/Sydney and B/Yamanashi, Rozelle says. Those are
the killed viruses used in the vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on a bit of scientific guesswork,'' Rozelle says.
``They take a look at what's happening in other parts of the world.
But they're usually pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   People with confirmed food allergies to eggs should not receive
flu shots because eggs are used in manufacturing the vaccine,
Rozelle says.

 &HT;    The dirt on denim
 &HT;    (EDS: With sidebars at end of story.)
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past few years, the jeans
business has been fueled by different shapes. Surely you've worn or
have studiously avoided one of the following: Legs so wide they
could easily slip over an elephant's foot; low-slung waists that
flirt with disaster; or highwater hems that bare the meatiest part
of your calves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, jeans are getting kicked in the back pocket by a slew of
new details that render them either more refined or more rugged.
</P>
<P>
   They're purposely ripped up or they're festooned with velvet
ribbons. Blue jeans are dyed so dark they almost look black, or
they're subtly outfitted with red seams reminiscent of the original
Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gap, which wants ``everybody in cords, vests and
leather'' this fall, is sitting pretty on the denim bandwagon. The
retailer has expanded its line of garden-variety jeans to include
denim with daintily beaded roses running up and down the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci is credited with goosing denim's recent upsurge in sales
(46.7 million pairs of women's jeans were sold in the first quarter
of this year, a 5.3 percent increase over the same period a year
ago). After Gucci designer Tom Ford feathered and decorated denim
for the glitterati, the embellished look made its way to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at denim as a fashion statement rather than
as a staple to have within your wardrobe,'' says Karen Koza,
director of public relations for the Fashion Association.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans traditionally sell well in Florida because the state
``created a laidback and casual lifestyle,'' says Melissa Goff of
Burdines. ``Jeans are indicative of that lifestyle and of us.''
</P>
<P>
   JC Western Supply in West Palm Beach has an inventory of roughly
20,000 pairs of jeans, and there's not a fringed hem among them.
Which doesn't bother Brigitte Halsey, whose family has run the
Congress Avenue store for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Embellished is ``going to be big, and it's going to be gone,''
she says. ``If they come in here asking for them now, they won't be
asking for them in January. . . . The style of Levi's, Lees and
Wranglers are what our customers will come back to buy tomorrow,
next month and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Nellis, who watches fashion trends for about.com,
agrees. ``I think embellished is a fad. . . . Darker dye is a
toss-up. It's a little safer. It's a classic, just a different
color.'' Nellis, who is based in Dallas, says, ``I'm not seeing
tons of embellished jeans on the street, but everybody's showing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what should you buy that will still look sharp a year from
now? ``I don't know if jeans really count as investment dressing or
not. You can get a nice pair for under $60,'' Nellis says. ``But a
mid-range color or black is probably safest.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the fashion industry hopes that you'll be ready to
spring for the next big thing in denim: Calvin Klein's CK Jeans in
``dirty denim,'' which has been blasted, whipped, dyed and
sandpapered almost beyond recognition. The collection will be
unveiled next spring with a you-can't-miss-it ad campaign starring
10 emerging musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Blue jeans have a thoroughly American heritage, right? Well,
sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, denim is cotton twill weave fabric of white and
blue threads. It was first woven on the looms of Nimes, France,
which explains the origin of its name: serge de Nimes (''twilled
fabric from Nimes'').
</P>
<P>
   The word ``jeans'' comes from ``Genes,'' French for the port
city of Genoa, Italy, where sailors wore sturdy work pants.
</P>
<P>
   During the gold mining boom of the 1850s, a young Bavarian
immigrant named Levi Strauss arrived in San Francisco trying to
make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   He gamely tried to sell a miner some canvas tents, but the old
codger said, ``You should have brought pants!''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss listened. He started sewing pants from brown canvas and
later switched to denim, which he dyed blue with indigo. Strauss
took out a patent for his durable jeans in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   Can you wear denim to your white-collar job?
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, if you keep it clean.
</P>
<P>
   Jeans ``that are free of holes, tears, stains, paint or other
signs of abuse are totally acceptable in a dressed-down
environment,'' say Chic Simple's Kim Johnson Gross and Jeff Stone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, if you accessorize wisely.
</P>
<P>
   No tennis shoes or sneakers, says Karen Koza of the Fashion
Association. Women can dress up jeans with a string of pearls or a
cashmere sweater set, say the Chic Simple folks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, if your jeans aren't too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to a classic, relaxed fit or choose denim with a little
stretch in it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yes, particularly if your denim is dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that I talk to get around it by wearing black jeans
because they're a little dressier,'' says Cynthia Nellis, a fashion
expert with about.com.
</P>
<P>
   The care and feeding of denim
</P>
<P>
   Denim is about as durable as fabrics come. That's why it's the
uniform of choice for cowboys and construction workers. But that
doesn't mean you can abuse denim indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Whirlpool suggest washing denim in warm water. (Try
hot water if you've rolled around in the mud.)
</P>
<P>
   To reduce wear and tear, shut off the dryer when your denim item
is just dry and remove it promptly to prevent any wrinkles from
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Denim as muse
</P>
<P>
   Whether ripped and faded, safety-pinned to within an inch of
their lives, or starched stiff, blue jeans have been the pant of
choice for many a musician. No wonder jeans pop up in so many
lyrics and a fair number of song titles:
</P>
<P>
   Venus in Blue Jeans, Jimmy Clanton
</P>
<P>
   Forever in Blue Jeans, Neil Diamond
</P>
<P>
   Baby Makes Her Blue Jeans Talk, Dr. Hook
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jean, David Bowie
</P>
<P>
   Tight-Fittin' Jeans, Conway Twitty
</P>
<P>
   Venom Wearin' Denim, Junior Brown
</P>
<P>
   Denim as museum
</P>
<P>
   You can visit Levi Strauss' oldest surviving factory, which
opened in November 1906 (earlier factories were felled by the San
Francisco earthquake of April 1906).
</P>
<P>
   At the adjoining Levi Strauss Museum, see exhibits about the man
and the company; see vintage garments; view classic Levi's
commercials; and take a walking tour of the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and factory are at 250 Valencia St. in San Francisco.
Phone is (415) 565-9159.
</P>
<P>
   How much denim do you own?
</P>
<P>
   _ According to the Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor, women
between the ages of 16 and 24 own an average of eight pairs of
jeans each. Women 56 to 70: About two.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wal-Mart sells three pairs of jeans every second of every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Denim is the biggest end-use category for cotton, accounting
for almost 25 percent of all cotton produced.
</P>
<P>
   A denim dictionary
</P>
<P>
   BEADED _ Intricate beadwork on the waistband, down the legs and
hanging off the hems is a favored embellishment of jeans makers
this fall. Some beading calls to mind Native American jewelry,
others create pretty floral patterns. ``It's all glam rock. Just
like in the '70s when we put all that stuff on the jeans,'' says
Cynthia Nellis, about.com fashion expert.
</P>
<P>
   BEATEN UP _ Call them ``vintage'' if you must, but ``destroyed''
is closer to the truth. If your mother saw you walking around in
these pre-distressed jeans, with their ripped pockets and holey
knees, she'd make you change before leaving the house.
</P>
<P>
   CUFFED _ Want to cuff correctly? Choose an extra-long pair of
dark jeans. Fold the hems just once _ we're talking four to six
inches _ to reveal the pants' pale underside.
</P>
<P>
   DRAWSTRING _ Buttons and zippers still secure flies, but
drawstrings cinch some waists. Some jeans also come equipped with
sewn-in ``belts'' of ribbons or beads that are for decoration only.
</P>
<P>
   EMBROIDERED _ Appliques, strips of brocade and velvet ribbons
add color to denim, particularly at the hem where several inches of
embroidery can stack up almost to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   JACKETS _ Denim jackets are receiving the same kind of fussing
over in fabrics and detailing that jeans are. ``They're back in a
big way,'' says Melissa Goff, Burdines fashion director. ``In a
casual setting, that's the only kind of jacket you need to get
through the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   RAW _ ``Raw'' doesn't refer to the stiff feel of this denim, but
rather its super-slick, unwashed state (which usually requires dry
cleaning). Also called ``rinse'' or ``dark dye.'' ``Everybody's got
a different name for it,'' says Nellis.

   RING SPUN _ Ring Spun denim is woven so the cotton fibers are
twisted in one uniform direction, which gives the yarn added
strength and makes for an extra-smooth texture.
</P>
<P>
   SELVAGE _ Jeans woven on old, narrow shuttle looms have a red
seam refered to as ``selvage'' that can be seen when cuffs are
turned up. It's a detail meant to hearken back to the original
Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   STRETCH _ The addition of a synthetic such as Lycra or polyester
gives denim's cotton a little more give.

   Cosmic cosmeticians promise color therapy for the spirit
</P>

   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Any old lipstick can colorize your
mouth. A really great lipstick can ``calm and revitalize your
evolving mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the folks at Tony &AMP; Tina's Vibrational
Remedies believe.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling makeup company sells Mood Balance Lipstick, Color
Frequency Eye Shadow, Cosmic Lights powder and New Age wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, they're serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some people out there who think we're just
doing this as a marketing concept. But if they would talk to us and
read beyond just one or two sentences, they'd realize that we're
sincere,'' says Tina Bornstein, co-founder and creative president
of Vibrational Remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Tony and Tina, who are married, were painters and writers before
launching their makeup company 2 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They had produced a conceptual art show of seven bottles of nail
polish that corresponded to the seven chakra colors, pointing out
that they believed those hues to be more therapeutic than anything
sold at the cosmetics counter. (''Chakra,'' Tina says, is Sanskrit
for ``wheels of light'' and refers to energy centers in the human
body.)
</P>
<P>
   The show flopped, but through the help of creative visualization
books, the couple imagined themselves a company that would allow
them to spread the word about color therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, they found an investor, and Tony &AMP; Tina's
Vibrational Remedies was born. In their airy New York loft office,
employees can participate in weekly yoga sessions and space is
reserved for shows by emerging artists.
</P>
<P>
   Products include Hair Wands (temporary hair mascara), Color
Effects (nail polish) and, of course, lipstick that contains
essential oils such as bergamot, used for its antidepressant
effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lipsticks are named after positive ways that women feel,''
Tina says. Loved, Connected, Seductive, Centered.
</P>
<P>
   The nail polishes are named for the effect they can have after
being reflected on throughout the day. Detox, a dull navy blue,
cleanses your mind, body and spirit. Focus, a glossy silver white,
opens your cosmic consciousness. And Understanding, a shiny hot
pink, promotes giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you coordinate lips and nails when you have to
consider color and effect? Don't overthink it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go with your intuition. Everyone has all the knowledge inside
themselves to guide them,'' says Tina, explaining that your
intuition is connected to your spleen chakra. ``It's not random.
You do have internal instincts that are guiding you.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this is scientifically and culturally based, she says.
``Since the dawn of time we've been affected by color. It's been a
great source of study, theory and mysticism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tina herself doesn't wear much makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to it from the consumer point of view. If I'm going to
wear it, it has to be therapeutic for me in some way.''

<P>
   OK, so it doesn't look much like a love nest. No candles, no
Persian rugs, not one Barry White CD: just a drab hospital room
equipped with a Barcalounger.
</P>
<P>
   But romance _ or at least its offspring, arousal _ is what it's
all about here at the Women's Sexual Health Clinic at the Boston
University School of Medicine. This room is a testing ground for
new generations of drugs to treat women who have lost their zest
for sex _ and therefore, suggest researchers at the center, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the drug being tested is the one already proven
wildly successful for men: Viagra. The preliminary results of this
ongoing study reveal that Viagra significantly improves sexual
response in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinic director Jennifer Berman and a handful of other
researchers across the country are trying to answer a question that
has puzzled humanity since Ovid first suggested onions were
aphrodisiacs: What causes passion? And _ more important to the
pharmaceutical companies investing billions in search of the answer
_ can it be bottled?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Pfizer's Viagra last year ushered in a
season of sexual reawakening for millions of men. If clinical
trials are successful, Viagra will eventually be made available for
women, although Pfizer has yet to announce marketing plans. In the
meantime, numerous new drugs for enhancing sexual function _ for
both men and women _ are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The competition must come up with drugs that do what Viagra does
_ increase blood flow to sex organs _ but do it better. Or they
must come up with a blockbuster pharmaceutical that does what
Viagra definitely doesn't do _ create a desire for sex, not just
the ability to have it if you already want it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of scientific progress is often the story of
serendipity, and that is certainly true with the new breed of
designer sex drugs in the works. Just as sildenafil, the active
ingredient in Viagra, began its life as a treatment for angina, so
several of the new sex drugs originally had another use entirely _
until some smart person figured out that those frequent erections
being reported by test subjects weren't just the result of youth
and good health.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new treatments being tested are, like Viagra,
vasodilators. All strive for essentially the same end result of
increasing blood flow in the genitals. And it is thought that these
vessel dilators work in clitoral tissue just as they do in penile
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A female version of Zonagen's Vasomax, which is trying to outdo
Viagra, is in the works. Testing of Vasofem, which may be
formulated as a vaginal suppository rather than a pill, began last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Apomorphine, another blood-vessel dilator, has been used for
years to treat tremor-causing Parkinson's disease. It turned out
that many male Parkinson's patients experienced an unexpected side
effect: improved erections. Tests on women began in July.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States 43 percent of women experience some form of
sexual dysfunction, according to a 1999 survey from the University
of Chicago, but they don't all have problems with their blood
vessels. Some have problems with their libidos. They'd rather be
doing something altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators like Viagra may restore physical function, but they
cannot give a woman a sex drive. That seems to be the job of
hormones. Specifically, the hormone we associate with the male sex
drive: testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Estratest, a pill from Solvay Pharmaceuticals that combines
estrogen and a testosterone derivative, has been on the market for
more than 30 years as an alternative to standard estrogen therapy.
But along with a decrease in hot flashes, many patients were
reporting an increase in energy and sexual enjoyment. The people at
Solvay knew a good thing when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling area of hormone research involves
work on PT-14, a peptide molecule derivative of a
melanocyte-stimulating hormone that's being investigated by Palatin
Technologies. In a study completed in May, PT-14 was given to 10
men with erectile dysfunction and helped nine of them. If
additional trials go well for men, testing on women should begin in
about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators require sexual desire to create an erection or
vaginal lubrication; testosterone seems to create sexual desire. A
guy on PT-14 can be thinking about his income tax returns and still
achieve a level of tumescence that a character in a gothic romance
novel would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we might soon have an arsenal of pharmaceuticals
available to treat sexual dysfunction begs a question: Do we need
to medicalize yet another fact of nature, that some people don't
have as strong a sex drive as others?
</P>
<P>
   Are we using medicine to shrink diversity in the range of human
behavior? And what will we lose if everyone's alike? If Henry James
had had a vigorous sex drive, would he have only written greeting
cards?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is ambivalence among researchers about using
medicine for social engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that can be done to enhance a woman's
possibility for reaching her full sexual potential, I'm all for
it,'' says sex therapist Laura Berman, who runs the Women's Sexual
Health Clinic at Boston University with her sister Jennifer. ``That
said, with drugs for sexual dysfunction, women can use them as
Band-Aids and not resolve real issues in their lives _ like abusive
relationships or body-image problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman also sees a risk: that men and women _ but especially
women _ may begin to have unrealistic expectations of their own
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Other health specialists fervently disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about medicalizing _ it's about improving our
understanding of sexuality, particularly how men's and women's
sexuality differ,'' says Marianne Legato, director of the
Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia University in New York.
``We're on a quest for real information about female sexuality. For
the most part, sexuality has only been studied in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gruwell, a 43-year-old mother from Springfield, Ill., who
found that Estratest restored her libido after the removal of her
uterus and ovaries, says, ``A man gets Viagra and the news is all
over the world. But women have to fight tooth and nail for this
stuff. It aggravates me.''

 By JOSEPH D'AGNESE  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A handgun is remarkably simple to operate. You pick it up, point
it and squeeze the trigger. The gun does the rest of the job. The
hammer cocks and then crashes down on the firing pin, sparking a
tiny gunpowder explosion that expels the bullet from its cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, the process is child's play.
That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently handle guns, with deadly results. According
to the National Safety Council, 220 kids under the age of 14 died
in 1997 as a result of playing with guns.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the game of point and shoot has become an outlet
for personal rage. Ever since the shooting massacre at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., last spring left 14 students and one
teacher dead, many national and state legislators have confronted
gunmakers with a challenge: In a safety-conscious culture rife with
air bags and childproof medicine bottles, why can't someone design
a gun that kids can't operate?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is pressuring manufacturers to create safer guns,
childproof guns _ smart guns that fire only when an authorized user
pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A criminal grabs a cop's gun. A child finds Daddy's
weapon in the bedroom. Neither can shoot because they don't have
the specially designed ring, bracelet or pin that electronically or
magnetically unlocks the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon, seemingly lifted from the works of Ian Fleming,
won't fire unless the microchip sensor recognizes the user's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such guns are not a futuristic fantasy. Make no mistake: The
technology is very much here and now and no more complicated than
popping open the garage door with a remote device.
</P>
<P>
   All engineers have to do is shrink the necessary circuitry to
fit into a gun _ and keep it working flawlessly. That's the tough
job.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider dropping your cell phone or
electronic notebook out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a laptop inside of your firearm,'' says
Jonathan Mossberg, vice president of 0.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the
world's largest maker of pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know firearms, there's an amazing amount of stresses
that go on when you pull a trigger,'' explains Mossberg, who is
developing a smart shotgun. ``It's like hitting something with a
sledgehammer every time you fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the percussion, there's also smoke, heat and accumulated
residue of gun oil and gunpowder. Altogether, a gun is a most
inhospitable home for a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers are working around the problem. They're tucking
critical processors into insulated gun grips, away from the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a semiautomatic pistol, that space normally
houses a magazine clip full of bullets. So the chips must be
miniaturized to fit under a gun grip's thin decorative plate _ and
still be cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   As for power, one maker experimented with NiCad rechargeable
batteries but switched to 10-year lithiums, figuring customers
would balk charging their guns like electric shavers. No wonder one
engineer grumbles, ``Building a smart gun is a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer smart guns are probably still about two to four years
away _ plenty of time to work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few. Though several companies are rumored to be
working on the project, only a handful have gone public with their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Company of Connecticut, best known for the
Colt .45, has toiled for three years on a smart gun intended for
law enforcement, but not home use.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the foibles of making smart guns were on full display
when the company demonstrated its radio wristlet device. The weapon
jammed as a reporter looked on but subsequently fired a hundred
rounds flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not perfect yet,'' a company spokesman admits. ``When the
processors get hot, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks who may be the first to rely on silicon to defend
their lives _ cops and other law enforcement workers _ are watching
all of these developments closely. But there is still plenty of
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has really worked this out,'' says Magna-Trigger's Rick
Devoid, also a New Hampshire police officer and firearms
instructor. ``Nobody wants to rely on a battery. If a battery
fails, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Americans are accustomed to glitches in their everyday
electronics. When it comes to guns, however, inconsistent behavior
won't do; performance must be foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer shaping a gun of the future offers this disparity:
``If your computer doesn't let you log on, you're inconvenienced.
If your smart gun doesn't shoot when you need it, you're dead. If
it fires when it shouldn't, your child could be too.''

   A handgun is remarkably simple to operate. You pick it up, point
it and squeeze the trigger. The gun does the rest of the job. The
hammer cocks and then crashes down on the firing pin, sparking a
tiny gunpowder explosion that expels the bullet from its cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, the process is child's play.
That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently handle guns, with deadly results. According
to the National Safety Council, 220 kids under the age of 14 died
in 1997 as a result of playing with guns.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the game of point and shoot has become an outlet
for personal rage. Ever since the shooting massacre at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., last spring left 14 students and one
teacher dead, many national and state legislators have confronted
gunmakers with a challenge: In a safety-conscious culture rife with
air bags and childproof medicine bottles, why can't someone design
a gun that kids can't operate?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is pressuring manufacturers to create safer guns,
childproof guns _ smart guns that fire only when an authorized user
pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A criminal grabs a cop's gun. A child finds Daddy's
weapon in the bedroom. Neither can shoot because they don't have
the specially designed ring, bracelet or pin that electronically or
magnetically unlocks the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon, seemingly lifted from the works of Ian Fleming,
won't fire unless the microchip sensor recognizes the user's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such guns are not a futuristic fantasy. Make no mistake: The
technology is very much here and now and no more complicated than
popping open the garage door with a remote device.
</P>
<P>
   All engineers have to do is shrink the necessary circuitry to
fit into a gun _ and keep it working flawlessly. That's the tough
job.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider dropping your cell phone or
electronic notebook out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a laptop inside of your firearm,'' says
Jonathan Mossberg, vice president of 0.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the
world's largest maker of pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know firearms, there's an amazing amount of stresses
that go on when you pull a trigger,'' explains Mossberg, who is
developing a smart shotgun. ``It's like hitting something with a
sledgehammer every time you fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the percussion, there's also smoke, heat and accumulated
residue of gun oil and gunpowder. Altogether, a gun is a most
inhospitable home for a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers are working around the problem. They're tucking
critical processors into insulated gun grips, away from the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a semiautomatic pistol, that space normally
houses a magazine clip full of bullets. So the chips must be
miniaturized to fit under a gun grip's thin decorative plate _ and
still be cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   As for power, one maker experimented with NiCad rechargeable
batteries but switched to 10-year lithiums, figuring customers
would balk charging their guns like electric shavers. No wonder one
engineer grumbles, ``Building a smart gun is a bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer smart guns are probably still about two to four years
away _ plenty of time to work out the kinks.
</P>
<P>
   And there are a few. Though several companies are rumored to be
working on the project, only a handful have gone public with their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Colt's Manufacturing Company of Connecticut, best known for the
Colt .45, has toiled for three years on a smart gun intended for
law enforcement, but not home use.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the foibles of making smart guns were on full display
when the company demonstrated its radio wristlet device. The weapon
jammed as a reporter looked on but subsequently fired a hundred
rounds flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not perfect yet,'' a company spokesman admits. ``When the
processors get hot, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The folks who may be the first to rely on silicon to defend
their lives _ cops and other law enforcement workers _ are watching
all of these developments closely. But there is still plenty of
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has really worked this out,'' says Magna-Trigger's Rick
Devoid, also a New Hampshire police officer and firearms
instructor. ``Nobody wants to rely on a battery. If a battery
fails, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Americans are accustomed to glitches in their everyday
electronics. When it comes to guns, however, inconsistent behavior
won't do; performance must be foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer shaping a gun of the future offers this disparity:
``If your computer doesn't let you log on, you're inconvenienced.
If your smart gun doesn't shoot when you need it, you're dead. If
it fires when it shouldn't, your child could be too.''

STYLISTS MAKE FOOD IN PICTURES LOOK GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delores Custer is feeling a bit jittery.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the coffee. In the magic world of food styling, the
coffee turns out to be as caffeine-free as a cup of water with a
few drops of Kitchen Bouquet, a food coloring agent.
</P>
<P>
   Custer, a New York-based food stylist, is nervous about an
interview she gave to the New York Times Magazine. A 20-year food
styling veteran who teaches at the Culinary Institute of America,
she rarely gives interviews anymore because food journalists tend
to fixate on the so-called tricks of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always want to know the tricks,'' she says, ``and I think
everyone has this idea that we work with fake food and we don't
cook the real food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically Custer confides her frustrations to members of the
Association of Food Journalists attending a food-styling seminar at
the Disney Institute in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always trying to keep food alive until the photographer
is ready to shoot,'' she says. ``The `tricks' that we do are only
because of time. We all love a natural look, particularly in
editorial.''
</P>
<P>
   So why use colored water as a stand-in for a cup of joe?
</P>
<P>
   The mud-puddle brown hues of real coffee appear black on film.
Not very appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the most sought-after food stylists in the country,
Custer has clients that include Kraft Foods, Pillsbury, Nestle,
Nabisco, Kellogg's and McDonald's. Some of her recent work can be
seen in Betty Crocker's newest cookbook, the ``I Can't Believe It's
Butter'' ads featuring Fabio and nearly every cereal box in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as a bleary-eyed, bed-headed America faces Custer's work
over its morning cereal bowl, few have even the faintest inkling of
just what it takes to make food look this good.
</P>
<P>
   Style before substance
</P>
<P>
   Like a makeup stylist who can turn a gawky, waiflike model into
a ravishing runway beauty, food styling is all about accentuating
the model's positive attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Good makeup, a hairstylist, a fan for that windblown look and
flattering light only enhance appealing features.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise a smudge of lipstick can give an unripe pear a
rosy-ripe glow. A spritz of glycerine on a waxed glass can make
iced tea appear icy cool with condensation. A dab of vegetable oil
gives asparagus an emerald-green sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a tackle box of tools including squirt bottles,
tweezers, toothpicks, skewers, eyedroppers, turkey basters,
surgical gauze and cotton swabs, the food stylist primps and prods
the food to an image of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means intentionally undercooking the Thanksgiving
bird so the skin doesn't wrinkle up, then brushing it with Kitchen
Bouquet or Angostura bitters to simulate the browning effect. If it
begins to dry out as it sits on the set, Pam cooking spray can
restore a moist, succulent look.
</P>
<P>
   Such techniques used to be learned on the job or working with
other stylists who already had broken into the business, but these
days, professional development seminars and workshops help food
stylists create a network.
</P>
<P>
   At Food on Film IX, a biannual conference sponsored by the Twin
Cities Home Economists in Business and the International
Association of Culinary Professionals held in Minneapolis, food
stylists, prop stylists, photographers, art directors and the odd
food editor can get a handle on the basic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Topics include the art of plate composition, how to scout for
props, how to shop for the best produce, tips for working with
chocolate and how to prep for a big job.
</P>
<P>
   Food stylists typically work as part of a team that includes a
prop stylist, a photographer and an art director who conceptualizes
``the look'' they are after based on where the photograph will be
used for advertising or editorial display, print or TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me, `Why doesn't my food look that good?' ''
says Marie Piraino, a Boston-based food stylist with credits in
Cooking Light and Eating Well magazines. ``If you had a person
obsessing over every detail of it for four hours, it would look
that good!''
</P>
<P>
   Filling in the missing senses
</P>
<P>
   It's true that we eat with our eyes, but without a sense of
touch, taste or smell, food photography must help the viewer
imagine what their senses are missing.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate what food stylists can do to create the illusion
of touch, taste and smell, Custer often uses two side-by-side
photos of the same shot to emphasize her point.
</P>
<P>
   The first shot shows fried eggs, English muffins, a bowl of
cereal, a glass of orange juice made from concentrate and coffee
the way a home cook would prepare it.
</P>
<P>
   The second shot includes the exact same items prepared the way a
food stylist might prepare it for a photo shoot:
</P>
<P>
   - Organic eggs, for example, take the place of regular because
they typically contain yokes with a deeper shade of yellow. The
eggs are cooked in oil to keep edges smooth and whites whiter. A
total of six dozen eggs are cracked before the stylist is satisfied
with the spread of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   - A home cook may just lay an orange slice on a plate for
garnish; the food stylist twists it to give it height, which
reflects more light and drips glycerine on it to give the slice a
fresh, dewy look.
</P>
<P>
   - The cereal flakes are handpicked with tweezers. A shallow
amount of milk is used so the flakes can ``stand'' on top, and
drops of ``milk'' made from a denser mixture of confectioners'
sugar and water allow for more control. MORE
</P>
<P>
   (denser mixture of confectioners' sugar and water allow for more
control.)
</P>
<P>
   Fashion plates
</P>
<P>
   As with hemlines in fashion, food styles come and go.
</P>
<P>
   Look at a Betty Crocker cookbook from the '50s, and the layers
of the cakes are perfect, the swirls of frosting a work of art,
each flourish like a series of commas hammered on a typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Then pick up a copy of Martha Stewart Living. The layers are
slightly crooked. Even something as seemingly pedestrian as
Tupperware is permissible as a prop because it represents a casual
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to manipulate the food as little as possible so it
looks as alive as possible,'' says Susan Spungen, food editor for
Martha Stewart Living magazine and a keynote speaker at Food on
Film IX.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there has to be an integrity to the food so I try to
cook as if we will eat it. If it really is good enough to eat, I
think it will look that way in the photo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission regulates the way products can be
advertised. Serving portions must be reasonable, and the food can't
be doctored. Perhaps one of the most infamous cases dates from 1969
when Campbell's soup used marbles to help the vegetables in its
Hearty Man Vegetable stew float to the top for a TV commercial.
Such deceptions are not allowed when advertising a product to
consumers, and some food companies keep lawyers on the set to avoid
potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the desire to make something bigger, better.
You really have to think about it,'' Custer says. ``You should try
to be as true to the consumer as possible. It's not fair when the
food does not look like what we produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Wary of such ethical dilemmas, an advertising shot for a carton
of ice cream would never use fake ice cream. But a shot of an
ice-cream sundae used as a background item in a banquet might be
permissible.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to enhance and to stretch, but not cheat. And
sometimes it takes nothing more than framing the food so we can see
it the way the camera does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camera sees food in a different way than we do. It has one
eye. We have two,'' Custer says. ``When a camera looks at that,''
she says, pointing to a salad of lettuce and tomato sitting on a
work table in the classroom//kitchen, ``that's all it sees. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If we went like that,'' she says, forming a picture frame with
her thumbs and index fingers, ``they'd say, `Wow! Isn't that
beautiful?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of faking it
</P>
<P>
   By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   It's a food stylist's nightmare: a ``hero'' that weeps, then
dissolves into a puddle in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the stunt doubles, look-alikes that can cool their pointy
heels on the set for hours without so much as a drip.
</P>
<P>
   Made from a mixture of corn syrup, shortening, confectioners'
sugar and a few drops of food coloring, fake ice cream is
technically edible, if not exactly delectable.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but how does it look?
</P>
<P>
   After scooping up a dozen perfectly textured mounds, I can vouch
for its authenticity. It is a dead ringer for the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer Tammy Ljungblad and I recently went into the
kitchen to try our hand at making fake ice cream. We got the recipe
at a food-styling conference.
</P>
<P>
   Our first batch of vanilla ice cream came together in a snap. A
few skirts of Hershey's syrup and we moved on to chocolate. Then we
tried strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   At first the food processor gummed up with a sticky pink ooze.
To turn the soupy muck into a more workable dough required a
mushroom cloud of confectioners' sugar. Instead of the 1-pound box
called for in the recipe, it took 5 to arrive at the right
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a frustrating hour of scooping and sculpting, a
dozen Play-dohlike blobs lined the kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   From the lineup we picked our ``hero,'' the most photogenic
scoop. A real beaut, our specimen exhibited a nice ``bark''
(textured ridges) and ``ruffles'' (the flounce around the edge
where the scoop mounds onto the cone).
</P>
<P>
   After sorting the pristine cones from the duds, I pressed the
best scoops lightly atop and tiptoed to ``location,'' a
weather-beaten swing on the photographer's porch. Only two stunt
doubles landed creamside-down on the concrete patio.
</P>
<P>
   Using fake ice cream, we had plenty of time to adjust the
lights. But after a few meter readings, the fuse box blew. Even
after repeated trips to the basement, the cones kept their cool.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a couple of Polaroids, we tweaked our composition
and put the image on real film.
</P>
<P>
   Elapsed time: Nearly 5 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect pizza pulls
</P>
<P>
   By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly Judy Peck Prindle's recipe for the perfect pizza
includes a few odd ingredients _ an emery board, a few thumbtacks.
</P>
<P>
   Prindle, a Los Angeles-based food stylist with more than 30
years of experience, specializes in ``cheese pulls.'' That's when a
slice of pizza, taken just so from the whole pie, reveals a drippy
web of luscious melted cheese.
</P>
<P>
   To stylists, pizza and ice cream are the two most temperamental
food groups.
</P>
<P>
   On a location shoot for a national pizza company, Prindle once
spent 10 days prepping hundreds of pizzas. Working from a portable
kitchen hauled in on a semi-truck, she hired four or five
assistants for what turned out to be a 30-second TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Prindle demonstrated her skills at Food on Film IX, a recent
conference in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing two pairs of cotton utility gloves (less clumsy than
mitts), she pulls barely cooked pizza crusts from the oven. When
the crusts are cool enough to touch, she begins ``grooming'' them,
using an emery board to sand off rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   On an imperfect pizza crust she spreads a mound of grated cheese
and toasts it to a light brown. After allowing it to cool, she uses
tweezers to remove each crisscrossed ``eyelash.'' Later she'll
reapply them to the rim of the crust to give it more character.
</P>
<P>
   The pepperoni is cooked separately in a 325-degree oven 21/2
minutes, then she blots each slice with paper towels and sprays
them with an antioxidant to prevent curling.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to construct the pizza, Prindle uses a soft
paintbrush to spread a token amount of sauce on the crust. Then
come the cheese and other toppings, before the pizza is lightly
baked, about 15 minutes in a 400-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   Prindle had hidden a few thumbtacks under pepperoni circles to
keep the pizza from sliding off its board and a triangular spatula
under a precut piece to ease removing it. She had ``laced'' some
extra slices of cheese to hide the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   For melting the cheeses laces, she uses a clothes steamer. When
the laces look good and gooey, she lets the pizza rest a bit before
pulling the piece up and out, freezing the motion at the moment the
cheese is stretched to quivering.

TIME TO RECLAIM CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How does that political slogan on top of San
Francisco taxicabs go? ``World-class city, world-class mayor, any
questions?''
</P>
<P>
   I have a question. Why does such a beautiful city have such
ugly, vicious, no-class politics? Why would San Franciscans have
any of the so-called major candidates as a mayor? Most people
wouldn't let them walk their dog.
</P>
<P>
   One guy would sell your dog to the highest bidder. Another guy
would kick your dog, later tell you he's reformed and then refer
you to his book on how to walk dogs. The other guy lost your dog
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jordan, Clint Reilly and even Mayor Willie Brown, a
politician so famous he's been on the cover of almost every
magazine in the land, are losers.
</P>
<P>
   These candidates have one character flaw in common. That
character is named Jack Davis. Davis is easily recognizable by his
knowing smile, prematurely platinum hair, the sycophantic political
writers who surround him and the politicians who never turn their
back on him.
</P>
<P>
   At his birthday party a few years ago, our leading political
figures watched sadomasochistic sex acts and Jack Daniels bottles
put to innovative uses.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the unelected thug-in-chief of San Francisco, famous
for fisticuffs, foul mouth and extracting favors from government, a
man who crushes mayors just for fun.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the consultant who got Jordan elected mayor in 1991 as
revenge against his enemy, former Mayor Art Agnos. Davis ran City
Hall for a while, then turned on Jordan to help get Brown elected.
Later he ran Brown's winning campaign for a new football
stadium-mall project, which Reilly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis is doing a bang-up job for Brown, portraying Reilly as
a man with a history of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   If the Borgias moved to the hills of West Virginia, they
couldn't come up with nastier and more ingrown feuds.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gives credit where credit is due, complimenting Reilly,
his former mentor as a political consultant. ``He gave me my
start,'' Davis told me not long ago. ``He made this profession what
it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   And they both helped make San Francisco politics the cesspool it
is today.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants became more important than politicians in the early
1980s. The consultants filled a political vacuum, as kingmakers,
king-breakers, high-paid lobbyists for big business and sources for
journalists. And they answered to no one.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reilly has become accountable, much to his personal
discomfort, by running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The press bears some responsibility for Davis. The first thing
we can do is stop calling him a ``bad boy political consultant.''
It makes Davis sound cute.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, it's interesting to talk to Davis. It's also
interesting to talk to hit men and street bullies. But from now on,
I'll just call him Jack Davis.
</P>
<P>
   We know who's likely to win the Nov. 2 election. Jack Davis,
hands down and dirty. Oh yeah, and Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The other night I was watching television and there was the now-
familiar face of Reilly telling us that in the past he'd had his
problems, but he'd quit drinking in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   No, he wasn't advertising one of those 30-day rehab centers.
This was his way of responding to the Brown campaign's charges that
in 1980 he'd beaten up a female campaign worker, charges packaged
by Davis like a cluster bomb in advertising and even a Web site.
And the mailers haven't even started arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly is a political consultant who now has a fool for a
client. He would have warned any other client to be prepared for
everything in his past to be exposed, but didn't seem ready.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan, he got elected in 1991 and made his only splash,
a literal one, at the end of his term. Why would he want to come
back?
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is one that should have been settled four
years ago. Why hasn't Brown dumped Davis? Brown dominated state
politics from Sacramento. Brown is the boss of a political machine
in a one-party town. He's one politician who shouldn't be afraid of
turning his back on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brown likes having Davis around for entertainment value.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brown likes to set Davis loose on his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Brown thinks Davis does a good job.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown administration has been one disappointment after
another, and the survival of Davis is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   We've been talking about the unelected rule of Davis for a dozen
years and three mayors. It's time the people took back the city.

WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO GEORGE PATAKI? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Since the last election, New York Gov. George
Pataki has turned into the Man Who Never Comes to Dinner. Not long
ago, he got a big raise. Now, apparently, he won't come to work
unless he also gets a signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to assume that George Pataki is not in Albany.
Anything beyond that is guesswork. His staff virtually never puts
out a schedule for him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The problem seems to be, in the context of New York politics,
that Pataki sees himself in a dead-end job with no room for
advancement. With a presidential election looming, he seems
fanatically devoted to impressing Texas Gov. George W. Bush in
hopes of nailing down the second spot on the Republican ticket. Or,
as a consolation prize, a Washington Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Pataki appears obsessed with the prospect of never
again setting foot in Albany. That's hardly an irrational desire
for a man whose job description requires him to deal with the
sharpies, dolts, dupes and wide-eyed innocents of the New York
Legislature. Still, the governor's obvious passion to escape the
job New Yorkers elected him to can have its drawbacks for other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that political action committee Pataki set up in
Virginia, for example. Much of the $400,000 the committee raised to
promote Pataki's national political ambitions came from
contributors who kicked in more than they could have under New York
state law. And about half that total has come from contributors
with financial interests directly affected by the state government
the governor runs.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Bell Atlantic, the telephone company. Under
New York law, corporations can give statewide officeholders no more
than $5,000 a year. Individuals can give them no more than $30,500.
Bell Atlantic kicked in $50,000 to the Virginia committee.
</P>
<P>
   That violates no New York or Virginia law, but the money was
donated at a time when Bell Atlantic was seeking permission from
the New York Public Service Commission to offer long-distance
service within this state.
</P>
<P>
   Take Bay Networks. That's a company with a five-year,
$27-million contract to provide New York state with phone
equipment. The contract expires next June. Bay Networks kicked in
$35,000 to the Virginia committee.
</P>
<P>
   And, as just one more example, take Peter Lewis. He's chairman
of an Ohio-based company called Progressive Insurance. He gave the
governor's Virginia committee $25,000 in April. A month before, his
company had applied for a $125,000 state grant to create a new
regional office in downtown Albany. By sheerest coincidence,
apparently, the company got the grant a month after the
contribution was made to the Virginia committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chichester is a former Pataki aide who now runs a private
business that produces an intriguing Web site. It's called
empirepage.com. Chichester says that political loyalty plays a huge
role in deciding which companies benefit from state largess in this
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver introduced
into the lower house a bill that would force statewide
officeholders to disclose contributors to out-of-state political
committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every New Yorker,'' the speaker said, ``has the right to know
who is making financial contributions to their elected officials _
wherever the accounts are kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the bill passed the Assembly, which is controlled
by Democrats. Predictably, the State Senate, controlled by the
governor's party, failed to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, ambition is not at all a negative trait in a
politician. But ambition without a proper sense of propriety is
different. You have to worry about a politician who'll tell you
that honesty is the best policy.
</P>
<P>
   And then behave as though dishonesty runs a close second.
</P>

COURTESY GOES A LONG WAY WITH THE HEARING IMPAIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA A. GOLDSTEIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The moment of realization, when it comes, is
often surprising. ``Oh! She's deaf!'' one woman gasped recently.
Unfortunately, the knowledge all too often never dawns, leaving the
impression that I'm either rude, strange, or both.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not antisocial. I just can't hear.
</P>
<P>
   So why does something so simple have to be so complex? Even
though as many as 10.1 million Americans have hearing problems, the
widely held assumption is that everyone you encounter can hear.
</P>
<P>
   And that can lead to problems _ like nearly getting run over by
one of those airport electric carts with the annoying beep (or so
I'm told). When at the Pittsburgh airport several months ago, I was
waiting for my husband outside the men's lavatory and became
engrossed in a magazine. When I looked up, I was surprised to see
an electric cart a few feet from me. The driver and an employee
behind him both looked quite angry. Apparently, I had been blocking
their path for quite some time as they repeatedly told me to get
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   I motioned to my ear and said, ``I'm deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my husband appeared and informed the employee behind
the cart as well. Her response?
</P>
<P>
   A pity-laced, ``Oh, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband replied tersely, ``She doesn't need your pity.''
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that carts used to transport physically disabled
people mow down other disabled people in the process. Perhaps it's
an effort to drum up more business, since one of these days I may
need a cart after I'm run over by a disgruntled airport employee.
</P>
<P>
   My husband was right, however: I don't need pity, just
understanding. Having been deaf all my life, one would think I'd be
used to things like this by now. But it doesn't get any easier.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping, I often run into people who assume everyone can
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paper or plastic?'' I'll be asked, along with, ``May I help
you?'' or even, ``Would you like your receipt in the bag?''
</P>
<P>
   These questions inevitably result in the interrogator looking at
me like I've descended from outer space. I don't think having
broken ears would warrant a role on the ``X-Files,'' however.
</P>
<P>
   At a department store not too long ago, a couple of salespeople
followed me, asking if I needed help. When I turned around, I
caught them talking about my rudeness. One person, in my line of
vision, queried me. When I replied, he signed, ``How are you?'' to
let me know he knew I was deaf. Aha! A solitary spark of
intelligence at last. Too bad I don't need to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that I can speak and read lips may make it easier for
me to ``pass'' as a hearing person. My deaf accent isn't always
recognized. In fact, I'm usually asked what country I'm from. When
I say, ``Buffalo, New York,'' faces usually register puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on my mood, I'll venture an explanation: ``My accent
is because I'm deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times, I'm content to let the mystery stand. One person
insisted repeatedly that I was from England. Buffalo is exotic, but
the local accent is nowhere near as thick as a stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, when someone's deafness is noticeable, people
still act like idiots. My sister, who is also deaf, used to sport a
short haircut similar to Demi Moore's in the movie ``Ghost.'' Her
hearing aids were visible. When the two of us were together, people
would treat her like she had a learning disability, while they
treated me as a hearing person.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip: Speaking louder just makes you look foolish. When
you are as deaf as I am, yelling won't help; I already have hearing
aids.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mumble. Moving your lips as much as possible doesn't
help, either. It just exaggerates your lip movements, which makes
it harder to lip read. And don't get me started on badly trimmed
beards!
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, there are a number of assumptions that I'd like
eradicated. These stereotypes cascade from one another, despite
being mutually exclusive. It seems to me it goes through someone's
head like this: Everyone is hearing, unless they're proven to be
deaf, at which point they must know sign language. And if they
don't, yelling will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   So please, the next time someone doesn't respond to something
you say, they may not be ignoring you. They may be deaf and
ignoring you.
</P>

BOOKS MAKE HOME DECORATING EASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be frustrated at the thought of starting a decorating
project.
</P>
<P>
   If you can read and follow basic instructions, a myriad of
self-help books can guide you through the process of creating or
transforming a room to fit your personal style and needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Room Redux: The Home Decorating Workbook,'' by designers Joann
Eckstut and Sheran James (1999 Chronicle Books, $29.95), is an
interactive guide to home decorating for real people.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the theme for ``Traditional Home Signature Style:
Creating Beautiful Interiors'' (1999 Meredith Books, $39.95), where
learning the decorating rules allows you to break them, especially
to find your personal decorating style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our book helps to answer questions, as if we were standing in
the corner of the room,'' said James, a partner with Eckstut in
their hands-on Manhattan-based design service, Room Redux.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know what they want, but not quite how to get
there,'' James said. ``The book basically answers questions that a
designer asks their client and themselves before beginning a job
and how to go about finding the solutions from there.''
</P>
<P>
   James named the five basic principles to designing a room:
harmony, rhythm, emphasis, scale and balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you learn the principles, you can apply them to any
room,'' James said. ``We also designed the book so that you can dip
in and out of it for any reason,'' from selecting fabrics to
placement of furniture, window treatments, color, flooring,
lighting or architectural needs.
</P>
<P>
   The format is a workbook with colorful illustrations by Andras
Halasz. Graph paper and furniture templates re-create your floor
plans, and pockets keep fabric, carpet and wallpaper samples, paint
chips and product information. An extensive and comprehensive
resource index lists places you can call and go that are open even
to people who aren't professional designers. An attached elastic
bookmark also can be used to hold the covers together so you don't
lose any samples.
</P>
<P>
   The book focuses on what it takes to create finished, decorated
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is designed to give you the outline of the basic
principles that every designer knows, except that you are in charge
of taking those principles and applying them to your taste,''
Eckstut said. ``There are no deep, dark secrets when it comes to
decorating a room for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time and build a room, furnishing it a little at a
time. All you need is a game plan and know what you are looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that each chapter looks at the difficulty and cost
of the projects. ``The nuts and bolts section provides the
practicalities, which are the standards, measurements and kind of
facts you need to make it all happen.''
</P>
<P>
   James stressed that the book allows you to decorate at your own
pace and make it fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you preplan each project or room, there won't be so many
surprises and anxiety along the way,'' James said. ``Don't worry
about making mistakes if you do. The biggest mistake is to not
attempt something.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The editors of Traditional Home magazine filled ``Traditional
Home Signature Style: Creating Beautiful Interiors'' with rich
photographs and chapters on each of eight interior designers.
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter includes an in-depth profile of the designer,
including design philosophies and preferences. Divider sections
between chapters, featuring photographs of each designer's
projects, cover key decorating elements _ scale and proportion,
color, fabrics, furniture, antiques, lighting and collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find things you love and build around them,'' writes Karol
DeWulf Nickell, editor-in-chief of Traditional Homes. ``Designers
will be the first to tell you that they'd rather not start from
scratch. Their best work is a combination of what you love and what
they know. While fine art, furnishings and rugs provide excellent
jumping off points for an interior, less stately objects such as
collected china or glassware, or a new fabric or wallpaper can also
inspire.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, you need to be honest about what you want,
writes Nickell, and how much time and money you are willing to
commit.

NOBEL WINNER WAS TOUTED NINE YEARS AGO AS A TOP CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ahmed Zewail, named Tuesday as the winner of the
Nobel Prize for chemistry, was designated nine years ago by a
scientific journal in Philadelphia as a likely winner someday.
</P>
<P>
   The California Institute of Technology scientist won the prize
fnstrating that a rapid laser technique can observe the
motion of atoms in a molecule as they occur during a chemical
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Scientist, a highly respected news tabloid that covers
politics and intellectual trends in science, listed Zewail among
``Scientists With the Right Chemistry To Win A Nobel Prize'' in its
Sept. 17, 1990, issue.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the journal stressed Zewail's eligibility
for the prize although his career violated the basis for most of
the publication's candidates for the prize. The journal forecast
future recipients of the chemistry prize based on a computer survey
of the number of times that their research papers had been cited by
other scientists in the footnotes of articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Important as (Zewail's) research is, he has not yet garnered a
large enough number of citations to be selected here. It is
conceivable, however, that the Nobel Committee may choose to honor
such a researcher,'' wrote the article's author, Angela Martello.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Martello added, ``High citations records and
stellar research careers generally go hand- in-hand,'' evidence
that a scientist's work is noticed by his or her peers.
</P>
<P>
   The journal is published by a Philadelphia firm that uses
computers to track the world's scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Caltech named Zewail to its first Linus Pauling
professorship in chemical physics, named after the famed chemist _
himself a two-time Nobelist, in chemistry and peace _ who later
became a controversial advocate of the medical merits of vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, Zewail spent two years as an IBM Fellow at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in an unusual honor for the esoteric field of
chemical physics _ Zewail's specialty _ Egypt, his native land,
issued two postage stamps in his honor that bear his face. The
stamps come in different currency values.

REELING IN THE REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every time you drop your fishing line, in the
back of your mind is the thought that maybe, just maybe, you might
catch the fish of a lifetime. That is exactly what happened this
past week to Mike Chadwick of Bolinas. But he not only thought it,
he did it.
</P>
<P>
   That hookup came just a few seconds after dropping his line in,
and after a 3 1/2-hour fight, he landed the fish of the year, a
5-foot, 140-pound bluefin tuna, an exotic rarity for the coastal
waters of the San Francisco Bay area. He was aboard the Outer
Limits out of Sausalito, which ventured about 40 miles out to sea
near that 601 Fathom Spot looking for albacore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right off, it took off on a 250, 300-yard run,'' Chadwick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hung on. We didn't even see the fish for 2 1/2 hours.
We finally saw the thing, and everybody was saying, ``It looks like
a submarine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, 39, is a union stagehand at the Orpheum Theater in San
Francisco. Three weeks ago, he caught an 82-pound opah, another
rare and exceptional catch for Bay Area waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to go out on albacore trips twice a week,''
he said. ``You don't have to fly to Mexico, don't have to fly to
Costa Rica. I mean, how can you pass it up, right here close to
home?''
</P>
<P>
   HUGE MIGRATION: As cold weather begins to sweep across Canada,
the annual fall flight of ducks and geese has commenced, with 105
million ducks projected to make the trip south this fall, the
highest number in 50 years in North America.
</P>
<P>
   DFG DELIBERATES: The controversy over Moto Duck, which
introduces powered movement to decoys and is staggering in its
ability to draw ducks down to a marsh, still has not been addressed
with a clear answer by the state Department of Fish and Game,
approval or denial. By law, they are still legal and tens of
thousands of the new invention will be in use in the new season.
</P>
<P>
   WILD WINGS: A wildlife art show featuring color photography of
birds in California opened last week at the visitor center at the
San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge, located at the eastern foot of
the Dumbarton Bridge. For information, call 510-792-0222.

S.F. EMERGENCY CHIEF PLANS FOR NEXT QUAKE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Because he runs San Francisco's Office of
Emergency Services, many might guess that Lucien Canton would be
the most prepared of all.
</P>
<P>
   But even Canton, who was a military reservist for the Federal
Emergency Management Agency when the Loma Prieta quake rolled
through the Bay Area in 1989, said the experience had made him
realize he could do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most people, there were things I knew I should do that I
hadn't done, like bracing my bookcases and putting latches on
cabinets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Canton's family was fortunate that their home was spared any
significant damage, and since it was well-stocked with basic
necessities _ and power was not disconnected _ there was minimal
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the memory of being in Golden Gate Park with his son and
daughter, then aged 4 and 3, that fateful afternoon 10 years ago is
far from forgotten. The force of the quake tossed his son from a
playground slide, and sent other parents rushing with their
children to hover beneath a concrete picnic bench. Canton held his
daughter tight on his lap, describing his own reaction as calm and
``not overly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   With his son unhurt and his daughter barely fazed, they started
walking home accompanied by the eerie cacophony of wailing car
alarms. The gravity of what had happened sank in when he arrived
and saw the shock on his wife's face, then the TV images of homes
ablaze in the Marina District, fallen freeways and the broken Bay
Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the stress level started climbing through the
roof,'' Canton recalled. ``After I made sure the family was all
right, I came in (to work) right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead signals caused a traffic nightmare, so now he keeps a
bubble light _ essentially a portable flashing light that can be
stuck on the roof _ in his car.
</P>
<P>
   He also added basic first aid and emergency kits to both his car
and his wife's. He collected off-season camping gear and other
useful things and stored it together. They did some serious
thinking and came up with a strategy for connecting with their
children if they were away from home or at school.
</P>
<P>
   Their food and water storage is maintained as always _ though he
thinks it's time for another rotation as he mentions this. And yes,
the bookcases and cabinets in their new home have been braced.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case.

THE VIEW FROM THIS `BRIDGE' IS SPECTACULAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ William Bolcom's new opera, ``A View From the
Bridge,'' suggested the unthinkable in its premiere: A classic
American play could be better served by a musical reinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned and presented by the Lyric Opera of Chicago,
Bolcom's treatment of Arthur Miller's play offered a remarkable _
even triumphant _ alternative that intensified even further the
tragedy of the longshoreman Eddie Carbone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
An operatic setting of ``A View From the Bridge`` has substantial
interest to Houstonians.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is the first of three major premieres this season. To
come is John Harbison's ``The Great Gatsby`` at New York's
Metropolitan Opera and Carlisle Floyd's ``Cold Sassy Tree`` for
Houston Grand Opera.
</P>
<P>
   As well, the Alley Theater is offering a highly regarded
production of the play to open its season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the story pared to its essentials, and Bolcom's
kaleidoscopic music giving it pungent reinforcement, the opera made
Miller's tale about Eddie's obsession with his niece even more
wrenching to me than in the Alley's fine staging.
</P>
<P>
   Strength was present top to bottom in Bolcom's second work with
the Lyric Opera (his first, ``McTeague,'' premiered in 1992-93).
</P>
<P>
   Led by University of Houston graduate Kim Josephson (Eddie),
Catherine Malfitano (his wife, Beatrice) and Timothy Nolan (the
lawyer Alifieri, who narrates the story), the cast was impeccably
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson was a fine singing actor, and Malfitano found a role
she fit perfectly. Nolan offered the right mix of emotional horror
and resigned storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   The sleeper success, however, was tenor Gregory Turay as
Beatrice's cousin Rodolfo, who has illegally immigrated from Italy
with his brother Marco.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Arnold Weinstein produced as fine a compression of
the play as might be wanted. The principle additions _ a Greeklike
chorus to make the play's roots clearer, and an aria for Marco _
only reinforced the pungency. (Weinstein has been Bolcom's
lyricist/collaborator since 1959.)
</P>
<P>
   American conductor Dennis Russell Davies, long a champion of
American music from his bases in Europe, conducted a grand,
sweeping performance. It was melting with lyricism reflecting the
hopes of young people and horrifying with dissonance as Eddie's
obsession becomes more and more destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Director Frank Galati so deftly staged the performance that the
web of domestic dysfunctionality tightened almost imperceptibly and
thus more powerfully.
</P>
<P>
   The sets and costumes of Santo Loquasto, the projections of
Wendall K. Harrington and the lighting of Duane Schuller created an
atmospheric evocation of Brooklyn's Red Hook district in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Girders, walls of old brick and constantly shifting projections
of images from the period established a place where hard manual
labor supported the tough lives of the people in Red Hook.
</P>
<P>
   The projections were the key, shown on three screens. Two large
ones were hung at the stage's left side and rear; the third, a
trapezoid, formed the sharply raked roof of Eddie's house (a
slightly elevated platform, left of center, with a very tall
chimney to hold the roof/screen and a raised bedroom area). When a
viewer paid attention to the projections, the realism was
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Bolcom's music propelled the maelstrom of
unrecognized and unexpressed emotions that come to the surface as
Eddie's disintegration whirls more and more out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of Bolcom's music, his score for ``A View From the
Bridge`` will be liked or disliked for its rampaging eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   Eclecticism is something Americans know from the music of, most
notably, Leonard Bernstein, but Bolcom's is far more sweeping in
grasp and deft in execution.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it so defines Bolcom's style that arguments over it are
really arguments over his style in general and, ultimately, over
the taste of the listener.
</P>
<P>
   In ``View,'' he could move swiftly from an almost outlandish
accompaniment of ``Paper Doll,'' the tune that becomes Rodolfo's
way to provoke Eddie, to the intense but finely modulated
dissonance and rhythm that paced the build of both acts' climax so
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   With his music, Bolcom showed once more how well music can
nonverbally articulate emotional currents and how much more power
words have when reinforced by the music.
</P>
<P>
   The most important aspect of the libretto was how emotional
issues came more emphatically to the forefront through the
compression of scenes and dialogue:
</P>
<P>
   Bea's acute awareness of life around her, particularly the
warped relationship between Eddie and Catherine (sung with girlish
charm and then steely anger by Juliana Rambaldi). The niece's
blindness to the uncle's obsession _ and then her bitterness when
she learns that Eddie betrayed the cousins, including her future
husband, Rodolfo, by anonymously tipping off immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo's springlike innocence, captured in the aria ``I Love
the Beauty of the View at Home,'' celebrating the glories of New
York City. It is the kind of the hit number composers yearn to
write. Akin to Carlisle Floyd's ``Ain't It a Pretty Night`` from
his ``Susannah,'' it is sure to join the standard repertoire of
lyric tenors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the depth of Marco's disillusionment, only partly
revealed in the play but brought to thrilling vividness in the aria
Miller added at the request of Bolcom.
</P>
<P>
   In ``To America I sailed on a ship called Hunger,'' so achingly
sung by Mark McCrory, Marco laments how he will have to return to
Italy on the same ship that brought him to the United States. He
will return home with nothing but more misery for his family, whom
he hoped to nurse to a better life through working in America.
</P>
<P>
   How the aria was used was the finest example of the opera's
superb dramaturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Marco sang it in jail, after he has been arrested as an illegal
immigrant. In the play the scene involves a confrontation between
the lawyer Alfieri and Marco over a pledge of good behavior. All
that was jettisoned in favor of a brilliantly executed way to give
voice to Marco's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Such touches were present throughout the performance and
propelled the audience to offer seemingly genuine enthusiasm for
the work at the performance's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   How far Bolcom's new opera travels will depend on the resources
of opera companies. Scenically, it easily can be simpler.
Musically, it will require great singers and an excellent orchestra
to plumb the emotional depths of a major addition to American
opera.

N.Y. STATE POLICE PENALIZE 12 POLICEMEN FOR WOODSTOCK FROLICKING

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ten New York state troopers and two supervisors
have been suspended for cavorting with nude women during the fiery
riots that closed Woodstock '99, the agency has announced.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a supervisor was reduced in rank because of his
actions and those of troopers under his charge during the July
show.
</P>
<P>
   More than two months after troopers were accused of posing with
nude women or taking their patrol cars through a topless carwash,
State Police Superintendent James W. McMahon announced their
punishments Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled at the conduct and action of a handful of
troopers who brought discredit to the agency and themselves,''
McMahon said. He also said he was pleased with the conduct of most
of the more than 500 troopers present at the end of the Woodstock
concert.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon had announced the suspension of one of the supervisors
soon after the incident was made known.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 190,000 people came to the mostly peaceful, three-day
concert July 23-25 at the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome.
But at the show's end that Sunday night, hundreds of fans set
dozens of fires and caused millions of dollars in damage from
looting, burning and rioting. ndred troopers were called to
the scene to help restore order, a task that wasn't completed until
dawn the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the riot, a Syracuse newspaper reporter
witnessed a group of troopers asking two young women, one from
Albany and one from Saratoga Springs, N.Y., to take off their
clothes and pose with them for photographs. The women complied.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the incident made headlines, McMahon ordered an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor on duty was immediately suspended. He later was
the subject of an administrative hearing, which recommended that
the officer receive a one-step reduction in rank and a significant
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, six troopers voluntarily accepted penalties
consisting of multiple-day suspensions and formal censures.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also included troopers who paid to have their
patrol cars washed at a topless carwash. Four troopers and one
supervisor were given censures and multiple-day suspensions from
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   State Police refused to provide the names of any of the
officers, saying it was an internal matter, and declined to provide
any more details on the suspensions, which have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Lefevre, a Saratoga Springs resident and mother of one of
the two women who stripped and posed for the officers, said earlier
this week she was not concerned about whether the troopers involved
would be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big deal,'' she said. ``(But) when I found out about
the rapes that went on, I just said, `Thank God she wasn't one.'
Thank God she got back OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Four rapes were reported during Woodstock, including one that
allegedly took place in a crowd of slam dancers. Police are still
investigating.

 &HT;    CHINA VOWS NEW 'LEAP' TO BRING ZERO POPULATION GROWTH
 &HT;    400&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On the day world population reached six billion, China
confounded speculation that it might relax its one-child policy for
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday just off Tiananmen Square, officials of the
world's most populous country pledged a new ``historical leap'' in
birth control with a goal of ending all growth in China's
population by the mid-21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Their objective is to stabilize China's population at about 1.6
billion people in around 2045, by which time India is projected to
be the most populous nation on the globe. Despite China's
long-standing target of just one child per family, its population
still swells at 1 percent a year _ adding 10 million new mouths to
feed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The audience in the Great Hall of the People heard a letter from
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji pledging the support of China's top
communist leadership for ``the whole set of family planning
principles and measures which have long been effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the prime minister didn't provide a blueprint of these
ongoing population measures, they include widespread promotion of
IUDs, condoms and abortions, as well as heavy encouragement of
female sterilization especially for Chinese women who have borne a
second child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any mood of relaxation and blind optimism could lead to a
rebound in our fertility rate and the deterioration of our
population environment,'' said Zhang Weiqing, the director of
China's state family planning commission.
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago there were headlines in the Financial Times and
other Western publications suggesting that China had decided to
loosen its 20-year-old one-child policy, supposedly because leaders
had concluded that China's once-exploding population was under
control.
</P>
<P>
   But one speaker after another took to the podium Tuesday calling
for China to strive even harder to convince the Chinese masses to
have fewer children in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Peng, the deputy chief for propaganda of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, said every newspaper and
television station in China must run programs to publicize birth
control objectives.
</P>
<P>
   One purpose, he said, is to convince China's 900 million
villagers and small town dwellers that families get rich not by
having more children but ``by science and technology and working
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s and 1960s Chinese couples often had six and
seven children during times when healthcare was improving. The
resulting population surge left China's leaders alarmed at
prospects of coping with demands for food, housing and jobs. In the
early 1970s China adopted a
</P>
<P>
   cautious population control policy of marrying late and having
fewer babies under the slogan ``late, spaced and fewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fertility dropped, but not enough to satisfy the policymakers.
So in 1979 China adopted the ``one-child'' policy that mandated
most families have a single child, meting punishment in the form of
fines, job discrimination and community ostracism against those who
failed to comply.
</P>
<P>
   In some villages where local family planning officials were
exceptionally zealous in fulfilling quotas for low birth numbers,
women were coerced into being sterilized or even having late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The one-child policy has not been universal. The minority ethnic
groups that make up 5 percent of China's population have generally
been allowed two or more children per family, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And in many provinces, rural families have been governed by a de
facto ``one-son'' policy in recent years. If a couple gives birth
to a girl, they have another chance to create the son considered so
important to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been that rural families having a girl first will
continue trying for a boy, resorting to sex-selective abortions
when ultra-sound scans indicate a female fetus. Several provinces
are trying to enforce prohibitions against the use of ultra-sound
for sex identification, partly because in some locales it has
dramatically skewed the male-female
</P>
<P>
   population ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Sex-selection abortions are less prevalent in cities. Urban
families have continued to be under heavier pressure to stick with
the one-child policy, yet have become somewhat more accepting of
girl children.
</P>
<P>
   While birth control has been almost exclusively an issue for
married couples, singles are beginning to be targeted as well for
purposes of both health and population. In major cities, especially
around university campuses, condom machines have appeared just in
the last few months.

<HEADLINE>
WITH YELTSIN AILING, PRIME MINISTER STEPS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin still wears the
perpetually bland expression only a former KGB spy such as he could
love. But in two short months, that unsmiling countenance has
become the universally recognized face of Kremlin leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually unknown to Russians when President Boris N. Yeltsin
appointed him in August, Putin has gone from nowhere to everywhere.
He has emerged as the Kremlin's point man on the fight against
terrorism and the de facto commander in chief in the war against
separatist militants in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown that he is that rare Moscow politician who can
create consensus in Russian society and among the country's warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin was hospitalized recently with what the Kremlin
described as a case of the flu, Russians wondered whether his
designated successor would take over sooner than anybody thought.
Putin is suddenly the man of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Putin for president? When Yeltsin named Putin in August, it
seemed highly improbable that an obscure career intelligence
officer with minimal political experience could overtake the
favorites by next summer's presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The idea does not seem so far-fetched. Opinion polls released
last week show Putin in third place with the support of about 15
percent of voters. That is up from less than 1 percent just a month
ago, but more importantly, only a few percentage points behind the
current front-runners, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of this newfound popularity is Putin's leading
role in Russia's latest campaign to crush Islamic rebels in
Chechnya, whom he blames for a deadly wave of apartment bombs last
month. If the army's efforts collapse amid heavy losses, as some
analysts fear they might, Putin's political star may plummet as
quickly as it has risen.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Putin has been able to project the image of a competent
military gradually establishing control in Chechnya. On Sunday,
Putin said Russian troops intended to expand the security zone they
were setting up in the north of the separatist region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to eliminate all bandit formations and absolutely
exclude any conditions for their revival,'' Putin said in an
interview aired on Russian television.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's tough talk and equally resolute action have appealed to
Russian voters who are fed up with their leaders' inability to
protect them from crime and violence. Now more than 50 percent of
Russians approve of the job Putin's government is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rise has no doubt been aided by the powerful Kremlin
coterie known here as The Family, who need a friendly candidate to
win the next election to protect the wealth they have accumulated
over the past eight years of Yeltsin's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has skillfully built on the advantages he has been handed.
Not satisfied with favorable coverage on Kremlin-controlled
television, Putin has set up a single press center that gives the
official line on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that no serious political contenders could criticize his
Caucasus policy given the current public mood, Putin met with four
former premiers, all of whom lead rival electoral blocs, to win
their public backing on his Caucasus policies.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful that the poor state of the military helped bring about
defeat in the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya, Putin has courted the
generals by promising $1 billion in new spending and vowing to
update the country's security doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very presidential way for the prime minister to be
acting. Some have questioned whether The Family is preparing for
Yeltsin to step down early to help clear the way for Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has denied such talk, and Monday said that Yeltsin
was feeling better. But Yeltsin, 68, has rarely looked healthy
since undergoing major heart surgery in 1996. As Yevgeny Kiselyov,
host of the weekly television news program Itogi, put it, ``no one
believes in talk about the latest flu.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiselyov argued that Yeltsin should hand over his powers to his
prime minister. More than 90 percent of 16,500 viewers who took
part in a phone poll agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, notoriously jealous of his power, has not made any
formal transfer of duties. But lately, Yeltsin has rarely been seen
or heard from.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was the one who promised Russian troops would beat back an
incursion of Chechen-led rebels into the southern republic of
Dagestan in August and September. Putin then announced that Russian
troops would pursue the rebels into Chechnya. It was Putin who
linked the bombs in Moscow with Chechen rebels. And Putin promised
that if ``we catch them in the toilet, we will rub them out in the
outhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   While Russian airstrikes have caused heavy civilian casualities
in Chechnya, the military has so far moved more cautiously in an
effort to prevent a repeat of the heavy losses it suffered in the
last campaign. And the Russian media has so far played down the
setbacks the military has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem for Putin now is how to keep it that way.

BRADLEY PROPOSAL   IS A SLIGHT STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the start, Bill Bradley's presidential
campaign has been built as an insurgency. Those days are gone, much
to the distress of the former New Jersey senator who tries to
maintain the pose even as his high command gushes over the latest
polling results.
</P>
<P>
   If not an insurgency, then, Bradley at least hopes to lead an
agenda for change that can mean something to people.
</P>
<P>
   In his first effort to fill in the big blanks, Bradley
successfully presented his ideas at the end of September for
expanding health insurance to nearly everybody. You could agree or
disagree, but there was no doubt that Bradley offered serious
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   His second attempt to be bold was less clear-cut. Again, Bradley
made an effective presentation on the serious stresses working
families face in a rapidly changing work, home, and school
environment. But whether he provided a solid basis for a choice was
more open to question. In the end, details of policy thinking do
not produce presidential nominations; but those details, as they
get questioned and tested, help voters make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire last week, Bradley focused on very young
children, 13 million of whom spend part of each day away from home
because their parent or parents work. Helping working families of
modest means with this huge burden takes more than $10 billion a
year in federal funds, both for early-childhood education and
day-care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would toss in another $2 billion over five years,
adopting a model in use in North Carolina and widely praised. The
states would be the vehicle for creating partnerships at the state
and county level to find the most worthwhile early childhood
programs in each community, with Uncle Sam contributing $5 for
every $1 a state spends. The money would presumably fund existing
networks of preschool and child-care efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds solid, but there are four points worth mentioning. The
first is that while $2 billion isn't hay, it also isn't much.
Having been willing to invest more than $600 billion of the
projected budget surpluses of $1 trillion in trying to make health
insurance nearly universal, Bradley has to be stingy with the rest,
especially because his upcoming third policy initiative will be a
very big-ticket item: poverty among children.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason he tossed a smaller stick on his pile in his
proposal to expand the shrunken pool of child-care workers by
offering senior citizens tax-free stipends up to $200 a month for
at least 15 hours of weekly work with kids.
</P>
<P>
   The second point involves some of the things Bradley chose not
to mention, such as raising the minimum wage, eliminating the
portion of the so-called marriage penalty in the tax code that
affects moderate-income families, after-school programs, and
helping low-income urban workers find transportation to jobs in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   These are Clinton-Gore administration initiatives, and they also
are very important to working families. Also, last May, Al Gore
proposed a potentially more sweeping idea to make preschool
availability universal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has yet to provide price tags for some of his early
campaign ideas, but he has plenty of time to fill in the blanks. It
was also interesting that at least in one area _ family and medical
leave _ Bradley found it unavoidable to support an expansion of the
existing law that Bill Clinton won passage of six years ago to
guarantee 12 weeks of unpaid leave and expand coverage to firms
with 25 or more employers, plus an additional three working days
annually for such obligations as parent-teacher conferences.
Bradley's speech didn't note that Gore has also proposed this.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bradley included in his package a $400 million annual
investment in the country's 1,000 community colleges as the most
efficient centers for the lifelong learning most workers will
require in the future to upgrade the greater skills local employers
will require.
</P>
<P>
   A sound proposal, but a slight stretch for a speech that began
with a nostalgic remembrance of supper every evening with the
entire family present.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Bradley is good, but so is the retooling Gore.
They appear to have differences worth debating over budget surplus
priorities and health care. But the lesson Gore should take from
Bradley's success is not that he should go after Bradley or assert
his incumbent administration muscle and advantages. The vice
president needs to concentrate on making his own connections to
voters, in which case he'll do just fine.

US DISASTER RELIEF TEAMS GO GLOBAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dean Tills, a 38-year-old structural engineer with graying
sideburns and oval wire-rimmed glasses, looks like a man who
belongs behind a desk. Most days, that's where he is, sitting in
his ergonomic chair and helping design office buildings and parking
garages.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, things have been different. Tills flew halfway around
the world to climb over twisted concrete and into crumpled
buildings, looking for survivors of the massive earthquake that
shook Taiwan in September and killed more than 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other newfound colleagues, including firefighters, medics,
seismic-device operators, and sniffer-dog handlers, have been
speeding around the globe in recent weeks to help Taiwan and
Turkey, which was struck by an even deadlier earthquake in August.
They were on alert last week when another big earthquake, measuring
7.5 on the Richter scale, rocked southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To Tills, the work is certainly more dangerous _ but more
stimulating _ than the office grind. ``The blood starts pumping and
the heart really goes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tills's education in disaster is rooted in being a volunteer
with the Fairfax County, Va., Fire and Rescue Department, a
100-member international disaster relief team and one of only two
such units that Washington sends worldwide when catastrophe
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Most team members are professional firefighters and medics who
take a break from fighting northern Virginia blazes when disaster
strikes the globe. They are an elite, specially-trained unit that
operates seismic devices and telescopic cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The unit includes skilled members who volunteer, like Tills,
such as doctors, engineers, and canine handlers with their house
pets-turned-sniffer-dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax team has been busy lately. It spent four days of
round-the-clock rescue work in Taiwan. In August, most of its
members were in Turkey, trying to find survivors of the earthquake
in which an estimated 15,000 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   That was Tills's first quake. At one point, he crawled through a
tunnel carved beneath a crumbled structure, trying to determine the
best way to rescue survivors without causing the building to come
down on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that here I was, sandwiched underneath this
building, and one little aftershock and I would be gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he saw an ad that the Fairfax department had
placed looking for engineers. Why did he answer it? The need for a
little excitement in his life, he admits, plus an altruistic streak
he says he inherited from his father, a former chief operating
officer for the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tills doesn't want to stop, much to the dismay of his wife.
Including the two quakes, he's been along with the rescue team for
a hurricane and the Oklahoma City bombing. ``It's in my blood
now,'' he said, as the unit prepared to head home from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That's a feeling echoed by many of his colleagues, who say they
are motivated by empathy and adrenalin. ``Going into some of these
buildings no one in his right mind would go into and knowing that
any moment it could be lights out, there's a sense of energy that's
indefinable,'' said Lieutenant Gerry Morrison, a rescue squad
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Or as one rescuer put it, ``Mechanics like it when cars break
down, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Six hours after the quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale
struck Taiwan, the Fairfax County's 19-person advance team left on
a charter flight, stopping to refuel in Seattle, Anchorage, and
Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later came the rest of the team on a C-5A military
aircraft: 72 rescuers, 70,000 pounds of equipment, and three
tractor-trailers. Within 36 hours, the US team was struggling to
find survivors in a 16-story Taiwanese building tilted at a
30-degree angle, and whose bottom five stories had plummeted
underground.
</P>
<P>
   It took the American rescuers eight hours to pull out a
32-year-old man trapped in a hole 20 feet below ground on what had
been the third floor of the building. He was hanging upside down,
his right leg trapped under debris.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Barbera, a rescue team volunteer and emergency
physician at George Washington University Hospital, wedged into the
hole along with two rescue specialists. Barbera medicated the man
and inserted two intravenous drips to stem dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he advised rescuers on how to chip away at the concrete
without damaging the leg. ``Succeeding to help someone who is
entombed and slowly dying is a great feeling,'' said Barbera.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Turkey, where the US team saved countless lives, in
Taiwan members recovered just the one man. Rescuers said the nature
of the buildings' collapse made it more difficult to find
survivors. Also, not as many people were trapped as in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best technical search team in the world,'' said
Dick Owens, team leader of the US Agency for International
Development, which contracts out to Fairfax County for its
international rescue service. Thirty-two rescue teams from 18
countries went to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfax's techniques ranged from high-tech to low-tech, from man
to beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a good rescue dog is social skills. He's got to
love people, and have a good temperament,'' said retired
veterinarian Brooke Holt, who has been taking her 10-year-old
mixed-breed Leni on missions for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, Holt sent Leni into a collapsed building through a
window, and directed him through the area by verbal command. When
it was deemed safe enough, she followed him in.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' role in international disaster relief began
after the 1986 Mexico quake. Back then, the Dade County, Fla.,
department sent a few firefighters to help out. That made the US
government realize that it wanted an effective international
disaster unit.
</P>
<P>
   Since then both Fairfax and Dade formed rescue units, which are
the only two certified by the US government for overseas work.
Fairfax was able to develop an independent rescue unit because of
its large size _ 1,300 firefighters _ and its convenience to air
force bases and authorities in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The group has handled disasters manmade and natural: from
bombings in Nairobi and Oklahoma City to quakes in Armenia and
Columbia. ``We've never had a death or a serious injury,'' said
Captain Michael Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   After each mission, the group engages in a critique, trying to
figure out which methods worked and which didn't. As the group met
in a hotel outside Taipei, most of the rescue team members showed
no outward signs of fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adrenalin is still high,'' said medical specialist Lorenzo
Thrower. ``If something else hits, we're ready right now. Our
trucks are loaded.''

HARVARD STARTS MENDING FENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ At a reception earlier this year, Harvard
president Neil Rudenstine celebrated the appointment of the
university's new chief emissary to the world outside its gates.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grogan, the appointee, spent 10 years at Boston City Hall
working for mayors Kevin H. White and Raymond L. Flynn and another
12 years in urban development, and he knew many in the crowd of
community activists and city officials at the reception. Some were
still smarting from Harvard's secret purchase of 52 acres in the
Allston section of Boston, assembled over nearly a decade before
the university disclosed it two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan began by saying he was touched that people had welcomed
him by saying that the secret purchases ``wouldn't have happened if
you were here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is,'' Grogan said, breaking into a grin, ``if I'd
been here, we would have gotten a hundred acres.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience laughed, taking it for the joke it was. Still, it
had a ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   By their own account, Harvard's top administrators have embarked
on an aggressive campaign to prove that the university is a good
neighbor to what it now deferentially refers to as its ``host
cities.'' Harvard officials would like to show Boston and Cambridge
that it is not, in Grogan's words, ``the Kremlin on the Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they want to avoid another public relations fiasco
like the one the secret Allston purchases triggered. They also hope
that improved relations will smooth the path to more development,
as the world's richest university looks to grow into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials estimate they will spend $1.1 billion on
construction projects over the next five years, particularly as
they look to enhance offerings in the sciences and at the business
school. To them, the logical site for expansion is across the
river, in Boston. Of the university's 444 acres, slightly more than
half are in Boston, although much of that is already developed.
</P>
<P>
   While many urban universities have thrown themselves into
rehabilitating their surrounding communities over the last few
years, Harvard has remained largely aloof, at least by reputation.
As Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino singsonged in mimicking what he
called the arrogance of the 1997 Allston purchase, ``We're from
Hahvahd, and we're going to do what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials say they have always done good works in the
community, but they have simply done them quietly. Now, however,
they have new interest in publicizing them. As the university looks
to develop, better relations aren't just a nicety; they're a
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the only time we're talking to people in public life is
when we have a transaction, chances are we're going to have
problems,'' Grogan said. ``On the other hand, if you're doing lots
of things together, you can deal with the stream of specific
transactions in a better context.''
</P>
<P>
   So if what Allston residents called the land grab marked the low
point in town-gown relations, the last few weeks have seen a
remarkable attempt at reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   First, Harvard announced it would pay the city of Boston $40
million in lieu of taxes over the next 20 years, payments that
Grogan had sought when he was in City Hall and a 45 percent
increase over what the university has been paying. It also agreed
to build 288 units of graduate-student housing in Allston, which
the mayor had sought to ease the tight rental market. Then Harvard
turned over 775 units of affordable housing to residents of
Boston's Mission Hill section, where it had acquired land through
eminent domain in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Rudenstine spoke to the Greater Boston Chamber of
Commerce, touting the $2 billion in economic benefits Harvard
provides to Boston and Cambridge, which were detailed in the
release of a 70-page report. Officials say that in the next few
months there will be an announcement of another initiative to help
the city, with ``significant university resources'' behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past it's been, `I'm Harvard; don't bother me.' I think
you've seen that change,'' said Menino, who warmly introduced
Rudenstine at the chamber luncheon. ``They're still Harvard, but
they understand this is a different era. If they want to do
anything with that land, they have to be more involved. And they
want to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome that, I'm not cynical about it,'' the mayor added.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Harvard hasn't entirely deserved the reputation as
a bad neighbor. Paul Guzzi, head of the chamber of commerce,
recalls working at a boys club in Boston in his own days as a
Harvard undergraduate. It was just one of hundreds of
community-service programs operated by college students each year.
In Cambridge, the school decided without fanfare not to build any
more high rises in Harvard Square, to preserve the neighborhood
atmosphere, Rudenstine said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the perception stuck. In part, it was natural in a
class-conscious city that a 350-year-old university would be seen
as elitist.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan acknowledges buying into that image himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very flattering to remember that period,'' Grogan
said of his own days in City Hall in the 1970s. ``We had an
undeveloped relationship, a very narrow conception of all these
institutions. We took them for granted in all sorts of ways. It was
the Proposition 2 1/2 era of strangling the city's revenues, and we
were fond of pointing out how much tax-exempt properties the
universities had. We viewed Harvard as particularly remote.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Allston purchase was disclosed, Menino complained that
Harvard had not done enough to provide scholarships for Boston
students. The mayor tried unsuccessfully to use increased
scholarships as a condition for Harvard's completion of new
construction on the business school and an athletic complex in
Allston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the way to go about a land acquisition,'' Guzzi said
recently. ``But that was just part of the bigger issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also have been the catalyst to better relations.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious improvement was the choice of Grogan in April
as vice president of government, community, and public affairs. He
was picked for the post while serving as head of a low-cost housing
initiative in Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan replaced Jim Rowe, who had been well connected in
Washington, reflecting what Harvard then saw as its most important
outside link.
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus is closer to home. To maintain the excellence at
Harvard, and the recent record-setting $2.325 billion fund-raising
is said to be dedicated to that goal, the university will have to
build.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really came out of a sense of things being tight in
Cambridge,'' Rudenstine said. ``Considering the constraints in
Cambridge, we have to look to Boston, and it makes sense that we
just have to have someone whose experience is more in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Other universities have periodically put out reports documenting
their economic impact on the surrounding community. Harvard had
never done done so until this year. Grogan called news outlets the
weekend before it was released, trying to make sure it was well
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Other universities are far ahead of Harvard in paying attention
to their host cities. Trinity College in Hartford, Yale in New
Haven, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have all
engineered major rehabilitations of run-down neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Grogan argues that those schools were forced to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have reason to do it before,'' he said. ``Those
areas are in very serious distress. We have just the opposite. We
have a very attractive city around us. Neil feels very strongly
that, instead of taking that for granted, we should be investing in
it affirmatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Some community activists say the push is showing signs of
working. In Allston, residents have been working on a Harvard task
force to shape the new development. They say they appreciate that
the business school has paid attention to their request that its
new buildings face Allston, instead of treating it as the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't so much angry anymore, but they're
apprehensive,'' said Boston City Councilor Brian J. Honan, who
represents Allston. ``They're the largest landlord. Their endowment
and political power make them intimidating.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say they want more information from Harvard,
particularly on what it intends to do with a 12-acre site and
another 5-acre site near the business school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they are waiting for a certain period of time, they
have to have some idea of what they're going to do,'' Honan said.
``How long can a person sit on a piece of property and not develop
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Personal relations mean a lot, however, and Honan is among those
who believe that Grogan's arrival marks an improvement in public
and community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials insist that the increased public relations
effort isn't just for show.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `What's the purpose of all this?' '' McCluskey
said. ``It could be viewed as sort of a reminder, to ourselves and
to others. It's not just to say, `Look how valuable Harvard is,'
but to recognize that we have a continued responsibility to play a
constructive role in the future.''

FORTHCOMING, A FORTHRIGHT SOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All over the usage map there are small but dedicated bands of
resisters fending off new usages _ the bad, the ugly, sometimes
even the good and useful. John S. Wollam of Falmouth speaks for one
such group when he protests ``the use of forthcoming when the
obvious intent is to convey the concept of forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   Forthcoming in the sense Wollam dislikes _ ``open, honest,
generous with information'' _ has been gaining on us in the past
few decades, it's true. And it got a big boost from diplomats and
politicians _ as when President Carter described the Soviet Union
as ``very forthcoming and cooperative'' _ which doesn't help the
word's image among defenders of the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   But forthcoming is not merely a ``common misuse of the English
language,'' as Wollam believes. For one thing, it's got history on
its side: The first recorded use is dated 1835, and forthcomingness
is found even earlier, in 1808. It didn't cross the Atlantic till
much later, though, and even today, after more than two decades of
regular use in print here, forthcoming still gets a ``Chiefly
Brit.'' tag in some dictionaries. But the membrane separating
British and American English has more holes in it every day, and it
seems unlikely that the pols and show-biz reporters so enamored of
forthcoming are hearing it as a British idiom.
</P>
<P>
   Is forthcoming an unnecessary synonym for forthright? I think
there are subtle differences, especially once we move beyond the
coded language of diplomacy. An interviewee could be forthcoming _
weeping, emoting, revealing gruesome details of past addictions and
transgressions _ while still being deceptive, intentionally or not.
Forthright connotes directness and honesty, while forthcoming
expresses more about an attitude _ the willingness to talk _ than
about the accuracy of what's said. That may mean it's a fuzzy word,
all too suitable for a culture of fuzzy communicators, but even the
fuzziness is part of its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Another objection to forthcoming is the possibility of
confusion, since the older forthcoming, meaning ``about to
appear,'' is still in daily use. ``Her forthcoming novel is
charming,'' we could say, ``but she's not at all forthcoming
herself.'' But there aren't a lot of contexts where either meaning
would fit, and as English-usage potholes go, this one seems easily
avoidable. If obsessing about usage is your hobby _ and why
shouldn't it be? _ there are more deserving targets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was it a semicolon for you, too?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new wedding night, wrote Asra Q. Nomani in Thursday's Wall
Street Journal, is more likely to be an all-night party than an
intimate revelation: With couples marrying older, living together
before the wedding, and often paying for the festivities
themselves, they want to enjoy the reception, not tiptoe off to the
bridal suite while their friends are still carousing.
</P>
<P>
   Clear enough, so far. But then Nomani sums it up this way:
``Sex, when it happens, is often an apostrophe, not an exclamation
point.''
</P>
<P>
   An apostrophe?
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the punctuation analogy is necessarily hard to
follow. For instance, a gentleman I know was quoted as saying that
after prostate surgery, sex was ``a period, not an exclamation
point.'' A period, in the nuptials story, would have implied _ you
should pardon the expression _ an anticlimactic ending to the big
night.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could have been a comma, a brief pause after which the
happy couple rejoined the wedding guests; and if the dalliance
lasted more than briefly, but remained an interlude between
partying and more partying, a semicolon would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But apostrophe?
</P>
<P>
   As a punctuation mark, of course, it indicates something left
out _ the missing letters in rock 'n' roll or ne'er-do-well _ but
that meaning only works if there's no sex at all; it doesn't fit
``sex, when it happens, is often an apostrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also apostrophe in the rhetorical/dramatic sense _ an
abrupt digression into exclamatory speech, as in Romeo's ``But
soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and
Juliet is the sun.'' But however suitable this might be on
sentimental grounds, it doesn't fit the sense _ unless the author
is trying to say that the modern wedding night is all talk and no
action. At press time, Nomani hadn't returned my phone calls, but I
hope the mystery will be solved by next week. In the meantime,
hypotheses are invited, with or without proper punctuation.

ESCAPING FROM A `WASTELAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So where are the protests? The calls for a boycott? All the
fist-shaking and finger-pointing? Where's the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People when you really need them to
lift up their voices and scream?
</P>
<P>
   Someone, somewhere needs to make some unholy noises about this
still-nascent television season, the same one that had the NAACP
and the National Council of La Raza all in a twist during the
summer. You may remember that several such groups, as well as many
TV critics, were thoroughly upset that out of more than two dozen
new shows on the four major networks _ ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox _
none featured a lead actor or actress of color. And most didn't
have any black, Asian, or Latino characters at all. NAACP President
Kweisi Mfume branded the fall season ``a virtual whitewash in
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hollywood TV execs feeling scorched, several of them
hastily added actors of color to their shows. One of the first was
``Wasteland,'' ABC's hourlong ode to Pretty White People with
Problems. Show creator Kevin Williamson, who said his ``eyes have
been opened a little bit wider'' after irate groups even evoked the
dreaded ``R'' word, brought in Jeffrey D. Sams, a black actor, to
diversify his cast.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. What with all our righteous indignation,
perhaps we failed to consider that TV types might have been doing
people of color a big fat favor with a slate of shows featuring few
black or brown faces. Now we have to endure the sight of Sams, a
smart actor who costarred on last year's far superior and quickly
canceled ``Cupid'' (also on ABC), on the absolute worst show of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   This is progress?
</P>
<P>
   So I'm calling for a protest, a boycott, or anything. Let's
rally the troops, leaflet the studios, and plead our case to Steve
Kmetko or Mary Hart. If all that tub-thumping could get a black
actor on ``Wasteland,'' then we need another mighty effort to get
him off before his career is ruined.
</P>
<P>
   Random thoughts: If Creed is the best that guitar-driven rock
has left to offer, then maybe someone should pull the plug on rock
'n' roll. Less than a decade after Nirvana kick-started a
revolution, this very photogenic Florida quartet is riding high on
some of the most shamelessly derivative and generic rock in recent
memory. They're the Backstreet Boys with instruments, 'NSync with
more tattoos. At best, their songs have all the flair of a
Soundgarden or Pearl Jam cover band. Still, their sophomore effort,
``Human Clay,'' managed to debut in the No. 1 slot on this week's
Billboard 200. Yikes.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of sophomore efforts, what happened to Missy
``Misdemeanor'' Elliott's ``Da Real World''? After the runaway
commercial and critical success of her 1997 debut, ``Supa Dupa
Fly,'' her follow-up was one of the most anticipated of the year.
But it never caught fire and dropped out of sight like a stone.
With such a reception, the title of one of her songs, ``She's a
Bitch,'' would also be an apt description of fan loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of Steven Patrick Morrissey is the Smiths'
``How Soon Is Now'' doing in a Nissan car commercial? Sure, we're
long past the days when jaws dropped after the Beatles'
``Revolution'' was used to sell sneakers. Now just about every
commercial employs popular music as a hook, such as the zombie-like
models in a current Gap ad singing a monotone rendition of Depeche
Mode's ``Just Can't Get Enough.'' Obviously no one is immune to
this lucrative bandwagon _ save for R.E.M., who said no to Bill
Gates when he wanted to use ``It's the End of the World As We Know
It (And I Feel Fine) to launch Windows 95. Still, there's something
particularly jarring about the Smiths, who disbanded in the 1980s,
hopping on-board. Their witty, wordy songs were so uncommercial (at
least by American standards), they became arguably the best British
band never to break big stateside. Although they've long enjoyed a
devoted cult following, in their time they never even mustered a
top 20 hit.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not saying artists shouldn't make as much money as
possible from their music, especially with the industry's long
history of ripping off musicians. But I can't help but feel
disheartened every time I hear Johnny Marr's trembling guitar, the
distinct intro to this naked, aching lament for love, used to
peddle a family sedan.

PATAGONIA ON HORSEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TIMOTHY LELAND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATAGONIA, Argentina _ The horses took us only halfway up.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the climb was on foot, up the stony face of the
escarpment. Up, up, and up to where the condors soared.
</P>
<P>
   You know you've climbed a good long way when you can look down
at a half-dozen Andean condors, hovering over a valley below, their
6-foot wing span holding them aloft in the secret swirling currents
of air.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of the butte we had just ascended, where we huddled
against the boulders to block the wind, an immense and empty
landscape lay before us, the snowcapped peaks of the Andes
glimmering in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   This was Patagonia, the wild and beautiful land of literature
and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   No towns could be seen in any direction. Not a single building,
no sign of habitation for what seemed like hundreds of miles. This
was the land we had come to observe and experience _ on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-distance beneath us, off to the west, a thick
embroidery of cultivated trees, green against the sere brown of the
rolling landscape, was all that gave away the location of our
``estancia,'' the cattle ranch where my friend and I were staying
for a week of horseback riding, sightseeing, and fishing in one of
the world's most remote and romantic regions.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Estancia Huechhue (pronounced way-CHA-way), it lies in
the foothills of the Andes in northern Patagonia, a thousand miles
southwest of Buenos Aires. As ranches go in this part of the world,
Huechhue is a relatively small spread, covering only 36 square
miles, or some 15,000 acres. But those 36 square miles provide
plenty of land for the ranch's 900 head of Hereford to graze on.
And if you're on horseback looking for those 900 head of cattle, or
herding them from point A to point B, those 36 square miles seems
endless. Especially if you're from Boston and a game of chess is a
good physical workout.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we were displeased. My childhood friend, James Dean of
South Berwick, Maine, was seeking the same thing I was. We were
both 61; both recently retired; both looking for a novel travel
experience.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what we found.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina exports much of the best beef in the world and, to
support the industry, has many huge cattle ranches, many of which
allow paying guests to stay on the premises in considerable luxury,
just like the dude ranches in our Western states. At elegant and
expensive ranches near Buenos Aires, for example, you can play a
round of golf or a game of polo on manicured grass.
</P>
<P>
   Not at Estancia Huechhue in Patagonia. Here, unlike its North
American counterparts, there are no TV sets, no video games, no
after-dinner softball games, no Ping-Pong tournaments, no pool
tables, and no rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeos? There aren't even any radios.
</P>
<P>
   Just horses and rainbow trout. But if you like to ride the
former or catch the latter, you'll think you're in Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get very few guests who spend the afternoons sitting in the
sun,'' says Jane Alexander, owner of the ranch. ``The people who
come here tend to be much more active than those who prefer the
traditional dude ranches.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a 42-year-old Englishwoman with shoulder-length black
hair and an explosive laugh, is a story in herself. Born and raised
in London as a member of the upper class, she married an Argentine
whose grandfather had bought the ranch in Patagonia around the turn
of the century. Shortly after their marriage in England, Jane
traveled with her new husband to see the Argentine property for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was coming here to play for a couple of years and
then go back to London,'' she recalls, ``but it didn't work out
that way.'' In a tragic twist of fate, Jane's husband was killed in
a tractor accident shortly after they arrived, leaving the former
socialite in charge of a 15,000-acre ranch in a remote part of the
world where a foreign language was spoken and the lifestyle was
totally different. ``I never even rode horses when I was young,''
she notes.
</P>
<P>
   She does now _ every day, almost all day, either in the company
of the Argentine cowboys, known as gauchos, who work on the ranch,
or with tourists like Jim and myself who visit the ranch between
November and April, when guests are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   For those who request it, Jane and the gauchos will lay on a
full seven-day pack trip into Lanin National Park, which lies
adjacent to the ranch. During the trek, you ride through beech
forests and bamboo thickets along the shore of a green-blue lake,
up the Aquinco Valley through a forest of Monkey Puzzle trees, over
the shoulder of a nearby volcano, then drop down for a swim in some
neighboring thermal springs before returning to Huechahue.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a pack trip was tempting, Jim and I opted for day
rides, returning each night to the comfort of our twin-bedded room
in the ranch's guesthouse, where we could soak our creaking bodies
in water heated by a wood-stoked furnace outside our door.
</P>
<P>
   And our bodies did creak, notwithstanding our best efforts to
achieve comfort and support. Along with the usual assortment of
leather gloves, soft cotton socks, suntan lotion, lip balm, and
fleece jackets, I had brought my secret weapons against physical
trauma caused by prolonged activity on horseback. These included:
</P>
<P>
   --Moleskin patches (for untoward blisters).
</P>
<P>
   --A pair of black nylon long johns (to prevent chafing under
dungarees).
</P>
<P>
   --A nylon back-brace (normally worn while chopping wood in New
Hampshire).
</P>
<P>
   --And a white foam-rubber neck brace (left over from a previous
injury).
</P>
<P>
   Jim's apparel was also utilitarian, if equally unorthodox. The
first day, he showed up at the corral wearing a purple flannel
shirt from L. L. Bean, green nylon ski pants taped at the ankles to
keep from sliding up his leg, a red cotton sash around his waist
for back support (borrowed from Jane), heavy leather hiking boots,
and a black velvet riding helmet perched atop his head. He looked
like a cross between an addled English fox hunter and a street
person in Boston. He claimed that I, on the other hand, resembled a
war casualty from a local field hospital.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, we were ready to ride _ and ride we did.
</P>
<P>
   The horses of Patagonia have been bred for strength and
endurance, and they love to run. Riding in this part of the world
does not mean ambling along at a walk or an occasional trot,
admiring the views. It means pounding over the hard, rolling hills
in long-winded canters interspersed with full-throttle,
hell-for-leather galloping, when the bones and teeth of aging
bodies feel as though they may rattle and shake apart. Everywhere
we went we seemed to go at top speed, Jim and I hanging on for dear
life.

   TAKE-BOS  
 PATAGONIA, Argentina: ... dear life.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But after reining to a stop in one piece, how very satisfying
and exhilarating it was. The shaking-and-baking of our bones was
worth it, as, close up and personal, we saw the beautiful
Patagonian countryside flash by. Animal and bird life were
everywhere: herds of wild red deer, their white tails twitching as
they raced through the underbrush; tall, ungainly guanacos (South
American llamas), which peered at us inquisitively as we rode past;
gray rabbits constantly dashing across our path; and their larger
cousins, hares, flushed out of hiding by the two black dogs that
roamed in front of us, barking with delight.
</P>
<P>
   My memory of wildlife in Patagonia, however, will always be of
birds.
</P>
<P>
   What wildflowers are to a pack trip in Wyoming, or tropical fish
to snorkeling in Bora Bora, or whales to a sightseeing trip in Cabo
San Luca, birds are to the countryside of Patagonia.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, there were numerous robins in southern Argentina,
making us feel for awhile as though we hadn't left New England
after all. But riding across the fields and meadows we saw many
other, less familiar species. Spur-winged plovers with bright red
legs rose with a clatter from the brush. Flocks of buff-necked ibis
strutted across the grassy plains, digging insects out of the earth
with their strange curved bills. Burrowing parrots, large green and
yellow birds that lived in holes they scratched in a sandy bluff,
made a tremendous clatter as we rode up.
</P>
<P>
   Ornamental trees are another hallmark of the Huechachue ranch.
As a hobby in the 1930s and '40s, Jane's late father-in-law
collected seeds and saplings from around the world and planted them
on the property. Jane would tick off the varieties that remain as
we rode out to the hills each morning: long straight lanes of
poplars, silvery-barked eucalyptus, orchards of peach, nectarine,
hazelnut, almond trees, and many others.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of our stay, we were joined at the ranch by
six Dutch military reserve officers who belonged to a riding club
in their country _ rough and ready men in their 40s and 50s who
loved to ride during the day and drink at night, and did a lot of
both.
</P>
<P>
   They also liked good, hearty food, and they had come to the
right place for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jane served huge English breakfasts each day to keep us going
until lunch, which more often than not was an ``asado,'' the
traditional Argentine barbecue. Sides of beef or lamb would already
be roasting over an open fire when we dismounted for our midday
meal, and the gauchos would use their razor-sharp knives, typically
worn in a sash at the small of their backs, to cut off large hunks
for each of us to eat. A typical dinner (which in Argentina never
begins before 9), might start with an appetizer of wild hare, rich
brown meat boiled in oil and vinegar and stored in sterilized jars.
Next might come sliced venison, fresh green vegetables, baked
potatoes, avocado salad, and warm bread, all products of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   And for dessert? When was the last time you had thick cream,
straight from the cow, poured over scoops of fresh, homemade
chocolate ice cream?
</P>
<P>
   If you're trying to lose weight, a cattle ranch in Patagonia may
not be for you.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, following breakfast, we set out on horseback for
a different part of the estancia, helping Jane and the gauchos herd
cattle or check fencing. After five days, it was time for a more
restful diversion, and Jim and I rode to a nearby stream for
fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Wading knee-deep in crystal clear water, we cast our artificial
flies in the deep glassy pools behind rocks or fallen branches.
Within an hour we had caught (and released) a half-dozen beautiful
rainbow trout that jumped out of the water when hooked, fighting
the line every inch of the way. The fishing, like the horseback
riding, is unequaled in Patagonia.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, refreshed and reinvigorated, we were back in the
saddle, trotting down a long dusty trail beside a beautiful river
that sparkled in the sun. Late in the day we came to the boundary
line of an Indian reservation, where the family of Domingo, one of
our favorite gaucho guides, lived.
</P>
<P>
   From the top of the hill overlooking a valley, he pointed to a
human-made rock formation, where a tribal chieftain had been buried
many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chiefs were always buried in a place where they could see
their tribal enemies approaching,'' Domingo said, scanning the vast
empty space in front of us. There were no enemies in sight.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there were no friends, either.
</P>
<P>
   There, in fact, was no sign of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   That's Patagonia.

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES _ This Latin city on the other side of the world
seemed too far away even to think about. But visiting it turned out
to be easier than I imagined, and more interesting, too.
</P>
<P>
   A bustling metropolis of 11 million, Buenos Aires has impressive
architecture, grand boulevards, and sweeping vistas reminiscent of
Washington, D.C. Its beef and wines are world famous. Its
nightclubs showcase the tango, that steamy dance whose mournful
melodies seems to capture a nation's longing.
</P>
<P>
   Argentines will tell you there's more to see in their country
than the capital. For me, the rest will have to wait. I found
plenty to keep me busy in Buenos Aires during an eight-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was a steamy evening in June when I flew out of Boston.
Fifteen hours later, I woke up to winter in Buenos Aires. That
meant no snow but temperatures in the 40s and 50s. Most tourists
prefer to visit when it's warm, but the off-season has advantages.
For one, cool days make for better walking.
</P>
<P>
   The pulse of Buenos Aires is felt in its streets. Men as well as
women greet each other with a kiss on the cheek. Cafe waiters
jaywalk a tray of cafe lattes through traffic in the local version
of takeout. Dog walkers, who can make $100 a month per animal, pass
by on the sidewalk with a dozen dogs on leashes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has great parks, often beautifully landscaped and well
maintained. Resting on a bench in Jardin Botanico can conjure up a
Parisian garden or a shady square in Savannah. Monuments to heroic
events in Argentine history are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, streets are dirty and sidewalks crumbling. The
city has begun to offer no-smoking areas in larger restaurants, but
it has yet to push dog owners to clean up after their pets. Those
who are well off appear to be thriving, but poverty remains a huge
problem and is said to be getting worse. Politics and corruption,
great spectator sports to be sure, are the despair of many
rank-and-file Argentines.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the downtown Plaza de Mayo gave me a glimpse of
Argentina's painful recent history. Plaza de Mayo faces the Casa
Rosaria government building where Juan and Eva Peron stood on the
balcony and waved to the crowds during pivotal moments in his
tumultuous reign.
</P>
<P>
   The Mothers of the Disappeared, wearing white kerchiefs, circle
the plaza Thursdays in a weekly march begun 22 years ago. It
commemorates the estimated 30,000 who were seized, many never to be
seen again, in the late 1970s and early '80s during the military
government's ``dirty war'' against internal critics.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I came across a group of 100 aging men with a
separate grievance. These rightist demonstrators were still upset
at Argentina's 1982 defeat by Britain in their war over the
still-disputed Falkland Islands and the suppression of a brief 1990
insurrection by young military officers.
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside politics, I went to a Sunday soccer match at a
large stadium in the northern part of the city. Instead of the
classic 0-0 tie, it turned out to be an exciting game, won 3-2 by
the visiting team.
</P>
<P>
   But the action off the field was even more interesting. The
streets were blocked to vehicles a quarter-mile from the stadium.
When I reached the gate, with the game underway, police were in
force outside. One stood over a prisoner who knelt on the ground
with his hands cuffed behind his back. There were police on
horseback and riot police with helmets and clubs. The soccer game
was supposed to be entertainment, but the police looked as if they
were expecting a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They had reason to be on guard, given an intensity in Argentine
fans that leads to comparisons with English soccer hooligans. The
match was supposed to be a walkover for the home team. To
everyone's surprise and the excitement of the visitors, the away
team won a big upset, beating its opponents in their home stadium
for the first time in 26 years. Maybe that explained the raucous
chanting, the obscene words and gestures exchanged by rival fans at
halftime, and the decision by police to keep the two sides
separated by a sort of demilitarized zone where no one was allowed
to sit. Or maybe it was all routine.
</P>
<P>
   In my one excursion outside the city, I took a hydrofoil from a
downtown dock across the Rio de la Plata to Uruguay. The round trip
cost $55 and took 45 minutes each way. I was hoping to have a
couple of hours to look around Montevideo, the capital, after
taking the bus there from the port of Colonia.
</P>
<P>
   That plan fizzled when the hour bus trip I had been told to
expect took 2 1/2 hours. The ride through rolling farm country was
enjoyable. But after finally arriving in Montevideo and arranging
my return trip, I had only 45 minutes to explore a city of 3
million people. I started on foot but soon switched to a cab. The
driver, a friendly fellow named Roberto who had relatives in
Trenton, N.J., whisked me past the Plaza Independencia and a blur
of stately buildings before dropping me off at the bus station with
two minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to do it over, I might try a package deal to
Montevideo I saw advertised on returning to Buenos Aires. The round
trip by hydrofoil, including a bus tour of the city and lunch, cost
$79. That's about the same as my boat-bus-taxi combo and would have
allowed me to see a lot more of Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
   South of downtown Buenos Aires lies the rough and colorful port
neighborhood of La Boca (Spanish for ``The Mouth''). Tourists are
warned to be wary there because of the crime. It is known as home
to some of the city's poorest residents, and the crumbling concrete
dwellings I passed, with mounds of trash and chickens pecking in
the dirt, seemed to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   In the harbor at La Boca were rusting hulks of abandoned vessels
and some extremely foul-looking water. But less than half a mile
away, the waterfront improved dramatically. With a rebuilt quay and
benches for visitors, this was a pleasant attraction for weekend
strollers and artists painting harbor scenes from behind their
easels.
</P>
<P>
   This part of La Boca has become more commercial, with pushcart
vendors and street performers like the ones found in Harvard Square
or Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The buildings are colorfully
idiosyncratic, and bars and restaurants invite you in for a drink,
meal, or tango performance. The tango is said to have taken hold in
the brothels of La Boca early in the century when it was disdained
by polite society in Buenos Aires. Only after it became the rage in
Europe did it come back to Argentina and gain a measure of
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   On my last night I went with a group to Bar Sur on the
recommendation of an acquaintance who said it offered a taste of
the tango as enjoyed by ordinary residents. The cozy club, whose
walls are decorated with old masks and posters, is located on a
deserted street in a once-fashionable neighborhood. Instead of the
stage show and full meal offered by some of the glitzier, more
tourist-oriented establishments, it charges a $15 cover that
includes two slices of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The two hours we were there started with a female singer belting
out ballads to the accompaniment of a piano. Then came two dancers,
a man and a woman, who tangoed with a finesse that was intricate
and acrobatic _ and very sexy. The dancing only fell flat when, as
advertised, the pair invited this writer and other members of the
audience for an on-the-spot tango lesson. My instructor quickly
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   It was an enjoyable end to my Buenos Aires sojourn. Residents
told me to return when the weather was warmer _ December or
January, for example _ and I had time to see the rest of Argentina.
Indeed, I had barely begun to know the country. I sucked mate tea,
the national drink, through a straw. The closest I came to a gaucho
was the head waiter in a funny hat at La Estancia restaurant. But I
saw enough to know I want to come back.

   There's only one problem with fall foliage drives.
</P>
<P>
   It's that last word: drives. If you've got your eyes on winding
roads and your fingers wrapped around a steering wheel, let's face
it, you're not spending much time looking at those 70-foot-tall
bouquets of orange, red, and yellow leaves. And if the leaf-peeping
traffic is bumper to bumper, so much the worse.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an alternative. You can return to the past and
leave the driving to the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it was railroads that in the middle of the last
century opened up northern New England to tourism. So what better
way to experience the quintessential aspect of northern New
England's scenery _ its fall plumage _ than by train?
</P>
<P>
   The railroads made the most dramatic regions of northern New
England, with their notches and peaks, accessible to city dwellers,
``turning the region inside out,'' writes Dona Brown in ``Inventing
New England,'' her study of 19th-century tourism here.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, and for at least two more, there are rail
excursions into the peaks and notches of New Hampshire and the
hills and valleys of Vermont _ just as the oaks and maples are
turning their brightest. And closer to Boston, there are rail
excursions west to the Berkshires and, south of the city, along the
route of the Blackstone River and through the timeless cranberry
bogs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some options:

with 55-minute round trips from North Conway to Conway and 1
3/4-hour round trips from North Conway to Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   This route follows the Mount Washington Valley aboard a restored
1898 Pullman car with wicker and rattan chairs, mahogany woodwork,
and an open observation platform. Coach fares for the Conway trip
are $8.50, and for the Bartlett trip $14.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Notch train runs daily through Oct. 15, with 5 1/2-hour
round trips between Conway and Fabyan Station. This route travels
through Crawford Notch on tracks sliced into the sides of the White

</P>
<P>
   Northern New England foliage may be past its peak by mid-month
but in full color in southern New England for the Blackstone Valley

farmlands, with woodlands on all sides. There will be narrators on
board pointing out the sights along the way _ many of them
associated with the beginnings of America's Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The trip leaves Cumberland, R.I., at 10 a.m. and returns at 2
p.m. Tickets are $32 a person. For information and reservations,

Springfield en route to Pittsfield _ on the Mystic Valley Railroad
Society's annual Berkshire Limited Fall Foliage Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   The route runs through the hilly country of Western
Massachusetts, passing through Huntington, Chester, Becket, and
Dalton, and up the Westfield River Gorge.

Tuesday that it might relax its one-child policy and pledged a new
``historical leap'' to further restrict its birth rate. Meeting at
the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, officials of the
world's most populous country said the next leap in birth control
would be an attempt to bring a zero growth in China's population by
the mid-21st century. Their objective is stabilize China's

India will have become the most populous nation on the globe.

MICKEY'S IN A PARTY MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to Mickey Mouse: He knows how to throw a
party that really lasts. The one now going on at Walt Disney
World's Epcot will run through Year 2000, which is the reason for
all the festivity.
</P>
<P>
   A giant version of Mickey's four-fingered hand, gripping a
116-foot-tall wand, can be found next to the Florida park's
Spaceship Earth sphere. That's appropriate, because the theme of
this salute to Y2K is ``Celebrate the Future Hand in Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The party, which began Oct. 1, includes: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Tapestry of Nations. This dramatic parade features more than
120 larger-than-life, futuristic-looking puppets, 32 drummers
aboard 16 rolling percussion stages, and a lot more in a
twice-daily pageant around Epcot's World Showcase Lagoon. Why, the
puppets may even shake hands with you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --IllumiNations 2000: Reflections on Earth. Calling this a
fireworks show is like calling the Taj Mahal a tomb: It just
doesn't do it justice. Each nightly presentation uses 2,800 shells
_ more than twice the number used in previous productions. Music
soars and a great globe of the earth spins slowly on the lagoon. A
fountain barge pumps 5,000 gallons of water a minute. A
150,000-pound ``inferno barge'' uses 37 nozzles to shoot flames
skyward. Lasers crisscross the sky. Walls of flame and a giant
torch climb 40 feet above the lagoon. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Millennium Village. Located in the park's World Showcase
section, this 65,000-square-foot ``village'' houses hundreds of
entertainers, artisans, and storytellers, with exhibits
representing more than two dozen countries, the United Nations, and
the World Bank, proving that it's, er, a small world after all.
There are games, such as miniature golf in the Scotland exhibit,
and regional foods, too. (The village was not without controversy;
even before it opened, Arab and Muslim groups objected to some
aspects of the Israel exhibit.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Leave a Legacy. Guests, for a price, can leave their mark on
the park. Their photos are etched on metallic tile, then mounted on
one of 30 sculptured monoliths near Spaceship Earth. And for
collectors and traders, limited-edition souvenir pins are sold
throughout Epcot. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Innoventions. This preview of the latest products and
technologies has been thoroughly revamped, with companies such as
Motorola, Honeywell, IBM, and AT&AMP;T joining in. You can, for
instance, see high-tech TVs, watch a computer type what a person
speaks, and participate in interactive exhibits. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Millennium Dreamers. The extraordinary contributions of 2,000
young people from around the world will be celebrated May 8-10,
courtesy of McDonald's and the Walt Disney Co. Youngsters ages 8-15
are eligible, and those chosen will be flown to the event, along
with a parent or guardian. Nomination forms are available in
schools and several other places, including www.disney.com and
www.mcdonalds.com.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information on Walt Disney World, call 407-W-DISNEY,
visit www.disneyworld.com, or see a travel agent. And if you
haven't been to Epcot in a while, check out the reworked and
renamed Journey into Your Imagination attraction and the wild Test
Track ride.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Walt Disney World encompasses (a) 350 acres, (b)
3,500 acres, (c) 30,500 acres, or (d) 350,000 acres. (Answer at end
of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Disney World has acquired by now something of the air
of a national shrine. American parents who don't take their
children there sense obscurely that they have failed in some
fundamental way, like Muslims who never made it to Mecca'' _
British journalist Simon Hoggart. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: A men's room at the Animal Kingdom offers visitors a
``Whiz Quiz'' about the ``watering'' habits of elephants, rhinos,
and tapirs. Enough said. Too much, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Fast, in more ways than one: The new Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at
Disney-MGM Studios launches riders 0-60 m.p.h. in just 2.8 seconds
as the music of Boston's own Aerosmith blares from speakers within
the limousine-shaped cars. What's more, the coaster is one of the
popular rides that uses the new FASTPASS system during peak
seasons. Instead of waiting in line (and you know how long those
waits can sometimes be), guests have the option of inserting their
theme park admission tickets into a turnstile, which gives them a
FASTPASS and the time they should return to the ride. When that
time comes, they go to the ride's FASTPASS entrance and then, with
little or no wait, to the attraction's pre-show or boarding area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the menu: The entrance to the Jungle Cruise ride in the Magic
Kingdom displays an imaginative (and imaginary) lunch menu for the
crew. Among the items: fricasse of giant stag beetle, barbecued
three-toed skink, and filet of rock python. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel bookshelf: ``PassPorter: Walt Disney World'' (Spread the
Word Press, $19.95) by Jennifer Watson and Dave Marx is a travel
guide, trip planner, organizer, journal, and souvenir, all in one.
In addition to information on the park and advice on planning
(accompanied by worksheets), the guide contains 11 organizer
pockets. Vacationers can write their itinerary on the front of each
day's pocket and store maps, tickets, brochures, and receipts
inside. On the back of the pocket, you can write down your memories
of the day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big bucks for a big celebration: If you want to celebrate the
arrival of Year 2000 in style, The Walt Disney World Swan and
Dolphin hotel complex is offering a seven-night family package

A MAN WHO REACHED THE HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Come sky with me!'' could well be the lyric of David
Breashears, who climbs higher than some airplanes fly.
</P>
<P>
   If Breashears were a social climber, his picture would be on the
cover of People and Vanity Fair. But the only thing I'd climb with
him, maybe, is an escalator, or to the top row of the Museum of
Science's theater the next time they run his superbly chilling IMAX
flick, ``Everest.'' I have to wear thermal underwear every time I
watch it, fearing frostbite, in high anxiety while vicariously
clambering across crevasses on shaky ladders amid shimmering,
teetering glacial high-rises in the Khumbu Icefall.
</P>
<P>
   But anywhere mountain-climbing David Breashears goes I want to
climb through the pages of the books he writes about it. Why would
I read a Breashears book? Not ``because it is there.'' That might
have been the rationale of his hero, George Mallory, who famously
said the same about that harrowing Himalayan hump, Everest, where
he spent his final hours in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   No, but because I savor Breashears' descriptions of his and
others' travails in the world's most altitudinous and dangerous
neighborhoods where breath is short and life isn't much longer if
you take the misjudged step or strategy. His handsomely illustrated
material reads as beautifully as the mountains themselves.
Breashears, who hangs in Boston when he isn't hanging precariously
from his fingertips at some remote, and freezing pinnacle
elsewhere, has hit the literary double this year.
</P>
<P>
   First, his autobiography, ``High Exposure,'' a brilliant
portrait of himself and upscale mountaineering, came out last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   And now appearing, ``Last Climb: The Legendary Everest
Expeditions of George Mallory'' follows closely on the discovery of
Mallory's body near the summit last May. Seventy-five years after
his third try for the top, Mallory was outed by winds that
dispersed a snowy coverup, his body intact but frozen stiff. ``Last
Climb,'' written in collaboration with Audrey Salkeld, a noted
English authority on Mallory and Everest, grippingly introduces you
to the fascinating Edwardian-era adventurer and his courageous
onslaughts on the stormy, deadly Himalayan gargantua. Salkeld
brings out the humanity of bold but gentle Mallory. Breashears
covers the expeditions and mountaineering. Their teamwork comes
close to solving the mystery of what happened to 37-year-old
Mallory and his 22-year-old climbing partner, fellow Briton Andrew
Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' says Breashears, ``not quite. And it probably never
will be solved. I doubt that Irvine will be found. The real mystery
is Irvine's camera. Might it be found containing film proving that
he and Mallory actually made the summit _ 29 years before Ed
Hillary and Tenzing Norgay! _ and were descending when they
probably fell?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the camera, as elusive as the Maltese Falcon. But the search
and speculation will go on, as for Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa,
Whitey Bulger, D. B. Cooper, and innumerable deadbeat dads. The
most recent hunt, commissioned by PBS's ``Nova,'' paid off in the
finding of Mallory, as described in a Breashears chapter by
producer Liesl Clark. It will result in the show's ``Lost on
Everest'' documentary Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Breashears says, ``I doubt they made it all the way up. A long
shot, but . . . anyway . . . the try cost them their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unusual on Everest, bearing a tantalizing reputation as a
killer peak, a place Breashears knows well and with which he feels
``a kinship.'' A frequent communicant, he respects the killer,
listens to it, and obeys when Everest moans blusteringly: ``This
playground isn't big enough for both of us _ go home!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing when to quit and turn around is so important. It may
take more courage to do that, when your goal is so close, than
plodding ahead, feeling your willpower will get you to the top,''
says this man who has stood at the icy apogee of the planet four
times, yet insists, ``I'm no daredevil.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the seemingly easygoing Breashears for the first time,
you might not sense being in the presence of one of the universe's
greater, inner-driven athletes. He looks healthy enough, a wiry man
of 43 with gray-flecked dark hair, yet somehow unimposing at
5-foot-10, 160 pounds. Then you notice long arms, big hands, very
long fingers _ the better to grasp insignificant lips of rock and
pull himself up an unfriendly bare face.
</P>
<P>
   And those vivid blue eyes, which have seen places viewed by few
others, tell you he's ever ready to charge, on hand and foot,
closer to heaven than believed possible before New Zealander
Hillary and the local Sherpa, Norgay, conquered the 29,028-foot
crest above Nepal and Tibet in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mark McGwire of the mountaineering game, Breashears
ascends Everestian heights blithely. A pitcher hanging a curve to
McGwire might get knocked out of a game. If Breashears hangs a
wrong turn, he gets knocked out of the game. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that's what his icon, Mallory, did ``at about 28,000
feet,'' Breashears feels. ``Both he and Irvine. Roped together.''
</P>
<P>
   Breashears writing about Mallory is something like McGwire doing
a book on Babe Ruth. And with many-sided Breashears you throw in
his film-making prowess (``next project, next year, Mount
Kilimanjaro in Africa''), athleticism, and his gallantry under
extreme pressure in 1996. He and colleague Ed Veisturs were
completing the IMAX film when the vicious storm hit, killing eight
climbers and two accomplished guides from separate expeditions, as
chronicled in Jon Krakauer's best-seller, ``Into Thin Air.''
Breashears and Veisturs and their Sherpas sprang to the rescue of
several of the stranded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much drive and ambition can get you killed,'' said
Breashears. ``Making it to the top isn't the success; it's getting
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once has Breashears been gripped by ``pure fear'' on the
Big E. Four years ago he was swept away in a snowy avalanche. ``I'm
going _ and I'm going to be ground beef,'' he remembers thinking.
``But it happened so fast. Somehow my rope held and I popped out on
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was enough that time. I listened to the mountain and went
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Belief in himself, his preparation and organization, a carefully
planned and hard-earned apprenticeship, the lonely experiences
spread over nearly two decades of getting high on rocks, and
``unlocking their secrets'' has kept fear at bay for Breashears,
long one of the elite.
</P>
<P>
   An itinerant Army brat, living here and there, he began
ascending in Wyoming and Colorado, and would write: ``I'd always
experienced an almost blissful sense of detachment on climbs where
mistakes had grim consequences. In moments of jeopardy the senses
become narrowed and focused. Only the language of survival is
engaged, all other dialogue stops. Your physical and psychic energy
are tightly constrained and conserved, carefully directed, bringing
about a clarity, a belief in your preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the high-priced guided ascents with plenty of support
troops, fixed ropes in demanding places, lots of oxygen,
``Mountaineering 101 with no `journey' behind it. By that I mean,
suppose you could pay somebody $65,000 for the privilege of hitting
a home run in the World Series. That wouldn't make you a baseball
player whose `journey' has meant playing catch with parents, kids'
games, high school team, the minor leagues. Of course these people
can get in needless trouble.'' And do all the time.
</P>
<P>
   No longer an exclusive address, the globe's penthouse was almost
mythical in Mallory's day. The natives, calling it Chomolungma
(Goddess Mother of the Land), told him that nobody but their gods
had experienced the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``No European had ever been here,'' he wrote to his wife, Ruth,
back in England with their three young children. ``We are
penetrating a secret.'' He described Everest as ``a prodigious
white fang excrescent from the jaw of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The fang would impale him one day, but not before he captivated
imaginations everywhere with his fortitude and intelligence on
quests into the unknown. Outdoors guy Mallory, a schoolteacher
hooked on heights _ literate, cultivated, daring, good-humored _
would be pleased to find similar characteristics in his tracker,
Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   ``What men Mallory and those other early climbers were,'' says
Breashears. ``Men for a pantheon. Imagine the long boat and train
trips just to get into position in India. Their equipment seems so
primitive to us, and their knowledge of the mountain and
high-altitude medicine almost nonexistent. Wool and cotton clothes
. . . hobnail boots _ still on Mallory. It was something like
asking tennis players in the 1920s with their wooden rackets and
inferior strings to go onto Centre Court today against guys with
high-tech rackets. Though not as perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know,'' he says with a smile, ``maybe lack of
knowledge was, in a way, advantageous. Everest hadn't built up its
killer name of today. They knew little of apoxia _ altitude
sickness _ and couldn't have imagined our sophisticated oxygen,
ladders, Gore-tex clothing, communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mallory and Irvine were from a time of great spirit and honor,
self-confident Englishmen of the Empire who felt they would just
march up that hill because of who they were _ and darned near did,
despite all the odds against. The Mallory spirit was
unquenchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Breashears', too. When you talk high-fives to this athlete _
shouldn't he play 29028 in the lottery? _ you get these spires:
``Everest; Peak Pobedy, 24,500 feet in Kazakhstan; Nameless Tower,
20,000 in Pakistan; Ama Dablam, 22,494; and Kwangde, both near
Everest. Those are the five greatest I've climbed.''
</P>
<P>
   But his toughest?
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlandishly difficult Himalayan winter ice climb of
Kwangde. Not a big peak: 19,720, but the north face is 4,500 feet
of steep ice and rock. No camps on the way like Everest. We _ Jeff
Lowe and I _ went straight up with 40-pound packs. Four bivouacs.''
It meant sleeping like sausages, bunched in hammocks, hanging above
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was baptized in the snows of Everest. I felt young,
invincible, even arrogant. But it was only the start of a journey
to self-knowledge, humility, feeling a small piece in the universe
among natural forces beyond my control.''
</P>
<P>
   So, an Everest encore? ``I've told myself never again,'' he says
with a grin. ``I don't need the summit again. . . but I didn't
climb the northeast ridge like Mallory. I'd like to follow him up,
for a while anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, on a Himalayan trek, I glimpsed majestic Chomolungma, at
some distance. Close enough. My friends, Aurelio and Bwana Jack,
have gotten as high as her base camp, 17,600. But because it is
there, I'm just as glad to be here with Breashears' books.

GETTING WHAT THEY PAID FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. may need to buy more
insurance for itself, to cover such disasters as the one that
heavily damaged this Illinois-based company last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although State Farm saw it coming, prepared for it, and
staunchly fought against it, the insurer was still hit with more
than $1 billion in actual and punitive damages over the use of
after-market parts in auto-body repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this disaster could be deemed one of State Farm's
own doing, if the expected appeal upholds the judge's and the
jury's awards to State Farm policyholders. Both concluded State
Farm deceived policyholders about the quality of the replacement
parts it required body shops to use in repairs. The jury originally
awarded $456 million to the policyholders, or plaintiffs, in the
class-action suit, believed to be the largest ever leveled against
an insurance firm, in this case the nation's largest auto insurer.
Last week circuit Judge John Speroni increased that award, adding
$130 million in actual damages and $600 million in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, which has announced it will appeal both verdicts,
emphatically denies committing any fraud, maintaining the judge and
jury ignored the evidence it presented at trial, and that it
complied with laws and regulations in every state.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the policyholders who brought the suit
claimed the parts State Farm required body shops to use were simply
not as good as original parts made for automakers. They argued
after-market or generic parts, which are based on manufacturers'
original parts but made without access to factory specifications,
were used on the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury agreed with the plaintiffs, Speroni himself ruled
that State Farm violated Illinois consumer fraud law by using
substandard parts and hiding that fact from customers. Instead, the
judge further ruled, State Farm's brochures to customers called the
parts a high-quality, low-cost alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 memo introduced by the plaintiffs' lawyers, a State
Farm executive wrote ``We may well say it is like kind and quality,
but the bottom line is that it is not the same.'' Lawyers for State
Farm argued that such memos were taken out of context, and that
they should have been taken as evidence of the firm's efforts to
improve the quality of after-market parts. This argument apparently
did not fly with the judge or the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plaintiffs sought nearly $4 billion in actual and
punitive damages, their lawyers expressed satisfaction with the
$1.19 billion award, made to those policyholders who filed claims
between July 1994 and February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, the jury and judge agreed that the
insurer had failed to restore customers' cars to their preaccident
conditions. According to the verdict, an estimated 4.7 million
current and former policyholders who could have claims against
State Farm would be awarded an average of $100 each. But it was
unclear last week how many consumers would collect awards.
</P>
<P>
   Among body-shop owners, auto insurance companies, and consumers,
the debate is still raging over whether the judge and jury awards,
especially the amounts, were warranted. Insurance industry analysts
suggest these verdicts could result in an increase in both
insurance premiums and the cost of auto-body repairs if they are
not overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto-body repairmen, in e-mails sent to MSNBC, said the
verdict was justified. One repairman said during his years of
repairing autos he found most after-market body replacement parts
were less than acceptable and that rust and corrosion protection is
not even close to that of original parts. He argued that if the
jury had been a panel of auto-body repairmen, the trial would have
been over in a few hours with much higher monetary awards, saving
the taxpayers time and money. In this world, he added, ``you always
get what you pay for. You want cheap, that's what you will get.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt insurance companies other than State Farm might be at
least a bit concerned about the awards, knowing their policyholders
might suspect similar treatment and move legally in the same
direction as State Farm policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of State Farm's appeal, there was no doubt
that the total judgment against the company was a shot across the
bow of all such insurance companies that may be engaging in similar
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, State Farm apparently got what it paid for: cheaper,
lesser-quality parts at lower cost. But policyholders apparently
did not get what they paid for: good as original body parts. That's
why the jury felt, and the judge even more so, that with this award
the policyholders got what was coming to them and State Farm got
what it deserved.

6 BILLION AND COUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
 WARSH-COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday is the day the United Nations has chosen to declare that
the human population of the Earth has reached 6 billion. To get
some idea of what this means, go to the Web site of the United
Nations Fund for Population activities (www.unfpa.org) and watch
the population clock register the rate at which new souls are being
added to our numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you like, order a copy of the 80-page State of the World
Population Report from the UN. World population is growing at the
rate of around 78 million annually, it says; a little less than the
total population of Germany is being added every year.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, a new film, ``Six Billion and Beyond,'' by
independent filmmaker Linda Harrar, packs a great deal of
understanding into the subject. (It, too, has a Web site,
www.sixbillionandbeyond.org.)
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in six countries _ Mexico, Kenya, India, China, Italy,
and the United States _ ``Six Billion and Beyond'' was supported by
the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. It makes indelibly clear
the expectational nature of the problem. What happens next depends
on the extremely local outlook in many faraway places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of all those now living are under 25,'' says Harrar.
``What they decide as they reach reproductive age will determine
what the world of the next century will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have either 7 billion or 9 billion or 11 billion
people, based on the decisions that they make.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the low, high, and median projections of global
population in 2050 by the Population Division of the UN Department
of Economic and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   What do we know about the immensely complicated process summed
up in the deceptively simple phrase ``the demographic transition''?
Only the broad outlines of the process are clear.
</P>
<P>
   World population has soared chiefly because people stopped dying
as quickly. Since 1950, the death rate has been cut in half, thanks
to basic sanitation, clean drinking water, and modern health care.
Some 52 million people still die each year, or about the same
number as died in 1950. But the population is twice the size it was
then.
</P>
<P>
   As longevity has increased and development spread, fertility has
been dropping in the richer nations. In Europe, population is
shrinking, as fertility has fallen from 2.6 children per woman in
1950 to 1.4 today. In the United States and Canada, population has
more or less leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America and Asia have seen dramatic declines in fertility.
Less remarkable reductions are reported in North Africa and the
Middle East. Sub-Saharan Africa fertility is still very high by
modern standards: 5.5 children per woman today, down from 6.5 50
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is no magic bullet. Among the palliatives are better
health care, more education, broader job opportunities (especially
for women), and wide distribution of family planning techniques.
Trade now is generally recognized as the most efficient carrier of
these broader opportunities. Presumably those who want fewer people
and a cleaner environment generally should encourage trade and
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The big discovery in recent years has been just how great the
power of technology is to raise living standards and fend off dire
Malthusian consequences of ``overpopulation.'' Doomsday predictions
of the sort associated with Paul Erlich and the ``Club of Rome''
have gone out of style.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that overpopulation is nothing to worry about,
as some shallow optimists have concluded. Concepts such as
``carrying capacity'' and the ``ecological footprint'' of a given
population are painstakingly being worked out by ecologists,
economists, and others.
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations become especially complicated when the
propensity to global warming and the adequacy of local water
supplies are factored in. Some truly nasty surprises may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to proceed is cautiously _ with more research, and
heightened sensitivity to the causes and consequences of population
growth. The difference between 7 billion and 11 billion is too
important to leave to individual despair.

<P>
   Half a decade ago, FairMarket Inc. founder and chief executive
Scott Randall was selling laundry detergent for Procter &AMP; Gamble. A
couple of years ago, he was selling computer parts. Today, Randall
is trying to sell everything.
</P>
<P>
   His company, based in Woburn, Mass., has emerged as a major
force in the booming Internet auction business and a serious
challenger to the dominance of auction leader eBay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you'll never purchase a set of golf clubs or Beanie Babies
from FairMarket, at least not directly. Rather than compete
directly with eBay, FairMarket works behind the scenes. The company
has won contracts to host its auctions on dozens of popular Web
sites. If you bid on merchandise on the Microsoft Network's auction
service, or offer something for sale at the Lycos or Excite search
portals, you're really using FairMarket's auction service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as a private-label eBay,'' Randall says.
</P>
<P>
   For now, FairMarket carries only around 100,000 items, far fewer
than the 3 million or so listed at eBay. But Randall is aiming for
rapid growth by weaving all of the auctions hosted by FairMarket
into a single network of wheeling and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Boston.com is one of the FairMarket sites. If a
reader decides to auction off a set of golf clubs using the
Boston.com auction service, his item will also be available to
potential buyers on every other site that has a FairMarket auction.
So if a Microsoft Network user wants to bid on golf clubs, he'll
see the clubs listed at the Boston.com auction. In effect, it'll be
one big auction, spread across about 100 Web sites, which between
them attract 46 million visitors a month. That's almost six times
more monthly visitors than eBay attracts. (Boston.com and The
Boston Globe are both owned by The New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove shrugs off the FairMarket
challenge. ``eBay users are pretty smart people,'' he said. ``We
know that they're going to keep their eyes and their ears open and
they're going to go where they can get the very best value.''
Pursglove predicts eBay's loyal users will keep the company out in
front.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Rothberg, who studies Internet auctions for Gomez Advisors
Inc. in Lincoln, thinks Pursglove's confidence is justified. ``EBay
is still the biggest and the best, period,'' she says. But she
warns that the FairMarket network could take business from other
independent auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Randall holds an even sterner view. ``Our take on the
industry,'' he says, ``is that stand-alone sites that are
non-networked are doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was exactly the business Randall had in mind when he
founded FairMarket in 1997 _ a stand-alone Internet auction site,
specializing in computer products.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest career change for a self-described action
junkie. The Harvard alumnus and Harvard Business School graduate
made his mark as a brand manager for Procter &AMP; Gamble, the same
training ground that produced America Online Inc. chief executive
Steve Case.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, peddling Dreft and Oxydol detergents began to lose
its appeal. ``Detergents are fine, but they're pretty boring,''
said Randall. ``I love a million things going on at once, nonstop
challenges . . . that's not what you get at Procter &AMP; Gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall knew it was time to bail in 1994, when he got a look at
Mosaic, the first popular Internet browser. ``That's where it's
at,'' he told himself. Randall foresaw that the industries that
would grow up around the Internet would need the kind of marketing
skill he'd learned at P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   His first move was to NECX Direct, of Peabody, Mass. In those
days, NECX was mainly a computer parts broker, operating an
electronic exchange on which manufacturers could bid on bulk orders
of chips and hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But NECX founder Henry Bertolon wanted to branch out. In 1993,
he'd begun an Internet-based service for selling computer parts and
supplies. Randall believed it could be the foundation of a major
electronic retail business.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years, Randall built the NECX on-line store
into a successful on-line enterprise. ``We were the largest Web
site in the world at the time I was running it,'' he claims.
</P>
<P>
   But when he left NECX to work for Barry Diller's Internet
Shopping Network, NECX sued, citing a non-compete agreement Randall
had signed. ``They'd sued about 30 people before, and they never
won a lawsuit,'' said Randall. ``They won this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall worked on Yahoo Inc.'s e-commerce business unit for a
few months, but by late 1996 he wanted to leave Silicon Valley and
return to the Bay State. The next year, he founded FairMarket in
his Beacon Hill apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company was just another auction site, selling
computer parts, but Randall soon had a change of heart. ``I came to
the conclusion that auctions were going to be on everybody's site,
and consumers were going to go where they were already going.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of trying to persuade Internet users to visit his
auction site, Randall decided to carry his auctions to where the
users were, striking deals with well-established sites to run
auctions for them. FairMarket gets a fee for running the auction on
its own server computers and a 1 percent cut of the selling price
of auctioned items. The Web sites that offer the auctions get a
popular new feature that can attract more traffic to their sites
and increase the prices the sites can charge to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a good deal to FairMarket partners including
Charles Conn, chief executive of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch
Inc. His company already has CityAuction, a service that runs
regional auctions targeted at communities throughout the country.
But Conn thinks FairMarket will help him maximize the number of
items for sale and the number of shoppers who might buy. ``People
want to go to the place where the most goods are, and posters want
to post where the most people are,'' Conn says.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors' Rothberg doubts that people who go to
Ticketmaster Online for concert tickets will stick around for
auctions. But if even a small percentage of visitors to FairMarket
sites participate in the auctions, that'll quickly add up to
millions of users _ enough for a very healthy business indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Randall says FairMarket itself is not for sale to some larger
entity. ``Lots of companies are interested, but it's not our
path.'' Randall's more the initial public offering type _ ``We're
going down that path right now, and talking to bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   With FairMarket's potential as a leader in e-commerce, the day
its stock goes public could be the biggest auction of them all.

   BBN-METS-BRAVES (Atlanta) _ Mets at Atlanta, 8:12 p.m. What is
life after death like? Check out the Mets. They came to Atlanta
three weeks ago hoping to beat out the Braves for the NL East

Olney.

</P>
<P>
   WINE-YATTARNA (Nuriootpa, Australia) _ The project lasted more
than six years, and it cost at least $1 million. But it produced a
fitting white stable mate for Grange, Australia's superstar red
wine. The newcomer is called Yattarna, after an Aboriginal word
meaning ``little by little,'' and it has added new luster to the
already sterling reputation of South Australia as a world-class
producer of premium wines. (Eds: First in an En Route series.) By
R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   OLD-COOKBOOKS (Undated) _ Cookbooks pose an unusual problem:
Their true value can only be determined over time. I rarely refer
to cookbooks that have been published in the last couple of years.
And an informal survey of experienced home cooks, food writers,
cookbook editors and authors and bookstore owners and buyers
indicated that my experience is anything but unique. By Mark
Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes, sidebar OLD-COOKBOOKS-LIST, on runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   FULLY-COMMITTED (New York) _ ``Fully Committed,'' a one-man
play, has touched a nerve. Packed houses suggest that there are few
dishes tastier, for present-day New Yorkers, than the stew of
pretension, duplicity, avarice and cruelty bubbling under the lid
of a four-star Manhattan restaurant, and few spectacles funnier
than seeing themselves in hot, panting pursuit of a reservation.
Critic's Notebook by William Grimes.

   GRAPE-LEAVES (Undated) _ Cooking with another product of the
vine: grape leaves. By Melissa Clark. With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   GOAT-CHEESE (San Francisco) _ A new generation of goat cheeses
has inspired chefs here to create new distinctive dishes. By
Jeannette Ferrary. With recipes.

<P>
   The voice at the other end of the line sounds cautious. Madame
Durell gets all sorts of crank calls, from people shopping around
for false breasts or lingerie in men's sizes, or from voyeurs like
me.
</P>
<P>
   Some desperate souls will stop at nothing to take a peek inside
Madame Durell's decadent villa in Spandau.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials established, I ring the bell at the gate of the
International School of Travesty. An alsatian growls menacingly,
the front door opens, and Madame Durell stands on the threshold. He
squeezes my hand firmly.
</P>
<P>
   The place looks like the high-class brothel it is rumored to be
in the neighborhood: tasteful antique furniture at ground level and
an all-marble interior straight out of Pompeii down below. At the
far end of the pool in the basement stands a mini-jungle of plastic
palm trees, backing on to one of the establishment's many walls of
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will spend hours ogling their reflections, watching
their shapes, movements and mannerisms slowly transcend the
boundary of gender.
</P>
<P>
   It takes four months to turn a willing male into a passable
female, at least in outward appearance. Four months and Dm35,000
(nearly $20,000). That's how much the course in travesty costs, at
the end of which successful students receive a state-recognized
diploma from Madame Durell, a chartered travesty pedagogue.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a serious educational establishment. On
Berlin's bustling variety scene, travesty is regarded as one of the
highest forms of art, and Madame Durell, who goes by the name of
Sascha Nowak-Tarnawa in his passport, as one of its greatest
exponents.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, he says, boasts more registered travesty artists _ some
620 _ than any other city in the world. And while New York has its
transvestite school and Amsterdam a school for transsexuals, his is
the only establishment in the world dedicated to the noble art of
cross-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone understands the school's true mission. ``We have
women aged between 50 and 65 who want to learn striptease for the
benefit of their husbands,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa is the old-fashioned type. He does not believe
in ``using the human body _ male or female _ for entertainment,
unless it's in the cultural context.''
</P>
<P>
   And his standards are rigorous: only art of the most sublime is
to be pursued on his premises. ``We have an entrance exam. When we
find out that the applicant is just a drag queen, he has to go,''
says Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he admits the school gets all sorts. One of the
star pupils is a 74-year-old blind psychoanalyst _ happily married
_ who is here to find out what makes women click. He is only doing
the dance part of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten, a 27-year-old waiter, is signed up for the full Monty.
He is unsure whether dressing up as a woman is his real calling,
but he loves playing roles, especially the role of women. Today is
Torsten's first day at Madame Durell's school. He is excited, and a
little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   We take the elevator up to Madame Durell's boudoir: yet more
marble, gilded taps, exquisite robes hanging in the wardrobe, among
them an embroidered folk costume from Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa's native
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten's first lesson is makeup. He picks out the longest false
eyelashes, applies the foundation with care, but is a little
overexuberant with the lipstick. An hour passes, and Torsten is
still not ready.
</P>
<P>
   We chat as he applies the brush strokes and plucks his eyebrows.
He worked on a cruise liner for two years, scraping the pennies
together for the course.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say it was his life's ambition to go around dressed
in women's clothes, and nor was the family terribly excited about
his further education. ``My mother was taken aback at first, but
now she is more relaxed and says: `If that's what makes you happy,
go ahead.'''
</P>
<P>
   His friends think it is a great idea. ``But I know there is a
lot of work ahead of me.'' More, maybe, than he had reckoned with.
From the makeup room, Torsten goes to the room next to the swimming
pool for a singing lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Standing ramrod straight, feet spread out next to the keyboard
in his black ballet shoes, black trousers with a white line running
down the sides and black sweater, he resembles an overgrown
penguin. Not to worry _ the posture lesson comes later.
</P>
<P>
   Julia, the Polish singing teacher, strikes a few keys. Torsten
has to sing the notes, and he does it well. He has a beautiful
baritone voice, but, alas, cannot rise to the high Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The acting class goes better. Priscilla, an actress from
California who plans to stage deaf cabaret next year in Devon,
England, devises a series of situations for her new student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come through the door, you are a hero,'' she instructs.
Torsten enters, strutting unconvincingly. ``Let's try something
else,'' she says. ``You will now play a queen.'' Torsten obliges,
delicately guiding the imaginary crinoline through the gap of the
door, and this time the illusion works.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the dance floor, with another American teacher,
Donna, in attendance. First Torsten is a chorus girl, wriggling his
hips to the theme song from ``Cabaret.'' You can tell he has done
this sort of thing before. ``He's doing well,'' whispers Priscilla.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is some Mozart, with Torsten, a head taller than his
teacher, led around the floor. It will take a while before he
masters this, but if he turns out to be good, he will get a chance
to dance Flamenco in high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten has worked hard on his first day, and as a reward is
allowed to wear Madame Durell's silk dress.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell four months before graduation, but he looks
promising. ``We still have to work on the style,'' says Mr.
Nowak-Tarnawa. ``But when you know who you are, it will all fall
into place.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The $115 billion that MCI WorldCom has agreed to pay for Sprint,
a rival American long-distance telecoms firm, is a spectacular sum,
albeit in shares rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even world-record-breaking deals no longer seem as exciting
as they once did. And all too often there is little to show that
these mergers will, in the long run, benefit shareholders or, more
important, customers.
</P>
<P>
   By these tests, it is hard to be enthusiastic about this latest
deal either. Recent big mergers in industries from banking to oil
have been driven partly by an outbreak of me-tooism and a frothy
and surprisingly uncritical stock market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, more promisingly, been about an unrelenting
search by big firms for economies of scale. But it is in telecoms
that the action has been most frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The data revolution triggered by the Internet and the explosive
growth of mobile telephones have made previously dull-seeming
utilities appear the acme of techno-glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecoms map of
America has been redrawn. The Baby Bell local phone companies,
created after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, have all but ceased to
exist. In their place stand two supra-regional monsters, SBC in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the East, which have systematically
absorbed their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent Baby Bell left is BellSouth, which entered
the bidding for Sprint with a late offer that MCI WorldCom, with
its more highly rated shares, was easily able to trump. BellSouth
may itself now be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new-look AT&AMP;T, having floundered in its early
attempts to enter local markets, it has bought a big chunk of the
American cable industry in order to gain direct access to
residential customers _ the vital ``last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is MCI WorldCom, which, thanks to the deal-making
of Bernie Ebbers, its boss, has gone from upstart to behemoth in a
little over two years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to see the acquisition of Sprint as just
another mammoth deal, with little effect on competition. Yet to
view this deal complacently would be a mistake. In two respects it
should raise anti-competitive worries inside the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that, if America's second and third
long-distance operators join forces, and there is no significant
fourth firm, competition may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers points out that the merged entity would still have a
smaller market share (just) than AT&AMP;T, that it is only a matter of
time before the two new ``mega-Bells'' are let into the
long-distance market and that new challengers such as Qwest are
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But it may take a few years for the newcomers
to get a national presence in long-distance _ and the scope for
tacit collusion between the big two may be worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Further ahead, the FCC should have another concern. One reason
for the wave of restructuring in American telecoms is the belief
that, to achieve customer ``stickiness'' and generate scale
economies in such areas as billing, operators need to offer a
bundle of at least four services _ long-distance, Internet, local
and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the same trend is visible, as a handful of firms such
as BT and Deutsche Telekom evolve into super-regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only AT&AMP;T, with its cable strategy, and Sprint, with
its Integrated On-demand Network technology, are on the verge of
packaging together such a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has no wireless service, the main reason for its
bid for Sprint; and SBC and Bell Atlantic have no long-distance
presence _ but, one way or another, they soon will. The question is
whether a potential five competing integrated operators should be
trimmed to only four.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom is resigned to appeasing regulators in America and
Europe by disposing of Sprint's Internet-backbone business.
</P>
<P>
   At a pinch, Ebbers might even be willing to sell Sprint's
long-distance network, if that was the price for carrying off
Sprint's mobile operation. But an ``orphaned'' long-distance
network would do little for competition.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, is right to have put Ebbers on
notice that he can expect his deal to be skeptically scrutinized.
Ebbers is sufficiently worried to have raised the spectre of the
rapacious foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not allowed to buy Sprint, he says it will fall into
the hands of Deutsche Telekom. Yet from a competitive perspective,
the German firm would be an ideal owner for Sprint, because it has
money to spend on developing it into a more formidable operator.
</P>
<P>
   The political odds and the weight of Wall Street expectations
are, nevertheless, such that it would take a bold FCC to stop this
deal. And despite the competitive concerns it raises, the telecoms
business is changing so quickly that it is not clear that it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the FCC should consider using this merger as the basis
for a less antagonistic, even if still rigorous, relationship with
the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed now is a ``fast track'' towards achieving the
opening of the local market so as to qualify the Bells for offering
long-distance service. It would involve some compromise on both
sides. But at least that would be a deal that put the customer
first. &QL;

 &HT;    THIS WEEK, TEENS CAN READ 'FOR THE FUN OF IT'
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    With TEEN-LIST sidebar
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are all sorts of spinach-is-good-for-you
justifications for Teens Read Week, which runs from Oct. 17 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   Students who said they read for more than 11 minutes a day did
better than others on recent national tests of reading and writing
skills. As adults, readers tend to get and keep the best jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the three celebrities recruited by librarians and
booksellers to convince teens to find time to read ``for the fun of
it'' don't tout tomes on self-improvement. When asked for their
favorite books, all invoked the pleasure principle, recommending
fiction with gripping plots:
</P>
<P>
   -- World-class figure skater Michelle Kwan liked Arthur Golden's
first novel, ``Memoirs of a Geisha.''
</P>
<P>
   -- WNBA basketball player Rebecca Lobo of the New York Liberty
liked Shel Silverstein's mysterious fable ``The Giving Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   -- NFL football player Tim Dwight of the Atlanta Falcons liked
``all'' of the Clive Cussler novels about swashbuckling adventurer
Dirk Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reluctant'' readers among teenagers present a special
challenge, said writer Diana Texier Herald, chair of a committee of
librarians who sifted through more than 1,000 new books to choose
10 with the greatest appeal to that group of teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that reluctant readers aren't necessarily bad
readers,'' Herald said. ``But it's hard to pick a sure-fire winner
for someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some teens who avoid recreational reading ``had to read
stuff they didn't like for school, so they don't like reading
because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But even avid readers spend less time reading once they reach
their teens. ``In school and after school, they have so much else
going on,'' Herald said.
</P>
<P>
   Her committee of the Young Adult Library Services Association
began months ago to assemble ``top 10 quick picks'' for reluctant
teen readers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's 11 members tested their hunches on
groups of teens, usually from advisory committees at public or
school libraries. Herald's regular advisers include three dozen
boys and girls confined in a detention facility near her home in
Grand Junction, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids there had never read a book before; they
were busy getting into trouble instead of reading,'' she said.
``Now, they're a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other reluctant readers, those youngsters often lean toward
how-to books, adventure stories, short-story collections or graphic
novels, which are thick comic books. Herald said that the detained
youth don't necessarily zero in on the thinnest volumes, since
``sometimes they can only go to the library once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers submitted more than 1,000 books issued between July
1997 and December 1998. Each book was read by at least two
committee members.
</P>
<P>
   The members nominated nearly 300 books. Then, in a series of
votes, they narrowed that down to 46 fiction and 28 non-fiction
books published by 32 different publisher imprints.
</P>
<P>
   All 74 finalists, including the Top 10 list of those titles with
the most votes, are posted on a Web site
(http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklists/99top10quick.html).
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 for reluctant readers runs the gamut from two Star
Wars manuals to a graphic novel about a teenage single mother, and
from an inside look at the pop sensations 'N Sync to a traditional
novel about an obsessive-compulsive 11-year-old who insists on
touching a doorknob and kissing her fingers 33 times whenever she
leaves the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything ties them together, it's that the authors respect
their readers as people who are almost adults, and don't see them
as children,'' Herald said. ``But reading is a personal taste. Few
people would like every one.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that can stand alone as a Teen
Reads Week sidebar follows.)
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of the card-holders at the nation's public
libraries are between the ages of 12 and 18, said Mary Arnold, vice
president of the Young Adults Library Services Association. But
many of the teens she meets at her library in the Cuyahoga county
suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, are working on school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When teens hear that adults want them to read, they think we
mean 'Moby-Dick' or Charles Dickens,'' Arnold said. ``The whole
purpose of Teens Read Week is to get teens to read for fun again.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't even have to start with books, said Clearwater, Fla.,
librarian Jana Fine, president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be magazines, cereal boxes, newspapers, Internet
screens,'' Fine said. ``What we know is that if you manage to get
through middle school without losing your love of reading, you'll
keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about Teens Read Week, and a variety of Top 10 lists for
various types of teen readers, are available on the Internet
(http://www.ala.org/teenread/). (cq)

<P>
   The $115 billion that MCI WorldCom has agreed to pay for Sprint,
a rival American long-distance telecoms firm, is a spectacular sum,
albeit in shares rather than cash.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even world-record-breaking deals no longer seem as exciting
as they once did. And all too often there is little to show that
these mergers will, in the long run, benefit shareholders or, more
important, customers.
</P>
<P>
   By these tests, it is hard to be enthusiastic about this latest
deal either. Recent big mergers in industries from banking to oil
have been driven partly by an outbreak of me-tooism and a frothy
and surprisingly uncritical stock market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also, more promisingly, been about an unrelenting
search by big firms for economies of scale. But it is in telecoms
that the action has been most frantic.
</P>
<P>
   The data revolution triggered by the Internet and the explosive
growth of mobile telephones have made previously dull-seeming
utilities appear the acme of techno-glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the telecoms map of
America has been redrawn. The Baby Bell local phone companies,
created after the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1984, have all but ceased to
exist. In their place stand two supra-regional monsters, SBC in the
West and Bell Atlantic in the East, which have systematically
absorbed their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The only independent Baby Bell left is BellSouth, which entered
the bidding for Sprint with a late offer that MCI WorldCom, with
its more highly rated shares, was easily able to trump. BellSouth
may itself now be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new-look AT&AMP;T, having floundered in its early
attempts to enter local markets, it has bought a big chunk of the
American cable industry in order to gain direct access to
residential customers _ the vital ``last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is MCI WorldCom, which, thanks to the deal-making
of Bernie Ebbers, its boss, has gone from upstart to behemoth in a
little over two years.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to see the acquisition of Sprint as just
another mammoth deal, with little effect on competition. Yet to
view this deal complacently would be a mistake. In two respects it
should raise anti-competitive worries inside the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious is that, if America's second and third
long-distance operators join forces, and there is no significant
fourth firm, competition may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers points out that the merged entity would still have a
smaller market share (just) than AT&AMP;T, that it is only a matter of
time before the two new ``mega-Bells'' are let into the
long-distance market and that new challengers such as Qwest are
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   All that is true. But it may take a few years for the newcomers
to get a national presence in long-distance _ and the scope for
tacit collusion between the big two may be worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Further ahead, the FCC should have another concern. One reason
for the wave of restructuring in American telecoms is the belief
that, to achieve customer ``stickiness'' and generate scale
economies in such areas as billing, operators need to offer a
bundle of at least four services _ long-distance, Internet, local
and wireless.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the same trend is visible, as a handful of firms such
as BT and Deutsche Telekom evolve into super-regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In America, only AT&AMP;T, with its cable strategy, and Sprint, with
its Integrated On-demand Network technology, are on the verge of
packaging together such a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom has no wireless service, the main reason for its
bid for Sprint; and SBC and Bell Atlantic have no long-distance
presence _ but, one way or another, they soon will. The question is
whether a potential five competing integrated operators should be
trimmed to only four.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom is resigned to appeasing regulators in America and
Europe by disposing of Sprint's Internet-backbone business.
</P>
<P>
   At a pinch, Ebbers might even be willing to sell Sprint's
long-distance network, if that was the price for carrying off
Sprint's mobile operation. But an ``orphaned'' long-distance
network would do little for competition.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, Bill Kennard, is right to have put Ebbers on
notice that he can expect his deal to be skeptically scrutinized.
Ebbers is sufficiently worried to have raised the spectre of the
rapacious foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   If he is not allowed to buy Sprint, he says it will fall into
the hands of Deutsche Telekom. Yet from a competitive perspective,
the German firm would be an ideal owner for Sprint, because it has
money to spend on developing it into a more formidable operator.
</P>
<P>
   The political odds and the weight of Wall Street expectations
are, nevertheless, such that it would take a bold FCC to stop this
deal. And despite the competitive concerns it raises, the telecoms
business is changing so quickly that it is not clear that it
should.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the FCC should consider using this merger as the basis
for a less antagonistic, even if still rigorous, relationship with
the Bells.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed now is a ``fast track'' towards achieving the
opening of the local market so as to qualify the Bells for offering
long-distance service. It would involve some compromise on both
sides. But at least that would be a deal that put the customer
first. &QL;

   The soldiers herded hundreds of frightened men, women and
children out of their villages and on to the road. When the people
stopped to rest, planes swooped down to bomb and strafe them.
Panic-striken, the survivors hid in two culverts under a railway
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three days, the soldiers repeatedly fired machine
guns into the huddled mass from both ends of the culvert, killing
another 300 villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Too many such stories have been told this year. However, this
particular atrocity was not committed by Serbs. It was committed by
Americans, or so it is said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident took place in July 1950, when the United States was
fighting to save Korea _ and the Koreans who died _ from communist
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   For years, survivors have sought in vain for an admission of
responsibility by the American government. But now an investigation
by the Associated Press has confirmed the survivors' account with
testimony from old soldiers still haunted by their role in the
killings, and documents showing that they acted under orders.
</P>
<P>
   Shamed by the revelations, the Pentagon has belatedly ordered
its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although not forgivable, the desire of American officials to
ignore the incident is perhaps understandable. It was long ago. The
United States' armed forces are now far more assiduously schooled
in the laws of war than they used to be, and they pride themselves
on avoiding civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Kosovo, Bosnia and Haiti, the lives of American
troops are now more often put at risk protecting civilians than
trying to win all-out wars.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such a plea of mitigation makes even less comprehensible
America's continuing opposition to what could be the single biggest
step towards preventing future massacres _ the creation of a
permanent international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has lobbied hard against the establishment of
such a court, even though dozens of countries, including all
America's NATO allies except Turkey, have indicated that they will
ratify the treaty setting up the court.
</P>
<P>
   America has no principled objection to the idea of supranational
bodies dealing with war crimes. Quite the contrary. It was the
prime mover behind the international criminal tribunals for
Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   It refused to guarantee immunity from prosecution to leaders in
the Bosnian conflict even to get a peace agreement. Along with
Britain and France, it supplied information to the Yugoslav
tribunal that led to the indictment of the Serb leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring some belated justice to Cambodia, it has
actively supported the establishment of an international tribunal
to put Khmer Rouge leaders on trial.
</P>
<P>
   America clearly believes in building a system of international
justice, but on one vital condition: that any such system does not
apply to America itself.
</P>
<P>
   Its initial enthusiasm for a permanent court evaporated when
other countries rightly refused to tie the court's powers to the
veto of the U.N. Security Council, which would have made it a mere
political tool of the great powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, America has pleaded that, as the sole remaining
superpower, its soldiers and officials would be the target of
politically motivated prosecutions, hampering its peacekeeping
efforts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   America's allies have similar concerns, so they have restricted
the powers of the court's prosecutor and given the court the right
to act only if national authorities themselves refuse to
investigate or punish alleged atrocities. This should be enough to
allay American fears.
</P>
<P>
   But the real objection of some officials, and of opponents in
Congress, is more fundamental and even less defensible: they cannot
tolerate any infringement of American sovereignty by an
international body over which the United States does not have
direct control.
</P>
<P>
   Such an absolutist version of sovereignty is rapidly becoming an
anachronism. America blew a huge hole through it by intervening in
Kosovo and bombing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Its frequent denunciations of war crimes and other atrocities
abroad, and its promotion of internationally enforceable rules in
trade and arms control are based on the assumption that absolute
claims to sovereignty are no longer legitimate or useful.
</P>
<P>
   Judged in this context, America's opposition to an international
court is not only hypocritical, but misconceived. Even a superpower
would be safer in a world where the rule of international law stood
some chance of being applied.
</P>
<P>
   And the sad tale from Korea is a reminder that even Americans
sometimes commit war crimes and then try to cover them up. &QL;

trade and arms control are based on the assumption that absolute
claims to sovereignty are no longer legitimate or useful.
</P>
<P>
   Judged in this context, America's opposition to an international
court is not only hypocritical, but misconceived. Even a superpower
would be safer in a world where the rule of international law stood
some chance of being applied.
</P>
<P>
   And the sad tale from Korea is a reminder that even Americans
sometimes commit war crimes and then try to cover them up. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   American voters have ample reason for holding their leaders in
disdain. At best, politicians seem like canny tacticians, twisting
in the gusts of opinion polls and focus groups. At worst, they are
brazen liars. (President Bill Clinton is both.)
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as something of a surprise to remember that America
has one presidential candidate who is not just a politician with
principles, but an authentic war hero. He is Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   It comes as even more of a shock to realize that most voters
don't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hero'' is not too strong a term for McCain. In his recent
book, ``Faith of My Fathers'' (Random House), he writes about
surviving five-and-a-half years in a Vietnamese prisoner-of-war
camp, much of that time spent in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, he carved out for himself a sort of
independence through insubordination _ taunting his captors and
breaking prison rules even at the cost of incurring more
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, McCain refuses to ascribe nobility to his
courage. ``Glory,'' he writes in one passage in his book, ``belongs
to the act of being constant to something greater than yourself, to
a cause, to your principles, to the people on whom you rely, and
who rely on you in return.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination _ sheer guts plus a genuine belief in the
greater good _ would sound unbearably corny in almost any other
politician. But McCain is exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he endure his captivity (and as Bob Dole once
remarked, you tend to accord more respect to someone who spent
five-and-a-half years in a box). But for most of the time it was
voluntary: he refused an offer of early release, saying that those
who had been imprisoned before him should be freed first.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to take punishment for his beliefs has been a
hallmark of McCain's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he defied his own party by proposing a big rise in the
tax on cigarettes that would have penalized some of his party's
biggest corporate donors. Republican leaders killed it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he slammed their $792 billion tax cut as a boondoggle
for special interests (though he voted for it anyway, calculating
that it would be vetoed).
</P>
<P>
   He is still defying them by sponsoring a bill to abolish
``soft-money'' (indirect political contributions not covered by
federal campaign laws). These, he says, corrupt the political
system and ``that shames me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these legislative campaigns have a quixotic,
tilting-at-windmills quality about them. It is not clear whether
campaign-finance reform is possible, let alone whether banning soft
money is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever doubts may exist over that, there was no
questioning McCain's moral clarity on two other issues this year,
both concerning foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost alone in either party, he urged the Senate to give
President Clinton the option of using ground troops in Kosovo _
articulating more clearly than anyone else the view that America
has interests abroad that are worth dying for.
</P>
<P>
   He made a similar point when he said that Pat Buchanan had put
himself outside the Republican pale when he asserted America had no
national interest in stopping Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   On both occasions, McCain was going against his interests. On
Kosovo, voters were reluctant to send in troops. On Pitchfork Pat,
he stood to lose Buchananites in the Republican primary contest.
But as he said, ``No political campaign is worth sacrificing our
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, this must be the sort of man voters have in mind
when they tell pollsters _ as they routinely do _ that they want
their next president to be a man of integrity. It is hard to
imagine what else they could want.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a puzzle about the voters' reaction to McCain. They
may admire him. But they do not seem to want him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls put him third in the beauty contest, behind Elizabeth
Dole, with only 5 percent of the vote. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, his standing is a testament to the fundraising power and
mesmerizing poll lead of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas. The
Bush steamroller is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of victory
that flattens everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That might change, of course, if Republicans start focusing on
the limitations of their front-runner, as Democrats are now doing
with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Then, McCain (who has raised more money than any Republican
except Bush) might prove the Bill Bradley of the right. But don't
hold your breath: after eight years out of the White House,
Republicans will not abandon their anointed one unless they have
to.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, too, McCain's low rating may reflect the difficulties of
making his main policy proposal, campaign-finance reform,
interesting to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue quickly gets bogged down in incomprehensible details.
And, anyway, at a time of prosperity, most Americans are reasonably
satisfied with their institutions of state.
</P>
<P>
   But there could also be a more profound reason for McCain's
standing. And it is connected with the very thing that also makes
him so admired: his personal qualities.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the embarrassments he talks about
with unflinching and abnormal honesty _ collapsing drunk through
the screen door of a girlfriend's house, or dating a stripper
called ``Marie the Flame of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, such episodes just enhance his reputation as an
honest man with real experience (in contrast to Bush's perceived
frat-boy callowness).
</P>
<P>
   No, the doubt concerns his ferocious tenacity in standing up for
what he believes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resisting, being uncooperative and a general pain in the ass
proved, as it had in the past, to be a morale booster for me,''
McCain writes about his experience in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Such insubordination has been a defining feature of his life. It
was heroic when he dealt with his Vietnamese captors. It was
refreshing when he defied his Republican colleagues over tobacco
taxes or campaign finance. It was powerful when placed in the
service of a vigorous foreign policy, especially considering that
everyone else was wobbly about Kosovo and Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not so clear that ``a general pain in the ass'' is
what voters want.
</P>
<P>
   American leaders set rules for others. They are the overdog.
Others react to them. This may explain why voters admire, but do
not support, McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He is a courageous man. But his courage lies in resisting what
he thinks is wrong. And Americans may not want a resistance hero as
president. &QL;

<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS _ A Californian, a Texan and a Coloradan are
out drinking. The Texan picks up his Lone Star beer, throws the
bottle in the air, takes out a six-shooter and empties the chamber.
Froth and glass everywhere. ``We've got plenty of beer back in
Texas,'' he says, ``but I've got to keep my aim straight.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour passes, and the Californian starts on his second bottle
of Merlot. He tosses it up, takes out his Saturday Night Special
and blasts away. ``We've got plenty of wine back in the Napa
Valley, but I've got to keep my trigger finger sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Coloradan puts three bottles of Coors beer on the
table, takes out his rifle and shoots the Californian and the
Texan. ``We've got plenty of those back in Colorado,'' he says,
``but the bottles I've got to recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke neatly embodies the changing attitudes of the West. The
huge migration out of California into Rocky Mountain states; the
tension this engenders; and the curious mixture of Old-West gun
culture and high-tech individualism _ between them, these things
have shaped a new political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency, his
victory promised to usher in a period of western dominance of
American politics. The country's economic center of gravity was
shifting westwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reaganism _ populist, internationalist, friendly to business,
skeptical of government _ was distinctively western. And that meant
distinctively Californian; the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest
then seemed little more than California's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 1980 has been only partly fulfilled.
Economically, the West is the country's fastest-growing area. But
the boom is taking place less in California than in the ``inland
West'' (otherwise known as the mountain West), those states that
straddle the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   So it no longer makes sense to think of this region as someone
else's hinterland. The inland West is a growth area in its own
right. Today's big gravitational shifts are taking place between
different parts of the West, not between the West and the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Latinos pour into California and Texas, whites are pouring
out of California and into the Rockies. As a result, the West is
splitting.
</P>
<P>
   California and the Pacific coast have become more multi-ethnic
and Democrat-controlled. The inland West is economically even more
successful and the most solidly Republican area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the West is becoming like the old California, while
California is becoming less like its old self.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation begins with the rise of the Latino vote.
There are 29 million Latinos in the United States, making them the
country's second-largest minority. California has a third of them,
30 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Texas Latinos tend to cluster in the strip
bordering Mexico, in California they are spilling into white
districts, says Rudolfo de la Garza, a professor of government at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This means that whites are starting to need Latino votes to win
even in predominantly white areas. That has changed their political
significance in the state. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Latinos had been a relatively apolitical group.
But galvanized by anti-immigrant measures in California _ notably
Proposition 187, which barred various state benefits to illegal
immigrants _ they are registering to vote on an unprecedented
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion poll for Univision, a Spanish-language
television network, 90 percent of the Latinos questioned said the
most important reason to apply for citizenship is the right to vote
to defend your interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they turned out to vote impressively: though the total
number of votes fell, the Latino turnout rose by nearly a fifth.
This helped to humiliate the once-mighty Republican Party of
California. It lost the governorship, the Senate race, all but two
statewide offices and five seats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The party's defeat was not entirely due to its alienation of
minority voters. Because of the growth of high-tech firms, whose
executives show little interest in party politics or ideology, the
Republicans are not getting the automatic business support they
once depended on from property developers and aerospace companies,
old stalwarts of the California economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever the reason, California's Republicans have become _
in the words of one of their own leaders _ the party of ``angry
white males.''
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, the party is self-destructing in the land of
Ronald Reagan. It is $300,000 in debt. Its leaders criticize each
other in the most virulent terms. And in Orange County, the seat of
Reagan's counterrevolution, less than half of all registered voters
are Republican. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a link between the Republican implosion in California
and the party's dominance in the rest of the West. According to
Bill Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in California,
more than 1.6 million people have left the state in the past
decade, most of them middle-income and working-class whites.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, 1.4 million more people moved into the
states of the inland West than moved out of them. If you include
Texas, Oregon and Washington (also targets of Californian flight),
the figure for internal migration is 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those moving came from California. This had
unexpected consequences. For much of the 1990s, western politicians
talked about the ``greening'' of the West, about the growth of
Democratic power there, and even about the collapse of the ``Old
West,'' socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out quite that way. Certainly the reliance on
primary industries has gone, to the point where ranchers and
farmers feel they are constantly on the defensive. But, instead of
greening, the West has been urbanizing _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The eight inland West states now contain six of the top ten
fastest-growing states by job creation and population, and five of
the ten states with the highest personal-income gains.
</P>
<P>
   This is genuine, bottom-up growth, not the boom-and-bust kind
that used to characterize the West. The gold and copper mining
industries that rose and fell with such spectacular suddenness are
still in the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   This boom is largely a high-tech affair. Denver is one of
America's leading cable-television and telecommunications centers,
home to TCI, a big cable television firm.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are other fast-growing
high-tech centers. Intel's largest production plant is in Portland,
Ore. And so on, right up to Washington state and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these companies, and much of the growth as a whole, have
been encouraged by people who left California for the great
outdoors. &QL;

   It would be too much to say they created the boom. But since
1991 the Center for the New West, a think-tank in Denver, Colo.,
has been tracking the influence of people it calls ``lone eagles''
_ well-educated individuals taking advantage of the
distance-eroding quality of new technology to set up small
companies and telecommute from cheap, spectacularly beautiful
places. (The Center calls the retired-rich version of these
characters ``bald eagles.'') &QL;

<P>
   It argues they have played a vital role in transforming the
inland West. They have helped make it another technology-based boom
region, like California in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Californian migrants like them have also strengthened the
Republicans of the Rockies and turned parts of the wide-open spaces
_ Idaho, Wyoming, Utah _ into one-party states. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,275) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1975, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the
state legislatures of the West by 739 to 488 (this excludes
California). Now the Republicans have 712 seats and the Democrats
514.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, there are only four Democrats in the 35-member state
Senate. All eight mountain states have Republican governors. All
the Pacific states (including Alaska and Hawaii) have Democratic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is not entirely because of the Californian arrivals. As
Phil Burgess, the head of the Center for the New West, puts it:
``The disappearance of highly unionized, blue-collar workers in the
mines, smelters and mills of the West has eviscerated the core
component of the Democratic base.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of it stemmed from the Californian emigrants'
concurrence with rock-ribbed western conservatism. As it turned
out, those who left California were not greenniks; they were
Reaganite Republicans who brought their views with them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The present western scene, then, is a strange one. For the
moment, ranchers and city-slicker computer wizards both find
themselves under the Republican label, united by a common disdain
for taxes and regulation. Yet social issues, from health care to
immigration, often divide the more tolerant techies from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This ideological disconnect has already caused intense fights
within the western state legislatures, and is likely to have a
large impact on next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this volatility is another Californian import:
Republican intolerance of the growing influence of Latinos, which
threatens to do for the party in the inland West just what it did
for the party in California.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these together, and there is just a slight glimmer of
hope for Democrats who wonder how the New West can be won. &QL;

 &HT;    THIS WEEK, TEENS CAN READ 'FOR THE FUN OF IT'
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    With TEEN-LIST sidebar

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are all sorts of spinach-is-good-for-you
justifications for Teens Read Week, which runs from Oct. 17 to 23.
</P>
<P>
   Students who said they read for more than 11 minutes a day did
better than others on recent national tests of reading and writing
skills. As adults, readers tend to get and keep the best jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the three celebrities recruited by librarians and
booksellers to convince teens to find time to read ``for the fun of
it'' don't tout tomes on self-improvement. When asked for their
favorite books, all invoked the pleasure principle, recommending
fiction with gripping plots:
</P>
<P>
   -- World-class figure skater Michelle Kwan liked Arthur Golden's
first novel, ``Memoirs of a Geisha.''
</P>
<P>
   -- WNBA basketball player Rebecca Lobo of the New York Liberty
liked Shel Silverstein's mysterious fable ``The Giving Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   -- NFL football player Tim Dwight of the Atlanta Falcons liked
``all'' of the Clive Cussler novels about swashbuckling adventurer
Dirk Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reluctant'' readers among teenagers present a special
challenge, said writer Diana Texier Herald, chair of a committee of
librarians who sifted through more than 1,000 new books to choose
10 with the greatest appeal to that group of teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that reluctant readers aren't necessarily bad
readers,'' Herald said. ``But it's hard to pick a sure-fire winner
for someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some teens who avoid recreational reading ``had to read
stuff they didn't like for school, so they don't like reading
because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But even avid readers spend less time reading once they reach
their teens. ``In school and after school, they have so much else
going on,'' Herald said.
</P>
<P>
   Her committee of the Young Adult Library Services Association
began months ago to assemble ``top 10 quick picks'' for reluctant
teen readers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's 11 members tested their hunches on
groups of teens, usually from advisory committees at public or
school libraries. Herald's regular advisers include three dozen
boys and girls confined in a detention facility near her home in
Grand Junction, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids there had never read a book before; they
were busy getting into trouble instead of reading,'' she said.
``Now, they're a captive audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other reluctant readers, those youngsters often lean toward
how-to books, adventure stories, short-story collections or graphic
novels, which are thick comic books. Herald said that the detained
youth don't necessarily zero in on the thinnest volumes, since
``sometimes they can only go to the library once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers submitted more than 1,000 books issued between July
1997 and December 1998. Each book was read by at least two
committee members.
</P>
<P>
   The members nominated nearly 300 books. Then, in a series of
votes, they narrowed that down to 46 fiction and 28 non-fiction
books published by 32 different publisher imprints.
</P>
<P>
   All 74 finalists, including the Top 10 list of those titles with
the most votes, are posted on a Web site
(http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklists/99top10quick.html).
</P>
<P>
   The Top 10 for reluctant readers runs the gamut from two Star
Wars manuals to a graphic novel about a teenage single mother, and
from an inside look at the pop sensations 'N Sync to a traditional
novel about an obsessive-compulsive 11-year-old who insists on
touching a doorknob and kissing her fingers 33 times whenever she
leaves the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything ties them together, it's that the authors respect
their readers as people who are almost adults, and don't see them
as children,'' Herald said. ``But reading is a personal taste. Few
people would like every one.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add that can stand alone as a Teen
Reads Week sidebar follows.)
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of the card-holders at the nation's public
libraries are between the ages of 12 and 18, said Mary Arnold, vice
president of the Young Adults Library Services Association. But
many of the teens she meets at her library in the Cuyahoga county
suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio, are working on school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When teens hear that adults want them to read, they think we
mean 'Moby-Dick' or Charles Dickens,'' Arnold said. ``The whole
purpose of Teens Read Week is to get teens to read for fun again.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't even have to start with books, said Clearwater, Fla.,
librarian Jana Fine, president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be magazines, cereal boxes, newspapers, Internet
screens,'' Fine said. ``What we know is that if you manage to get
through middle school without losing your love of reading, you'll
keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about Teens Read Week, and a variety of Top 10 lists for
various types of teen readers, are available on the Internet

<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS _ A Californian, a Texan and a Coloradan are
out drinking. The Texan picks up his Lone Star beer, throws the
bottle in the air, takes out a six-shooter and empties the chamber.
Froth and glass everywhere. ``We've got plenty of beer back in
Texas,'' he says, ``but I've got to keep my aim straight.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour passes, and the Californian starts on his second bottle
of Merlot. He tosses it up, takes out his Saturday Night Special
and blasts away. ``We've got plenty of wine back in the Napa
Valley, but I've got to keep my trigger finger sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the Coloradan puts three bottles of Coors beer on the
table, takes out his rifle and shoots the Californian and the
Texan. ``We've got plenty of those back in Colorado,'' he says,
``but the bottles I've got to recycle.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke neatly embodies the changing attitudes of the West. The
huge migration out of California into Rocky Mountain states; the
tension this engenders; and the curious mixture of Old-West gun
culture and high-tech individualism _ between them, these things
have shaped a new political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency, his
victory promised to usher in a period of western dominance of
American politics. The country's economic center of gravity was
shifting westwards.
</P>
<P>
   Reaganism _ populist, internationalist, friendly to business,
skeptical of government _ was distinctively western. And that meant
distinctively Californian; the Rockies and the Pacific Northwest
then seemed little more than California's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of 1980 has been only partly fulfilled.
Economically, the West is the country's fastest-growing area. But
the boom is taking place less in California than in the ``inland
West'' (otherwise known as the mountain West), those states that
straddle the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   So it no longer makes sense to think of this region as someone
else's hinterland. The inland West is a growth area in its own
right. Today's big gravitational shifts are taking place between
different parts of the West, not between the West and the rest of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   As Latinos pour into California and Texas, whites are pouring
out of California and into the Rockies. As a result, the West is
splitting.
</P>
<P>
   California and the Pacific coast have become more multi-ethnic
and Democrat-controlled. The inland West is economically even more
successful and the most solidly Republican area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This part of the West is becoming like the old California, while
California is becoming less like its old self.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation begins with the rise of the Latino vote.
There are 29 million Latinos in the United States, making them the
country's second-largest minority. California has a third of them,
30 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Texas Latinos tend to cluster in the strip
bordering Mexico, in California they are spilling into white
districts, says Rudolfo de la Garza, a professor of government at
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This means that whites are starting to need Latino votes to win
even in predominantly white areas. That has changed their political
significance in the state. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 525) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Latinos had been a relatively apolitical group.
But galvanized by anti-immigrant measures in California _ notably
Proposition 187, which barred various state benefits to illegal
immigrants _ they are registering to vote on an unprecedented
scale.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion poll for Univision, a Spanish-language
television network, 90 percent of the Latinos questioned said the
most important reason to apply for citizenship is the right to vote
to defend your interests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, they turned out to vote impressively: though the total
number of votes fell, the Latino turnout rose by nearly a fifth.
This helped to humiliate the once-mighty Republican Party of
California. It lost the governorship, the Senate race, all but two
statewide offices and five seats in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The party's defeat was not entirely due to its alienation of
minority voters. Because of the growth of high-tech firms, whose
executives show little interest in party politics or ideology, the
Republicans are not getting the automatic business support they
once depended on from property developers and aerospace companies,
old stalwarts of the California economy.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever the reason, California's Republicans have become _
in the words of one of their own leaders _ the party of ``angry
white males.''
</P>
<P>
   After that defeat, the party is self-destructing in the land of
Ronald Reagan. It is $300,000 in debt. Its leaders criticize each
other in the most virulent terms. And in Orange County, the seat of
Reagan's counterrevolution, less than half of all registered voters
are Republican. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a link between the Republican implosion in California
and the party's dominance in the rest of the West. According to
Bill Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in California,
more than 1.6 million people have left the state in the past
decade, most of them middle-income and working-class whites.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1997, 1.4 million more people moved into the
states of the inland West than moved out of them. If you include
Texas, Oregon and Washington (also targets of Californian flight),
the figure for internal migration is 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of those moving came from California. This had
unexpected consequences. For much of the 1990s, western politicians
talked about the ``greening'' of the West, about the growth of
Democratic power there, and even about the collapse of the ``Old
West,'' socially and economically.
</P>
<P>
   It has not worked out quite that way. Certainly the reliance on
primary industries has gone, to the point where ranchers and
farmers feel they are constantly on the defensive. But, instead of
greening, the West has been urbanizing _ and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The eight inland West states now contain six of the top ten
fastest-growing states by job creation and population, and five of
the ten states with the highest personal-income gains.
</P>
<P>
   This is genuine, bottom-up growth, not the boom-and-bust kind
that used to characterize the West. The gold and copper mining
industries that rose and fell with such spectacular suddenness are
still in the dumps.
</P>
<P>
   This boom is largely a high-tech affair. Denver is one of
America's leading cable-television and telecommunications centers,
home to TCI, a big cable television firm.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are other fast-growing
high-tech centers. Intel's largest production plant is in Portland,
Ore. And so on, right up to Washington state and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these companies, and much of the growth as a whole, have
been encouraged by people who left California for the great
outdoors. &QL;

<P>
   It would be too much to say they created the boom. But since
1991 the Center for the New West, a think-tank in Denver, Colo.,
has been tracking the influence of people it calls ``lone eagles''
_ well-educated individuals taking advantage of the
distance-eroding quality of new technology to set up small
companies and telecommute from cheap, spectacularly beautiful
places. (The Center calls the retired-rich version of these
characters ``bald eagles.'') &QL;

<P>
   It argues they have played a vital role in transforming the
inland West. They have helped make it another technology-based boom
region, like California in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Californian migrants like them have also strengthened the
Republicans of the Rockies and turned parts of the wide-open spaces
_ Idaho, Wyoming, Utah _ into one-party states. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,275) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1975, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the
state legislatures of the West by 739 to 488 (this excludes
California). Now the Republicans have 712 seats and the Democrats
514.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho, there are only four Democrats in the 35-member state
Senate. All eight mountain states have Republican governors. All
the Pacific states (including Alaska and Hawaii) have Democratic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is not entirely because of the Californian arrivals. As
Phil Burgess, the head of the Center for the New West, puts it:
``The disappearance of highly unionized, blue-collar workers in the
mines, smelters and mills of the West has eviscerated the core
component of the Democratic base.''
</P>
<P>
   But much of it stemmed from the Californian emigrants'
concurrence with rock-ribbed western conservatism. As it turned
out, those who left California were not greenniks; they were
Reaganite Republicans who brought their views with them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The present western scene, then, is a strange one. For the
moment, ranchers and city-slicker computer wizards both find
themselves under the Republican label, united by a common disdain
for taxes and regulation. Yet social issues, from health care to
immigration, often divide the more tolerant techies from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This ideological disconnect has already caused intense fights
within the western state legislatures, and is likely to have a
large impact on next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this volatility is another Californian import:
Republican intolerance of the growing influence of Latinos, which
threatens to do for the party in the inland West just what it did
for the party in California.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these together, and there is just a slight glimmer of
hope for Democrats who wonder how the New West can be won. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last weekend, in one of the most prosperous and steady countries
in Europe, more than a quarter of those who voted plumped for a
party whose leader, Jorg Haider, is widely regarded _ especially
outside his own country _ as the next worst thing to a Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Austria's two established parties, the Social Democrats
and the conservative People's Party, which have run the country
between them since 1945, got their lowest proportion of the vote in
any postwar election.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's Freedom Party came second (though the final count of
absentee ballots might yet bump it down to third) with 27 percent,
behind the Social Democrats' 33 percent but a whisker ahead of the
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Will Haider now get his first slice of top-level power, in
coalition? And, if he did so, would this mean that fascism was
crawling back into the mainstream of European politics?
</P>
<P>
   The answers are that it is hard to say _ and no. The Social
Democratic chancellor, Viktor Klima, who has governed Austria since
1997 in coalition with the People's Party under Wolfgang Schussel,
says he will never share power with the Freedomites. Schussel
previously said he would bow out of government altogether if his
lot came third.
</P>
<P>
   Though constitutionally feasible, it is unlikely that the Social
Democrats, as the largest party, would rule as a minority
government, perhaps with the Greens, who pulled in 7 percent; at a
big pinch, they might just seek a minimal agreement (on a budget,
for instance) with the mainstream conservatives, without resuming
their 13-year-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the big question is whether Schussel might, after all, be
prevailed upon by some of his power-hungrier colleagues to team up,
as chancellor, with the controversial Haider after all. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the steamy comments of some leading politicians
across the continent, an Austrian government with the Freedomites
on board would put the country beyond the pale. Not so, said Edmund
Stoiber, who leads Bavaria's right-wing Christian Social Union and
is himself a possible future German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Looking south across his state's border, he said that a long
period of rule by ``grand coalition,'' as in Austria, was always
bad; that, by implication, Haider's lot had genuinely changed their
spots; and that the mainstream conservatives should agree to share
power with them.
</P>
<P>
   Other continental conservatives were less sanguine. Volker Ruhe,
a leading German Christian Democrat, upbraided Stoiber for his
indulgence towards Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's former fascists, led by Gianfranco Fini, who themselves
briefly shared power in a ruling coalition in 1994, sounded
cautious: Italian and Austrian ultranationalists have unsettled
territorial arguments. But Fini said that Haider was ``no racist
and no Nazi.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So how frightening is he? There is no doubt that Haider, the son
of a Nazi official and notorious, some years ago, for praising
aspects of Hitler's ``employment policy'' and for toasting a bunch
of former SS veterans as ``decent fellows,'' gets the old Nazi vote
_ in a country which never truly denazified itself and
proportionately had more Nazi party members, in Hitler's time, than
Germany did.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Haider's people clearly pander to racial and
xenophobic prejudice, harping on illegal immigration and the crime
that they blame on it.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider also espouses more defensible policies. His strongest
card is opposition to the system of Proporz, whereby patronage for
all sorts of public jobs, down to bottle-washers and drivers, still
tends to be shared out among card-holders of the two establishment
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has other strong views that are likewise unexceptionable
on democratic grounds. He was against Austria joining the European
Union, though he no longer argues for withdrawal; with immigration
again in mind, he is against the EU's eastbound expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Another policy puts him closer to most other continental
mainstreamers: unlike Austria's Social Democrats, he, along with
the People's Party, wants his country to join NATO. Lastly, he has
shed the corporatism of his Nazi political forebears, arguing
instead for privatization and a low, flat tax on income.
</P>
<P>
   The real respectability yardstick, for Haider and others with
the far-right label, is whether they are true parliamentary
democrats who accept the rule of law, replete with safeguards for
minorities. Maybe they do now. Would they if by chance they won
power _ as Haider conceivably might?
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe, the answers vary. Disciples of Jean-Marie Le Pen
seem to long for a punch-up in the street. So do the hate-filled
ultranationalist of Central and Eastern Europe, for whom
parliaments are generally obstacles in countries where democracy is
still taking root _ for instance, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Hungary and Russia itself. But nowhere is fascism clearly a looming
feature of the political landscape. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 475 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More promisingly, several political parties that have roots in
anti-democracy have genuinely joined the mainstream: despite their
lineal descent from Mussolini, Italy's post-fascists, under the
rather canny Gianfranco Fini, are nowadays accepted, even on the
left, as having a legitimate role _ as democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Spain, the ruling mainstream conservative People's Party,
under Jose Maria Aznar, which pulls together several strands
including one that threads back to the old authoritarian right of
General Franco, has moved far enough to the center to have made its
leader an avowed political soul mate of Britain's Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   There are also parties with the far-right tag which are, in
fact, extreme libertarian, and which, by the by, want to squeeze
the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway, where such attitudes are controversial, Carl Hagen's
Progress Party has steadily crept up in the polls, and now gets
about 15 percent, but he is hardly a threat to Scandinavian
democracy, let alone heir to the viciousness of Vidkun Quisling,
Hitler's Norwegian nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, in Switzerland, the flinty, populist, anti-EU People's
Party, with _ yes _ a whiff of anti-immigrant nastiness (a charge
also laid against Hagen), has had similar success challenging the
woollier conservatism of the Christian Democrats for the mantle of
the broad right. But it would be unfair to call it crypto-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   All told, parties with a Nazi flavor are doing poorly across the
continent. In southern Europe, where postwar democracy was once
weakest, the anti-democratic parties, from Portugal to Greece, have
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Europe, xenophobic parties (in Denmark, for
instance, and in ethnically divided Belgium) can sometimes notch up
weighty scores in decrepit cities, often egged on by hostility to
the sovereignty-eroding European Union. But they never come close
to getting real power, beyond the odd city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the splitting of Le Pen's National Front into two
wings, one of them purporting to be more civilized than the other,
seems to have done for both bits of it.
</P>
<P>
   The worst recent outbreak of the nastier sort of far-right virus
has been in eastern Germany, where the racist German People's Union
(DVU), exploiting high unemployment and post-unification trauma,
got 13 percent in a state election last year. But its vote slumped
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's twitchiness about its past is still reassuringly
acute: there is little sign of a thoroughgoing far-right revival.
Anglo-Saxons and perhaps Nordics, without the baggage of a recent
fascist, communist or authoritarian past, are more comfortable with
the simple labels ``right'' and ``left.''
</P>
<P>
   Other continentals prefer ``center-right'' and ``center-left,''
fearing that plain ``right'' carries a hint of anti-democracy. More
and more continentals tend to think, ``We are all centrists now.''
Even the once undoubted far-righters, such as Fini and Haider in
Italy and Austria, would love to relabel themselves as just plain
right. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A certain queasiness is inevitable when their vote count starts
matching or even overtaking their rivals on the old center-right.
In the early 1920s, their forebears were unwisely shrugged off,
often as comical irrelevances. But that was then. Democracy
nowadays is much stronger, prosperity much more widely spread.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better if Haider were sent packing. But _ thanks in
part to the transnational strictures of the European Union _
neither Austria nor Europe will suffer unduly if he is not. &QL;

   Like much else on the Internet, online advertising is full of
jargon. Here is a guide.
</P>
<P>
   Banners are the inch-high straps found at the top of a web page.
They are the workhorse of Internet advertising, accounting for some
60 percent (including buttons, see below) of all online
advertisements, according to IAB/PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Banners usually carry a company name, a message and an
enticement to click. They can be static or animated, but they are
not interactive, and they carry you to another website if you click
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Although banners remain the most popular form of web
advertising, they are the least likely to elicit a response.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent buttons are smaller than banners and are enduring
features of a site. They can also sit close to relevant content;
and response rates can reach 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, E*Trade, an online broker, can put its button next
to a share tip on a financial site. However, most buttons are not
interactive and, like banners, take you away from the website if
you click on them.
</P>
<P>
   Interstitials are advertisements that pop up on their own
article in between content pages. For the most part, users cannot
click on them. Although they offer features such as video and
audio, they have fallen from favor because they are so big that
they can take as long as two minutes to download, irritating users.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitials are new, improved interstitials that download
``politely'' in the browser's short-term memory so that they do not
interrupt users.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hopple, chief executive of Unistat, which launched the
technology this year, thinks superstitials can match the quality of
television for brand-building advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rich-media expanding banners use technology such as Flash,
Enliven, Shockwave and Java to combine video, audio, animation and
photographs and let the viewer click on them without leaving the
original web page.
</P>
<P>
   They take live website information directly to the viewer,
allowing him to shop, register for information and interact,
without ever leaving the original site.
</P>
<P>
   However, websites dislike them because they cover content, take
time to download and, at worst, can crash the site.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is one of the cheapest, most effective marketing methods
on the Internet, with response rates of between 5 percent and 25
percent. And yet e-mail represents only 1 percent of
online-advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Like rich-media banners, e-mails bring an offer or product
information direct to consumers. The problem is to avoid spam and
clutter.
</P>
<P>
   Users enter sweepstakes to win prizes, get discounts or,
increasingly, cash in exchange for telling a marketer who they are,
i.e., registering.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet software can track movement on the web, it
cannot get personal information such as addresses and age.
Affiliate deals split an advertiser's revenue with the site in
exchange for free advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates that, by 2004, half of all online
advertising revenue will be based on performance. Sponsorships or
co-branded deals usually involve payment up-front whether or not
there is a sale. Such deals often deploy the gamut of
Internet-advertising techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble and Yahoo! have united to market P&AMP;G's Pringles
crisps, Pepto-Bismol medicine and Pampers diapers.
</P>
<P>
   They are using banners and e-mails to bring traffic to the site
and sweepstakes to get users to register. &QL;

`NOVA': DON'T BOOK THAT TIME TRAVEL VACATION JUST YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Review of UPN's ``The Strip'' follows.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking, appearing on ``Nova''
Tuesday, is something of a killjoy on the topic of time machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time travel might be possible,'' he admits. ``But if that is
the case, why haven't we been overrun by tourists from the
future?''
</P>
<P>
   To which some of us might ask, who's to say we haven't? I think
one of them even got elected governor in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Nova'' covers all its bases in a show that looks seriously
and compellingly at the possibility of time travel.
</P>
<P>
   The late Carl Sagan, Mr. Cosmos, says on the program that
tourists from the future might have mastered invisibility. So
there.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists, skeptics all, say they see no chance of a time
machine that can go back farther than when the machine itself was
invented. I'd explain, but I'm stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The guesswork involves a wormhole in space, much as California
Institute of Technology physicist Kip Thorne suggested to Sagan for
Sagan's book ``Contact,'' which became the Jodie Foster movie.
</P>
<P>
   That's what introduced wormholes to science fiction. The idea is
to give a speedy flight to one end of the wormhole so that, in
accordance with Einstein's theory of relativity, it's at a
different place in time than the stationary end. Then the time
traveler enters the wormhole at one place in time and exits in
another. Piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe not. Hawking, Thorne and others conclude,
perhaps wistfully, that it'll probably never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking ends the program, though, with the kind of joke that
makes theoretical physicists grab their protons and double up with
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't take a bet against the existence of time
machines,'' he says. ``My opponent might have seen the future and
know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-0- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Now for a forlorn little adventure in TV time travel. It's
called ``The Strip,'' it's on UPN and it premieres Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, two cops cruising their town in a convertible, to a
driving overlay of music. The white cop, with the dirty blond hair,
is a slob who lives on a boat. His black partner used to work in a
big northeastern city.
</P>
<P>
   And watch out for the creature named Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 points, name the show. (set ital)Ding! Ding! Ding!(end
ital) It is indeed ``The Strip,'' but our judges also will accept
``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that ``The Strip'' is a poor man's ``Miami Vice.'' A
pauper's ``Miami Vice.'' I had a feeling they squandered the whole
season's budget when they blew up a trailer home for Tuesday
night's show.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis was Don Johnson's pet alligator in ``Miami Vice.'' Here
he's Elvis Ford (Sean Patrick Flanery), and a little less brainy.
He's the slovenly one. His partner is Jesse Weir (Guy Torry). He's
the one who apparently believes that acting consists of rolling his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there's plenty of eye-rolling material in ``The
Strip.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Las Vegas detectives promptly become ex-cops when Elvis
punches out their supervising lieutenant. So they take jobs as
private dicks working for the manager of Caesars Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Caesars Palace made a deal with the show's producer, Joel Silver
(``Die Hard,'' ``Lethal Weapon''). I wonder how they'll feel when
they see that the chain-smoking, pockmarked Joe Viterelli, a man
born to play mobsters, is cast as the hotel's manager.
</P>
<P>
   The show is a high-test testosterone affair with bullets,
fistfights, fast cars, fast food, babes in thongs, one babe in
bondage and the aforementioned mobile home that goes boom in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   If only ``The Strip'' could imitate that instead of someone
else's show.

TEXAS FIREFIGHTING TEAM BATTLES 40-ACRE TIRE FIRE IN CALIF. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLEY, Calif. _ They've battled big blazes from the Persian
Gulf to the Gulf of Mexico, emerging victorious more than 100
times.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dwight and Randy Williams, a brother-sister team with one of
the world's great firefighting pedigrees, are face-to-face with
something they've never confronted: a smoldering 40-acre expanse of
7 million tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ignited Sept. 22 when lightning hit the former Oxford Tire
Recycling dump here, the fire could persist for a year. Williams
Fire and Hazard Control Inc., of Mauriceville, Texas, was brought
in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to try to contain
the fire and quell the billows of toxic smoke that had spread
across the western San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fire is awesome. It's beautiful,'' declared Randy
Williams, 45, who like her brother, who is 52, was attracted as a
teenager to the family business run by their father, Les.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Dwight Williams, the blaze is stealing resources,
money, life and health. ``Our job is to kill the thief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far they've managed to dramatically reduce the pall of smoke
by dousing a raging oil fire fueled by melted runoff from the
tires. With a crew of two dozen they're using special foam to
suppress the flames as thousands of gallons of oil continue to melt
off the burning rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Putting out the main fire is another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big job because of the resources, manpower and
length of job,'' said Randy Williams. ``But the crew would rather
be at a large gasoline or crude oil storage tank fire. It's more
thrilling to them,'' she said. ``This fire never goes away. It's
demoralizing and very taxing for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Williams added, ``With an oil fire, you rig up for maybe
two hours and put it out in 30 minutes. For this one, you rig up
every day. You beat a piece of it back. And you do it again the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fighting the fire, they're trying to remove as
many tires as possible from the path of the flames.
</P>
<P>
   Working close to the fire, they're using tractors with long
mechanical arms to grab tires. Meanwhile IT Group Inc. of
Monroeville, Pa., which was hired by the EPA as the master
contractor, is working farther from the flames, using excavators
and other heavy machinery to push aside big piles of tires. So far
the EPA has paid IT $1.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and IT are hoping to protect another expanse of tires
uphill from the main dump and about a quarter of its size.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses know the bravery, the daring, the lore, the
history and the emerging technology of their trade. So far, in the
fires they've extinguished, there have been no worker injuries at
tankers, storage tanks and refineries for Texaco, Tenneco, Exxon,
Chevron, Shell and other major oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Brubaker, chief of the EPA's emergency response office in
San Francisco, said the Williamses were chosen because of their
reputation and experience.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Williams, president and CEO, is in charge of fighting
fires. Randy Williams, vice president, directs logistics and
contract fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   They never take vacations, said Dwight, who hasn't had more than
seven days off in a row for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, Les, who was a legend in the firefighting
business, died of a heart attack at age 68 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Les Williams was part of a team at Jefferson Chemical, now
Texaco Chemical, that in the early 1960s designed the first foam
made of hydrocarbons instead of animal fats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Les and Dwight Williams formed Boots and Coots Fire
Protective Equipment Co. with Boots Hansen and Coots Matthews, lead
firefighters with Red Adair, the famed Houston capper of
out-of-control oil or gas well fires.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses bought out the company and changed to the present
name in 1991. Over the years they invented and modified nozzle
systems, making it possible to apply foam with greater precision
and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   One of Dwight Williams' earliest jobs was on the Amazon River in
Manaus, Brazil, when he was 26.
</P>
<P>
   As a ship burned gasoline and diesel, part of the deck blew up,
blasting steel and paint in every direction. Watching Williams
stand his ground, locals started yelling, ``John Wayne. John
Wayne!'' In 1969, John Wayne dramatized the exploits of Red Adair
in the movie ``The Hellfighters.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the company put out a blaze that had burned for decades
on the Hudson River at the 97-acre PJP landfill in Jersey City
across from New York. It took 48 days, 14 hours a day to extinguish
the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Energy Department sent the company to assess the
possibility of fire or terrorism at the Trans-Alaska pipeline in
1986. The Defense Department sent Dwight Williams to Saudi Arabia
during the Persian Gulf War to respond to fires at refineries,
tankers or pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mississippi River floods in 1996, the company worked
for the city of St. Louis to prevent a catastrophic accident at
storage tanks threatened by rising waters. The firm's workers
vented the gas and built equipment to safely recapture it.
</P>
<P>
   In Monserrat in the West Indies, a volcano belched lava and ash
in 1998, threatening to push two large pressured liquid petroleum
gas tanks into the ocean. Dwight Williams, at times standing on 3
feet of ash, flared off 22,000 gallons of fuel and emptied the
tanks.

SHRIMP SIMMERED IN LIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people I know have gone food hunting in Cambodia, so I was
curious when Deb Winson, a New York-based food stylist, came back
with an ecstatic report. ``Everything was so fresh and beautiful,
and everything was so simple,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked her to describe her favorite, dish she told me
about a great preparation for shrimp cooked in lime. The
ingredients were much as I expected: limes, sugar, salt, chilies
and garlic, all common in Southeast Asian cooking. But the
technique sounded unusual. The shrimp were not stir-fried, as you
might expect, but instead were simmered in a very pungent sauce so
that they took on strong flavor and still stayed juicy.
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce, she said, ``they started with salt, sugar and
lime, then kept tasting, adding, stirring, tasting, adding,
stirring, until they were happy with the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   This sounded like something I could handle, so I set out to
recreate the dish. The result may not be entirely authentic, but it
is really good, a striking balance of mildly sweet and
mouth-puckeringly sour. It is also ridiculously fast, assuming you
start with peeled shrimp. If you start cooking rice before tackling
the shrimp, they will both be done 20 minutes later. (Peeling the
shrimp should take 10 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to heat the pan and oil sufficiently, so that the garlic
browns lightly without burning. Let the lime-and-sugar mixture cook
until it is syrupy; this won't take long, about three minutes, but
it will guarantee that the liquid coats the shrimp nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp themselves, Ms. Winson said, should be ``huge''
prawns, with their heads on if possible. There are benefits of
head-on shrimp: they might be fresh, or even alive, when you buy
them; they make for an impressive presentation, and it's fun to
suck the juices out of the heads. But I had good results with
shrimp of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   SHRIMP IN SPICY LIME SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 to 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   About { cup lime juice (3 or 4 limes)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grape seed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon crushed red chili flakes, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds peeled shrimp, or 3 pounds head-on shrimp, left
unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small bowl, combine the lime juice, sugar and salt.
Place oil in a 10- or 12-inch skillet, and turn the heat to high. A
minute later, add the garlic and chili flakes and cook the garlic
until it just begins to brown. Immediately add the lime juice
mixture all at once, and cook until it reduces by half, or even
more, 3 to 5 minutes. There should be only about \ cup of liquid in
the skillet, and it should be syrupy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the shrimp, and cook over high heat. The shrimp will give
off liquid of their own and begin to turn pink almost immediately.
After about 2 minutes, stir contents of pan. Continue cooking,
stirring occasionally until all the shrimp are pink, about 4
minutes total. Taste, adjust seasoning, garnish with cilantro and
serve with rice.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings

A SPICY GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH, BUILT TO LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This is the fifth of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's
Bread in Manhattan. These columns are being written with Dorie
Greenspan. )

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You can think about sandwiches in two directions:
from the inside out or from the outside in. You can decide on the
filling and then choose the bread, or if you're like me, you can
choose the bread and then decide what to put between the slices.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're going from bread to filling or filling to bread,
to build a perfect sandwich you have to consider taste and texture.
The basic rules are simple. For texture, pair soft breads with soft
fillings (so the egg salad doesn't go flying out of the toast) and
sturdy breads with firmer fillings (think roast beef or turkey), so
you get a ``chew'' of equal density from the outside in.
</P>
<P>
   When you want to bend the rules, you can put a firm filling on a
softer bread. Similarly, big-flavored breads go best with fillings
that can stand up to them.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite grilled cheese sandwich starts with country
sourdough bread (a good toasting bread) spread with a zesty mixture
of chipotle peppers and tomato paste. From the bottom up, it has
two slices of sharp New York State Cheddar, red onions, fresh
cilantro, a layer of ripe tomatoes, two more slices of cheese, and
then the capstone, another slice of bread spread with the chipotle
paste.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to use a different cheese, change the cilantro to
parsley, omit the onions or replace chili sauce with mayonnaise.
You can play around with the inner elements, so long as you don't
change the order in which they are layered. Order is all when you
grill this sandwich, as you'll see.
</P>
<P>
   At the bakeries, we use a press, which packs the sandwich down,
toasts the bread, warms the innards and, because the Cheddar is
positioned next to the bread, melts the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   At home, you can put the sandwich in a saute pan and weight it
with a small pot. Either way, you'll discover that the cheese melts
on both sides and, even better, melts around the tomatoes, cilantro
and onions, forming a cocoon that keeps these delicate ingredients
juicy, but away from the bread. There's no sog, ever.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes two sandwiches, but it can be multiplied
indefinitely. You can even assemble and refrigerate the sandwiches
up to eight hours ahead. Regardless of when you make them or how
many, you will always have the same results: the construction
guarantees that the last bite will look and taste exactly as good
as the first.
</P>
<P>
   SPICED-UP GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 6-ounce can tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   2 canned chipotle peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon adobo sauce (the sauce in which the peppers are
canned)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon molasses
</P>
<P>
   4 large slices sourdough bread, cut } inch thick
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces New York State Cheddar cheese, cut into 8 thin slices
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices red onion, in rings
</P>
<P>
   \ cup coarsely chopped cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   1 large or 2 small tomatoes, sliced \ inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a blender or small food processor, combine tomato paste,
chipotle peppers, adobo and molasses. Puree until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   2. Taste chipotle pepper spread to determine the spiciness, then
spread one side of each slice of bread with desired amount.
Refrigerate the extra sauce.
</P>
<P>
   3. On each of 2 slices of bread, place 2 slices cheese. Top with
onion rings, then sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Add tomato
slices, and top with remaining cheese. Put slices of bread, pepper
sides down, over sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   4. If using a sandwich grill, follow the instructions.
Otherwise, place a large skillet or saute pan over medium heat for
30 seconds. Put sandwiches in pan, and weight with a clean heavy
pot. When bread has begun to toast and brown and cheese is melting,
in 1 to 2 minutes, flip sandwiches over and toast other sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 sandwiches.

<P>
   Les Forts de Latour 1989, Pauillac, France. About $100.
</P>
<P>
   While Chateau Latour is not the only top Bordeaux chateau to
produce a good second wine _ Carruades de Lafite and
Bahans-Haut-Brion are others that come to mind _ it has always been
one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who say that in some off years for Chateau
Latour, Les Forts is its equal. That is doubtful, but I do recall
the 1973 as coming tantalizingly close.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, very fine wines were produced in Bordeaux, most of
which have long disappeared from the store shelves. There is some
of the Les Forts around, however, and even at $100 it's a good buy.
</P>
<P>
   The last decade has been good to the wine; it's rich, supple and
filled with flavor. It's a lot of good things that 10 years have
shaped into a single harmonious experience.

A MIGHTY VALPOLICELLA THAT'S A SECRET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ At a restaurant in Verona recently I was offered
a remarkable red wine, one I had never heard of before. It was
called Osar, and the restaurant owner was reluctant to talk about
it. ``Ask Sandro Boscaini at Masi,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I did. Boscaini is president of Masi Agricola, one
of the best-known producers of Valpolicella wines. For six
generations, his family has owned the company in Gargagnago, a
20-minute drive northwest of Verona.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he was equally hesitant to talk, but finally agreed to
tell me a bit about Osar. It was, he said by way of introduction, a
wine that might just change the way the world perceives the wines
of Valpolicella. The story goes back decades.
</P>
<P>
   Valpolicella was one of the lighthearted Italian wines, along
with Bardolino and Soave, that Americans fell in love with in the
years after World War II. Valpolicella, the best of the group, and
Bardolino are red; Soave is white. To meet the demand in the late
1950s, millions of gallons of these wines were exported every year,
and inevitably quality suffered and consumers turned to other
Italian wines, notably Chianti. In recent years, local producers
have worked to restore the reputation of Valpolicella.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its northern location _ on clear days, the Alps are
quite visible _ this region is not an optimum one for growing
high-quality red grapes. So to make their best red wine, called
Amarone, Valpolicella producers have long resorted to appassimento,
the ancient practice of partly drying their best grapes before
fermentation.
</P>
<P>
   Extra-ripe grapes are spread out on bamboo panels and left in
cool lofts for three or four months. As they dry out, the grapes
lose up to a third of their weight, but their sugar and flavor
elements remain in a highly concentrated form.
</P>
<P>
   When the grapes are crushed and fermented, usually in January or
February, the resulting powerful wine can contain 16 percent
alcohol or more, compared with around 11 percent for a simple
Valpolicella.
</P>
<P>
   Still another special wine is produced by adding newly made
Valpolicella to Amarone pomace _ the pits, stems and skins left in
the fermenting vats after the wine has been drawn off. The
Valpolicella remains in contact with the pomace for about two
weeks, picking up additional color and tannins. This process is
called ripasso, because the young wine is said to have been passed
over the pomace.
</P>
<P>
   At the Masi estate, where the ripasso version of Valpolicella is
called Campo Fiorin, the Boscainis have never been satisfied with
the traditional methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always wanted to make a big, red wine to compete with
the best Piemontese and Tuscan wines,'' Boscaini said, ``but we
thought we were too far north. Hence Amarone and the ripasso
wines.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boscaini and his brother, Sergio, who is Masi's chief wine
maker, had heard of a long-forgotten grape, native to the region,
that was said to have once produced a full-flavored, robust red
wine that had no need for additional processing. The grape,
oseletta, had been abandoned many years ago because it was
difficult to grow and produced only a tiny and very uneconomical
crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a detective story,'' Sandro Boscaini said. ``We
found a grower who had four vines. Four vines! But we took them and
began to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 18 years ago. The Boscainis learned how to cultivate
the vines, produce good grapes, and eventually they made small
batches of wine. And then they took the experiment a step further.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Valpolicella is made from three grapes: corvina,
rondinella and molinara. About 10 years ago, Masi began making a
wine that was mostly corvina, with some rondinella but no molinara.
Instead they added about 10 percent oseletta and a touch of a grape
called dindarella _ ``for personality,'' Boscaini said.
</P>
<P>
   The new wine, called Toar, ``showed that we could produce wines
of greater complexity and structure with fresh grapes,'' Boscaini
said. ``We didn't need ripasso or appassimento.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toar was an intermediate project for Masi. The next step was
to produce a wine made almost entirely from oseletta. That wine,
the Osar that piqued my interest, does indeed mark a revolution in
Veronese wine making. It is a rich, supple, muscular wine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Osar I tasted could be characterized as more rustic
than the best Amarones. But it lacked neither complexity nor tannic
structure. Osar has about 12 percent alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you can't go to your corner store for a sample.
Only some 5,000 bottles were made of the 1995 vintage, the first
released, and the Masi people have allowed only a few nearby
restaurants to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   The Boscainis consider Osar to be a work in progress, one they
can eventually be proud of. Let's hope that more wine lovers will
one day be able to share in their pride.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: FINALLY, A PLAY ABOUT THE DINING EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a certain trendy restaurant on the Upper East
Side, a place where they serve Argentine cedar-roasted milk-fed
chicken, tables are very, very hard to come by. The place is fully
booked months in advance, but callers never hear the situation
described that way. They are told that the restaurant is ``fully
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the name of the one-man play now at the Vineyard Theater.
My only question is, why did it take so long? In a restaurant-mad
city like New York, where virtually every aspiring actor and
playwright has waited on tables, where deals are struck over lunch
or dinner, where finagling a reservation at the latest hot spot is
a blood sport, it's astounding that fine dining has taken so long
to claim a place on the stage, not as a backdrop _ there's plenty
of eating in Chekhov and Ibsen _ but as dramatic material in its
own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fully Committed'' may be slight, but it has touched a nerve.
Packed houses suggest that there are few dishes tastier, for
present-day New Yorkers, than the stew of pretension, duplicity,
avarice and cruelty bubbling under the lid of a four-star Manhattan
restaurant, and few spectacles funnier than seeing themselves in
hot, panting pursuit of a reservation.

   ``Fully Committed'' unfolds on a busy December day, as the
Christmas holidays approach, and a hapless, struggling actor named
Sam, played by Mark Setlock, fields an unending stream of calls
from would-be diners. Some are rude. Some are desperate. Some are
bullying. Some are clueless, like the woman from Louisville, Ky.,
who cheerfully announces, ``My husband and I are coming to New York
the weekend of January the 13th, and we are just dyin' to come eat
with y'all!'' Setlock, who once worked as a reservationist at
Bouley, runs through about 30 characters at top speed.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, the torment goes on. And it's not just the
customers. The chef, an out-of-control control freak with a
paranoid streak a mile wide, calls Sam constantly. So does the
maitre d'hotel, a supercilious, cocaine-sniffing Frenchman who
cannot bear to talk to homely female customers.
</P>
<P>
   I found ``Fully Committed'' immensely entertaining, a richly
comic affirmation of everything I've ever heard, or suspected,
about the bad behavior that good food can inspire. But it also
illuminated, almost by accident, an aspect of restaurant-going that
diners rarely think about: the intricate theater of the dining
experience.
</P>
<P>
   By now it's a commonplace to compare Manhattan restaurants to
theaters. The food tends to come in three acts. The restaurants
have set designers and lighting designers. There is a script (the
menu), and a playwright (the chef). There are reviews, of course.
And restaurants have the kind of audience that Broadway needs
desperately but can't seem to get. New York's diners, as a class,
are well informed, highly motivated and dead keen to try anything
new. The restaurant equivalent of ``Cats'' does not interest them.
They are always ready and willing to take a walk on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   These are the obvious parallels, but Becky Mode, the author and
a former waitress and restaurant hostess, makes you see the less
obvious ones. There's something about putting a restaurant onstage,
front and center, that forces the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it captures the sheer terror and the unbelievable
chaos that lie behind each night's performance in Manhattan's
theaters of food. The place is not just fully committed, it's
overbooked to the tune of 25 diners. The Zagats have turned up, and
their reservation has been misplaced. An unfortunate accident has
taken place in one of the restrooms, so bad that the busboys have
scattered and hidden. Like a meltdown in a Soviet reactor, none of
this information reaches the public.
</P>
<P>
   By that same mysterious alchemy that produces a memorable
evening of theater, fallible human beings manage to work around the
botched deliveries, the misplaced orders, the last-minute slip-ups
and glitches, and produce perfection on a plate for 70 or 80
demanding diners. The end result is beautiful to behold. The means
resemble trench warfare.
</P>
<P>
   There are casualties along the way. The reservationist who
quakes at the thought of a call from the chef or the maitre d'hotel
does not realize it, but fear runs throughout the chain of command.
The maitre d'hotel, who looks so powerful to the reservationist,
also deals with a thousand petty annoyances and impossible demands.
He dreads the wrath of rich, spoiled customers who can take their
business elsewhere on a whim. The almighty chef, as often as not,
is a welter of neuroses and insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   There's a poignant moment, late in the play, when Sam
offhandedly tells the chef that he doesn't really care for his
orange roughy. The remark lands like a punch to the stomach. ``Do
you like my polenta?'' the chef asks, crushed. The egos are as
enormous as Macy's balloons, and they can be deflated just as
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What chefs send out to the table every night is a peculiar
thing. It is in part a work of art, but more immediate, more
intimate than any work of art can ever be. The primal connection
between food and love adds a powerful psychological charge to the
relationship between a chef, his staff and the diners who sit,
knife and fork in hand, demanding to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   This is an audience with a difference. A playwright has to
satisfy a crowd. A chef and his wait staff have to fashion an
experience table by table, diner by diner. Each customer is an
audience unto himself, with the power to grant or withhold
applause.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the fascinating paradoxes of the restaurant
experience that each table, while imagining itself the audience, is
in fact, for all the other tables, part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   There is an all-consuming, almost infantile, quality to the
egocentrism of the diner. (I'm reminded of it when I see a hungry
customer tuck his napkin in his shirt like a bib.) I think it
accounts for the neurotic behavior one sees so often in
restaurants. The customer who throws a tantrum over a bad table, or
who sends back a perfectly fine dish, is often testing the staff
the way a child tests a parent. It's not about the table, or the
dish. It's about being coddled, or accepted, or even loved.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, it can be a vulgar display of power. There are
people who simply enjoy pushing waiters around. I well remember
eating with a normal-seeming gentleman who sent back a perfectly
prepared fillet of salmon and then turned to me, with a look of
glee on his face, and announced: ``Always send something back. It
makes a point.'' It made a point with me, all right. There are
diners who quiz the waiter on each and every ingredient in a dish,
demand about six substitutions, and send the waiter scurrying on
pointless errands throughout the meal. At a certain point, you
begin to suspect that eating well is not really the purpose of the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   I am told that film-industry executives no longer even bother to
look at a menu. They make a point of tossing it aside, simply
instructing the waiter to have the chef prepare an egg-white omelet
with organic spinach, or mung beans, or whatever it is that
important film people eat these days.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: ``You think the chef is in charge here,
and I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. I'm paying, so that
makes me the producer.'' Hollywood never did go in for the auteur
theory.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder chefs run wild and managers turn to drugs. They're
stuck in an abusive, unequal relationship, frantically eager to
please an inconstant lover whose whims and demands can never be
satisfied. Inevitably, the abused becomes an abuser himself.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that there's a world seething with intrigue and
drama behind those familiar words, ``May I put you on hold,
please?'' The caller, placated with Muzak, doodles aimlessly on a
pad. At the other end of the line, three circles of hell are
rubbing up against each other.

   NEW YORK _ Grape leaves are like escargots, a canned ingredient
that seems too forbidding to use fresh in a home kitchen. But in
one of those increasingly common alliances of farm and chef,
freshly picked grape leaves from vineyards are turning up both in
markets and on menus well beyond Greek and Middle Eastern
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with grape leaves sold in jars, usually imported from
Greece, the fresh local ones have a citrusy, spicy flavor with a
surprisingly herbal bite. They are also more tender, with veins
that are skinnier and less chewy. Now is the time to try them, when
they are easiest to find, even in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Grape leaves, like the grapes themselves, have to be picked by
hand, one at a time. Although they can be harvested at any time in
the grape-growing season, most growers prefer to take them in the
fall, along with the grapes. Only the most tender, bright green
leaves are picked. The older ones will have grown too thick and
sturdy for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   From August to November, Buzzard Crest Vineyards in Penn Yan, in
the Finger Lakes region, brings its leaves on Saturdays to the
Greenmarkets at Union Square in Manhattan and at Grand Army Plaza
and Borough Hall in Brooklyn. They are never on display with the
vineyard's four varieties of grapes also for sale, though. The
leaves are stored in coolers to keep them fresh and must be
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Roth of Wolffer Estate/Sagpond Vineyards on Long Island
also sells fresh grape leaves, but only to restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The most traditional way to use grape leaves is in dolmades, the
Greek appetizer of a seasoned rice mixture wrapped into little
green bundles and braised. They can also be used to enfold any food
destined for the grill, to keep it moist and to add a subtle
flavor. But chefs are doing much more.
</P>
<P>
   Mina Newman, the chef at Layla, a Middle Eastern restaurant in
Tribeca, wraps seasoned shrimp or salmon in fresh grape leaves
before grilling. Marc Meyer of Five Points in the East Village
makes a variation on dolmades with sausage, and Matthew Kenney of
Matthew's on the Upper East Side adds figs, pine nuts and mint to
the Basmati rice in his leaves.
</P>
<P>
   David Cunningham, at the Lenox Room, also on the Upper East
Side, fills fresh grape leaves with an orzo and quail stuffing
before braising them. Scott Conant, at Chianti in midtown, chars
the leaves on the grill to garnish balsamic-glazed eel. And Scott
Campbell, at Avenue on the Upper West Side, wraps them around
halibut before roasting the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newman also dries grape leaves in the oven at low heat with
a thin coating of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt so that they
crisp up into brittle sheets that snap in the mouth like the
thinnest of potato chips. They make an attractive garnish for her
grape leaf-wrapped salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Grape leaves sold in jars have been brined, which softens and
helps preserve them. Fresh leaves have to be blanched to make them
pliable, and a light brining at the same time will also make them
last longer, a month or two in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   To tenderize the leaves without blanching or brining, you can
also freeze them between sheets of parchment; they wilt when they
defrost.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves in jars are much larger than the fresh ones, up to
eight inches in diameter, and have been simmered to make them
tender. They taste of the plain brine, whereas chefs add flavorings
to their salt water: Ms. Newman uses thyme, bay leaf and garlic;
Cunningham adds retsina laced with Greek brandy, Conant a touch of
balsamic vinegar. Campbell skips brining but blanches leaves in
muscadet.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Botsacos, the chef at Molyvos in midtown, uses grape leaves
from jars because they are always available and all about the same
size. To eliminate the heavily salted taste, though, he first boils
them in lemon-spiked water, then shocks them in ice water.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh leaves have a much greener, woodsier flavor than the
kind in jars, but both work well in recipes. One key is to use the
smallest leaves, which are noticeably thinner and more tender than
the larger ones, and to snip off the central stem with kitchen
shears.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greenmarkets, Buzzard Crest sells bags of leaves,
containing about two dozen, for $4. The owner, Ken Farnan, will
fill orders with a few days' notice (315-536-9686).
</P>
<P>
   The Chef's Garden (800-289-4644), which supplies Layla, will
ship leaves for a minimum order of $50, plus shipping. The price of
100 grape leaves is $35, and the order can be filled out with
seasonal vegetables.

CHEVRE LEARNS SOME NEW TRICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JEANNETTE FERRARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here in the Bay Area, goat cheese is not just
goat cheese. It has colorful names like Hyku, Humboldt Fog and
Tomme Tumalo. Occasionally it masquerades as camembert and even
cheddar. And it constantly dazzles.
</P>
<P>
   This region, where goat cheese was effectively introduced to the
American palate some 20 years ago, has nurtured inventive
cheesemakers who have been experimenting with different breeds,
terrains in which to raise them, and animal feeds. This new
generation of goat cheeses has inspired chefs here to create new
distinctive dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bertolli, a firm believer that cheese is ``the soul of the
soil,'' recently tried to prove his point by gathering two dozen
people at his restaurant, Oliveto, in Oakland, for a discussion of
cheese and terroir.
</P>
<P>
   Terroir is a word French winemakers use to describe the
environment in which their grapes are grown, and it is the latest
buzz word among artisanal cheesemakers, allowing chefs to select
goat cheeses from different regions for their distinctive tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolli followed the discussion with a dinner that used cheeses
from the Northern California coast, including grilled figs with
ash-tinged Humboldt Fog, fried squash blossoms stuffed with Redwood
Hill goat cheese, and pork rib chops with grilled tomatoes and
Redwood's goat camembert.
</P>
<P>
   Few ould have predicted this happy obsession 20 years ago, when
Laura Chenel of Santa Rosa, who had begun to produce little rounds
of goat cheese as she had learned in France, first presented her
cheeses to Alice Waters at Chez Panisse, the Berkeley restaurant
known for its devotion to pristine ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Chenel's amazement, Ms. Waters tasted and then said,
``Can you make me 60 for next week?''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Waters paired that cheese with baby greens, it was a
hit. ``That salad signaled quite a revolution,'' said Daphne Zepos,
a cheese authority and writer. Goat cheese became a trendy
ingredient, and artisanal cheesemaking became viable.
</P>
<P>
   Local chefs use goat cheese _ fresh or aged, soft or crumbly,
spreadable or hard _ for any course. At the famous sidewalk tables
at Enrico's, in North Beach, the favorite is smoked salmon and goat
cheese bruschetta, drizzled with cucumber jam.
</P>
<P>
   At Silks, downtown, Dante Boccuzzi makes crisp goat cheese
beignets suffused with the flavors of a pepper-rosemary marinade.
For dessert, goat cheese ice cream with a huckleberry lemon verbena
compote comes on buttery wedges of pistachio shortbread.
</P>
<P>
   Diners at Jardiniere can begin with Traci Des Jardin's parfait
of roasted beets and creamy goat cheese. Desserts include a goat's
milk sorbet served with lavender-scented strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese trolley has been restored to its former glory at
Campton Place, downtown, where Yerba Santa Alpine Chevre sits on a
silver tray alongside some of the world's best cheeses. The
flavor-dense menu of the executive chef, Laurent Manrique,
showcases asparagus with chevre and wild mushrooms and a goat
cheese tart with piquillo peppers and fried artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Girl and the Fig, in the Sonoma wine country town of Glen
Ellen, the chef and owner, Sondra Bernstein, has an updated fondue
in which Juniper Grove Tomme Tumalo is mixed with sauteed
chanterelles and shiitakes and served with chunks of pear or slices
of grilled eggplant for dipping.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Bernstein presents her cheese course with little
descriptive cards; recent selections included Redwood Hill's goat
milk teleme and Goat's Leap Hyku.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Chez Panisse, where it all began, goat cheese in
the company of pancetta adorns frittatas; with an herb or two, it
is snuggled into the restaurant's ever-popular crostata, a
two-crusted pizza.
</P>
<P>
   As a condiment, a spice or the star of the dish, goat cheese
continues to find new ways of tantalizing chef and diner alike.

flour, and mix until smooth. Place in refrigerator until ready to
use.
</P>
<P>
   2. To prepare dough: Place one sheet of phyllo dough on work
surface. With pastry brush, apply a coat of clarified butter.
Sprinkle with sugar. Place another sheet of phyllo on top, and
repeat, ending with a third sheet of phyllo. Brush that layer with
butter, and set stack aside. Repeat process, making a total of 6
stacks.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make fruit garnish: Combine sugar, white wine and vanilla
bean in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Lower heat slightly and
cook until mixture has been reduced by two-thirds. Remove vanilla
bean. Melt butter in a saute pan over medium heat, and add fruit.
Cook until softened but not mushy, 8 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place a stack of layered phyllo
on a clean dry surface. With a sharp knife, cut 3 circles 5{ inches
in diameter, cutting through to bottom of stack. Repeat with
remaining stacks until you have 18 circles of layered dough.
</P>
<P>
   5. Spread 2 tablespoons of goat cheese mixture in center of a
circle, leaving a margin of about an inch. Place another circle on
top. Fold edges of phyllo up and over to seal all around. Bake on
cookie sheet 7 to 10 minutes or until golden brown.

and food, only a few businesses have real staying power. Or so
you'd think. &HT;    But this year, a surprising number of local food and wine
enterprises are celebrating their 20th anniversaries. The Bay Area

entrepreneurs who had a good idea in 1979 and ran with it: Laura
Chenel Chevre, Acacia Winery, Greens and Zuni restaurants and Tante

 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The ingredients that accompany Aaron Peters' Wild
Striped Bass _ crescent potatoes, salsify and Jerusalem artichokes
_ are exciting in themselves. A delicate parsley salad, glistening
with Meyer lemon vinaigrette, rounds out this wonderful dish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wild bass is one of the staple dishes at Aram's, a
pan-Mediterranean restaurant tucked into an alley off Sacramento in
Presidio Heights. Located in the former home of Rosmarino, the
restaurant is now owned by Khajag and Hildy Sarkissian, former
proprietors of the Caravansary restaurants and the team that
introduced Aram sandwiches to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Peters trained in much the same manner as the best
European chefs. He started working in the kitchen of Kuleto's when
he was 16 years old and then moved on to Aqua, Square One and
PlumpJack Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   At Aram's, which has a comfortable feel and a stylish decor that
reflects the affluent neighborhood, Peters crafts some creative
dishes using simple techniques and out-of-the-mainstream
ingredients. However, in the case of this fish dish, the Jerusalem
artichokes, also known as sunchokes, and the salsify, sometimes
called oyster plant because of its briny flavor, are available at
many upscale supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Aram's, 3665 Sacramento St. (near Spruce), San Francisco;

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Vegetables
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into
1/4-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Ruby Crescent or other red-skinned potatoes, cut into
3/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound salsify, peeled and cut into 3/4-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups unsalted chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Meyer Lemon Vinaigrette
</P>
<P>
   1 Meyer lemon or other lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced shallot
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   The Fish
</P>
<P>
   6 wild striped bass or sea bass fillets, about 5 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups Italian parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the vegetables:  &LR; Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the Jerusalem artichokes, potatoes and salsify in a
large ovenproof skillet. Add the oil and toss to coat. Season with
salt and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes. Transfer the pan to a
stovetop burner (medium heat). Add the stock and thyme. Bring to a
boil, scraping up any browned bits. Continue to cook until the
liquid is reduced by about one third and is syrupy, about 10
minutes. Add the butter and stir until melted. Season with
additional salt and pepper if necessary. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the Meyer lemon vinaigrette:  &LR; Zest the lemon, leaving the
zest in long threads, and reserve for the salad. Squeeze the juice
from the lemon into a small bowl. Add the Champagne vinegar, rice
vinegar, shallot and mustard. Gradually whisk in the olive oil.
Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the fish:  &LR; Season the fish with a liberal amount of salt
and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large saute pan
until just smoking. Gently add half of the fish, skin side down.
Cook until the skin is brown and crispy, about 3 minutes. Using a
spatula, carefully turn the fish over and continue cooking until
just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the fish to a
platter. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat the process with the remaining oil and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the parsley leaves and reserved lemon zest in a small
bowl. Add the vinaigrette and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the vegetables among serving plates. Top with the fish.
Garnish each plate with parsley salad and drizzle with any
remaining vinaigrette.
</P>

 BEST WAY: Dried Beans   By Stephen Baker  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Dried beans can be confounding to cook perfectly.
Should they be soaked or not? And when should you add salt?
<TEXT>
<P>
   To find out, we tried several methods of preparing black turtle
beans, looking for two things _ the best texture and the best
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   We soaked one batch overnight and one by the quick-soak method
(boiling them for 2 minutes, then letting them soak for 1 hour).
One batch was cooked without any soaking.
</P>
<P>
   We also experimented adding salt at different points _ at the
start of soaking, at the start of cooking, 30 minutes into cooking,
and at the end of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; _ &UR; Texture. &LR;  Food Department staffers picked the quick-soaked beans
as having the best overall texture. The beans were smooth, without
any grainy sensation, and most beans had the skins intact.
</P>
<P>
   The skins of the beans that had soaked overnight tended to
split, letting the cooking water penetrate the beans so that they
became very soft.
</P>
<P>
   The beans that had not been soaked at all had a grainy
mouthfeel. The skins seemed cooked but the interior of the beans
was unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Flavor &LR; . After picking the quick-soak method as our favorite,
we cooked quick-soaked beans in four batches, salting them four
different ways. Food staffers were surprised by the best-tasting
ones _ the beans that had been salted at the end of cooking. They
had a nice flavor throughout.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  The beans that were salted 30 minutes into cooking had a better
overall appearance, with fewer split skins. These beans might work
better in a salad, whereas the beans salted at the end would work
best for soups or stews.

 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  As a possible drizzly fall looms, we start to
gravitate to the foods of the hearth. Sunday afternoon is the time
to create thick, steamy vegetable soups or meat loaves with
Grandma's secret sauce. It might even be time to pull out the bread
maker.
<P>
   And what could be more homey than chicken potpie? Of course, you
can buy them ready-made any time of the year. But this week's Now &AMP;
Later recipe isn't difficult to make, and it's a whole lot better
than those frozen supermarket potpies. Made in individual portions,
these scrumptious pies have a generous filling of wild mushrooms
and boneless chicken breast in a decadent-tasting
sherry-and-shallot sauce. A flaky puff pastry crust tops each one.
</P>
<P>
   After you've completed the recipe, not only will you enjoy
potpies for dinner that night, you'll have a batch for your freezer
for that cold, rainy night when you don't feel like cooking.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Frittata with Prosciutto and
Roma Tomatoes, is a gorgeous combination of fluffy eggs, salty
prosciutto, ripe tomato and soft, creamy cheese. Looking something
like a pizza, this quick dish works great for either brunch or
dinner, accompanied by country bread and a salad.
</P>
<P>
   What makes frittatas different from omelets is that they are
open-face and partially cooked in an oven-proof skillet, then
placed in the oven to finish cooking. If you layer the topping
carefully, leaving a wide border around the edge, the eggs will
fluff up under the broiler and get golden and crusty. The melted
fontina on top smells like heaven as it comes out of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-Minute Main Course is a brothy pasta made with tiny pasta
shapes intended for soups. Swiss chard, which is sauteed with
garlic then wilted in stock, is added to this, creating a wholesome
broth.
</P>
<P>
   The flavors in this dish are straightforward. The contrast of
textures is what makes it special: Al dente pasta floating in
broth, tender wilted chard, crunchy, briny chunks of pecorino
cheese and crispy toasts. They all come together in a very
satisfying way.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FRITTATA WITH PROSCIUTTO &AMP; ROMA TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   10 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup grated fontina cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe Roma tomatoes, sliced into very thin rounds
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 slices prosciutto (about 1/4 pound), cut into bite-size
pieces
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the broiler before beginning preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the eggs in a bowl, seasoning them with pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare the other ingredients before starting to cook the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a nonstick oven-proof skillet over medium
heat. Pour in the eggs. As the eggs cook, lift the bottom with a
rubber spatula to prevent them from sticking and to allow the
uncooked egg to run underneath. Cook until the bottom is set and
the top still runny, about 5 to 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the eggs from the heat. Sprinkle most of the cheese on
top, then arrange a layer of tomatoes over the cheese, leaving a
1-inch border around the outside. Sprinkle the prosciutto pieces
over the tomatoes, then top with the remaining cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pan directly under the broiler until the cheese is
melted and the egg cooked through; the edges should be puffy and
golden brown. This takes about 3 minutes.

 &LR; PASTA IN BRODO WITH SWISS CHARD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   12 slices baguette, cut thinly on an angle
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound tiny pasta (see note)
</P>
<P>
   8 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches Swiss chard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons grated pecorino or Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning preparation, preheat the oven to 400 degrees
and begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Place the bread slices on a cookie sheet and toast in the oven
until browned on one side, about 5 minutes. Turn the slices and
toast the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Begin cooking the pasta. When it is al dente, drain (reserving 2
cups of the cooking water) and rinse briefly under cold tap water.
</P>
<P>
   While the pasta is cooking, put the garlic through a garlic
press; trim the stems off the chard. Stack the leaves, slice them
in half lengthwise, then slice them crosswise into thin ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a large heavy stock pot over medium heat.
Add the garlic and cook until it begins to release its aroma, 1 to
2 minutes. Stir in the chard and cook for 5 minutes. Add the broth
and cook until the chard is tender, about 2 to 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cooked pasta to the stock pot, then the reserved
pasta-cooking water and heat through. There should be plenty of
liquid. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, portion the soup into bowls. Top with a liberal amount
of cheese and the toasts. Ladle a little broth on top to moisten
the toasts.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; There are many different types of tiny pasta shapes
traditionally used in Italian brothy soup, or brodo. Look for small
1-pound boxes of pasta labeled  &LR; acini di pepe &LR;  (peppercorns),
pastina, riso,  &LR; semi di melone  &LR; (melon seeds) or orzo.

 &LR; CHICKEN POTPIE WITH WILD MUSHROOMS &AMP; SHALLOTS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:

<P>
   1 pound mixed wild mushrooms, such as shiitake and oyster
mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 pound button mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken stock or low-salt broth
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   4 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds boneless chicken breasts (about 4 breasts)
</P>
<P>
   8 carrots, cut in medium dice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   12 shallots, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   2 sheets prepared puff pastry (17.3-ounce package), defrosted
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Have ready 12 four-inch-diameter tartlet pans (see note).
</P>
<P>
   Trim off mushroom stems and reserve. Slice the mushroom caps,
but keep the heartier mushrooms like shiitakes separate from the
lighter oyster and button mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Place the stock in a large pot. Add the mushroom stems, bay leaf
and thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, then add the chicken and reduce
the heat to simmer. Cover and poach until the chicken is cooked
through, about 8 minutes. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon
and set on a cutting board to cool. When cool, cut into medium
dice.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the stock into a smaller saucepan, discarding the
mushroom stems, thyme sprigs and bay leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
</P>
<P>
   Return the stock to a boil and add the carrots. Blanch until
tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon to the ice
water, reserving the stock. When the carrots are cool, drain and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the shallots into eighths lengthwise, but do not cut all the
way through. You want the slices to remain attached at one end.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
shallots and cook until browned, stirring frequently, about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the shiitake mushrooms, if using, and the minced thyme;
season with salt and pepper. Saute for 3 minutes, stirring
frequently. Add the button and oyster mushrooms and saute until
tender and all liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Deglaze the pan with the sherry, and cook over medium-high heat
for 2 minutes, until the liquid evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the vegetables with the flour, 1 tablespoon at a time,
and stir to incorporate over very low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add the reserved stock to the pan, scraping the bottom to remove
any stuck bits. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until there
is no raw flour taste, at least 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the chicken and carrots to the mushroom sauce; stir to
incorporate. If the sauce is very thick, add a bit more stock, but
be careful, the sauce will thin out when the potpies are baked.
Adjust seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the puff pastry to extend it by about 2 inches in
length and width, making sure each sheet is large enough to cover 6
tartlet pans. Turn one tartlet pan over to use as a stencil. Using
a sharp paring knife, cut out 6 circles from each sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle equal portions of filling into each tartlet pan. Place a
pastry circle on top and crimp the edges with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the beaten egg with 2 tablespoons water. Lightly brush the
top of each pie with this egg wash.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the pies in a 375 oven until the tops are puffy and golden
brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 12 potpies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Foil tartlet pans are available at many supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Freezing Note:  &LR; If you plan to freeze part of this recipe,
freeze it before baking. Wait until the filling has cooled, then
wrap the uncooked pies in freezer paper, then in foil. Defrost the
pies in the refrigerator then bake as directed above.

 CRUSH '99: Final Vintage of Century Turns Frantic   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The last vintage of the century may make the
record books as the one of the fastest vintages ever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As recently as late September, Napa Valley winemakers and
vineyard managers were twiddling their thumbs, waiting impatiently
for grapes to ripen. Then a week of 100-degree, low-humidity
weather sent grape sugars soaring. Vineyard crews scrambled to get
the grapes picked before they dehydrated, and winemakers grappled
with the nightmarish possibility of all the vineyards coming in at
once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody at Mondavi described it as sitting on your hands for
a month and then the barn burns down,'' says Paul Jackson, a
vineyard manager for Honig Cellars, Grgich Hills and other Napa
Valley properties. ``Wineries went from zero to full capacity in a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Few wineries can afford to build a facility big enough to handle
this worst-case scenario. Most years, they can count on grapes
progressing through their fermenting tanks in stages. When
everything arrives at once, there may not be enough fermenting
space; to keep wine moving from tanks into barrels, winemakers may
have to press a red wine off its skins before it has macerated as
long as they might like.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they may have to leave ripe grapes hanging in the
vineyard because they have no place to put them. ``That's starting
to happen,'' Jackson says. ``The grapes are ready to go and the
tanks are full.'' Fortunately, irrigation can help keep the berries
hydrated until the winery has room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have crushed as much as we can physically bring in here,''
confirms Michael Havens of Havens Wine Cellars in Yountville. ``We
worked something like 100 hours last week, getting out of here on
average at 1 a.m.. We crushed around 220 tons, better than half of
our crush.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat also produced some of the highest grape sugars in
winemakers' memories, with grapes coming in at 27 or 28 degrees
brix, instead of the more typical 23 or 24. Unless winemakers
dilute the juice with water _ a widespread if not widely admitted
practice _ such grapes could produce overly alcoholic wines,
possibly with some residual sugar. Winemakers also worry that the
grapes, while technically ripe, won't have the soft tannins and
developed flavors that come with maturity.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the grapes have good acidity, says Jackson,
which is often lacking in California. And some grapes that weren't
picked during the heat wave have rehydrated in the cooler weather,
dropping a couple of degrees brix.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Havens says his grapes were showing signs of
maturity _ brown seeds and soft tannins in the skin _ before the
heat struck and should therefore make fine wine. If that's true for
others, too, this abnormal vintage could have a normal outcome.

wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders.  AT THE SOURCE: Touting Benefits of Crucifers  
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 BOLINAS, Calif. _  No plants have ever had such good publicity as
have cruciferous vegetables in the last decade. Pharmaceutical
researchers, nutritionists and food scientists have all touted
crucifers' benefits to health.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The vegetables are loaded not just with useful fiber and
vitamins (A and C), but they've got phytochemicals, sulforaphane,
indoles _ all compounds that are believed to fight everything from
colon and breast cancer to Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   So if broccoli, cauliflower and their various cousins in the
vegetable patch are life-enhancers, are they even more so when
grown organically?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to the people at Warren Weber's Star Route Farm
in Bolinas. They believe their organic crops are not only healthier
but that they taste better than their conventionally grown
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what customers tell us,'' says production manager
Douglas Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer feedback is an advantage of entering the farmers'
market business, which the 25-year-old Star Route Farm did this
year, making its products more widely available to consumers who
increasingly ask for organic produce.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Gallagher says, Star Route's 40 acres _
supplemented by twice that acreage at its satellite farm in the
Coachella Valley of Southern California _ would have been
considered large for an organic operation. Now, he says, the
operation is small fish in an expanding pond, as many large-scale
farms jump on the organic bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons include greater consumer awareness as well as the
development of natural pest-fighting products and fertilizers,
which can be applied with conventional machinery. ``You don't have
to make your own compost any more,'' Gallagher points out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Star Route relies heavily on a natural crop cycle to
maintain its soil and guarantee healthy and plentiful future crops.
As soon as the last broccoli and cauliflower are harvested _ in a
few more weeks _ the Bolinas fields will be planted with clover and
other cover crops that get plowed under in the spring. Star Route's
restaurant and retail customers will then receive essentially the
same crops (broccoli, lettuces, herbs, flowers and root vegetables)
from the Coachella Valley farm, which, in turn, converts to cover
crops for the hot summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher says Star Route's location on a flood plain is ideal
for cool-weather lovers like broccoli. The heavy soil (technically,
blucher loam) isn't well suited for root vegetables, but the
crucifers thrive here from spring to fall _ even into mid-winter if
it's a dry year.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from large farms that have switched to organic
practices _ some as far away as Arizona and Mexico _ may benefit
consumers by driving prices down, but it's obviously a concern for
small operations.
</P>
<P>
   Weber and Gallagher are part of a group of west Marin growers
who are working with the county's Agricultural Commissioner's
Office to create a Marin organic label to promote the use of
locally grown produce.
</P>
<P>
   Support from trend-setting restaurateurs who want their produce
not only fresh and natural but locally grown if at all feasible, is
a boon to farms like Star Route. Plus, it helps to be virtually in
the backyard of a metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can drive to Ferry Plaza (site of a Saturday farmers'
market) in an hour,'' says Gallagher, so the distance, and time,
from field to table are about as short as they can get.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Kellogg's Crowned King of Toaster Pastries   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For a quick breakfast, many people, especially
children, turn to toaster pastries. A few minutes in the toaster,
and out pops a hot, sweet treat that can be eaten on the way to
school or work.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six frosted strawberry toaster pastries,
including three labled as low-fat. While the prices were fairly
similar, the nutritional profile differed, and not just in terms of
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the pastries were fortified with vitamins and minerals.
All were high in carbohydrates, with sugar accounting for almost
half of them in all the pastries. The full-fat varieties all
contained five grams of fat per pastry, while the low-fat ranged
from two to three grams.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists chose  &UR; Kellogg's Pop-Tarts &LR;  (14.7 ounces, $2.49-$2.99
at many supermarkets) as the best. Three panelists liked the
strawberry flavor; one described it as ``best of the bunch.'' Two
others detected a bitter edge. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Toastettes &LR;  from Nabisco (13 ounces, $1.69 at Andronico's) came
in second. One panelist thought the neon-pink color was ideal for
kids, but another described it as off-putting. Another taster
thought the pastry was too sweet and lacked fruit filling, but
others liked the flavor and texture. Four might buy it; one would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway &LR;  (11 ounces, $2.19 at Safeway) scored just four points
below Toastettes. Two panelists complained of a too-thick pastry;
others thought the pastry was bland and salty. One panelist thought
the filling had an off-flavor, but another particularly liked it.
Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Auburn Farms Toast'n Jammers &LR;  (11 ounces,
$2.49 at Whole Foods), one of the low-fat pastries. Three panelists
disliked the filling, noting that it had very little strawberry
flavor (the package also does not list strawberry in the
ingredients, only apple flakes and beet juice). One panelist liked
the softer pastry and less-sweet filling, but another objected to
the royal-icinglike frosting. One would buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kellogg's Low-Fat Pop-Tarts &LR;  (14.7 ounces, $4.29-$2.59 at many
supermarkets) ranked just below Auburn Farms. All of the panelists
disliked the filling, saying it tasted fake and overly perfumed.
They also complained of metallic, bitter and salty flavors in the
dough. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barbara's Nature's Choice &LR;  also was tasted but ranked too low
to rate. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Roland
Passot, chef/owner La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and menlo Park; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and
Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. All products are

 20 Good Years: Five Bay Area trendsetters celebrate two decades  of
defining what we eat.   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  In the trend-smitten world of wine and food, only
a few businesses have real staying power. Or so you'd think.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this year, a surprising number of local food and wine
enterprises _ many of which have shaped the way Americans eat _ are
celebrating their 20th anniversaries. Remember when goat cheese
salad was a novelty? When vegetarian food was always brown? When
California Pinot Noir smelled like _ well, let's not go there.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area's celebrated dining scene owes a giant debt to some
entrepreneurs who had a good idea in 1979 and ran with it. That's
when Laura Chenel began trying to turn her goat's milk into cheese
and inadvertently launched an American cheese revolution. That's
when Michael Richmond and partners made their first Acacia Pinot
Noirs, acclaimed wines that boosted the reputation of that varietal
in California. That's when Greens opened in Fort Mason, shattering
perceptions about stodgy vegetarian food. And 20 years ago, Mary
Risley opened Tante Marie's, a professional cooking school as
ambitious as any in Paris or London. The esteemed Hayes Street
Grill dates from 1979, as do Opus One, J. Fritz and S. Anderson
wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Why did these businesses thrive when so many worthy others fell
by the wayside? To find out, we surveyed some survivors. We heard
about good decisions, bad decisions, failed partnerships, blessed
partnerships, good times and lean times, highlights and fears.
Their recollections provide a lively look back at the past 20 years
in wine and food.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; GREENS RESTAURANT
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Then: &LR;  Motivated by the success of their Tassajara Bakery,
practitioners from San Francisco's Zen Center opened a vegetarian
restaurant in a former warehouse at Fort Mason in San Francisco in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a $300,000 budget, contractors raised the floor
two-and-a-half feet so guests could see the marina. Zen Center
carpenters used 12 types of wood on the stairs, wall paneling, bar
and Shaker-style tables. Deborah Madison, who had cooked for the
Zen Center abbot's guests and at the Tassajara retreat near Carmel,
was the obvious choice for chef. The other employees were
restaurant neophytes working to fulfill their Zen practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened in a backwards way,'' recalls Annie Somerville, who
joined Greens in 1981 and has been its chef since 1985. ``Most
restaurants open for dinner; Greens opened for lunch. That was so
people who worked here could go to the meditation hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early employees worked for minimum wage or for room
and board, and all their tips went back to the Zen Center. But
Greens' evolved from a not-for-profit, Buddhist-staffed business to
a for-profit business with mostly non-Buddhist employees after
1983. In the spring of that year, abbot Richard Baker resigned
under a cloud, and disillusionment swept the Zen Center. People
stopped coming to work in its businesses, says Somerville, and
Greens began hiring people from outside the fold.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the early days, when service was famously inept,
critics and customers recognized Greens as a landmark restaurant.
For the first time in most observers' memories, vegetarian food had
been given a beautiful setting and serious treatment.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Now: &LR;  Only a handful of employees have a connection to the
Zen Center, although the restaurant is still a Zen Center business.
But perhaps the bigger change for Greens has been the emergence of
so many competitors _ not just vegetarian restaurants, but
conventional restaurants with vegetarian options on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to feel threatened by other vegetarian restaurants
opening, but now I see competition as helpful,'' Somerville says.
The competitive pressure keeps employees in peak-performance mode,
she argues. ``I don't think you can let it slip.''
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen used cream and cheese liberally in the early years,
partly to compensate for lack of meat. But as tastes have changed,
so has Greens' cooking. Today it's lighter and less
dairy-dependent, more clearly focused on showcasing produce from
the Zen Center's Green Gulch Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Greens serves lunch, Sunday brunch, dinner and late-night
dessert and has a take-out counter. But there's still just one
Greens, the same size as it always was.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, the decision to expand comes early on when
things are going great and everybody's walking through the door,''
Somerville says. ``You spend all this money, but a year later
something's different and customers aren't there and you're out a
lot of money. We're still here because we keep changing, but we do
it very slowly and conservatively.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; LAURA CHENEL CHEVRE
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Then: &LR;  In the early 1970s, Chenel was living on a small farm
in Forestville and tending a garden, fruit trees, chickens, bees
and a few goats. The idea was to be self-sufficient, she says, but
the goats captured her fancy and she began breeding them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, I had a lot of little mouths to feed,'' she recalls,
and she began exploring the idea of making cheese so she could
afford to keep her goats.
</P>
<P>
   Chenel admits her initial cheeses were underwhelming. When
someone brought her some French chevre, she finally realized what
her goats' milk could do. In 1979, she went to France and in a few
months learned enough to come home.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Chenel took her new cheeses to Helen Allen,
then a cheese merchant in San Francisco. ``I know somebody who
would really like this,'' says Allen, who sent Chenel to Chez
Panisse.
</P>

   ``Alice (Waters) just flipped,'' Chenel recalls. ``She called
everybody around to taste it and placed a standing order
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Now: &LR;  Chenel makes about 700,000 pounds of goat cheese a year.
It's become so mainstream that it's a staple on mass-market pizza
and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Despite steady growth, Chenel says little else in the business
has changed. She still makes her goat cheeses the same way and has
hardly raised her prices in 20 years. In the early 1980s, Chenel
reluctantly gave up her herd to concentrate on cheesemaking, but
when she moved her bursting-at-the-seams business into the former
Stornetta Dairy in Sonoma in 1993, she had room for goats again.
She now has 450.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has added so much to my life,'' Chenel says. ``Now if I
have anything I worry about at night, it's, `Are the goats OK?' ''

 &LR; TANTE MARIE'S
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Then: &LR;  For five years in the mid-1970s, Mary Risley taught
French cooking informally out of her San Francisco flat on
Leavenworth Street. Then she started to get calls from strangers
about enrollment procedures and fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say, `I don't have a full-time school. You'll have
to go to Paris,''' Risley recalls. ``So I thought, `Why do people
have to go to Paris to learn fine cooking?'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Risley launched Tante Marie's Cooking School in a
storefront on a residential block of Telegraph Hill. The program
was ``in the manner of the Cordon Bleu,'' says Risley, with morning
participation classes and afternoon demonstrations. She opened with
one full-time student whose formidable curriculum included French
cooking with Jeremiah Tower, Italian cooking with Carlo Middione
and Chinese cooking with Ken Hom.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, her investors encouraged her to stop the full-time
program. ``They said, `It's not going to make you money,' '' Risley
recalls. ``So I got rid of (them).''
</P>
<P>
   Her full-time school eventually did take off, especially when
Risley changed from a nine-month program to two six-month programs
a year. But her individual classes (1979 prices: $48 for six
classes) have always been well-subscribed, in the early days
primarily by non-working wives who wanted to learn how to make puff
pastry, breaded and fried Camembert and charlotte Malakoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Now: &LR;  Risley's school offers 800 classes a year (six classes:
$480), from bread baking to Shanghai-style cooking. She doesn't see
many non-working wives anymore, but neither does she see the young,
college-educated people who, 20 years ago, wanted to work in the
restaurant industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to work for $18,000 a year,'' Risley says.
``The educated-kids-going-into-kitchens isn't happening anymore.
They realize they can't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Her students have changed in other ways, too. In the old days,
attendees at least knew the basic etiquette of dining. They knew
how to set a table and how much wine to put in a glass.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Recently, the straight-talking Risley taught a
weekend class-cum-party for a dozen executives of a prominent
online business. The party favors were Harley-Davidsons.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were drinking $300 and $600 bottles of wine all
weekend, but when I asked, `Does anybody want to know how to open a
bottle?,' they all came running over. Because they don't know. You
ask, `Would you set the table?' and they reply, `What side does the
fork go on?' I'm not kidding. You wouldn't believe the number of
times I have to say, `Stop filling the glass up. People will think
you drink in cheap bars.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole generation of youngsters with a lot of money
who don't know that the wine glass goes over here and the bread and
butter plate there. That's what is propelling my biz now.''
</P>
<P>
   The past year brought Risley two major honors. Bon Appetit
magazine chose her as its first Cooking Teacher of the Year. And
for her considerable charitable work, Risley founded Foodrunners,
an organization that collects and distributes excess restaurant
food to shelters _ she was named the James Beard Foundation's
Humanitarian of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ACACIA WINERY
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Then: &LR;  In 1979, Michael Richmond, a longtime employee of
Freemark Abbey, teamed up with attorney Jerry Goldstein to raise
money for a 15,000-case winery that would make Chardonnay and Pinot
Noir in the Burgundian style. To persuade potential investors that
he knew what he was doing, Richmond poured his homemade wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oddly enough, those little homemade wines went a long way,
which surprised me,'' Richmond says. ``Homemade wine is a lot
different from running a winery.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the pair raised a little over $1 million,
purchased a half-interest in a Carneros vineyard and began making
wine in a rented facility using the methods they had seen in a
two-week tour of Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started Acacia, newspaper wine writers wrote about how
bad California Pinot Noir was and how California would never make
decent Pinot Noir,'' Richmond recalls. ``Our Pinot Noir label was a
knockoff of French labels because we didn't want to be associated
with California wines.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the partners built a winery building and began enjoying
acclaim for their wines. But in 1986, the business almost capsized.
Plans to expand into Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Sauvignon ran
afoul of some of the original investors; in the ensuing turmoil,
Goldstein was forced out and the winery was sold to the Chalone
Wine Group. Richmond, who had started Acacia because he wanted to
make wine, became Chalone Wine Group's vice president of sales.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Now: &LR;  ``Chalone resurrected the winery, basically,'' says
Richmond, who returned to Acacia as general manager about a year
ago. Now at 45,000 cases of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, the winery
plans to top out at 75,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond believes that one of the biggest changes in the 20
years since Acacia's founding is the respect that California Pinot
Noirs now earn. And all those critics who used to write that the
varietal had no future here? ``It's probably been seven, eight,
maybe 10 years since I've seen anyone mention that,'' he says.
Acacia recently changed its label to one that is ``solidly
Californian,'' he points out. ``I don't really care about French
associations in our package anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ZUNI CAFE
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Then: &LR;  With a $10,000 investment, Billy West started a
nine-table sandwich shop in San Francisco in 1979. He called it
Zuni Cafe. The restaurant had a hot plate but little else in the
way of a kitchen. Vince Calcagno, now a partner, remembers his
first meal there: swordfish cooked on a Weber grill in the back
alley.
</P>
<P>
   Calcagno, who at the time was a waiter at the new Hayes Street
Grill, became friendly with the Zuni owner; in 1981, he succumbed
to West's pleas to join the growing business.
</P>
<P>
   The early years were lean ones. Calcagno recalls serving diners
upstairs by candlelight because the upper room had no electricity.
``You couldn't see your food,'' he says, ``which might have been a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiters made scrambled eggs with the steamer on the espresso
machine. (Don't ask about the coffee.) Despite its physical
challenges, the restaurant grew in popularity under the wildly
eclectic chef James Moore and, later, the Mediterranean-inspired
Kathi Riley. Black bean soup and guacamole with chips were menu
staples, and serapes covered the banquettes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the two partners persuaded Judy Rodgers, whose cooking
they had admired at Benicia's Union Hotel, to take over the stoves.
The guacamole and black bean soup vanished and were replaced by
house-cured anchovies, the now-legendary hamburger and a much more
focused Mediterranean approach. Rodgers is now Calcagno's partner;
West died of AIDS in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the partners acquired the light-filled corner space to
the east but it took three years for them to amass enough money to
remodel it. Calcagno himself sledgehammered the floor and painted
the purple and green bathrooms. ``A lot of stuff was done like
that,'' he says. ``We had our pastry chef in a plastic bubble for a
long time, and she was such a good sport about it. But you had to
be. Everything was so homemade.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Now: &LR;  Zuni Cafe is a $5 million-a-year business and one of
the nation's most influential restaurants. After years of hounding
from publishers, Rodgers recently signed a contract to produce a
Zuni cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Calcagno says the pivotal decisions were bringing
Rodgers in as a partner and adding hard liquor in the late 1980s.
Fearful that a drinking crowd would compromise the food, the
partners had resisted. But today Zuni's lively bar is one of the
most popular places in the city for sophisticated hanging out.

   ``In the 1970s, it wasn't a question of what kind of wine list a
restaurant had, but did the restaurant have a wine list at all?
There were only maybe 200 wineries then, and we would help each
other get our wines on the list. Now there's a level of competition
that doesn't necessarily preclude that, but we know that if one of
our wines goes on, another winery's (wine) goes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest change is that wine and dining go together now.

   ``When I walk into a new restaurant now and it's a $2 million or

they going to pay for this? Because I know how much restaurants
make. That's why a lot of people go under, and that's one of the
biggest differences between then and now. The real investment then
was your time and energy.''  &LR; _ Vince Calcagno, &LR;   &LR; Zuni Cafe &LR;

Greens.'''  &LR; _ Mary Risley, Tante Marie's Cooking School &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ On what keeps them awake at night: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that people are getting more impressed by weird
dishes that have too many ingredients, and they are starting to
forget what simple (food) is. Look at the horrible comedians
getting $20 million for a movie. They're not even funny. They're
just crude, and that's a threat to me _ that people wouldn't
recognize quality. I worry about society in general deteriorating
and not realizing what good things are.''  &LR; _ Vince Calcagno, Zuni &LR; 
 &LR; Cafe &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are selling (wine) to such a rarefied portion of the
population. There are tea drinkers and Coke drinkers and Snapple
drinkers, but there's not a broad base of wine drinkers.
Advertising money is shaping the taste of Americans. It's the
Kendall-Jacksons and the Gallos that are going to save our industry
because they're going to put money into national advertising.''  &LR; _

ZUNI CAFE'S CHOCOLATE POT DE CREME
</P>
<P>
   This rich dessert has been served at Zuni since the early 1980s,
well before the restaurant's famous hamburger, roast chicken or
gateau Victoire made the menu. The chocolate version is the most
requested flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   8 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the chocolate with 1/2 cup of the cream in a 2-quart
saucepan or in a bowl over simmering water. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the remaining 1 cup cream, the milk and sugar in a
saucepan and warm until the sugar dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the yolks in a bowl, then slowly stir in the warm cream
mixture. Pour the resulting custard mixture through a strainer into
the melted chocolate and stir to combine.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the mixture into 6 custard cups and place them at least an
inch apart in a baking pan. Add enough hot water to the pan to
reach just under the lip of the cups. Bake until the custards are
just set at the edges, about 45 minutes. They will continue to cook
after you remove them from the oven, and the chocolate will harden
as it cools. Take care not to overcook; this custard is best when
slightly soft. Loosely cover and refrigerate.

   2 pounds large Yellow Finn or Yukon Gold potatoes
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups thinly sliced leeks (white part only)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons creme fraiche + 1/2 cup for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated Asiago, Gruyere or fontina cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for cooking the cakes
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Boil the potatoes in their skins until they're slightly
underdone, about 20 minutes. Drain, saving 1/2 cup of the cooking
water, and let cool. Peel the potatoes, then grate on the largest
holes of a grater or in a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a skillet; add the leeks, season with salt
and pepper and saute until leeks are tender, about 5 minutes,
adding a little reserved potato-cooking water to keep them from
sticking. Toss with the grated potatoes and season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the egg and 3 tablespoons creme fraiche in a small bowl;
beat until blended. Add to the potato mixture and mix well. Add the
cheese and flour and mix again.
</P>
<P>
   Form the mixture into cakes 3 to 4 inches in diameter and about
1/2 inch thick. Cook in a lightly oiled skillet or on a griddle
over medium heat until the cakes are golden on both sides, 4 to 5
minutes per side. Keep each batch of cakes warm in a low oven while
you make the rest.

   NURIOOTPA, Australia _ The project lasted for more than six
years, and it cost at least $1 million. But it produced a fitting
white stable mate for Grange, Australia's superstar red wine, which
was once described by the English wine writer Hugh Johnson as the
New World's only real first growth. The newcomer is called
Yattarna, after an Aboriginal word meaning ``little by little.''
</P>
<P>
   The first vintage, 1995, released last year, caused a sensation.
It won all four categories for which it was eligible at the Sydney
Wine Show, the first wine ever to do so. People camped out
overnight at the cellar door of Penfolds, which makes it, for the
right to buy a single bottle. The second vintage, in the view of
Australian critics, is even better.
</P>
<P>
   Yattarna has added new luster to the already sterling reputation
of South Australia as a world-class producer of premium wines _ a
reputation that has been established in little more than two dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the planet's great wines emerge from cobwebby Old World
wineries or sleek California setups. Not Grange and Yattarna. They
are produced at a gigantic, highly mechanized facility here in the
Barossa Valley, a remote, largely unspoiled stretch of countryside
45 miles northeast of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
   With wine tanks the size of silos, miles of tubing and more than
a dozen low-lying buildings, the Penfolds operation looks more like
an oil refinery than a winery.
</P>
<P>
   One bunker-like, air-conditioned concrete structure, covering
five acres, has a capacity of 80,000 300-liter hogsheads. All of
the upper-end Penfolds red wines, including Grange, are aged in
this building, by far the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No lovely mystical winery here,'' said Peter Gago, a member of
Duval's wine-making team, as he drove us around the place. ``Here
it's all production, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barossa, settled by Scottish and German immigrants in the
1830s and 1840s, has seen a surge of winemaking success in recent
years, and not just at Penfolds. The family-owned Henschke Cellars,
just up the road from Nuriootpa, produces a shiraz called Hill of
Grace that in many years rivals Grange; on one restaurant wine list
in Adelaide, the 1980 Hill of Grace was $215, slightly more than
the 1980 Grange, at $200.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Grange, Hill of Grace is made each year from grapes from
the same vineyard; that makes it more vulnerable to the vagaries of
the weather. But when the viticultural gods smile, as they did in
1991 and 1994, Stephen Henschke, whose family has been growing
grapes in the Barossa for five generations, turns them into
voluptuous wines that age a bit more quickly than the slow-maturing
Granges.
</P>
<P>
   As in California, tiny vineyards have also caused a stir, not
only with peppery shiraz but also with Rhone-style blends of
shiraz, aromatic mourvedre and fruity grenache. At a utilitarian
little winery set against the swell of gentle green hills, Charles
Melton, a ringer for the Marlboro cowboy, produces an opulent,
much-esteemed blend called Nine Popes (the name is based on a shaky
translation of Chateauneuf-du-Pape).
</P>
<P>
   He is often credited with single-handedly reviving the grenache
grape in Australia. Using the fruit from thick, gnarled, ancient
bush vines, some planted before the American Civil War, Turkey Flat
turns out luscious Grenache Noire and award-winning shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   These and other top Barossa wines, including Glaetzer, Elderton,
Mountadam and St. Hallett Old Block, are making their way to the
United States, often in tiny quantities. The Australian Wine Bureau
(212-351-6585 or www.wineaustralia.com), can help track them down.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Popes turns up occasionally on the wine lists of American
restaurants, including the highly original one that Stephen Beckta,
a young Canadian sommelier, has assembled at Cafe Boulud in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is giant Southcorp, which owns Penfolds, that sets the
standard. It thinks big. It exports more top-end red and white
table wines (excluding bulk wines, champagne and fortified wines)
than any other company in the world _ a total of 5.5 million cases
in 1998, including 2.5 million cases to Britain, where it is a
major supermarket presence, and 1.5 million to the United States.
The figures have roughly doubled in the last five years, and more
than 40 percent of the company's sales are now abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those sales, of course, are modestly priced wines of
the kind that earned Australia a reputation for ``sunshine in a
bottle.'' But while churning out millions of cases of everyday
drink, Southcorp also manages to lavish a lot of attention on 7,000
to 12,000 cases a year of Grange and fewer than 2,000 cases of
Yattarna. It is an unusual combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could sell 10, 20 times that many if we had them,'' said
David Combe, the former politician and diplomat who heads
Southcorp's export operations. ``But the winemakers decide how much
to produce, not the accountants or the salesmen.''

 NURIOOTPA, Australia: the salesmen.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Duval, the resolutely self-effacing chief winemaker at
Penfolds, who led the search for ``the white Grange,'' as the new
wine came to be called, sees Yattarna as a work in progress; hence
the name. At the moment, it is 100 percent chardonnay, but he does
not exclude the possibility that small amounts of other grapes
might be included in the future; most years, up to 15 percent
cabernet sauvignon is added to the shiraz (the Australian name for
syrah) from which Grange is made.
</P>
<P>
   Also still to be answered is the important question of aging:
will Yattarna mature gracefully, gaining depth and authority after
six, seven, even 10 years, or will it nose dive after two or three,
the way many American and Australian chardonnays have a disturbing
habit of doing?
</P>
<P>
   Yattarna has been built to last, in a balanced style, creamy but
not over oaky, with a luscious, lingering finish and a nice nip of
citrus at the end. But neither Duval nor his bosses at Southcorp
can be sure yet.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who decry the hype surrounding Yattarna, and
especially the high prices it has commanded from the outset _ at
least $80 on retailers' shelves, when it can be found, much more at
auction. Leeuwin Estate's Art Series chardonnay, from Western
Australia, and Petaluma's Tiers chardonnay, another new
super-premium, both have their champions.
</P>
<P>
   Len Evans, the dean of the Australian wine world, sees the
emergence of Yattarna and Tiers, in particular, as evidence that
Australia, like California, is sorting out which grapes grow best
in which region.
</P>
<P>
   The Adelaide Hills, he thinks, are ideal for chardonnay. The
grapes that go into Tiers come from that area, just east of
Adelaide, the South Australian capital, as do 90 percent of those
in the 1996 Yattarna; the other 10 percent come from Tumbarumba in
the far-off Snowy Mountains, near Canberra. In Australia's
punishing summer heat, hills and mountains offer islands of the
relatively cool weather chardonnay grapes like best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now,'' Evans said, ``our chardonnays have been all
head and shoulders, like Picasso's bull. They start fast, then fade
fast, with no continuity and no finish. These new wines are a new
departure, an evolution in style. They have more intensity, better
structure and an enduring concentration of flavor. I think of them
as mini-Montrachets.''
</P>
<P>
   Grange was created by Max Schubert, a winemaking legend who died
in 1994. His portrait hangs to this day in a kind of shrine at
Penfolds, surrounded by locked wood-and-glass cases containing one
bottle of each Grange vintage.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up at it one evening not long ago, Duval, his successor,
took note of the crags and creases in the beaky face and said,
``There's a story for every one.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeply impressed by the first growths of Bordeaux, Schubert
emulated many French practices, including the use of new oak for
aging, in attempting to create an Australian counterpart. Lacking
sufficient cabernet sauvignon when he began, in 1951, he used
mostly shiraz grapes, and shiraz still predominates. At first, most
of the grapes came from the original Penfolds vineyard at Magill,
then on the outskirts of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
   After five years, Schubert submitted the results to company
higher-ups. They hated it, and ordered him to cease production. But
he continued in secret, and eventually the brass relented. He
concluded that he had shown the wine too soon, before it had aged
enough to ``come together,'' as wine people say; even today, it
takes at least 10 years for a bottle of Grange to mature and 20 or
so for it to reach its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a kind of Grangeomania among wine collectors,
who value it for its tastes of ``raspberries, strawberries,
violets, truffles and old boots,'' in Evans' exuberant description.
Auction prices have reached $300 and more for great vintages like
1976, 1986 and 1990. The 1990 was named Wine of the Year in 1995 by
The Wine Spectator, the first time a wine from anywhere other than
France or California had been so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the richest, most concentrated wine on earth, it is
still made mostly from the fruit of low-yielding old vines, grown
with the least possible irrigation. Today, only a few of the
grapes, and only in occasional years, come from Magill, which has
been almost completely swallowed up by Adelaide's suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fruit used in Grange comes from the Penfolds-owned
Kalimna vineyard, about three miles northwest of Nuriootpa. That,
said Gago, ``is where most of the oomph in the wine comes from.''
But important lots of grapes also come from a select group of
contract growers, to whom Penfolds pays cash bonuses for
outstanding quality, in the Barossa as well as other viticultural
regions in South Australia like McClaren Vale and the Clare Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all comes from old vines, some of them 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Unhindered by the restrictive geographical appellations used in
France, Italy and increasingly in the United States, Penfolds could
use grapes grown anywhere in Australia in Grange. In practice, it
doesn't do so.
</P>
<P>
   Forsaking the taste of individual terroirs, or localities, that
the French prize so highly, Penfolds seeks a consistent ``house
style.''
</P>
<P>
   But each batch of grapes has to earn its way into the Grange
blend each year. Each is vinified separately, then tasted by Duval
and his colleagues until they reach a consensus on what to use.

 NURIOOTPA, Australia: to use.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of 60-odd outside growers, only nine or 10 see their produce
chosen each year. If relatively little fruit makes the cut, Grange
production that year is reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit that misses goes into one of the other premium
Penfolds reds. The company makes a lot of them _ pure cabernets
like Bin 707, a powerful, layered wine that competes with
Australia's best; pure shirazes like Kalimna Bin 28, which has won
almost as many prizes here and abroad as Grange, and several
blends, including St. Henri, which is aged not in new, small
barrels but in huge, 45-year-old casks, and Bin 389, which Gago
described as ``the poor man's Grange.'' It's the one he and his
colleagues buy for their cellars.
</P>
<P>
   Red wines have always carried the Penfolds flag abroad. Almost a
decade ago, Ross Wilson, who then headed Southcorp, shared some of
the best with associates during a visit to Hong Kong. But when it
came to white wine, they drank Montrachet, the great white
Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' Combe recalled, ``he asked, `Why can't we
make something like that?' Then he gave the boys an open
checkbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Duval and his colleagues set out to use the Grange
methodology _ assembling a wine from the best fruit available,
grown in cool climates all across Australia. At first, they
considered using riesling or semillon grapes, which have for
decades made some of Australia's best and longest-lived wines,
quite different from what they produce in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But it is chardonnay that has the international reputation,
Duval said, so it was chardonnay that quickly became the focus of
the ``white Grange'' search (though an experimental wine released
in 1994 contained 10 percent sauvignon blanc). The process was
semipublic, with wine writers and others invited to taste trial
blendings.
</P>
<P>
   And it had the full support of Southcorp managers, unlike
Schubert's original quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995 we decided we had to draw a line in the sand and
release the first Yattarna,'' Duval said. ``We had teased people
long enough. We had concluded that the Adelaide Hills, with their
low yields, were going to give us most of what we wanted, which is
flavor, length and intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Fruit trees and vines had always grown on the middle slopes of
the Adelaide Hills, but chardonnay has been planted there only for
the last decade. As the vines mature, so should the wine improve,
little by little.
</P>
<P>
   Happiest Hunting In South Australia
</P>
<P>
   Any hungry wine lover who turns up in South Australia will find
lots of good things to eat and agreeable places in which to eat
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Gourmet Traveller, the country's leading food
magazine, chose the Grange Restaurant, in the Adelaide Hilton
(Victoria Square; 011-61-8-8237-0698), as its restaurant of the
year in 1998. The Malaysian Chinese chef, Cheong Liew, started
blending European techniques with Asian ingredients 25 years ago,
before anyone had thought of the word ``fusion.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, his is a cuisine of infinite refinement, a parade of
sweet, spicy, salty, smoky, sour and garlicky flavors. Liew
innovates fearlessly, using marjoram and chili, for instance, to
flavor his fish beignets.
</P>
<P>
   Penfolds serves solid, classic food at its Magill Estate
Restaurant (78 Penfolds Road, Magill, 011-61-8-8301-5551), a
handsome glass box overlooking the city from the lower slopes of
the Adelaide Hills. The all-Penfolds wine list is stuffed with
older vintages and offers both Yattarna and Grange by the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Petaluma has the Bridgewater Mill (Mount Barker Road,
Bridgewater, 011-61-8-8339-3422), a leafy spot 35 minutes southeast
of town, open only for lunch, Thursday through Monday. The fine
Vietnamese chef, Le Thu Thai, er, bowled us over with his herby hot
and sour snapper soup with prawn dumplings.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly obsessive, there is no beating the Universal Wine
Bar (285 Rundle Street, Adelaide, 011-61-8-8232-5000), patterned
after Willi's Wine Bar in Paris. Order a steak frites, or the
smoked and lightly grilled salmon, a revelation. Then attack the
comprehensive, more than fairly priced wine list.
</P>
<P>
   If you fancy a pinot noir, for example, you will find not only
South Australia's best but also medal winners from the Melbourne
region and famous names from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Beer, one of the most famous names in Australian food,
has reentered the restaurant business with Charlick's Feed Store
(Ebenezer Place, Adelaide, 011-61-8-8223-7566), a big, breezy spot
downtown that features wonderfully briny, deep-shelled oysters from
nearby Cowell Bay and the remarkably plump, moist chickens raised
by her daughter Saskia in the Barossa. An oversize sheet lists more
than 150 wines, all but three or four of them Australian, including
big names and small, some absurdly cheap. &QL;

`FRENCH DNA': BIOTECHNOLOGY MEETS FRENCH PRIDE AND FEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dust jacket of this new book by Paul Rabinow asks an
outrageous question: ``Is there such a thing as `French DNA?''' The
answer, of course, is no, if by French DNA one means some
genetically unique and precious substance that makes the French
biologically different from others. But Rabinow's answer is a sort
of symbolic yes, and that is what gives his book, ``French DNA:
Trouble in Purgatory,'' its scandalous flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinow, a professor of anthropology at the University of
California at Berkeley, tells the story of the collapse of an
agreement between a French institute and an American company to
collaborate on genetic research. The reason for the collapse was
the French government's refusal to allow the American company
access to the most valuable asset of the French institute,
thousands of samples of genetic material collected from French
families that had volunteered in the service of medical advance.
The DNA in question wasn't deemed to be biologically unique, but it
was seen as part of the French patrimony, and therefore requiring
protection from crass commercial exploitation by hegemonic America.
</P>
<P>
   There are elements of defensive French nationalism in this that
are reminiscent of the battle to banish English words from the
language of Moliere. But Rabinow has a far more complex and subtle
interpretation. His book makes clear that a French ethical and
historical unease over manipulating the very constituent
ingredients of life played at least as important a role in the
failed collaboration, as did France's continuing worries about
American domination. In acting as they did, the French were
expressing a belief that DNA, cells, genes, body parts in general
are indistinguishable from the human person and therefore sacred,
inappropriate for profit-making activity.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinow's telling of this story is brilliant but also unkempt,
penetrating and impenetrable at the same time. The narrative is
frequently disjointed, with interpretive passages alternating with
background summaries and what seem to be almost raw field notes.
Rabinow is too interested in the social meaning of things to bother
much with explanations of the science involved, and he makes
references to such things as polymerase chain reactions as if we
all know what they are. Most important, perhaps, Rabinow's writing
is turgid and stilted, or so it will surely seem to people
unaccustomed to the language and the in-group conceptual devices of
the American Anthropological Association.
</P>
<P>
   The bare bones of Rabinow's story are these: By 1994 France's
leading genetics laboratory, the Center for the Study of Human
Polymorphism, known by the French acronym CEPH, had struck a deal
with a start-up American company, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, to
collaborate in finding the gene that causes diabetes and then to
profit from the therapeutic application of that discovery. The
laboratory's main contribution was to have been its bank of genetic
samples collected from the families of French diabetics. Before the
agreement went ahead, the French government in early 1994 put a
stop to it, with one official making the remark about French DNA
that gave Rabinow his title.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinow dispenses with those bare bones in a quick introduction
and then, in Chapter 1, plunges into ultra-high concept, the deep
and difficult-to-grasp meaning of things. Borrowing concepts from
Weber, Foucault, Hannah Arendt, Aristotle, Italian philosopher
Giorgio Agamben and several others, Rabinow sets up a kind of
theoretical framework.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea here threatens to become lost in a fog of
highfalutin lingo, but occasionally it emerges sufficiently into
the clear to be understood by mere mortals. It is in essence that
biotechnology, especially the ability to alter life forms, has
changed the rules of the ethical game, destroying old definitions
of life itself without creating new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ```Life' is problematic today because new understandings and new
technologies that are involved in giving it a form are producing
results that escape the philosophical self-understanding provided
by both the classical world and the Christian tradition,'' Rabinow
writes in one of the clearer statements he makes in this section.
This has produced an anxiety in certain quarters that he likens to
the emergence of the idea of Purgatory in Christian theology seven
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the moral and moralistic discursive productions surrounding
key sectors of the life sciences, purgatorial themes and tropes
retain (or, better, once again attain) a certain actuality,'' he
writes. In other words, we don't know whether we are heading for a
kind of heaven on earth or for an eventual ethical hell.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting parts of ``French DNA'' are Rabinow's
concrete and lucid explanations of this French unease over the
practices that have emerged in recent decades: the collection of
blood, organ transplants, in-vitro fertilization and genetic
research. The French, concerned about equality of care and holding
to the notion, as Rabinow puts it, that ``the body is the person''
and is therefore sacred, have been uncomfortable with
biotechnology, and even more uncomfortable with the commercial
exploitation of it. Expressing his frustration with this attitude,
which he saw as obstructionist and outmoded, the president of the
laboratory, Daniel Cohen, presented Rabinow with a different view:
``Why make the natura as it now stands sacred?''
</P>
<P>
   In Rabinow's view, it isn't sacred; yet what he calls the French
``sanctification of the genome'' lay behind the political
opposition to the CEPH-Millennium deal. Other factors played roles
as well, and Rabinow covers them. One was a conflict between two
leading figures within the laboratory itself, with one of them
manipulating French ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the good old-fashioned French sensitivity to
American power. When the French press discovered the
CEPH-Millennium agreement, it presented it as the pathetic giveaway
of an important part of the noble French patrimony. It is here that
the idea of ``French DNA'' entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Rabinow has combined a rich set of themes and observations with
a deep grasp of the French to create this portrait of France
struggling with the technologically new, trying to achieve a moral
balance among curing disease, making money and upholding the sacred
value of life. It is too bad that he chose to tell this very modern
tale from within a closed professional world that keeps the rest of
us on the outside looking in.

 &HT;    PESTICIDE-SOAKED MOSQUITO NETS FOR AFRICAN CHILDREN
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Health Organization on Tuesday launched a
five-year campaign to protect at least 60 million African children
from malaria with bed nets soaked with pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne illness is the largest killer of children in
Africa, causing an estimated 700,000 childhood deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   Officials attending a multilateral malaria conference this week
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, said recent studies show that children
who sleep under nets that have been impregnated with pyrethroids, a
common pesticide, are 50 percent less likely to get malaria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is scandalous that 700,000 African children died last year
from malaria when a $4 bed net could have saved them,'' said David
Alnwick, chief of health for UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   WHO officials said that by working with African governments to
eliminate tariffs on bed nets and insecticides and using
mass-marketing strategies, they believe they can bring cost of nets
down $2 each, an amount within the reach of most African families.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, to be called ``Roll Back Malaria,'' will also
solicit individual donations for families who cannot afford to buy
the nets.
</P>
<P>
   Nils Daulaire, head of the private Global Health Council, said
that in addition to saving the lives of children, the bed net
campaign will cut down on the overall ``pool of infected
individuals'' and probably reduce the number of cases of the
disease among adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the leading strategy for saving children's
lives in Africa,'' Daulaire said. ``Even among children who have
the disease and don't die of malaria, the infection leaves them
weakened and less able to deal with other diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Individuals who are interested in making contributions to help
purchase nets can get information by sending an e-mail to
rdm(at)who.int.

<P>
   We're on the prowl for pants. We fan through the store, move
through the racks. Dressy, sporty, tailored, trendy, drawstring,
pleated? What are those with the button front? Sailor? Geez,
parachute pants. So '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Are those flares? I remember flares. Possibly invented by Cher.
All the London models wore them. You need platforms if you're going
to wear flares. I don't know why, but I remember that you do.
</P>
<P>
   We are shopping, one mother and two adult daughters, of similar
tastes with a few strong exceptions and different fashion memories,
equally outspoken and pledged to not let anyone buy something she
will regret later. This is strategic shopping. We are not here to
browse but to buy. We have a list.
</P>
<P>
   We move fast, choosing, rejecting, sympathizing, admonishing,
cajoling, commenting, standing back and frowning, creating a force
field that no clerk can penetrate. We have done this before.
</P>
<P>
   Is every single pair of pants in this store made out of spandex?
Do you think these pouf out funny on the side? Does stretch
stretch? Stretch doesn't work on everyone. No, I'm not saying you.
They look good on you. Get the black.
</P>
<P>
   Because black goes with everything. And black is slimming. No,
I'm not saying you're fat. I think they'll loosen up. No, I'm not
saying they're tight.
</P>
<P>
   What do you wear under stretch pants? Thong underwear? Not in
this life.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch pants can't last. There are no pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Try some jeans, at least. You never outgrow your need for jeans.
</P>
<P>
   We are looking for a basic sweater. An easy pullover. An
uncommitted turtleneck. Something between a cowl and a mock.
Classic. Katherine Hepburnish. Not too long. Not too short. Three
quarter sleeves? What's wrong with pushing them up the old way?
</P>
<P>
   Minor distraction over at the T-shirt sale table. You can do
pink. I look sick in pink. Here's a yellow, but you've enough
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't you love to need a sweater like this in your life? It's
as heavy as a rug. This is not a California sweater. If you did a
lot of winter sailing in the North Atlantic you could wear that
sweater. Avoid temptation. Not even with jeans?
</P>
<P>
   I like the vest, but don't you already have something like that?
And what's with the hood?
</P>
<P>
   That's a good color with your eyes but short sleeve season is
definitely over.
</P>
<P>
   Do I wear this out or in? Button or unbutton? Do I really want
this shirt? Tell me why I need this. If I color my hair can I wear
this? Do I need to color my hair?
</P>
<P>
   We are seriously seeking shoes. Black ones. Hip looking ones,
but not too extreme. Something to wear with pants to the office.
Maybe a skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Do you ever wear skirts? No, but I could start, and if I did
could I wear these shoes? Sure, with tights. I don't wear tights.
OK, socks. Thick or thin?
</P>
<P>
   You could walk unaided up the sheer side of a mountain in those
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   You may have noticed that I don't do ladylike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Try the platforms. I remember platforms. They have an attitude
and they might make you taller than your boss.
</P>
<P>
   What are those? They look so sad next to the big, tall shoes.
Like slippers, like something you wear after foot surgery. You
could never wear them with the pants. They're not worthy.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end of the day, the worst time to get lost in
shoeland. The clerks are rummy. There is nothing left in size 8. We
are hungry and tired, giddy with inappropriate shoe longings. We
break down just looking at a pair of peds. Put the shoes on hold,
come back tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think of this purse?
</P>
<P>
   That purse doesn't fit your body. We don't have the strength for
purses. Purses aren't on the list. We'll go eat now.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Revived by the official embrace of the AFL-CIO,
Vice President Al Gore and the rickety roller-coaster that is his
campaign have suddenly picked up momentum and are climbing upward.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bill Bradley closing in on him, there will be many
hair-raising dips ahead before the ride is over.
</P>
<P>
   My money is still on Gore to win the nomination. He's the more
experienced, articulate, consistent and disciplined of the two.
Thus far he has not proved that he is the better campaigner, but as
vice president he is being judged by a tougher standard than voters
have yet applied to the lesser-known Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won the AFL-CIO endorsement the old-fashioned way. He
earned it. The official union sign of approval, which will come on
Wednesday, was crucial to shatter a growing public perception that
his campaign was foundering. A delay in the labor federation's
endorsement past the early primaries would have announced to the
world that the unions feared Gore was a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   As the familiar political and sports maxim goes, when the going
gets tough, the tough get going. Gore campaigned hard for the
endorsement, relying not just on old favors and old friends but on
a great deal of arm-twisting and private pressure from President
Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigned to stave off the endorsement. But his
pro-labor record is not as strong as Gore's. Furthermore, union
leaders feared neutrality might encourage a long and bloody
Democratic primary fight, which nobody wanted. All Bradley had was
a sense of political momentum, and it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley still trails Gore by 12 percentage points among
Democrats nationally in a recent USA Today-CNN-Gallup Poll. Yet in
the past month Gore dropped 12 points while Bradley gained 9 points
nationally. And in New Hampshire, which holds the first primary,
Bradley has pulled even with Gore, as he has in some other northern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is wisely re-inventing his campaign with a new theme: Stay
and fight. He contrasts his own dogged support of the Democratic
Party and the battered Clinton presidency to Bradley's decision to
quit the Senate in 1996 in the gloomy days after the new Republican
majority took over Congress. It's a trumped-up issue, but
potentially effective nonetheless. Quitters are not voter
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Moving his campaign headquarters to Tennessee, a silly stunt on
the surface, seems to be providing a psychological boost by
physically distancing the campaign from the White House and
Washington. If Gore cannot shake the public's Clinton fatigue, at
least he can say its source is miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's best idea, however, is to challenge Bradley to a series
of debates, a truly masterful stroke that poses real problems for
Bradley. If Bradley declines to debate, he looks scared, an
outsider who has forgotten what he used to know. If he does debate,
he is likely to look like chopped liver when Gore is finished with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of Hubert Humphrey, the Minnesota orator who drove the
segregationist South from the 1948 Democratic convention. Except
for the gab-gifted President Clinton, the vice president is the
most formidable public policy debater currently on the national
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows every national and international issue down to the
commas and semicolons. His memory for detail is astonishing. The
verbal axing he gave Ross Perot during their 1993 debate over the
North American Free Trade Agreement finished Perot as a serious
political figure.
</P>
<P>
   A debate could also put to rest the myth that Bradley is
charming plastic while Gore is dull wooden. During his Senate
years, Bradley had a reputation for being one of the most boring
legislators on Capitol Hill. He was a great cerebral yawn. If he
has perked up since then, now's the time to demonstrate it. But
frankly I don't believe in personality transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The debate idea reverses expectations, bringing Gore down to the
challenger's level and Bradley up to the incumbent's level.
Normally this would not be a good move for the incumbent. But Gore
loses nothing here, except some elitist baggage.
</P>
<P>
   He cannot shake an establishment image entirely, particularly
after the AFL-CIO endorsement. But he must superimpose on it a
picture of the human Al Gore, the hard-working public servant. To
that end, he has wisely dumped the lectern and vice presidential
seal that used to distance him from his audiences. He speaks now
more informally, as just another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This is good stuff _ cosmetics, but important cosmetics. Yet in
the end the voters will respond to Gore's policy message and the
way it contrasts with Bradley's message.
</P>
<P>
   The question a voter asks is always the same: What have you done
for me lately and what will you do for me now?

POLITICIANS FEEL HAMSTRUNG ON VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some recent skirmishes in the political culture
wars:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is making plans to create a special panel on American
culture, a forum for a handful of senators from both parties to
examine, among other matters, violence in popular entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission, under orders from President
Clinton, has begun an exhaustive study of whether the movie,
recording and video industries market violent products to children.
</P>
<P>
   In a sizzling daylong debate in June in the House of
Representatives, one lawmaker after another denounced the
entertainment industry. Then the House unanimously adopted a
hortatory measure calling the industry ``irresponsible'' and
instructing it do ``everything in its power to stop these
portrayals of pointless acts of brutality by immediately
eliminating gratuitous violence in movies, television, music and
video games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks the Senate and House have passed
nonbinding resolutions expressing their view (but setting no
policy) that the Brooklyn Museum of Art should be denied federal
funds unless it cancels the ``Sensation'' exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this activity as well as a belief among politicians
from both parties and much of the public that violence in the media
contributes to some degree to violence in society, it is a safe bet
that no law will be passed or regulatory action taken that puts
meaningful restraints on movies, television and other forms of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is a result of intense lobbying and generous
campaign contributions from broadcasters, filmmakers and others in
the entertainment field. After all, nothing in Washington politics
nowadays is immune from arm-twisting and money.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment industry interests gave over $20 million to
parties and candidates in the 1996 presidential and congressional
elections, and donations in the first six months of this year far
exceed that pace, according to the Campaign Study Group, a
nonpartisan research firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason no concrete action is likely to be taken is
neither the money nor the lobbying but the fact that most
politicians of all stripes have come to realize that as serious as
they feel the situation is, there is little the government can do
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Gallup polls last spring found that 81 percent of American
adults say they believe that violent entertainment is a cause of
increased violence in society and that 73 percent say the
government should restrict the access of minors to such material.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians follow such polls as diligently as they follow
campaign contributions, and would certainly respond to this
sentiment if they could. But they say they cannot _ not in a way
that would be effective and constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a problem that isn't going to be solved in
Washington,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., the chief sponsor of
the measure that would create the special Senate panel on culture.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he worried deeply about the
content of the entertainment available to his 15-year-old daughter,
Jessica. He has some influence in this regard as a father, he said,
but essentially none as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could wave a magic wand and stop violence in the media, I
would wave it,'' he said. ``But it is impossible without the heavy
hand of government starting to censor, and when the government
starts censoring or giving a seal of approval, it has the potential
to do more bad than good.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Political focus on violence in popular culture has waxed and
waned over the years. Some senators and representatives said they
remembered watching as children the televised hearings conducted in
1954 by Sen. Estes Kefauver on whether violence in comic books
contributed to juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   (At a memorable moment, Kefauver held up the cover of a comic
book and said to its publisher, ``This seems to be a man with a
bloody ax holding a woman's head up, which has been severed from
her body. Do you think that is in good taste?'' Yes, the publisher
replied, explaining that it would be ``in bad taste if, for
example, the severed head was held higher and blood was shown
dripping from it.'')
</P>
<P>
   The political fervor reached a new pitch this year after the
massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., and other
acts of violence around the country. In June, the House debated
whether the availability of guns or the prevalence of violence in
the media was the primary cause. In the end, the House voted to do
nothing about either.
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal vote came on a proposal offered by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee. His measure
would have made it a crime punishable by up to five years in prison
to sell, distribute or lend violent movies, television programs,
videos, books and Internet material to children.
</P>
<P>
   Applying standards that the Supreme Court set for defining
obscenity, the Hyde proposal applied to material that ``the average
person'' would find was ``patently offensive with respect to what
is suitable to minors.'' The material would have to fail the
so-called ``slaps'' test, meaning that it had no ``serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal even defined examples of violence, including
``sadistic or masochistic flagellation'' and ``torture'' (though,
curiously, no mention was made of terrorist bombing or mass murder
with automatic weapons).
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that thinks rotten movies, rotten television, rotten
video games are not poisoning, toxically poisoning, our kids' minds
and making some kids think that conduct is acceptable just is not
paying attention,'' Hyde declared in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the debate that most members of the House
agreed that children's minds were indeed being poisoned.
Nonetheless, the Hyde proposal was overwhelmingly rejected,
282-146, a margin of nearly 2-to-1. It is rare for a committee
chairman in the House to be defeated so soundly.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view was expressed by Rep. Kenny Hulshof, a
conservative Republican from Missouri. ``If I believed that passing
one additional law would prevent incidences of school violence in
America, I would lead the charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hulshof and a legion of others from both parties said that
even if Congress could figure out a practical way to restrict
violence in entertainment, the lawmakers were prevented by the
First Amendment from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the politicians take no definitive action to control
cultural violence, some small steps are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from President Clinton, representatives of movie
theater owners across the country announced in June that they would
begin requiring teen-agers to present photo identification cards
when they showed up without an adult to see R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   Congress seems likely to approve legislation that would waive
antitrust restrictions so competing media companies could work
together in developing codes that would limit violence in their
products.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 1, a 1996 law will require all new television sets to
have a V-chip, a device that allows parents to program their sets
to filter out programs that have been rated by networks as
unsuitable for children.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said the purpose of the special culture panel, which
he said he hoped to lead, would be ``informing the public'' and
``cajoling the industry.'' The panel will probably be called the
Senate Task Force on the State of American Society. Democrats
insisted that it be a task force and not a special committee so
that it would not hold subpoena power.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who will probably be on the task
force, agreed that the best politicians could do was to keep
drumming on the subject in the hope the entertainment industry
would rein itself in. ``We have to keep pleading with the people
who produce this stuff to take a look at the consequences,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that vein that the Senate and House passed resolutions
expressing the opinion that funds should be withheld from the
Brooklyn Museum. The resolutions were approved by voice votes with
only perfunctory debates, indicating that no one really expected
the money to be cut off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was not challenging
the Senate resolution, an amendment to a giant spending bill, ``in
the interest of moving this bill.'' But he was giving the Senate
``no assurance as to how hard we will pursue it,'' Specter
emphasized, ``to put it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, such political pressure has led to some voluntary
restraints. After the Kefauver hearings, for example, the comic
book publishers formed a trade association and developed a code of
standards that is still in effect. The decision of the theater
owners to be stricter about admitting under-age customers to
R-rated movies resulted, at least in part, from having been leaned
on by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, the association that represents video stores
nationwide said its members were posting new signs and emphasizing
the policy that videotapes and video games designated as restricted
will not be sold or rented to children under 17 unless they could
prove parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, a lawyer here who often represents
consumer interests before the Federal Communications Commission,
said there was little the politicians could do directly to keep
violence off television. But speaking of broadcasters, Schwartzman
said, ``It might do some good if they feel footsteps.''

   Cookbooks pose an unusual problem: their true value can be
determined only over time. No quick read-through can distinguish
the great from the merely good. No reviewer is going to cook every
single recipe to see if they all work. Instead, a cookbook is a lot
like other pieces of kitchen equipment: it needs to be used for
months, maybe years, before you know whether it really makes it _
that it truly is, as the blurb always says, indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   What a pity that it takes so long. By the time a good cookbook
proves that it is in fact great, it has probably been relegated to
the back shelves of the bookstore and replaced on the display
tables by this year's models, mostly mediocre to poor.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt one of the best ways to search for cookbooks is to
reach into the past. I rarely refer to cookbooks that have been
published in the last couple of years, turning instead to those I
have come to know and trust; perhaps one book joins the list each
year. And an informal survey of experienced home cooks, food
writers, cookbook editors and authors, and bookstore owners and
buyers indicated that my experience is anything but unique.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising, however, was that the same titles kept
coming up in those conversations. And gratifyingly, many were the
same as those on the list I'd rather not live without. This list is
incomplete and personal, of course, but the books share qualities
that make them enduring.
</P>
<P>
   These books are all meant to live in the kitchen, not on a
coffee table. They're comprehensive, with wide perspectives that
give a rich sense of the areas of cooking they cover.
</P>
<P>
   They contain information not readily available elsewhere, and
sometimes they are the only game in town. Each has a personality
and a life that makes it readable.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the recipes work. A friend insists that if a
cookbook gives you 5 good new recipes, it's a success. Perhaps, but
how do you find those 5 if the 200 others are failures?
</P>
<P>
   Most of these books are in print, though some are more widely
available than others. The hard-to-find specimen often turns up on
line; among the better sources are www2.alibris.com, Amazon.com and
Bookfinder.com. Kitchen Arts and Letters, 1435 Lexington Ave., New
York 10128 (near 93rd Street), (212) 876-5550, is also a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   A BOOK OF MIDDLE EASTERN FOOD by Claudia Roden (Vintage Books,
1974; $16). Ms. Roden's most recent book, THE BOOK OF JEWISH FOOD
(Knopf, 1996), was an instant classic. But this volume, first
published in 1968, covers a broader, more important topic. I love
it for its flavors, its accessibility and its warmth. Ms. Roden
grew up as a Jew in Egypt, and she has a pleasantly unusual
perspective on the region's cuisine. More important, she has a
brilliant palate, sound judgment and a near-perfect recipe-writing
technique. Organized traditionally, by food groups, the book
includes 50 pages of mezze (appetizers) and salads, nearly a dozen
kibbeh (ground meat dishes), a survey of unusual beverages and
yogurt dishes and much more _ it's not just an introduction to
Middle Eastern food but a true guidebook. Few 30-year-old books
feel as current, not only in language but also in ingredients and
method. And passages like this one have made the book a favorite of
cooks who like to read: ``Every year, a type of migrating quail
flies over Alexandria. Hundreds of the small birds fall, exhausted,
on the dunes of the beaches of Agama, to be caught in large nets
and collected in baskets. They are marinated in a rich sauce
flavored with cumin and coriander, and grilled on the beaches over
numerous little fires.'' This is followed by a simple, irresistible
recipe for the marinade.
</P>
<P>
   MASTER RECIPES by Stephen Schmidt (Clear Light, second edition,
1998; $29.95). Schmidt, a New Yorker who teaches cooking and
occasionally writes for cooking magazines, practically perfected
the recipe-and-variation cookbook format. In 1989, the first
edition of this book met with critical but not commercial success
and fell out of print. Fortunately, there is a new edition, with
some updating. Schmidt's instructions are deliberate and clear, and
there are delightful common-sense surprises throughout. But the key
to this book is that it teaches cooking, and does so correctly.
This leads to some unusual recipe titles, like ``Braised Beef Stew
Meat (or Lamb Stew Meat, or Beef Pot Roast or Round Steak),'' but
they get the message across. The long, painstakingly detailed
recipes _ the one for beef stew runs more than 1,500 words _ can be
followed by a novice. And the variations (that recipe has 11) are
sensible and easy to follow.
</P>
<P>
   CHARMAINE SOLOMON'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ASIAN FOOD (Periplus
Editions, 1996; $39.95). This book, the newest on my list, filled a
desperately empty hole: it's the closest thing to an Asian
Larousse, and sorely needed. Ms. Solomon, who lives in Australia,
gives nearly equal weight to the cooking of two dozen countries,
including Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and others that are
rarely mentioned elsewhere. There is no Asian technique or
ingredient I could think of that this book did not define
adequately, and there are 500 good recipes and dozens of beautiful,
detailed color illustrations (unfortunately grouped in the back).
If you just want to know the difference between palm sugar and
jaggery and the uses for each, this is the place. More important,
if you want seven distinctive and authentic variations on curry
paste, they are here, too.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERTS by Nancy Silverton (Harper &AMP; Row, 1986; out of print).
You'll have to search for this gem, but it's worth the effort. Ms.
Silverton, who is a co-owner of Campanile restaurant and La Brea
bakery in Los Angeles, was a leading light among pastry chefs in
the 1980s, but her dessert book was designed for the long run. It
is the first dessert book I turn to when trying something out of my
repertory. The recipes range from simple (spiced pecans) to
challenging (raspberry caramel napoleon). They have never failed
me, and most are impressive enough to be served at a four-star
restaurant. Yet the directions are clear enough to be followed by
any moderately experienced, patient home cook. The 20-page basics
section (``Trade Secrets'') sets the stage nicely.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSIC INDIAN COOKING by Julie Sahni (William Morrow, 1980;
$26.) A treasure, comparable in its accessibility and style to
Marcella Hazan's ``Classic Italian Cookbook.'' With it and a few
unusual ingredients, you will be able to prepare quite probably the
best Indian food you've ever eaten _ even if you are a novice cook.
In the first 95 pages, Ms. Sahni, a teacher and writer who lives in
Brooklyn, offers a succinct, purposeful introduction including
directions for making ghee (Indian-style clarified butter), cheese
and yogurt; detailed descriptions of every spice mentioned in the
book, and descriptions of basic techniques. This section by itself
it is worth the price of the book. Better still, it is followed by
400 pages of fantastic recipes. It's been 15 years since I cooked
my way through this book, yet it remains one of my most vivid
kitchen memories. I envy anyone who has yet to experience the joy
of discovery that it brings.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   FRENCH COOKING IN TEN MINUTES Edouard de Pomiane (North Point
Press, $10). A quirky choice, I'll admit. But this slim, witty
volume _ first published in 1930 and subtitled ``Adapting to the
Rhythm of Modern Life'' _ is a cult classic. The wicked quick
recipes (rarely taking as little as 10 minutes, but close) work,
especially for cooks with a little experience. And there's a
hilarious preface entitled ``Some Indispensable Concepts for
Understanding This Beautiful Book.'' These concepts, in fact, can
be revelations. De Pomiane suggests that the first thing you do
when you enter the kitchen is set a pot of water to boil: ``What's
it for? I don't know, but it's bound to be good for something.''
This is true, and a real time saver in many instances. As for
recipes, the author offers many soups, mostly based on bouillon
cubes (I'd suggest canned stock) or water; fish; bean dishes
(including a credible choucroute garnie); salads, and meats _ in
short, what you eat for dinner. There is some cheating here (some
recipes call for cooked potatoes, for example), but the spirit is
honest and the result valuable.

   POPPY SEED-ORANGE COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Nancy Silverton
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes, plus 1 hour's refrigeration
</P>
<P>
   2 sticks unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated or finely chopped orange zest (from about 3
oranges)
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2 cups minus 2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   \ cup poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
   1. Use an electric mixer to cream butter with orange zest until
it whitens and holds soft peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat in sugar
until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk together egg yolk and vanilla, and beat in, scraping
down sides of bowl as necessary. Add flour and poppy seeds, mixing
only enough to combine. Wrap dough in plastic wrap, and chill 30
minutes, or until firm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Divide dough into 4 sections; work with one section at a
time, keeping the remainder refrigerated. On a lightly floured
surface, form each section into a solid log about 1{ inches thick.
Place on a cookie sheet, and put in the freezer at least 30
minutes, or until firm enough to slice. Repeat. (The dough may be
wrapped and frozen for as long as 3 months; it slices most easily
while frozen.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp knife, slice logs
into ]-inch rounds; place them 1 inch apart on nonstick baking
sheets. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, or until firm and evenly browned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some other great cookbooks from the past, in no way of
the second rank but described more briefly here for reasons of
space.
</P>
<P>
   BISTRO COOKING by Patricia Wells (Workman, 1989; $13.95). This
American in Paris assembled 200 of her favorite recipes, culled
from years of reviewing restaurants in France. The selection is
authentic, quirky and wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   COUSCOUS AND OTHER GOOD FOODS FROM MOROCCO by Paula Wolfert
(HarperCollins, 1973; $18). This cookbook, Ms. Wolfert's first,
opened new worlds for American cooks, like those that followed.
Many recipes are challenging, but almost all are splendid.
</P>
<P>
   THE FINE ART OF ITALIAN COOKING by Giuliano Bugialli (Random
House, 1977; $27.50). The single most useful cookbook about Italian
food in print. Detailed and serious, it can vault your
understanding and execution to another level.
</P>
<P>
   ITALIAN FOOD and FRENCH PROVINCIAL COOKING by Elizabeth David
(Penguin U.S.A., 1999; $13.95 and $14.95). These books, just
reissued in this country, spell out the basics of home cooking in
the city and the country.
</P>
<P>
   JANE GRIGSON'S VEGETABLE BOOK (Penguin Books, 1998; $18.95). I
wish there were an American equivalent to this A-to-Z guide to the
most common vegetables in Britain. But it is well worth deciphering
terms like ``custard marrow'' (pattypan squash) and grappling with
measurements for the wonderful prose and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   THE OLD WORLD KITCHEN by Elisabeth Luard (Bantam, 1986; out of
print). The best at describing ``the cuisine of the necessary'' in
European peasant life. Filled with hard-to-find gems like socca and
duck with cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE FRENCH FOOD by Richard Olney (Macmillan, 1974; $15.95). A
favorite of old-school cooks; very French and not always simple,
but always correct and valuable.
</P>
<P>
   THE THOUSAND RECIPE CHINESE COOKBOOK by Gloria Bley Miller
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1984; $21). Almost 35 years old, but still the
best guide to Chinese cooking for those with little or no
experience.
</P>
<P>
   UNCOMMON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES: A COMMONSENSE GUIDE by Elizabeth
Schneider (Morrow, 1986; $28). This is newly back in print, and
hallelujah. It covers dozens of exotics, like gooseberry, cherimoya
and yuca, as well as some more common fruits and veggies.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the temperature soared past 90 degrees in portions
of the central Plains as breezes from the southwest directed
unseasonably hot air into the region. On Wednesday, brisk winds
from the north behind a departing cold front will import much
colder air from Canada southward into the area. Very chilly air
will also pour into the upper Midwest and northeastern Plains with
afternoon readings holding in the 40s in many locations.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will stretch from the central Gulf
Coast to the Carolinas Wednesday as moist air from the Atlantic
Ocean and Gulf of Mexico intercepts a stationary front draped
across the region. South of the front, partial sunshine and humid
conditions will persist in Florida with afternoon readings near 90
degrees. Isolated thunderstorms are also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather will cover the Northeast and northern Middle
Atlantic states as high pressure slides off the coast. The day will
begin with ample sunshine, though clouds and breezes from the
southwest will increase during the afternoon ahead of an
approaching cold front. As the front undercuts and lifts
increasingly humid air ahead of it, a broken line of showers and
spotty thunderstorms will sweep east through the Great Lakes. Any
showers that form will be brief.
</P>
<P>
   A moist flow of air from the Pacific Ocean will spark scattered
showers across northern Washington and the Bitterroot mountains.
The remainder of the West will be dry with considerable sunshine.
California will stay quite hot as afternoon readings exceed 100
degrees across the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Forecasting Woes
</P>
<P>
   Weather balloons and commercial aircraft recorded winds as high
as 140 miles per hour at altitudes near 30,000 feet over central
Canada and the upper Midwest Tuesday morning. These jet stream
winds blew almost directly from west to east. Such fast, ``zonal''
winds are the basis for the forecasting rhyme ``Fast flow,
weatherman's woe.'' The woe comes from the difficulty in timing the
arrival and departure of precipitation associated with streaking
disturbances because the timing by computer guidance is often too
slow. Fast-moving disturbances will race over the northern tier
states Wednesday.

MAC SWINGS WEAK LITERARY BAT

 (ATTN: Mo.)   (bl)  
 By LOWELL COHN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roll over, Mark Twain, because Mark McGwire is on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. I was in St. Louis over the weekend to cover the
49ers-Rams game. I arrived late Saturday afternoon, rented a car
and started driving to my hotel. Right away, I ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   According to the map, I was supposed to be following the Mark
Twain Expressway toward downtown. But the road signs didn't say
anything about Mark Twain. The signs said Mark McGwire Expressway.
This was puzzling to an out-of-towner.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I realized the freeway name had been changed from
Twain to McGwire. The change took place, I later learned, last
spring when Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan encouraged the Legislature
to dump Twain for McGwire. As I made my way downtown, I wondered
how I felt about the guy who wrote ``Tom Sawyer'' getting the
heave-ho for the guy who hit 70 dingers.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was a frivolous question. I mean, it was only a
stretch of highway, for heaven's sake _ not a museum or a monument.
And it was an ugly piece of asphalt at that. Still, questions of
value were at issue, questions we're asking as the millennium draws
to a close and we take stock of ourselves as a nation: What really
matters to us? And who are our heroes?
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I love sports and have made my living
writing about them for more than 20 years. I believe sports are
important to America. I also think McGwire is a good man. I've
known him since he came up with the A's in 1986, and he was always
polite and civilized, even when he was frustrated by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Missouri was wrong to honor McGwire where it formerly
honored Twain. McGwire is a regular guy who did an extraordinary
thing. He smacked a bunch of home runs. Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain is a national treasure. He is our Shakespeare, and
that is not something to be taken lightly or to be compared with a
ballplayer. He wrote ``Huckleberry Finn,'' the best novel in our
entire literature, a humane, clever, touching book, written in the
dialect of ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Twain invented Huck, the most important character
in American fiction. Excuse me a moment for sounding literary, but
because Twain lived, we talk and write and think the way we do.
Without him, there might not have been a writer like Ernest
Hemingway or a character like Holden Caulfield.
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough of that. To use a few sports terms, we are talking
superstar here, we are talking all-time great, we are talking Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, we're talking someone whose impact has endured from
generation to generation _ Twain was born in 1835, McGwire in 1963.
Some day, a better home-run hitter will come along and break
McGwire's records, and then he'll become a distant memory or an
asterisk in the record book. Twain never will be distant or an
asterisk, and he'll always be as modern as this minute.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not the only one who feels that way. Brian Bartow, who's in
charge of public relations for the Cardinals, told me McGwire was
embarrassed by the whole freeway thing and considered it ``corny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark wasn't too excited about it,'' Bartow said. ``Just
because he hit 70 home runs, why put his name there? He thought the
governor should have been worrying about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which shows McGwire is no Pudd'nhead.
</P>
<P>
   You may be surprised by a letter that ran in Sunday's St. Louis
Post-Dispatch. Under the headline ``Time to Trade McGwire,'' Ryan
Corley of Washington, Mo., wrote: ``I know the great achievements
of Mark McGwire, but what about the team's success? It seems no one
cares if we win or lose as long as McGwire hits a homer. Well, my
opinion is to trade McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, not everyone in Missouri is wild about Big Mac. So
here's what I want to know. If the Cardinals ever trade him, what
happens to the expressway? Maybe Carnahan should change its name to
the Kurt Warner Freeway. Mark Twain may be a little above the
governor's head.

FROM A BROWNIE BOX SNAPSHOT TO AN IMPRINT ON THE AMERICAN
CONSCIOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (Editors.: Production notes are at end of review. Time and channel
are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1900, conveniently on schedule for this centennial survey, a
revolution in photography took place: the small Brownie box camera
went on sale for $1, affordable enough for everyone to start taking
snapshots. ``American Photography: A Century of Images'' juxtaposes
that crucial fact with videotape taken this year. In a church hall
in Oklahoma City, people who have survived a tornado sift through
hundreds of photographs recovered from the storm and laid out on
long tables. They are searching for those irreplaceable objects now
taken for granted as part of every family's history.
</P>
<P>
   As it traces the role of photography in American life, the
program gives a vivid sense of how frozen images have helped shape
what the country thinks about issues from child labor to racism,
from Lewis Hine's pictures of small children at work in mills to
Gordon Parks' heart-wrenching 1940s image of a smiling black girl
hugging a life-size white doll.
</P>
<P>
   But this wide-ranging program is also intellectually glib and
works better as a sleek visual survey (American Photography 101)
than as thoughtful analysis. It is so intent on demonstrating the
centrality of the still image that it wears blinders to the equally
important role of moving images. Willfully playing down movies and
television, ``American Photography'' comes to seem facile rather
than convincing.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour program (a lot to take in one gulp) is organized
chronologically and divided into many small sections, creating a
swift but jittery tone. The documentary makes room for Alfred
Steiglitz's shimmering images that turned photography into art but
is less interested in esthetics than in social change.
</P>
<P>
   That approach works best, and ``American Photography'' becomes
most gripping, when it examines the context that produced some
famous photographs. Rayna Green, a curator at the Smithsonian
Institution and one of the many articulate on-screen experts,
explains how Edward Curtis created his iconic images of American
Indians during the century's early decades. He dragged around a
trunk of costumes and props, sometimes replacing an Indian's
everyday suit with beads and a feathered headdress.
</P>
<P>
   During World War I no pictures of dead or maimed bodies could be
published in newspapers or magazines, with censorship supporting
the war. Those grisly images of soldiers with parts of their faces
shot off were finally printed in the 1930s as propaganda against
American entry into the next World War.
</P>
<P>
   As it zooms through the century, the program acknowledges how
taking a photograph makes an event seem real. The assumption that
the camera doesn't lie was fiercely exploited by advertising. Among
the most amusing photographs here are those of Babe Ruth in ads for
underwear, breakfast cereal, even anchovy paste.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much thought and style scattered through ``American
Photography'' that it is a shame the program is self-defeating in
its boosterism about its subject. Showing the well-known
photographs of destitute farmers taken for the Farm Security
Administration by Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans and others, the
narrator says, ``Today when we think of the Depression, we see
these faces.'' Well, some people do. Others see panhandlers on Wall
Street, among many possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Such overstatement is typical. Even granting that the program
has chosen to focus on still photography, the argument about the
primacy of the frozen image has to be made rather than blithely
asserted. Yet there is no mention here of the newsreels shown in
movie theaters, a crucial instrument in shaping American thought
from the Depression on.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, as the program says, that certain searing images
have gained their power through repeated viewings: the 3-year-old
John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting at his father's funeral, and a
napalmed Vietnamese girl running naked toward the camera, howling
in pain. But the program ignores the fact that most people first
saw the Kennedy salute on live television. It is content to let a
former editor from The Associated Press say that still pictures
``had a much greater impact'' on American thought about the war in
Vietnam than television did, without beginning to define the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Yulin, an otherwise talented actor, reads the narration
in a stereotypical PBS drone. At least its many quick glimpses at
subjects makes the uneven ``American Photography'' easy to dip in
and out of. You can stay put for the compelling sections on war
photography and take a break during the talk with Stewart Brand,
the wacky creator of The Whole Earth Catalog, the best evidence
that a smaller range and greater depth might have helped here.

`CREMASTER 2': AN EPIC AVANT-GARDE WESTERN
</HEADLINE>
   (lh) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Cremaster 2,'' the fourth installment of his projected
cycle of five experimental films, Matthew Barney proves beyond a
doubt that he is not a cinematic dabbler tossing around ideas that
might just as readily be elaborated in performance art or in a
video installation. Larger in scale, darker in tone, and much more
lavishly produced than the previous installments, ``Cremaster 2,''
is an epic avant-garde western built around classic themes but
laced with an intricate (and often whimsical) symbolic framework.
</P>
<P>
   You could drive yourself crazy chasing down the symbolic clues
that the film drops and that lend ``Cremaster 2'' its own integral
form while also connecting it to the cycle's broader themes. But to
obsess too much about the internal mechanics of a work whose
connections seem intuitive (and often very loose) would be to
overlook its purely cinematic power. Visually and emotionally,
``Cremaster 2'' unfolds as a disturbing, enigmatic dream that has
its own forceful rhythms and moods and a haunting musical
soundtrack that ranges from fragments of folk songs (sung by Patty
Griffin) to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera sweeps across the Columbia Ice Field in Alberta,
Canada, or contemplates the dazzlingly white Bonneville Salt Flats
in Utah, ``Cremaster 2'' conveys a surreal desolation and grandeur
that the music underscores. These wide-open spaces are filmed with
a breathtaking beauty and with a compelling feel for the emotional
weight that the sky and landscape exert on individuals. And as the
film depicts various rituals enacted in these open spaces, it
creates a palpable tension between a sense of freedom and one of
emptiness and constriction.
</P>
<P>
   The rites Barney has devised include synchronized equestrian
maneuvers executed by American cowboys and the Canadian mounted
police, the taming of a Brahma bull, and an imaginary flashback to
the 1893 Columbia International Exposition in Chicago where the
legendary escape artist Harry Houdini appeared. In the
hallucinatory world of ``Cremaster 2'' the exposition has been
relocated to the Columbia Ice Field, and Houdini impersonated by
Norman Mailer. A good part of the film incorporates elements from
Mailer's masterpiece ``The Executioner's Song,'' with Barney
portraying its protagonist, Gary Gilmore, who committed two murders
in July 1976 while on parole and was sentenced to death by a Utah
firing squad in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Utah being the Beehive State, the film includes scenes of
swarming bees along with shots of interiors that have a
honeycomblike design. Near the end of the film an ominous,
wasp-waisted ``queen bee'' (a hallucinatory version of Gilmore's
paternal grandmother), dressed in black Victorian finery,
approaches Houdini at the exposition. The woman is also a variation
on the Hungarian opera diva memorably portrayed by Ursula Andress
in ``Cremaster 5.''
</P>
<P>
   As for bees, nature's pollinators also connect to the cycle's
broader interest in fertility and sexual transfiguration. In
earlier installments Barney appears in various satyr guises. A
running theme of the cycle, exemplified by a race-car sequence on
the Isle of Man and gymnastic feats performed by Barney, is the
male compulsion to master difficult physical challenges. Since
``cremaster'' is the name of the muscle that raises or lowers a
man's testicles in response to temperature, the whole cycle could
be seen as a meditation on the driving forces of masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Gilmore's story and his family history, evoked
symbolically, that give ``Cremaster 2'' a solidity and emotional
depth that are missing in the earlier, more playful installments.
One especially gripping scene portrays the shooting of an auto
mechanic in a deserted gas station. The murder is viewed as the
climax of an elaborate macho ritual of car fetishism _ the checking
of oil and tires, inspection under the body _ in a surreal space
dominated by automotive advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the completed ``Cremaster'' series coheres as a kind of
cinematic ``Ring'' cycle remains to be seen. ``Cremaster 2'' is so
much deeper and more resonant than the other installments that
right now it's hard to see how they can work together visually.
(Theoretically, ``Cremaster 2'' is the second film in the cycle,
whose parts have been filmed out of order; 4, 1, and 5 preceded.)
Much will depend on the final installment, ``Cremaster 3,'' whose
intended location is the Chrysler Building and whose premiere is to
be at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum sometime in 2001.

ROPE A CHICKEN, WIN A PRIZE AT WATT MATTHEWS COWBOY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was nothing that legendary rancher Watt Matthews admired
more than a good cowhand _ someone with a strong back, a willing
hand and dead solid accuracy with a
</P>
<P>
   He would love this year's Watt Matthews Cowboy Days in Albany in
Central Texas. It will feature the first ``Texas National Chicken
Roping,'' an event designed to test the quickness and tenacity of
both roper and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews died in 1997, and the folks in Albany _ near his
beloved Lambshead Ranch in Shackelford County _ quickly established
a celebration in his honor. This year's event takes place Saturday
and Sunday and features _ along with the chicken roping _ a Western
photography symposium, a cowboy breakfast on the courthouse lawn, a
melodrama inside the courthouse and a Don Edwards concert.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a ranch rodeo, chuckwagon dinner and western
swing dance.
</P>
<P>
   But the chicken roping is clearly the premier event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new event, and we're pleased to present to the state of
Texas the first National Chicken Roping,'' said Bob Echols, event
chairman. ``There will be three divisions: junior, women's and
men's.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicken roping is a team event. A header and a heeler go to
work, on foot, as soon as the Dominique chicken is turned loose in
a 20-foot by 30-foot pen.
</P>
<P>
   The ropers have 90 seconds to toss a rope of soft material
around the chicken's neck, and then another around its legs.
</P>
<P>
   The ropes, 10-feet-long, were specially made for the event by
Classic Rope Co. in Granbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might start making them commercially,'' Echols said.
``This thing could catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who feel sorry for the chickens, Echols promises that
judges will ensure there is no chicken abuse, no yanking or
jerking. No plucking. In fact, a lot of people in Albany doubt that
many chickens will be caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a little smaller target than a calf and a little
quicker,'' said Lea Clayton with the Albany Chamber of Commerce.
``They have a really fast reaction time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ropers will pay $5 a team for a chance at the chickens. The
winners will get a few caps and roping gear as trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The chickens, the entire flock of 21, will be auctioned off
after the roping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're going to have a good turnout,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the Watt Matthews Cowboy Days is the annual Spanish
Gourd Award, given to individuals who exemplify Matthews' love of
the land and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   This year's recipient is former Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe served in the Legislature from 1949 to 1957. He was
governor from 1973 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Briscoe's primary contributions to the ranching industry were
co-sponsorship and passage of the Farm-To-Market Road Program in
1949 and leadership in the screwworm eradication program in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm-To-Market Road Program helped bring rural Texas ``out
of the mud,'' Briscoe has often said. The screwworm eradication
program saved ranchers millions of dollars in livestock losses.
Cattlemen viewed the program as the most significant health advance
in the Texas livestock industry.

would be an attempt to bring a zero growth in China's population by
the mid-21st century. Their objective is stabilize China's

California is the top prize in the Democratic nomination

Party, from Gov. Gray Davis on down, is allied with Gore.
Disenchantment with Gore because of President Clinton's troubles,
Bradley's primary draw in other parts of the country, isn't an
issue in California, where Gore has visited 60 times since 1992 and
dozens more as a member of Congress. Bradley is hoping to attract

`BEEFCAKE:' TAN AND PUMPED UP, LIVING CAMPILY EVER AFTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the many pop ditties that float like wisps of pink ice cream
through ``Beefcake,'' Thom Fitzgerald's campy strawberry milkshake
of a film saluting the dream world of '50s male physique
photography, none captures that ethos more perfectly than ``Mr.
Sandman.'' In this giddy cinematic swirl of vintage photos and film
clips of young men flexing their muscles, interspersed with
fictional, satirically shaded vignettes set in 1950s Los Angeles,
the Chordettes' cooing plea to ``make him the cutest that I've ever
seen'' distills the strained faux-naif attitudes behind those
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Back in that fabulous decade, Calvin Klein was just a wee lad,
Mark Wahlberg a twinkle in his father's eye and the display of the
male body as a pinup limited largely to ads featuring a
bare-chested Charles Atlas promising to turn 97-pound weaklings
into swaggering he-men through a principle called ``dynamic
tension.'' But as Fitzgerald's film amusingly documents, a
submerged, dissembling homoerotic culture of male pinup literature
was also in its infancy. Years before gay men had even adopted the
term ``gay,'' admirers of the pumped and chiseled male body were
discreetly snapping up copies of Physique Pictorial, a magazine
produced in Los Angeles by Bob Mizer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the young men Mizer photographed were amateurs
``discovered'' in random locations like bus stations. Mizer also
established the Athletic Model Guild, a photo agency that amassed
hundreds of thousands of physique photos. Some of his models lived
with him and his mother, who assisted her son and who designed the
young men's ``posing pouches.'' To avoid prosecution for obscenity,
Mizer promoted his models as clean-cut embodiments of good health
and physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
   What Fitzgerald has created in ``Beefcake'' is a heady,
impressionistic mixture of biography, fantasy and social history in
which it isn't always clear which is which. One strand of the movie
follows the starry-eyed Neil O'Hara (Josh Peace plays Neil, who is
campily named after a character in ``Valley of the Dolls''), who
travels from Nova Scotia to Los Angeles and ends up living with
Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) and other young men in a group situation
that suggests a low-rent version of Hugh Hefner and his bunnies. In
these scenes the movie delights in parodying vintage Southern
California hipsterese with its pretentious ``Daddy-o's,'' ``hep
cats'' and other quaint terms.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet several of Mizer's real-life former physique models
who are now in their 50s and 60s, as well as the fitness guru Jack
LaLanne. Even today these men strain to uphold a 50s-style
all-American image. The former Andy Warhol ``superstar'' Joe
D'Allesandro also appears as himself today and as a teen-ager in an
eight-millimeter nude film made by Mizer.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's biggest problem is that MacIvor's portrayal of Mizer
as a repressed, photography-obsessed milquetoast who displays no
apparent sexual interest in his models doesn't square with scenes
late in the movie that recreate Mizer's actual trial for operating
a prostitution ring using those models. The production notes for
``Beefcake'' say the trial transcript used in the film was
discovered as the movie was nearing completion and incorporated
almost as an afterthought. This results in a glaring discrepancy
between the giddy, campy celebration that ``Beefcake'' begins as
and the darker material unearthed late in its production.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this contradiction, ``Beefcake,'' which opens Wednesday
at the Film Forum, offers a fascinating double-edged portrait of
1950s Los Angeles. In the shadows of this wholesome sun-drenched
pre-Beach Boys world of giddy optimism and cheer _ a strawberry
milkshake world, if ever there was one _ worms were turning.

TUG-OF-WAR   ON FURNITURE THAT BARBRA STREISAND IS SELLING AT
CHRISTIE'S  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Vt. Calif., N.J.)   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The log cabin that Gustav Stickley, America's pre-eminent
proponent of the Arts and Crafts style and one of its finest
cabinetmakers, built for his family in 1911 at Craftsman Farm in
Parsippany, N.J., was meant to embody his vision of the power of
the Arts and Crafts ideal, down to the last piece of plain oak
furniture that spoke of the virtue of the simple life. As
Stickley's own magazine, The Craftsman, described it that year it
was to be ``a rudimentary sheltering of domestic life, a place of
safety where love and friendship could be shut in and foe and
danger shut out.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have not been simple, or safe, for a long time. In 1987
developers made an unsuccessful stab at the last 26 acres of the
farm, which originally had 653 acres. The town bought the property
in a grass-roots move to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a National Historic Landmark and a museum operated by
the Craftsman Farm Foundation, a nonprofit organization, since
1989. It has become an unlikely battleground between the Arts and
Crafts community and Barbra Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has been trying to return Stickley's furnishings
to the house for 10 years, including a pair of glass-fronted
cabinets Stickley designed specifically for the corners of his
dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streisand now owns the cabinets, which she intends to sell
as part of her collection of American Arts and Crafts furniture at
Christie's New York on Nov. 29. The 106 lots are estimated to bring
a total of $2 million to $3 million. She purchased the cabinets at
Christie's in 1989 for $68,200.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has made repeated appeals to Ms. Streisand for a
donation of the cabinets or terms for a private sale since then,
said Tommy McPherson, the foundation's executive director. But Ms.
Streisand's publicist, Dick Guttman, denied that that she or her
adviser on Arts and Crafts had ever been approached by the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one person I've talked to who can sympathize with
her as to why she hasn't donated the cabinets or given the farm the
chance to raise the money and buy them from her,'' said Tim
Gleason, a New York dealer who said he had helped the foundation
with requests to Ms. Streisand's production company, Barwood Films
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, he said, has been ``snubbed by one of the
wealthier collectors'' in the Arts and Crafts community.
</P>
<P>
   Guttman insisted on Friday that ``this is the very first she's
heard of it.'' He added, ``This has never been presented to her.''
</P>
<P>
   McPherson responded that the foundation had been approaching Ms.
Streisand through her representatives since she bought the cabinets
10 years ago and had received consistent negative responses.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson said that even requests for measurements, which with
the farm hoped to at least reproduce the cabinets for its dining
room in lieu of the originals, were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who these people thought they were talking to,''
Guttman said on Monday, replying to McPherson's assertion, ``but it
wasn't an authority. The one person through whom all of this would
funnel has no recollection of any of this.'' He was speaking of Ms.
Streisand's Arts and Crafts adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the cabinets are available publicly, estimated by
Christie's at $40,000 to $60,000 apiece, a price experts said
seemed unrealistically low given the importance of their provenance
_ from the farm, not the star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pieces should go back to the farm,'' said David Rudd, a
dealer in Syracuse. Rudd once owned Stickley's house there. ``They
started at the farm,'' he said. ``That collection is important
historically, for this period.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think it is nobody's business but Ms. Streisand's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold things to Barbra, and she's always been decent to
deal with,'' said David Rago, an Arts and Crafts dealer who is also
on the Craftsman Farm Foundation's board of advisers, and was
married at the farm. ``Naturally I would have liked to see the
cabinets donated, but if the farm is surprised they weren't, it was
out of ignorance. She's free to do what she wants with her pieces.
It's very easy to spend someone else's money.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaction to the sale, the foundation began a fund-raising
appeal, hoping to raise at least $75,000 to bring the cabinets
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been delighted to buy them outright; it's a bit
of a tragedy to have to bid for them in an open market,'' McPherson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streisand's collection, which was created largely in the
1980s, consists of furniture, lamps, pottery, metalwork and
textiles by artists including the potter William Grueby, the
coppersmith Dirk van Erp and Frank Lloyd Wright. It formed the
contents of Ms. Streisand's Beverly Hills house, which was sold
this year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several items from her collection, including the cabinets, were
offered for sale to other, more prestigious institutions recently,
including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said one dealer with
knowledge of the offer, before the collection was consigned to
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Given the layers of advisers who can hermetically seal a
celebrity from public contact, the foundation had been concerned
that its requests were not getting through to the star.
</P>
<P>
   But Gleason said that Nancy McClelland, international head of
20th-century decorative arts at Christie's, who is working with Ms.
Streisand on the sale, had had talks with her about the disposition
of the cabinets and their possible donation or sale to the farm.
Gleason said he had spoken with Ms. McClelland about the
discussions, but Ms. McClelland denied that she had had the
conversations with Ms. Streisand.
</P>
<P>
   The Craftsman Farm Foundation has cause to be nervous about
going to auction now. After its peak in the late 1980s and a slump
in the early '90s, the Arts and Crafts market has been
exceptionally strong during the last 12 to 18 months, in part
because of the appearance of vigorous new high-end collectors like
Rudy Ciccarello, a Florida businessman who paid $275,000 for a
Stickley cupboard on Saturday at a country auction house in
Williston, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The Craftsman Farm Foundation and the Arts and Crafts community
might wish for an 11th-hour intervention from Ms. Streisand, in
withdrawing the cabinets from the sale, but the cabinets are also
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Nancy doesn't get those cabinets in the sale, it's
considerably weaker,'' Gleason said of Ms. McClelland at
Christie's. ``Those cabinets and the sideboard are her marquee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Streisand paid a $362,000 for a Stickley sideboard in 1988,
which remains a record for a piece of Arts and Crafts furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising money, the Craftsman Farm Foundation
hopes that publicizing its interest will dissuade its own community
from bidding against it. But at least one important collector, who
asked not to be identified, said he thought the farm should be
prepared to pay the market's price and ``not be a prima donna.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their provenance, he agreed with several dealers that
the cabinets' condition and esthetic forms were unexceptional and
that an institution's expectation of collectors to ``lay hands
off'' at an auction was setting a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Guttman described as an ``disturbing,
unprofessional'' telephone message from the farm threatening
negative publicity, McPherson expressed concern about any
impression that the foundation was playing the bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're genuinely pleased to have a chance to bid on them,'' he
said of the cabinets. ``Obviously there could have been a lot of
other scenarios, but Barbra Streisand is making a decision about
her money, and we don't intend to be in the crying game about it.''

RICKY MARTIN REHEARSING IN THE LAKELAND CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla. 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Latin superstar Ricky Martin has been ``Livin'
La Vida Loca'' for months in the United States _ but will he do so
in Lakeland?
</P>
<P>
   The singer has booked The Lakeland Center's arena for a week's
worth of rehearsals before starting a national tour at the Miami
Arena on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, tour personnel unloaded some of an expected 19 to 20
tractor-trailers at the Lakeland Center's arena for the private
rehearsals, which local officials described as technical rehearsals
to fine-tune sound and lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been rehearsing this show in Los Angeles at the Forum
since late September,'' said Allen Johnson, executive director of
The Lakeland Center.
</P>
<P>
   Martin joins a growing list of performers who have rehearsed at
The Lakeland Center, including Sheryl Crow in March, Phil Collins
in 1997 and U2 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriSuites, the on-site hotel at The Lakeland Center, received
hundreds of phone calls and many visits from people wanting to know
if the singer was staying there, said Joanie Thresher, director of
sales and marketing at AmeriSuites.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Martin is a bona fide pop-music phenomenon, a
27-year-old singer whose current album, ``Ricky Martin,'' has sold
more than 5 million copies in five months.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Puerto Rico and beginning his career in the teen-aged
group Menudo, Martin also is credited with spearheading Latin pop
music interest in the United States, where Latin acts such as
Jennifer Lopez and Mana also sell millions of albums.
</P>
<P>
   While AmeriSuites has booked a lot of rooms for Martin's road
crew through Sunday, the singer himself is not staying there,
Thresher said. Johnson of The Lakeland Center said he had no idea
where Martin was staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand he's coming in and out of town,'' Johnson said.
``I heard he has media commitments that will mean he's in and
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Martin's tour will play to Lakeland is a sold-out
date at Tampa's Ice Palace on Oct. 22 _ one of only 16 North
American cities on the tour.

JEERS FOR NO CHEERS - SUNDAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio)  By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I'm well aware that sports fans can go ``overboard'' in
support of their teams, up to and including killing each other, I
think the Northern Ohio Girls Soccer League has taken the
``sportsmanship'' thing a little too far.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Associated Press story, league president Al
Soper declared a recent Sunday ``Silent Sunday,'' a day when all
coaches and parents were forbidden from cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want kids to be able to learn and to be able to think and
play without constant yelling,'' Soper said. After refereeing a
boys soccer tournament earlier this year, Soper said he ``needed
earplugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was so loud, kids couldn't hear the whistle, talk to
each other, develop combinations or anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom, of course, is that parents have lost
(assuming they ever had it to begin with) perspective of what youth
sports are all about. We've all read the ugly stories of
hyper-stimulated dads (and the occasional mom) assaulting his kid's
coach or the umpire or even a player on the other team.
</P>
<P>
   I think we can all agree that abusive behavior has no place in
youth sports.
</P>
<P>
   But cheering?
</P>
<P>
   I have no experience with youth-soccer moms and dads, but I do
know a thing or two about Little League parents, and I rather
expect the two groups have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I've learned is: The younger the kids, the crazier the
parents.
</P>
<P>
   It's the parents of the 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds who should be
given sedatives before being allowing into the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the field, you've got a bunch of 60-pound kids wearing
uniforms so big that a moderate breeze would cause them to take
flight. Their gloves, some of them costing more than $100, are the
size of manhole covers and are almost too heavy for some of the
smaller players to lift.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the kids protect these expensive gloves by keeping
them out of contact with the ball as much as possible. At this
stage, it is not uncommon for a ball batted say, 6 inches, to
result in a home run. Indeed, if the rules were not so restrictive,
the batter could probably score several home runs on the same
6-inch hit as the fielders furiously whip the ball around to
wherever a person with a glove might not be standing.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a fan of slapstick comedy, it is great entertainment.
However, if you think your son or daughter has major-league
potential and is being held back from his (your?) dream by
incompetent coaching and a bad call at the plate in a 23-2 game,
then you tend to derive little, if any, amusement from these
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most (not all) of these parents drift off to other
things (apocalypse preparation, unsolved conspiracies), much to the
relief of their stressed-out kids who learned only one thing from
their Little-League experience: They never want to play organized
baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us stick around to wince, shake our heads in
disbelief and, more than anything else, cheer. We yell lots of
stuff, too, but of course we do it in a helpful, supportive,
affirming sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if our child lets the ball dribble between his
legs, allowing the winning run to score, we yell, ``Bad hop!''
</P>
<P>
   If our child is pitching and wings the ball over the backstop
into the parking lot and through the windshield of one of our cars,
we helpfully advise that he ``bring it down a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun is the culprit for high, fly balls that drop at our
child's feet. The wind is responsible for the opposing player's
blast that clears the fence by 50 feet. Monday games, of course,
are impossible to win as they come too soon after the weekend and
Friday games are also sure losers because the weekend's on
everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long season and if we weren't allowed to cheer we'd be
left with nothing to do but hang around the concession stand,
screaming at the person running it for forgetting the hot-dog buns
and running out of cups.
</P>
<P>
   We're rather tightly wound, we Little-League parents, but we
mean well. We really do.

LONGING FOR SPACES THAT ARE LESS GRAND AND MORE OPERA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUCCA, Italy _ One reaches up to turn the latch at 14 Via
Carmignani in the nearby hillside town of Montecarlo. It was a door
meant to be opened by men on horseback. From the street, one sees
one more among a row of private houses. But beyond this particular
door is a lobby, complete with bar and box office, and beyond it
the Teatro di Assicurati.
</P>
<P>
   Though presently not used as such, this space, ringed by a
two-tiered horseshoe of boxes, has been the opera house of
Montecarlo since 1795. Now, the orchestra pit beneath the stage is
blocked, and plush red seats have replaced the noisy wooden chairs
of the orchestra stalls. Seating capacity: 196.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, an out-of-date poster offers jazz concerts. A
poster framed on the lobby wall advertises an 1861 performance of
``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' Donizetti's memorable bel canto tragedy,
currently running at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There is a distance between the two events, and not just in
years or geography. Montecarlo's ``Lucia'' played to a house whose
orchestra section seated 50 patrons. Met performances, even those
not sold out, still accommodate at least 3,500 more patrons. The
music and the voice parts were probably similar, made more so by
the Met's return to a version presumably closer to the composer's
original wishes. Yet by virtue of place, these become two very
different operas.
</P>
<P>
   Montecarlo and the Met represent extremes: the too little versus
the too big. The Assicurati's cut-down orchestra certainly had a
limiting effect on Donizetti's melodrama, which, on the other hand,
threatens to disappear altogether within the vast spaces of Lincoln
Center. But there are messages coming from both sides about opera
and its intentions. They are perhaps better addressed in another
Tuscan opera house, the Teatro del Giglio here in the city of
Lucca.
</P>
<P>
   The Giglio has been a theater since the late 17th century but
took its current form at the urging of Napoleon's sister, Elisa
Baciocchi, named by her conquering brother as ruler of the city,
and then by her successor, Maria-Luisa of the Parma Bourbons, Queen
of Lucca. The new Giglio was inaugurated in 1819. A more recent and
egalitarian renovation (Communism, at least in its Italian form,
has been a big political force in Tuscany) removed the highest of
four tiers of boxes to create an open gallery. Once seating 600,
the theater now holds a few hundred more.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Duprez, who sang in the first ``Lucia'' in Naples in
1835, had stood on the stage of the Giglio four years earlier and
introduced Italy not only to Rossini's ``William Tell'' but to the
first high C sung from the chest. With this opening shot, the
light, airy, flexible tenor tone on which so much of bel canto was
based, was doomed. Opera houses were finding bigger voices like
this one. More people would be reached, bigger houses built to put
them in, more tickets sold. Without the brilliance and carrying
power that Duprez was advertising (Rossini dismissed the sound as
the death throes of a chicken), the Met would not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Teatro del Giglio put on ``La Sonnambula'' last month.
When we think of Bellini's opera now, it is its connection to the
charismatic singers capable of soaring above an opera's creaking
plot and out to an audience of thousands. Lately the Amina of
choice has been Joan Sutherland or Maria Callas. They put the
grandness in grand opera.
</P>
<P>
   At the Met performance I heard, Andrea Rost and Frank Lopardo
sang Lucia and Edgardo. Both are good big-house singers, and both
spent much of the afternoon aiming their voices outward for maximum
coverage. Though indifferent in other ways, the Giglio production
offered heroines of a different kind.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, Patrizia Ciofi was the more sophisticated
Amina: a finished singer with a voice that could command a somewhat
bigger theater than this. Paola Cigna the next evening was softer,
sweeter and technically good enough. Neither is a grand opera
voice, and I doubt that they will make the rounds of New York,
London, Chicago and the like. Yet Ms. Cigna's size was an endearing
fit for the space it was in. We have rightly thrilled to Ms.
Sutherland's elegant declamation and Ms. Callas' fire, but here was
opera as conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The Giglio, when correctly used, creates intimate social
intercourse. Alone on the stage of this theater, one can speak in a
normal voice with people at the very top of the gallery. One of the
troubling things about these ``Sonnambula'' performances was how
little most performers took account of the space they were
occupying. In two casts on successive evenings, one Elvino and both
Lisas shouted. The rest, with their varying degrees of vocal
subtlety, understood a little better that they did not have to.
</P>
<P>
   One had the sinking feeling that Italy, with perhaps more
intimate opera spaces per square mile than any country in the
world, may be forgetting how to use them. Some of these singers
would have sung a lot louder had they been able to.
</P>
<P>
   Young Italians, or singers from anywhere, might look to another
tiny opera house on another nearby hilltop town in Tuscany: Barga.
With a history roughly parallel to Montecarlo's but brought to life
by the English family of Peter Hunt, Barga's Teatro dei Differenti,
seating under 300, has been a modern working theater for over 30
years. A renovation lasting an unlikely 16 years (Barga's Mayor,
throwing up his hands and rolling his eyes: ``Italy is always
Italy.'') ended last year, and now the theater gleams, at least
inside. The new facade, conforming to government guidelines, is
sadly ugly and out of place.
</P>
<P>
   There is the same inviting smallness, and acoustics perhaps
better than the Assicurati's. The early seasons of the Festival
Opera Barga were remarkable. Attracting foreign students and young
professionals, offering the coaching and direction of people like
the late Italo Tajo and Lorenzo Malfatti, now head of Lucca's
summer academy for Americans, the Opera Theater of Lucca, and
bringing in conductors like the young Sir John Eliot Gardiner, the
Differenti has staged Stravinsky's ``Rake's Progress,'' Handel's
``Agrippina,'' Milhaud's ``Pauvre Matelot,'' Schoenberg's ``P
Lunaire'' and a raft of out-of-the-way pieces by Cimarosa, Cavalli,
Satie, Falla and Zandonai.
</P>
<P>
   Both theaters were originally built and owned by consortiums of
important families in the two towns. Both were for periods of time
closed as potential hotbeds of sedition. Malfatti remembers having
to telephone each family before Barga performances to see if their
boxes were available for ticket buyers. The theaters now belong to
the local governments, Montecarlo's having just barely been saved
from demolition for a proposed car park.
</P>
<P>
   Big opera houses coincide roughly with architecture's tendencies
toward gigantism at the end of the last century. The Met's size
reflects its dependence on paying customers. Great opera comes out
of these spaces but often at a price. We have more or less stopped
dreaming of a Piccolo Met, but there is that chance that the New
York City Opera might find itself a small and embracing Broadway
theater and offer us alternatives. Recordings and television are
promising places for smaller voices in grand-opera repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise there are the theaters of Lucca, Pisa, Mantua, Livorno
and the like. The singers, the orchestras and the productions may
be less than we are used to, but a flavor of rightness pervades
them.

GROCERY STORE REWARDS PLANS RAISE PRIVACY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Melissa Hernandez, a San Francisco housewife,
would gladly trade her driver's license number, Social Security
number and information about her buying habits for bargains on
whole chicken breasts and 2 percent milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to hide,'' said Hernandez, loading her
late-model Honda with bags of groceries outside a Safeway here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it saves me a few bucks, why not?'' Hernandez said of her
Safeway Club card.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Davis signed a new law that answers Hernandez's
question.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by state Sen. Jackie Speier, a Democrat of Daly City,
Calif., the bill restricts the kinds of information grocery stores
in the state can solicit in exchange for letting customers use the
various reward or loyalty programs like Safeway's.
</P>
<P>
   In these programs, stores give customers a card that's
electronically read at the cash register. After each trip to the
store, a customer's purchases are logged to create a constantly
updating database of what consumers are buying. Customers using
these cards at the registers are rewarded with discounts on some
grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Marketing Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based trade
association, estimates that 60 percent of retail grocery stores
will offer some form of data-gathering reward program by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Speier's bill puts the first legal restraints on these popular
programs. Stores are prohibited from asking for Social Security or
driver's license numbers. Additionally, stores are prohibited from
selling or sharing the names or addresses of customers.
</P>
<P>
   These mandates, the lawmaker said, prevent stores from profiling
individual buyers, then trading that personal data with others,
including national suppliers and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's personal information is like gold,'' said Speier. ``It
gets collected and sold to all kinds of organizations. It's a major
problem if you're at all concerned about privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Large supermarket chains say the legislation simply enforces the
privacy policies the stores have been following on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already in compliance,'' said Judy Decker, spokeswoman
for Lucky Stores Inc. of San Leandro, Calif., which owns and
operates 500 supermarkets in California. ``From the time we've
first offered the awards card two years ago, we had no intention of
selling the information.''
</P>
<P>
   This policy is echoed at the Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway
Corp. supermarket chain, which has 1,656 stores in the United
States and Canada and which has been credited with starting the
first loyalty program a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not sell any personally identifying information to
anyone _ don't plan to, and we never will do it,'' said Safeway
spokeswoman Deborah Lambert. ``That's been our policy since we
launched the program two years ago. We don't even store information
by a consumer's name,'' added Lambert. ``We store the information
by product.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier said the law is aimed at future abuses. ``We're going to
make sure these stores stay away from any abuses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates applaud the legislation, but believe it
doesn't go far enough to curb potential abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Lemmey, president of Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San
Francisco-based privacy advocacy group, said, ``It's good to see
some kind of legislative awareness of the importance of data
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lemmey said the bill, which prohibits the distribution of a
grocery customer's name and address, needs to encompass more
consumer information. ``A company shouldn't be able to disclose
anything without a customer's consent,'' she said. ``It shouldn't
be limited to just the names and addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers who make their livelihood by harvesting consumer data
say the law is an unnecessary intrusion into the bargains many
supermarket customers are willing to cash in on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is choosing to participate in the program,'' said
Chet Dalzell, spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, a New
York-based industry trade group representing some 4,600 member
companies. ``As long as the stores disclose what the data is being
used for, there should be no restrictions on that arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how Hernandez feels about her Safeway Club card.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they aren't selling it to some sleazy porn outfit
for whatever, I'm OK with what they do with my information,'' she
said.

IT'S A STRETCH, BUT EXOTIC LIMO BUSINESS IS A GAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DICK J. REAVIS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When prom season comes next spring, the 200 or so
limousine companies in Dallas-Fort Worth will be busy _ and the
owners of two of them will be worried. Brad Goodbread of Truly
Texas Limousine is one of the concerned operators. Some of his
clients hire limousines for proms in Dallas, where he has to keep
an eye out _ so he won't be ticketed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that they've got two people in Dallas who
enforce the regulations, mainly during prom season. They hang out
at the hotels, watching to catch somebody,'' he says. So far,
Goodbread has been lucky. ``I guess I just haven't been caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem that Goodbread has with Dallas is that the city
seems to be run by car snobs: It won't grant permits for limos that
are made from ``stretched'' pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 10A of the Dallas City Code is clear on the subject:
``... a limousine,'' it says, ``is a luxury sedan.'' In addition to
forbidding the drivers of pickup limousines to originate a trip in
Dallas, the ordinance forbids the reboarding of a passenger who has
disboarded, to attend a prom, to use a restroom, to get married _
or for any other reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas thinks that a limousine has to be a Cadillac or a
Lincoln,'' groans Tom Doherty, owner of Three-D Custom of Everman,
a company that builds pickup, Humvee and SUV limos, the so-called
exotics of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers prefer exotic limousines, Doherty and their owners
say, mainly for reasons of caprice and curiosity. ``In Fort Worth,
it's the cowboy appeal, something about the Old West,'' says Rodney
Rasberry, whose 341/2-foot Ford F-350 went into service this week
under the name Western Luxury Limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pretty useful when you've got eight passengers with
luggage,'' says Goodbread, who operates a 31-foot Chevy C-3500.
``They also come in handy for tailgate parties at Cowboys games.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two companies operate pickup limousines out of bases in
Fort Worth and Arlington, and the only Humvee limo in the Metroplex
has recently been sold to a Florida operator. But Doherty, who
built all three vehicles, is sure that his business would triple _
if Dallas would just loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth and Dallas/Fort Worth Airport issue permits to
limousines, just as Dallas does, and authorities in those two
jurisdictions haven't banned the exotics. ``I don't see any reason
to exclude them if there's a demand for the service _ and there is
_ and as long as there's no safety problem,'' says Robert Bergeron,
who administers D/FW's program for permits.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty built his first stretch pickup in 1989, and soon limo
companies from across the nation were ordering them. He no longer
keeps count, but he estimates that he has stretched about 150
pickups, adding 22 to 176 inches to the length of each.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Doherty got his first call for a stretch version of the
Humvee, the Jeep-like military vehicle that is now the Army
standard. ``It was the thing at the time. Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Sylvester Stallone were driving civilian models of the Humvee, and
everybody wanted one,'' Doherty says. His first Humvees were sent
to a client in Atlanta. Now his shop is producing its 25th stretch
model.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch pickup limousines are roomy and comfortable, but the
Humvees, even with amenities like televisions and wet bars, and
with the alteration that is unique to Doherty's shop _ lowering the
vehicle's transmission hump from 17 to 4 inches _ are a bit
cramped. ``There's not much head room,'' Doherty acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons that limo operators like pickup and Humvee
models, however, is eminently practical. ``Those we build have
diesel engines, and limos spend a lot of time sitting, with the air
conditioning running. The diesel engines don't heat up at idle like
gasoline engines do,'' Doherty says.
</P>
<P>
   Stretched Humvees and pickups are not cheap. Sticker prices run
about $90,000 for new Hummers, and the work of Doherty's shop adds
$50,000 to $100,000 to their price as limousines. Comparative
figures for the pickups are a purchase price of about $30,000, plus
$40,000 to $60,000 for conversion to limos.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasers cry all the way to the bank, Doherty says: Hourly
rates for Humvee rentals run from about $200 to $350, and those for
pickups from about $100 to $200; standard rates for sedan limos run
from $75 to about $100 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas restriction against the exotics hasn't brought in any
revenue from fines, partly because operators have learned to be on
guard. On the other hand, the fee for renewing a limousine permit
in Dallas is a hefty $500 per year. Perhaps because permit fees
promise to be a more reliable source of income than fines for the
municipal department that oversees the city's taxi and limo
affairs, Dallas officials say that they are now considering
proposals to repeal the city's sedan-only rule. But until a change
is made, the operators of cowboy Cadillac limos will have to keep
their eyes peeled.

GROCERY STORE REWARDS PLANS RAISE PRIVACY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Melissa Hernandez, a San Francisco housewife,
would gladly trade her driver's license number, Social Security
number and information about her buying habits for bargains on
whole chicken breasts and 2 percent milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing to hide,'' said Hernandez, loading her
late-model Honda with bags of groceries outside a Safeway here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it saves me a few bucks, why not?'' Hernandez said of her
Safeway Club card.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Davis signed a new law that answers Hernandez's
question.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by state Sen. Jackie Speier, a Democrat of Daly City,
Calif., the bill restricts the kinds of information grocery stores
in the state can solicit in exchange for letting customers use the
various reward or loyalty programs like Safeway's.
</P>
<P>
   In these programs, stores give customers a card that's
electronically read at the cash register. After each trip to the
store, a customer's purchases are logged to create a constantly
updating database of what consumers are buying. Customers using
these cards at the registers are rewarded with discounts on some
grocery items.
</P>
<P>
   The Food Marketing Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based trade
association, estimates that 60 percent of retail grocery stores
will offer some form of data-gathering reward program by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Speier's bill puts the first legal restraints on these popular
programs. Stores are prohibited from asking for Social Security or
driver's license numbers. Additionally, stores are prohibited from
selling or sharing the names or addresses of customers.
</P>
<P>
   These mandates, the lawmaker said, prevent stores from profiling
individual buyers, then trading that personal data with others,
including national suppliers and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's personal information is like gold,'' said Speier. ``It
gets collected and sold to all kinds of organizations. It's a major
problem if you're at all concerned about privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Large supermarket chains say the legislation simply enforces the
privacy policies the stores have been following on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were already in compliance,'' said Judy Decker, spokeswoman
for Lucky Stores Inc. of San Leandro, Calif., which owns and
operates 500 supermarkets in California. ``From the time we've
first offered the awards card two years ago, we had no intention of
selling the information.''
</P>
<P>
   This policy is echoed at the Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway
Corp. supermarket chain, which has 1,656 stores in the United
States and Canada and which has been credited with starting the
first loyalty program a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not sell any personally identifying information to
anyone _ don't plan to, and we never will do it,'' said Safeway
spokeswoman Deborah Lambert. ``That's been our policy since we
launched the program two years ago. We don't even store information
by a consumer's name,'' added Lambert. ``We store the information
by product.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier said the law is aimed at future abuses. ``We're going to
make sure these stores stay away from any abuses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates applaud the legislation, but believe it
doesn't go far enough to curb potential abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Lemmey, president of Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San
Francisco-based privacy advocacy group, said, ``It's good to see
some kind of legislative awareness of the importance of data
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lemmey said the bill, which prohibits the distribution of a
grocery customer's name and address, needs to encompass more
consumer information. ``A company shouldn't be able to disclose
anything without a customer's consent,'' she said. ``It shouldn't
be limited to just the names and addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers who make their livelihood by harvesting consumer data
say the law is an unnecessary intrusion into the bargains many
supermarket customers are willing to cash in on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is choosing to participate in the program,'' said
Chet Dalzell, spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, a New
York-based industry trade group representing some 4,600 member
companies. ``As long as the stores disclose what the data is being
used for, there should be no restrictions on that arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how Hernandez feels about her Safeway Club card.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they aren't selling it to some sleazy porn outfit
for whatever, I'm OK with what they do with my information,'' she
said.

`ROMANCE' ISN'T ROMANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to say a bad word about a film like ``Romance''
without sounding prudish, anti-intellectual or both. When it comes
to critical booby traps, you can't do better (or worse) than an
explicit French movie about the sexual exploits of a bored young
woman. Praise it and prove your mettle. Pan it and look like a
dunce.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the dunce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' is _ despite its topic and its start-to-finish,
up-close-and-personal, look-ma-bare-organs graphic sex _ about as
titillating as a visit to the gynecologist. In fact, it is a visit
to the gynecologist; at one point, the film's continually humping
protagonist equates male-female intercourse with monthly checkups
at her Ob/Gyn's. Yell if this sounds sexy to you.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, none of ``Romance'' is sexy. None of it's romantic _
please note ironic title. And not much of it's compelling, although
Yorgos Arvanitis' cool photography and writer-director Catherine
Breillat's virgin-whore color scheme are both artfully done. Those
who wear white have pathetic, stilted or nonexistent sex lives.
Those who wear red are ooh-la-la. And those who wear black are _
but that would give away the ending (and it's a weird one).
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Marie (Caroline Ducey) and her wan model
boyfriend, Paul (Sagamore Stevenin), we know they aren't having sex
because they wear nothing but crisp white clothing. Paul and Marie
sleep in the same bed, but he became indifferent to the sex act
months ago and wishes Marie would just quit whining about it. ``It
doesn't interest me,'' he says, his face the picture of ennui.
</P>
<P>
   She, for her part, is in love with her lump of a boyfriend and
refuses to walk out. Her alternative solution is to sleep around,
which she does, bringing her pale disinterest to one dull coupling
after another. One stud, played by porn star Rocco Siffredi,
listens blankly while Marie blathers on about inadequate male
endowments. Another guy pays her for oral sex, then rapes her on a
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Much nicer _ a true prince among men, actually _ is Robert, a
red-shirted Don Juan (Francois Berleand) who gags Marie, ties her
up, sparks her appetite for S&AMP;M and boasts of having slept with
10,000 women (one of whom an inept subtitle identifies as the late
``Grace Delly''). Robert is scum, but he's scum with heart: When he
binds Marie a little too painfully, he apologizes and caresses her
head with tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Breillat's idea of a human moment _ a dominating
lothario who strokes the hair out of the heroine's eyes. The rest
of the film is flat, affectless, in love with its own detachment
and lacking any compelling narrative or character; Ducey's face
tears up on occasion, but most of the time it's as dolefully
inexpressive as her bored interior monologues (``I hollow myself:
that's my purity''). And nowhere is she less expressive than in
coitus, when her eyes assume the glazed disassociation of someone
having a root canal.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse us for asking, but isn't sex supposed to be _ oh, what's
that word _ fun? The sex acts in ``Romance'' are so head-to-toe
graphic that they've sparked comparisons to pornography (albeit
gabby pornography), but it isn't the movie's genitalia, or its
venereal candor, that offends; it's the portrayal of intercourse as
an emotional dead zone. Like David Cronenberg's ``Crash,''
``Romance'' scoffs at monogamous union but finds little reward in
its alternative. Simply put, it makes sex dull.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is particularly liberating. For a film that's been
promoted as a frank ode to female desire, Breillat's work neither
conjures the thick mists of true physical longing nor makes much of
a case for womanhood. Marie goes from being dressed in white and
fed up with the shortcomings of the common male to being dressed in
red and being even more fed up with the shortcomings of the common
male.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Robert, who understands Marie's vague, twin longings
for submission and control, every man in ``Romance'' is just
another target for blandly articulate male-bashing. According to
Breillat's world schema, men are bored with sex, bad at sex,
obsessed with sex, disgusted with sex, ill-equipped for sex and
determined to have sex with everything that moves. They are
faithless, self-involved louts who want only to seduce and conquer.
</P>
<P>
   This is feminism? No, it isn't _ and neither is a dream sequence
in which Marie fantasizes about a brothel where men couple with
faceless groins. In the slightly less-tedious ``36 Fillette,'' the
only other Breillat film to be released stateside, a sexually
budding 14-year-old flippantly observes that men would like nothing
more than to remove women's heads from the rest of their bodies.
Separate their minds from their nether parts, so they can have sex
without their brains getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Breillat thought enough of this conceit to base an
entire movie on it. The result is ``Romance,'' a film that reduces
sex to its mechanical components and reduces those who have it _
men as well as women _ to cheerless automatons.

 &HT;    GORE'S AFL-CIO ENDORSEMENT UNLIKELY TO BE UNANIMOUS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore appeared to escape a major
political embarrassment Tuesday as AFL-CIO officials privately
pushed the 68-union federation closer to endorsing Gore over an
increasingly popular Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, arriving here Tuesday afternoon for last-minute
negotiations with labor leaders at their hotel, planned to visit
the AFL-CIO convention Wednesday morning to accept the labor
endorsement following a formal vote of the federation's 700
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated floor vote, on the final day of the
gathering, would be a mere formality. The key vote to recommend
Gore to the convention delegates was to be taken late Tuesday by
the AFL-CIO's political committee.
</P>
<P>
   Following weeks of intensive lobbying by Gore and Bradley,
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney appeared to have lined up the
necessary support on the political committee to secure the
endorsement for Gore. But the private vote of the panel, which
includes representatives from more than two dozen unions, was
unlikely to be unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   James Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, which is represented on the political committee,
announced that the Teamsters would vote against endorsing Gore
because his 1.4 million-member union is not ready to endorse a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the feeling of our members that they need more time to
see the candidates in action, and we, as a union, need more time to
advance our agenda through the electoral process,'' Hoffa's
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Teamsters officials had indicated that the
union might simply abstain when the political committee met to vote
on an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers also indicated they would either abstain
or vote against endorsing a presidential candidate at this time.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid embarrassing Sweeney because of the Teamsters'
opposition to a Gore endorsement, Hoffa's statement added that ``in
the end, the labor movement can count on the Teamsters Union to do
the right thing for America's working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who seven months ago took over the union his legendary
father and namesake once headed, also avoided any public
appearances off the convention floor because ``he does not want to
be perceived as being in a power struggle with Mr. Sweeney,'' said
Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Teamsters' current opposition to an endorsement of
Gore, Roth said one of the more positive developments of the
convention is that ``we have established a dialogue with the Gore
campaign at the highest levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, at the urging of President Clinton, pushed for the
endorsement of Gore this week, the earliest ever by the AFL-CIO,
because of Texas Gov. George W. Bush's rising popularity, according
to Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's political director.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the labor federation endorsed a presidential
candidate during the primaries was in 1983 when it backed Walter
Mondale against a strong challenge from Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger of not doing something now (for Gore) is that
George W. Bush will get elected,'' said Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   The expected endorsement of Gore marks the beginning of a $40
million campaign by the AFL-CIO to mobilize political support for
their preferred candidates in the 2000 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Its timing also helps Gore avoid a major setback as he tries to
restart his campaign from a new headquarters in Nashville amid new
polling data showing Bradley continuing to cut into his lead.
</P>
<P>
   The new Nashville headquarters caused some embarrassment for the
Gore campaign Tuesday when it was disclosed by The New York Daily
News that some of the wiring at the building had been done by
nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee AFL-CIO President John Neeley assured his fellow union
members that the mistake was made because of ``the rush'' with
which Gore's campaign sought to move the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll completed Sunday shows Gore with a
12-point lead over Bradley, down from 33 points from last month.
</P>
<P>
   Gore now has the backing of only 51 percent of Democrats
compared to 63 percent in September, according to the poll.
Bradley's support has grown from 30 percent in last month to 39
percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore needs all the help he can get,'' William Schneider, CNN's
chief political analyst, said Tuesday at the Los Angeles Convention
Center. ``This endorsement couldn't come at a better time for
him.''

   SATURDAY-NIGHT-FEVER (New York) _ When the Broadway musical
version of ``Saturday Night Fever'' opens on at the Thursday
Minskoff Theater, it should, by rights, look as quaint as the 1950s
of ``Grease'' did in the 1970s. ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the movie
released in 1977, marked the apogee of disco, a lucrative moment in
pop that quickly generated a backlash, a record-business crash and
a widespread repudiation. Twenty years is the usual nostalgia gap,
the time it takes for fond memory to replace the embarrassment of
succumbing to a long-gone trend; hence the Broadway-bound
``Saturday Night Fever,'' despite disparaging reviews of its London
production. By Jon Pareles.

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;

<P>
   SAME-OLD-SONG-FILM (Paris) _ Alain Resnais seemed quite amused
by the idea that it took him 35 years to have his first genuine box
office hit. Of course, at 77, he could well afford to display
nonchalance, what with his place in the history of modern cinema
having long been assured by his remarkable first two feature films,
``Hiroshima Mon Amour'' and ``Last Year at Marienbad.'' Even so,
the success of his latest movie, ``On Connait La Chanson,'' or
``Same Old Song,'' surprised him. Much of the charm of ``Same Old
Song,'' which opened in New York on Friday, derives from the way
its six main characters lip-synch popular French songs. By Alan
Riding.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET (New York) _ More than most dance companies,
American Ballet Theater prides itself on its versatility. And
rightly so. Last spring it presented ``Giselle'' and other Old
World heirlooms. For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and
runs for two weeks at the City Center, the troupe will flaunt its
progressive side, taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de
Mille, the wry populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver
partnering of Nacho Duato. By Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-OPERA (Undated) _ As it becomes clear that Gerard
Mortier will be replaced as director of the Salzburg Festival when
his contract expires in 2002, a new release of Olivier Messiaen's
lone, immense opera ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' which was present on
the program of his first year at the festival, is especially
timely. The new release (Deutsche Grammophon 445 176-2; four CDs),
was recorded at a revival last year. By Paul Griffiths.
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRANSPOSED-MUSIC (New York) _ Transposition is in the news at
the Metropolitan Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras has just opened a run
of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of the score
restored to the higher keys in which the composer originally wrote
them, and at the same time Placido Domingo is reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly
_ and both are being a bit misunderstood as often as not. By Will
Crutchfield.

   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOMAX-DELTA-BLUES (Undated) _ In 1941 and 1942, the folklorist
Alan Lomax visited the Mississippi Delta to document its
African-American folk music. One of his major objectives was to
record the Delta's most famous cultural product, the blues.
``Mississippi the Blues Lineage'' (Rounder 11661-1825), whose
contents Lomax selected before a stroke incapacitated him several
years ago, represents his early-40s Delta blues fieldwork. By Tony
Scherman.

<P>
   COLOMBIA-ART (Bogota, Colombia) _ Gloria Zea, director of the
Museum of Modern Art here, in an effort to provoke what she calls
``a profound and unhurried meditation'' that can ``help change
behaviors and habits that impede civil discourse,'' her museum, the
capital's most prestigious, has organized the first systematic
examination of ``the scourge that has bled the country dry,'' as
she puts it, in an unsettling exhibition entitled ``Art and
Violence in Colombia Since 1948.'' Each of the show's dozen
sections, spread over four floors, addresses one specific
manifestation of the violence that afflicts this nation of 40
million people. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   TSCHUMI-ARCH (New York) _ Alfred Lerner Hall, the new student
center at Columbia University, will plunge some baby boomer alumni
into a cool nostalgic bath. The architect, Bernard Tschumi, has
long made a touchstone of the events of 68: the student uprisings
that for many epitomize the turmoil of the 1960s. Columbia
University's architecture school was one of the epicenters of those
events. Today, 31 years later, the school is run by Tschumi, an
architect whose sensibility was formed by the Paris edition of
those events. No other architect of his generation has identified
himself more closely with the anarchic energies of that era. By
Herbert Muschamp.

SHOWTIME FILM ON MAPPLETHORPE; `TODAY' RECORDS; JETS MONDAY NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Another Artist, Another Exhibit
</P>
<P>
   Showtime will be making a movie based on the political brawl
over an art exhibition accused of being obscene.
</P>
<P>
   No, not  &UR; that &LR;  one. The Showtime film, which will probably begin
shooting in November, will be based on the exhibit of art by Robert
Mapplethorpe that aroused such passions in Cincinnati in 1990 that
the director of the Contemporary Arts Center there, Dennis Barrie,
was actually put on trial and charged with pandering obscenity. (He
was acquitted.)
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Offsay, president for programming at the Showtime
networks, acknowledged Tuesday that the uproar over the
``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which has
pitted New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani against much of the art
world as well as free-speech advocates, is ``a very lucky accident
of timing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The controversy over the Brooklyn exhibit was not a factor at
all in our deciding to make this movie,'' Offsay said Tuesday,
``because we've had this project in development since 1994.'' It
only got announced this week, he said, because the final piece fell
into place: James Woods agreed to star in the film as Barrie.
</P>
<P>
   Offsay added that before the mayor's challenge to ``Sensation''
made headlines, the network had already reached an agreement with
the director Frank Pierson, and Woods had already read the script.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he conceded that having the furor over ``Sensation''
erupt just as Showtime decided to do the film was the kind of
development that often helps television movies get attention. He
equated it with Showtime's decision last year to a do a version of
``Inherit the Wind'' just as the debate over the teaching of
evolution in Kansas schools became national news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a project here that was eight years old,'' Offsay said.
``And in meetings when you have a project like this, some creative
executive always asks a question like, `What's the relevance of a
story this old?' But hot-button issues like this tend to be
timeless. History does repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The film will look at the position Barrie found himself in
Cincinnati when the exhibition of Mapplethorpe's photographs, which
have images like men in sadomasochistic poses and children with
genitals exposed, was attacked by religious and political leaders
in Cincinnati and stirred debate in Washington over public
financing for the arts. Offsay said the film would deal with the
trial and also with how the incident roiled Barrie's private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family was involved,'' Offsay said. ``They were vilified
at Little League games. There's a lot of human drama, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason the project took so long to get started, Offsay said,
was simply that Showtime could never get an acceptable script
written. Once it was, by Ilene Chakin, Showtime and the film's
producer, Michael Manheim, sought a director.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pierson, who won an Emmy for the HBO film ``Citizen
Cohn,'' was a first choice. ``Frank asked one question,'' Offsay
said. ``He wanted to know if we would allow him to show in the film
the seven images from the exhibit that were at the center of the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Offsay said that Woods eventually asked the same question, and
that he told them both that Showtime could hardly be doing a film
about about the issue of censorship and leave out those images.
Pierson will use the actual art in the movie, Offsay said, although
he insisted that the film would still have to be able to receive an
R rating.
</P>
<P>
   As for when the film will make it to television, Offsay said it
would most likely be in May or June, just about the time that a
Senate race between Mayor Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton is
expected to be heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to be more concerned about the Emmy race,''
Offsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Records for `Today'
</P>
<P>
   The success of NBC's ``Today'' reached the kind of perfectly
round milestone last week that the network could not resist crowing
about.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week ``Today'' had been in first place in the morning
ratings for 200 consecutive weeks. That's the longest period of
dominance for one program since competition among morning news
programs began in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Today'' had already had the record back at week 199, and
all the way back to week 88.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 200 weeks is a noteworthy number. The streak began the
week of Dec. 11, 1995. That was not a week of any major event on
the program, like the addition of a new host. But that was the week
that Jeff Zucker, who had produced the program earlier and went off
to work on a prime-time magazine program, returned to ``Today'' as
the executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the program's hosts _ like Katie Couric and Matt Lauer,
and in the past, Bryant Gumbel _ acknowledge Zucker's essential
role in building ``Today's'' unchallenged leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his importance, there was one small detraction from
NBC's elation in the timing of the 200-week announcement. Zucker
told his staff his week that he was taking a leave of absence from
``Today'' starting this week to have surgery for what he called a
pre-cancerous condition.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker, who is 35, previously suffered from colon cancer and was
treated through surgery and with chemotherapy. A spokeswoman for
the program said he was extremely optimistic and expects to rejoin
``Today'' in four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Return of the Jets
</P>
<P>
   One indication that the New York Jets were back as one of the
elite teams of the National Football League was their return this
season as one of the most featured teams on ``Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC may regret that if the Jets don't start doing better this
season. This week, the Jets' first Monday night game drew one of
the smallest ratings for that show in years: under a 10 rating,
according to preliminary national figures. (Each rating point
represents just over 1 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the game was affected by the division in the sports
audience; many viewers were drawn to Game 5 of the Indians-Red Sox
baseball playoff series. But the football game also appears to have
lost to the entertainment lineup on CBS, which drew an 11 rating
from 9 to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner on the night was CBS's comedy ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' which continues to build into the biggest hit on
that network. It had a 12.1 rating.

SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS NICHOLS' CONVICTION AND LIFE SENTENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the appeal of
Terry Nichols, convicted in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that
killed 168 people and injured hundreds more. The action let stand
his conviction and life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal, Nichols, 44, argued that his federal conviction
for conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction should be
overturned because he never intended to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Nichols was found guilty in a federal trial of
involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy because of his role in the
April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
Nichols was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in June of that year, co-conspirator Timothy McVeigh
was convicted of first-degree murder in connection with the bombing
and later sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing Nichols' sentence, his lawyer, Michael Tigar,
argued that ``the government's evidence failed to prove that Mr.
Nichols was aware that Mr. McVeigh intended to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigar also argued that Nichols' sentence was invalid because his
trial judge used overly harsh sentencing guidelines. The lawyer
contended that because the judge used guidelines designed for
first-degree murder instead of involuntary manslaughter _ the crime
for which Nichols was convicted _ his sentenced should be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton administration lawyers contended that Nichols'
intent would be relevant only if he had been sentenced to death.
The administration also said judges have discretion on which
guidelines to follow.
</P>
<P>
   In February the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with
that reasoning and upheld Nichols' life sentence. On Tuesday the
Supreme Court let that ruling stand.
</P>
<P>
   An argument similar to Tigar's was used successfully by
co-conspirator Michael Fortier to get his 12-year prison sentence
overturned in June.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th circuit court, in throwing out his sentence, ruled that
federal guidelines for involuntary manslaughter, not first-degree
murder, should have been used. Fortier had pleaded guilty to having
advance knowledge of the bombing. Despite the appellate ruling, a
U.S. District Court earlier this month gave Fortier same 12-year
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols is expected to go on trial again late next year or in
early 2001 in an Oklahoma court on state murder charges.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, the high court:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upheld a Maine program that subsidizes children attending
private, nonreligious schools while refusing to spend state money
for those who go to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refused to let Pennsylvania exempt religious publications from
a state sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agreed to decide whether former Associate Attorney General
Webster Hubbell's guilty plea on a misdemeanor tax charge will
stand. The court will try to clarify whether prosecutors can use
documents against defendants who are required to produce them under
a limited grant of legal immunity. Hubbell, a friend of President
Clinton, said his immunity deal with Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr should have precluded Starr from using the tax documents.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agreed to hear a challenge by ranching and farming groups to
the Clinton administration's regulation of livestock grazing on
millions of acres of federal land throughout the West. The court
voted to study the appeal, which says the administration's 1995
rules violate a 65-year-old law and threaten the livelihood of tens
of thousands of ranchers.

MESSIAEN'S EXCURSION INTO RAPTUROUS OPERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As it becomes clear that Gerard Mortier will be replaced as
director of the Salzburg Festival when his contract expires in
2001, a new release of Olivier Messiaen's lone, immense opera ``St.
Francois d'Assise,'' recorded in performance at the festival, is
especially timely. The production of this opera was the main event
of Mortier's first Salzburg season, in 1992, and in many ways it
was a declaration of intent.
</P>
<P>
   New music, as much as old, was now to benefit from the
festival's resources and prestige. More comprehensively, new stage
directors were to change the look of the festival: ``St. Francois''
brought Peter Sellars to Salzburg for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The new release (Deutsche Grammophon 445 176-2; four CDs),
recorded at a revival last year, leaves out the wonders and
conundrums of Sellars' staging, but it will serve as a magnificent
reminder of the musical achievements of Mortier's decade at
Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   And after all, the sound is what matters here. Messiaen was a
master of sound, and he often said that his aim was to astonish, to
shock the listener with wonderful and unexpected sonorities and so
give an intimation of the bliss experienced by souls in Paradise.
In none of his works did he astonish so much, or on so many levels,
as in ``St. Francois.''
</P>
<P>
   The work requires a huge orchestra and chorus, a baritone of
immense authority and stamina in the title role, and a soprano with
the voice of an angel. Until now, anyone wanting to hear ``St.
Francois has had to get to one of its inevitably rare performances
or rely on two recordings: one from the partly defective premiere
production, of 1983; the other an obscure Belgian account conducted
by Kent Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   The new set has faults of its own (some of them because
Salzburg's Felsenreitschule, a large auditorium carved into a
mountainside, is by no means an ideal place in which to record),
but through them all, with total certainty, the work gleams and
radiates.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen sometimes achieved his bewilderments by simple means,
writing melodies that seem rudimentary as they unfold but that
because of the special scales he used, prove puzzlingly difficult
to recall accurately. Plainchant was his model, but what was there
communal and prayerful becomes in his music, and especially in
``St. Francois,'' emphatic individual declamation.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the characters has his own voice (there is no female
role except that of the Angel, who is addressed as male) and his
own repertory of phrases. Like saints in a medieval polyptych, they
carry with them their identifying emblems, which include, in
Messiaen's powerfully expressive world, not only particular melodic
traits but also identifying emotions: the raging self-pity of the
Leper, whom Francis cures; the immature fearfulness of Brother Leo,
one of Francis' companion monks; the overwhelming conviction and
sense of purpose of Francis himself.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because these emotions are contained in melodic symbols _
almost signals _ rather than allowed to interweave and develop, but
also partly because of the almost uniformly slow pace of the
singing, there is no question of realistic representation.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene, in which Francis uses Leo's fear as a
teaching point, is a little liturgy of verses and refrains.
Francis' questing certainty and Leo's anxious doubt are conveyed in
alternation, presented rather than represented. If there is little
dramatic tension among the characters, each of whom exists within
his own frame, there is great drama just in their appearance.
Invested in their separate musics, they address us from inside a
magnificently rich, resonant and strange world: that of Messiaen's
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In this department, Messiaen's search for astonishment took him
way beyond the elemental chantings of the soloists. Perhaps the
most extraordinary thing about ``St. Francois'' is how the vocal
melodies, unaccompanied or given halos of string tone, fit into the
vastly more complex orchestral score.
</P>
<P>
   Often the orchestral image will come from the song or call of a
bird, amplified to sound through a great body of wind and
percussion instruments. The scene that principally concerns the
Leper _ the third of the opera's eight, roughly half-hour scenes _
uses almost no bird songs, as if the leper had shut out the voices
of nature; yet here, too, the score has its awesome moments: low
brass pacings suggestive of Wagner's music for the dragon Fafner,
swirling mixtures of wordless voices with dabs of string and
percussion tone.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestral performance in the new recording, by the Halle
Orchestra under the direction of Nagano, is strong and often
thrilling. Nagano has known this score since it was being written,
and through his command of tempo and sonority he makes it sound out
full and clear.
</P>
<P>
   One hears Messiaen's exultant embrace of all kinds of chords,
timbres and textures: an embrace so contrary to the confinement and
reduction that other composers have recently felt necessary to
express the spiritual life.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent, too, are the soloists. In the title role, Jose van
Dam is superb, conveying the saint's grand calm and benevolence but
intimating the nagging feeling of insufficiency that keeps him on
his path.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Upshaw yields purity as the Angel, and Chris Merritt
supplies the embattled anger of the Leper thoroughly in his
singing, avoiding expressionist exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dam, who has been Francis in every complete performance of
the work so far, has announced that he will not take on this
colossal part again, which adds further value to the recording. Of
course, the piece will go on: the Lincoln Center Festival is
reportedly exploring the possibility of staging a production in New
York. But now there is a permanent record of Messiaen's vision in
all its splendor.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)  
 (af)  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than most dance companies, American Ballet Theater prides
itself on its versatility. And rightly so. Last spring it presented
``Giselle'' and other Old World heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and runs for two
weeks at City Center, the troupe will flaunt its progressive side,
taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de Mille, the wry
populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver partnering of Nacho
Duato.
</P>
<P>
   As disparate as these dances are, however, one piece in the
program stands out as a real stretch: Martha Graham's ``Diversion
of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a union of classical and modern might have been thought
treasonous when the piece was first seen in 1948. Back then, ballet
was lofty and lithe, a passport to the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's work was its antithesis, an earthbound art that bared
the human soul. Her signature move, an abdominal contraction and
release that starts deep in the pelvis, would have made a naif like
Giselle blush with shame.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with choreographers shuttli and forth between
classical and contemporary troupes, adding Graham to Ballet
Theater's repertory is a rare and risky endeavor. Only three other
ballet companies have performed her work, and never in New York,
where her troupe is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an expression in England about taking coals to
Newcastle,'' said Wayne Eagling, artistic director of the Dutch
National Ballet, which will stage its fifth piece by Graham next
month. ``It's like a company bringing Balanchine to New York; it
better be bloody good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some purists are aghast at the notion that dancers with no prior
training in the Graham technique could, after six weeks of
rehearsals, do her work justice. Others wonder why Ballet Theater's
Ashley Tuttle, a paragon of classical form, would bother with
Graham's barefoot modernism. But the most common refrain is simply,
``What took so long?''
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Theater has been a crucible of crossover ballet at least
since 1976, when it asked Ms. Tharp, who was known for setting
dances to songs by Petula Clark and the Beach Boys, to make a piece
for Mikhail Baryshnikov. The result was ``Push Comes to Shove,'' a
public sensation that breached the wall between ballet and modern
dance for good. (The company will perform it, minus Baryshnikov, at
City Center.)
</P>
<P>
   There was talk of adding Graham to the repertory a dozen years
ago. She and her rehearsal director, Peggy Lyman, even came and
taught a class. But the project stalled with Baryshnikov's
departure as artistic director in 1989, Graham's death two years
later and financial crises at both companies. (Ballet Theater paid
off the last of its $5 million debt in 1998, while the Graham
troupe retired its $2 million debt earlier this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director since 1992,
eventually resumed the conversation with Ron Protas, his
counterpart at the Graham studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was important for the company to do a Graham piece,
and do it well, because she's such an influential figure,''
McKenzie said. ``You're going to get it watered down, three times
removed, from some present-day choreographer anyway. So why not go
to the source?''
</P>
<P>
   Protas was game. At the time, he was laying the groundwork for
the new Martha Graham Trust, which licenses her work to dance
companies and schools. The goal, he said, is to keep her work alive
and help it reach a broader audience. To that end, he struck a deal
that allows Ballet Theater to perform ``Diversion of Angels,''
McKenzie's first choice, at a cost of $55,000 for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angels'' was an anomaly for Graham. Sprightly and tender, it
came just after three of her darkest works: ``Cave of the Heart,''
``Night Journey'' and ``Errand Into the Maze.'' Instead of Medea,
Jocasta and Ariadne, the tragic heroines of those glosses on Greek
myth, it presents three couples happily in love.
</P>
<P>
   To Graham, who created the piece during her brief marriage to
Erick Hawkins and never performed in it, the couples represented
different shades of devotion. The two lovers dressed in white
should appear ``mature and balanced,'' Protas told the dancers
after watching a rehearsal earlier this month. The red couple
should be erotic, he added, the yellow one playful and elusive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The dancing, to an ebullient score by Norman Dello Joio, is
arguably lighter and more linear than anything else in Graham's
oeuvre. But it's no cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot hide behind a narrative or a story or a dramatic
portrayal,'' said Peter Sparling, a former Graham dancer whose
modern-dance troupe in Ann Arbor, Mich., recently performed
``Angels.'' ``It's essential, lyrical Graham. The technique is laid
bare.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her dancers once dubbed the piece ``Perversion of
Angles,'' a sobriquet that seems even more apt at Ballet Theater.
Four weeks into rehearsals, the dancers had the basic structure
down. But the women were still struggling to throw themselves into
radical tilts without falling off balance and learning to leap
without letting their center of gravity ride too high.
</P>
<P>
   The men, wearing knee pads and ballet slippers that will have to
be gone by opening night, grimaced as they plunged to the floor and
tried to spiral right back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the purest modern &UR; - &LR; dance technique there is,'' said
Keith Roberts, a principal dancer who has created roles with Ms.
Tharp, James Kudelka and Lar Lubovitch. ( Roberts will also dance
in Lubovitch's newest work, ``Meadow.'') ``It's like asking a
modern dancer to do `Sleeping Beauty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the effort is not unprecedented. Many notable Graham
dancers (including Graham herself) mastered her technique after
years of classical training.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Nureyev, who was jeered during his clumsy debut with the
Graham company in 1984, eventually became an important interpreter
of her work. And last year the Colorado Ballet scored a hit with
its production of ``Appalachian Spring'' (1944), after six solid
weeks of rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Takako Asakawa, a Graham protege who is teaching them the piece,
said she had hoped to start off with a few weeks of classes. But
the troupe's busy schedule made that impossible. So after showing
them a 1976 video of ``Angels,'' with herself as the red girl, she
dived right in, demonstrating each of the roles herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best way of bringing it to life is through imitation,''
said Roberts, who dances as the red boy. ``We may not fully grasp
what's going on, but if we can imitate it until we get it into our
body, then we can start understanding the feeling of it. It's kind
of a backward approach, but it's all we can do in the time we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more striking images in rehearsal was that of Ms.
Tuttle, her feet wreathed in adhesive tape, laying a string of
altered arabesques across the floor. Every few steps she stopped,
lifted herself up on point with a visceral contraction and then
surged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie had initially pegged her as the yellow girl, an
effervescent role that seemed to suit her persona. ``My natural
movement quality is to be more upright, more flighty, more like
Giselle,'' she said. But Ms. Asakawa, sensing an untapped
potential, shrewdly recast her as the red girl.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, Ms. Asakawa said, she has found Ballet Theater's
dancers more receptive to Graham than their peers at the Paris
Opera Ballet, where she restaged ``Temptations of the Moon'' (1986)
a few years ago. But with two weeks to go, she was still
dissatisfied with their timing and spacing, and she thought their
transitions were rough.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again she instructed them to flex their feet, molded
their torsos with her hands and shared emotional insights into the
roles. In a dance studio, it was pretty much business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to look like people who have studied Graham
technique for 12 years,'' Protas said. ``But I think they will have
mastered it to a degree that's acceptable and dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he offered an anecdote that, if true, appears to call the
entire enterprise into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha's disciples have much more rigidity about her work than
she did,'' he said. ``One time she told Misha, `Darling, this
contraction and release thing: it's so overrated.' Of course, it's
the whole basis of her work.''

DO PANAMA HATS REALLY COME FROM PANAMA? (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I was told that Panama hats aren't from the country of
Panama. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.H., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Panama straw hats are actually from Ecuador. The most
widely accepted explanation for the misplaced name is that the hats
were originally exported from Panama, according to Fino Fino, a hat
retailer in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers on the Panama Canal found them to be durable headwear
and comfortable under the tropical sun,'' states the Fino Fino Web
site. Another early wearer, President Teddy Roosevelt, helped to
popularize Panamas in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fino Fino takes its name from the Montecristi fino, a hand-woven
Panama hat still made in Ecuador that ranges in price from $250 to
$10,000. All of the retailer's Panama buyers are inducted into the
Peninsula Panama Hat Society, which meets every June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continued existence of the Ecuadorian weavers of the
Montecristis is dependent on the demand for this quality of hat,''
according to Fino Fino. For more information, visit the company Web
site at www.finofino.com or call (650) 321-8720.

   _ Mrs. G.A.W., Northborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to her in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Streep, 50, is starring next in ``Music of the Heart'' with
Gloria Estefan and Angela Bassett. In the film, which premieres
Oct. 29, Streep plays a Harlem violin teacher whose students earn
an opportunity to perform at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Off screen, Streep is active with Mothers &AMP; Others for a Livable
Planet, a not-for-profit group she co-founded in 1989 with several
neighbors in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The 30,000-member group, which has a Web site at
www.mothers.org, promotes organic food, opposes genetically
engineered ingredients and is involved in other environmental
consumer issues.

<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Who are the voices of the Budweiser frogs and lizards?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.J., Anderson, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The lizards are voiced by Daniel Mastrogiorgio (Frank)
and Paul Christie (Louie), frogs by Tom Woodard (Bud), Ronnie
Brooks (Weis) and Brian Steckler (Er), and the ferret by Bob
Morrow, according to Robert Dougherty, publisher of an unofficial
Budweiser Lizards Web site.

 &HT;    Electronic Campus a joint effort of colleges in 16 states
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brandy McCorkle had a problem. She needed one more
course to graduate, but the course she needed on the Mississippi
State campus conflicted with her job. She was stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Stacia Washer, a full-time hospital worker in Quality, Ky., and
a busy mother, desperately needed to find time to study toward a
degree _ but how to fit it in an already demanding schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Both of these women found refuge in one of the newest and
fastest growing sources of higher education, the Electronic Campus.
It is a fast-growing so-called distance learning program, where
students in 16 states take college courses by way of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus, not to be confused with the new Georgia
GLOBE program, started just two years ago with 104 courses and has
now mushroomed into one of the biggest ``campuses'' in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the Electronic Campus comprised more than 2,000
courses, with more than 20,000 students enrolled, many of them in
their choice of 65 degree programs. All level of degrees are
offered, and the Electronic Campus is now connected to the Georgia
Galileo library system, providing vast new sources of reference
readings to the students on the far-flung campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this program is that we are not a flea
market, we are a mall, an educational mall,'' said Mark Musick,
president of the Southern Regional Education Board, which started
and now governs the Electronic Campus.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was envisioned in 1996, the Web-based campus has been
governed by the participating colleges that offer courses. It is
coordinated by the SREB.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges maintain records of enrolled students, keep track
of their progress and decide what credits are given for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The SREB acts as the switchboard for the courses, and as dean
assuring that the courses are of the right caliber. The board,
through Musick and his team, puts together support services like
the Galileo addition.
</P>
<P>
   And so McCorkle got Mississippi State credit for her course, and
Washer can work through Western Kentucky, the school she would
attend if she had the time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything on the Internet, its glory is the always the
connection, giving students and schools a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Musick said Clayton College &AMP; State University and Southern
Polytechnic have been among the busiest and most creative partners
in the Electronic Campus. Clayton's former president, Richard
Skinner, was named this year to organize a new program of
electronic education to bolster Georgians' opportunity to benefit
from distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the state's program, GLOBE or Global Learning
On-line for Business and Education, is to get more Georgians to
take college courses and to strengthen the state's pool of workers
in information technology and develop other skills for business
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus has no such focus but instead stretches
broadly to provide a range of courses, emphasizing regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how the colleges, normally so competitive, agreed to
such a cooperative program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors of the 16 states decided three years ago that we
needed this 'educational free trade zone' to suit students needs
and strengthen the system for the region,'' Musick said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that though schools are competitive, on the
higher levels and in research endeavors, cooperation has always
been a hallmark of secondary education. This has led to a kind of
educational ``common market'' approach to electronic or distance
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a sense of cooperation as we build this
program,'' said Bruce N. Chaloux, Electronic Campus director.
</P>
<P>
   The range of offerings is large, from simple courses with
reading lists and study guides to others that are interactive Web
sites, with give and take between teachers and even among students.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus can be viewed at the following site:
www.sreb.org.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton State's Web offerings range from Accounting 101 to
periodontics and AIDS management to courses in writing and music
appreciation. To view the courses and enrollment information at
Clayton State, see the following site: distancelearning
</P>
<P>
   .clayton.edu/srec/
</P>
<P>
   Some futurists have predicted that the growth of distance
learning could spell the end of higher education as we know it, and
provide an escape from the rigidity and expense of old-fashioned
education using bricks and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chaloux sees it another way. ``Youngsters will still go to
college,'' he said, ``but the ways they learn will change and there
will be newer options and approaches that will enhance their
learning opportunities.''

 &HT;    New drug arrives in time for flu season
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Early indications suggest the flu season will
arrive sooner and hit harder this winter than in normal years. On
the bright side, though, doctors will be able to battle influenza
with a newly approved prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always speculation as to whether the numbers are going to
be high,'' says Greg Rozelle, director of the personal health
division for the Combined Health District of Montgomery County,
Ohio. ``But there's a little bit of a difference in the vaccine
this year. When the strains change, more people tend to get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials are predicting flu to strike four weeks
earlier than usual because of a strain that infected people on
Alaskan cruise ships the past two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Rozelle has seen no cases confirmed with laboratory tests so far
this season.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too soon for people to get their vaccines, Rozelle
says. They're becoming available at county health departments,
senior centers, clinics, doctor's offices and many drugstores and
supermarkets will offer them. Medicare covers flu shots for its
elderly and disabled beneficiaries, who are the people most in need
of receiving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People over 65, people with chronic medical risks and health
care workers dealing with people at risk should be vaccinated every
year,'' Rozelle says. ``It's especially important for diabetics and
people with chronic heart, kidney or respiratory problems.
Influenza can lead to serious complications including pneumonia,
and every year a few deaths are attributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flu is blamed for 20,000 deaths a year in the United States,
with as many as 50 million contracting the virus. Its most common
symptoms are sudden high fever, headache and upper respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got the flu, it knocks you off your feet,'' Rozelle
says. ``You're not going to be coming in to work sniffling to the
boss, `Man, I'm sick.' You're going to be home in bed.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as stomach or intestinal flu, Rozelle
says, although other viruses cause diarrhea and abdominal pain.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to recognize flu symptoms early because the new
drug, Relenza, can diminish the effects of both A and B types of
influenza if treatment begins within the first two days of
symptoms. The drug is inhaled through the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The flu strains that this year's vaccination inoculates against
are A/Beijing, A/Sydney and B/Yamanashi, Rozelle says. Those are
the killed viruses used in the vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on a bit of scientific guesswork,'' Rozelle says.
``They take a look at what's happening in other parts of the world.
But they're usually pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   People with confirmed food allergies to eggs should not receive
flu shots because eggs are used in manufacturing the vaccine,
Rozelle says.

 &HT;    UPN's `Miami Vice' of the desert lacks charismatic leads,
originality
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All buddy cop films look the same. There's a black cop and a
white cop. The white cop is usually the seen-it-all veteran. He
squints a lot, which makes him look cooler than he really is. The
black cop is the jive-talking, designer clothes-wearing sidekick.
He fires the cliched one-liners between car crashes and big-budget
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   If all buddy cop movies are frustratingly formulaic, the same
can be said about buddy cop TV shows. That brings us to ``The
Strip,'' UPN's by-the-numbers cop series that tries too hard to be
the millennium's new ``Miami Vice.'' But chances are ``The Strip,''
executive produced by Joel Silver (''The Matrix,'' ``Lethal
Weapon''), won't be around long enough to ring in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strip'' is the kind of show you can watch with the volume
down and still know what's going on. Crockett and Tubbs have
nothing to fear. The always squinting Elvis Ford (Sean Patrick
Flanery) and the jive-talking Jesse Weir (Guy Torry) are loose
cannon Las Vegas cops. That means they duke it out with bad guys in
moving trucks, hang on the back of speeding limos and dis Kevin
Bacon between those scenes when they're not duking it out with bad
guys in moving trucks and hanging on the back of speeding limos.
</P>
<P>
   But Elvis and Jesse turn in their badges. Well, to be more
accurate, they toss them off a roof, after they're made the
scapegoats for a botched FBI investigation. They're immediately
hired by a big-shot casino tycoon (Joe Viterelli) to, you know, do
the jobs the cops can't _ or won't. First up: find a wealthy
client's kidnapped wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's nothing new or interesting to see, the series'
success rides on its stars. Unfortunately, both Flanery and Torry
look and act like third-rate TV stars. As Elvis, Flanery clearly
went to the Luke Perry School of Acting. He has the same
disheveled, I-don't-care-how-I-look-because-I'm-still-cool
attitude. Torry is mildly amusing, but he's no Eddie Murphy or
Chris Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strip'' certainly moves fast. But it's going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE STRIP
</P>
<P>
   Today: 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A by-the-numbers cop series that tries too hard to
be the new ``Miami Vice.''

IN CANADA, COWS GET GENTLE GENDER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Clover is OK, ditto for Buttercup. But Suzie or Elsie
are definite no-nos.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy is borderline, and would probably require executive
approval before it could be bestowed on a cow _ at least on a cow
at Canada's Central Experimental Farm, a federal agricultural
museum and research center in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of bovine correctness coming to the barnyard.
</P>
<P>
   Instituting a policy that has raised bellows of derision on
farms across the land, bureaucrats have ordered the center to cease
the custom of giving ``human female names'' to cows because such
names might give offense to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are ... sensitive to finding their name on an
animal. I am, for example,'' Genevieve Ste-Marie, director of the
National Museum of Science and Technology, which oversees the farm,
told the Ottawa Citizen. ``Let's say you came in and found your
name on a cow, and you thought the cow was old and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ste-Marie is responsible for the directive banning feminine
names for dairy cows. Instead, new cows at the government facility
must be provided only ``non-people names,'' such as Red-Leg or
Rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals should have their own names,'' said Ste-Marie.
</P>
<P>
   So Maple is fine, but Mabel is forbidden. Bossy gets the nod,
but not Bessie. Names unusual for women but not unheard of _ Skye
or Jewel, say _ will get the nay or yea on a cow-by-cow basis.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the change was instituted after a woman
visiting the research farm was insulted to discover she shared her
name with a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a complaint raised that a cow was called
Stephani,'' said Michelle Dondo-Tardiff, director of the farm's
Agriculture Museum. ``It was a verbal complaint from somebody named
Stephani.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Ariel, Becky, Lucy, Meg, Rosella, Veronica,
and the other 45 milk cows at the center _ even the offending
Stephani _ can continue chewing their cuds in contentment. The
original plan to change existing names was deemed impractical. And
the names of Dapple, Ghost, and Jello were safe from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Cows aren't the only critters under scrutiny. The rule will be
applied to sheep, pigs, horses, and other animals at the facility,
which is a popular destination for school tours and family outings.
</P>
<P>
   Male names may also be consigned to the dust heap of Canadian
farm history: No more Tom Turkey, no more Gilbert Goose, and,
presumably, no more pigs called Wilbur, as in E.B. White's classic,
``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to squash sexism on the farm has touched off a
cavalcade of calls to radio talk shows and letters to newspapers.
Most citizens seem more appalled than amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows are wonderful animals and give us perfect food: milk,''
wrote Mildred Beechey of Ottawa. ``I'm proud to have `Millie the
cow' in the barn at the center. . . . My advice to this woman is to
change her name and leave the cows alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no hard rules for naming ordinary milk cows
on private farms, most are given female names _ although non-human
monikers are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a `Spiffy' and we've got a `Straw,' which aren't
girl names,'' said Angela Hamelin, who runs a dairy farm near
Kingston, Ontario. ``But usually we just give them female names _
`Donna,' `Debbie,' whatever. And yes, one of ours is called
`Angie.' Why would I mind? Cows are sweet and productive animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Registered cows _ that is, cows of pure stock, such as
Holsteins, Swiss, or Jerseys, whose bloodlines can be traced for
generations _ receive three names for record-keeping: the name of
the farm, the name of the sire, and the cow's ``personal'' name,
plus a number designating the cow's matriarchal line.
</P>
<P>
   Male cattle seldom get names because most are herded off to the
slaughterhouse before reaching maturity. There isn't a lot of use
for bulls down on the modern farm; almost all dairy cows are
impregnated by artificial insemination these days.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over cow names has spawned a spate of humorous
complaints from people whose names might be associated with farm
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to be named Bill?'' demanded Bill Steele of
Nepean, Ontario, in a letter to the Ottawa Citizen. ``How about
having a duck's nose named after you? That cuts me to the quick
every time I hear it.''

1979 IRANIAN MILITANT IS A MODERATE TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHERAN, Iran _ If anyone could stand as a bellweth%r of Iran's
changing political climate, it might be Abbas Abdi, a
mild-mannered, soft-spoken man whose office on a tree-shaded Tehran
side street seems a world away from the furies Abdi and other
militants unleashed at the dawn of Iran's Islamic revolution 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   These days Abdi, thickset and balding at 43, is an influential
figure in the May 23 Movement, a group of moderate Muslim clerics,
scholars, journalists and others who campaigned for the election of
Iran's reformist President, Mohammad Khatami, on May 23, 1997. More
than two years later, Khatami is embroiled in a bitter struggle
with hard-line Muslim clerics who oppose his plans for a more
democratic form of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   But it is another date, Nov. 4, 1979, that is branded on Abdi's
mind. On that day, nine months after the shah's downfall, Abdi was
one of three student leaders who masterminded the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy, setting off a hostage crisis that kept 56 U.S.
diplomats captive for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, a failed U.S. rescue effort left eight U.S.
servicemen dead in the Iranian desert, Jimmy Carter's presidency
was fatally weakened and Iran and the United States settled into an
enmity that has yet to relent.
</P>
<P>
   To those who watched him harangue crowds outside the ``den of
spies,'' as the students called the embassy, few men seemed more
committed than Abdi to the puritanical, anti-Western vision of
Iran's revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But now he writes columns for a liberal Tehran newspaper,
Sobh-e-Emrooz. In them, he offers civics lessons about free speech
to Islamic hard-liners who have struck back at reformers by closing
newspapers, imprisoning editors and threatening summary executions
for any opponents deemed to have ``insulted Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Through a research group with close links to Khatami, he
conducts polls and plans strategy for the reform cause in the
parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 18, a watershed for
reformers and conservatives alike. In the battle lines being drawn
up, he finds himself arrayed against many former militants who view
him as an apostate. But he is supported by as many others who, like
himself, have decided that it is time for Iran to renounce
revolutionary excess.
</P>
<P>
   The change in Abdi is one that many Iranians who accept the
revolution find barely credible. But in an interview in his office
across the street from the University of Tehran campus, which has
become a focal point of support for Khatami just as it was once a
center of opposition to the shah, Abdi said his transition to
Western values has been less a matter of repudiating his past than
learning from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand us, you have to think of us as mammals who never
lived out of water before 1979, and who are only now learning to
walk on dry land,'' he said. ``For Americans freedom is an everyday
commodity, but for us, under the shah's dictatorship, it was
something unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we took the embassy, we acted on the basis of what we
knew, and that was despotism. Today we have chosen a different
course, based on what we learned from the past 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lessons have led Abdi to argue in his newspaper columns
for Khatami's concept of a ``civil society,'' with democratic
institutions, guarantees of fundamental freedoms, and due process
of law. Such arrangements would be removed from Iran's experience
since 1979, with most of the levers of power in the hands of a
powerful and often vengeful class of conservative Muslim clerics
who have rarely hesitated to persecute opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that has left nobody safe. In 1993, Abdi's first
cautious dissent from revolutionary orthodoxy cost him nine months
in solitary confinement in Tehran's Evin prison, where many of the
revolution's early victims were executed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, his name was on a ``death list'' of reformers revealed
by an intelligence ministry defector. After five of those on the
list were killed by an Intelligence Ministry death squad late last
year, Khatami replaced the intelligence minister and ordered the
prosecution of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But with no sign of any of those arrested being brought to
trial, fear still stalks reformers and infuses their political
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know now that any system that allows one group to eliminate
another entails an endless cycle of retribution,'' Abdi said. ``We
have learned that even if you can eliminate your opponent now, in
the long run, he may eliminate you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to look at the shah. He tried to eliminate the
clergy, and they ended up eliminating him. So what we need is a
system in which everybody agrees to tolerate competing viewpoints,
whatever they may be.''

</P>
<P>
   Abdi's own reckoning with history passed a notable milestone
last July, when he met privately in Paris with Barry Rosen, a
former embassy hostage who is now executive director of external
affairs for Teachers College of Columbia University and who has
spoken strongly in favor of a rapprochement between the United
States and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said hello, shook hands, and sat down,'' the Iranian said.
``We both knew that there was nothing personal in what happened in
1979, so we were quite relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many senior Iranian officials acknowledge that the
embassy takeover was a blunder, but saying so publicly is another
matter. Conservatives still regard the affair with iconic
reverence, and anybody condemning it risks being accused of being
``an American spy.'' The result, in Abdi's case, is an awkward
equivocation, in which he distances himself from the takeover, but
stops short of explicitly disavowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, much about his demeanor during the interview _ slumped
shoulders, voice barely audible _ suggested misgivings. After
noting that the students were careful to see that the Americans
were not physically harmed, he added quickly, ``Of course, it was
not a hotel, and nobody can say they were not hurt emotionally or
psychologically, even though it was not our intention.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he said, ``You can't judge from hindsight. That's
not to say what we did 20 years ago was right or wrong, only that
it should be judged against its time.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As if reflecting the disdain with which many ordinary Iranians
now view the way the Americans were treated, the former embassy
compound on Taleqani Street in central Tehran is a ghostly sight.
Although it remains what it has been for nearly 20 years, a high
school for the Revolutionary Guards corps that has been the
revolution's most relentless enforcer, the slogan on the outer wall
_ ``We will face America with a severe defeat!'' _ has long since
faded. Nearby, a bookstore that sold pamphlets celebrating the
takeover has been closed.
</P>
<P>
   When he led the takeover, as a member of a group known as the
Student Followers of the Imam's Line, Abdi was a zealous supporter
of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's absolute ruler from the
downfall of the shah in February 1979 until his death 10 years
later. For Khomeini, the embassy seizure was simultaneously a means
of humiliating the United States _ the ``Great Satan'' of his
diatribes _ and of uniting his fractious followers in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Abdi has more prosaic memories. The students' plan, he said, was
to hold the embassy for ``five to seven days,'' to protest
President Carter's decision to admit the shah to the United States
for medical treatment. What kept the hostages captive for 14
months, he said, was the United States' refusal to make any
concessions and the fact that the embassy became a ``rallying
point'' for the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us deal with our internal problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Abdi said the students hoped to end the occupation by winning
the shah's expulsion from the United States, or an apology for
decades of U.S. support for the exiled monarch. In the end, a
guarded American apology waited until April this year, when
President Clinton, responding to Khatami's calls for dialogue, said
at a White House reception that Iranians had ``historic
grievances'' against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Secret negotiations secured the hostages' release on Jan. 20,
1980, the day President Reagan was inaugurated. As Americans
rejoiced, Abdi and his fellow hostage-takers had a quiet
celebration of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very happy that we were able to deliver them safely,''
he said. ``We had held them for a long time, under conditions of
great stress, always trying to make sure that nothing happened to
them. Perhaps Americans don't realize it, but it wasn't a exactly
an easy experience for us, either.''

ZIMMER HAS UNIQUE TAKE ON SOX-YANKEES RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After taking a foul ball off the side of his head in
Game 1 of the Yankees' Division Series against the Rangers and then
jokingly wearing a combat helmet in Game 2 for protection, the
headaches have returned for Don Zimmer. With Boston and New York
playing in the American League Championship Series, the Yankees
bench coach and former Red Sox manager must deal with a lot of
ticket requests.
</P>
<P>
   Finding seats for family in the New England area will cost more
and cause a little extra aggravation for Zimmer. But such is the
price for switching sides in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Zimmer managed Boston during an up-and-down season that
resulted in a one-game playoff with New York. The Red Sox' season
ended when Bucky Dent belted a three-run homer in the seventh
inning that gave the Yankees a 5-4 victory. For the past four
seasons, the 68-year-old Zimmer has served as bench coach for the
team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the 50th anniversary of his first season in
professional baseball, Zimmer was the designated expert on
rivalries Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The rivalry between the Red Sox and Yankees) is not as big
today as it was in the '70s,'' said Zimmer. ``First of all, there's
a reason. In the '70s, the Yankees had a lineup they put on the
field every day. I had a lineup I put on the field every day.
Everybody gets to know your own players after five or six years.
They're all on the same team. Today, that's not the way. There's no
question that the rivalry has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were players that hated each other in the '70s. I don't
think that feeling is there today. Bill Lee was hated by the
Yankees. (Carlton) Fisk didn't like (Thurman) Munson and Munson
didn't like Fisk and that's what it was all about in the '70s. I
don't think that feeling is there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer remembered that two sections of the left-field bleachers
were empty when the Red Sox journeyed to the Bronx earlier this
season. He could not remember a similar scene in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer acknowledged that returning to Boston for the ALCS is
special. Whenever he returns to Fenway Park, Zimmer has flashbacks
to his tenure with the Red Sox. And this season, he has kept a
watchful eye on the decisions by Boston manager Jimy Williams, who
is a close friend and once played for Zimmer in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent more years in Boston than any city in the major
leagues,'' said Zimmer. ``I spent seven years there and I loved
every moment of it except a minute and a half.''

NOBEL PRIZES AWARDED FOR RESEARCH ON BEHAVIOR OF MOLECULES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Egypt, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Calif., Mass., Mich.,
Texas)   By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobel Prizes worth nearly $1 million each were awarded Tuesday
to an Egyptian-American chemist and to two Dutch theoretical
physicists for opening new perspectives on the behavior of
molecules and subnuclear particles.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry award by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences
went to Dr. Ahmed H. Zewail, 53, of the California Institute of
Technology. Zewail, who holds dual Egyptian and American
citizenship, was honored for developing a laser spectroscopy
technique that has been called the world's fastest camera. Zewail's
system, now used by chemists throughout the world, takes ultrafast
snapshots of reacting molecules, revealing each split-second step
even of very complex interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ed Wasserman, president of the American Chemical Society,
described Zewail as ``the father of femtochemistry,'' the chemistry
that occurs on a time scale of extremely small fractions of a
second.
</P>
<P>
   A femtosecond is the fraction of a second represented by a 1
preceded by 14 zeros and a decimal point. It is the same fraction
of a second as the proportion of one second to 32 million years.
</P>
<P>
   Among many applications of the technique, femtochemistry has
been used to study the complex and lightning-fast chemical changes
that occur in rodopsin, a pigment in the eye's retina essential to
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The work for which the Nobel in physics was awarded focused on a
much smaller scale of objects _ the building-block particles on
which all matter is based. The prize will be shared by Dr. Martinus
J.G. Veltman, 68, a retired University of Michigan professor who
lives in Bilthoven, Netherlands, and his former student and
collaborator, Dr. Gerardus 't Hooft, 53, of the University of
Utrecht, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sheldon L. Glashow of Harvard University, co-winner of the
1979 Nobel in physics, said in an interview that many physicists
had expected the prize this year to go to Veltman and 't Hooft,
whose work was a ``watershed, richly deserving of the award.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the calculational system they developed,'' Glashow
said, ``no one would have taken the electro-weak theory
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The electro-weak theory, developed in the 1960s, revealed a
hidden unity underlying both electromagnetism and the weak nuclear
force. It was devised by Glashow and his two fellow Nobel
laureates, Steven Weinberg, now at the University of Texas in
Austin, and the late Abdus Salam of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists have waged an unrelenting campaign for much of the
20th century to find what they believed to be a fundamental
unifying relationship between the four known forces of nature,
electromagnetism, gravity and the strong and weak nuclear forces.
That search has had two prongs, one based on experiments that use
particle accelerators and other apparatus, and the other on
theoretical mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial mathematical technique developed by theorists was
``renormalization,'' the transformation of equations into new
variations to eliminate the infinite (and therefore meaningless)
answers sometimes inadvertently produced by this type of
calculation. Another development was ``non-Abelian gauge theory,''
in which a change in the sequence of operations performed on an
equation to change its form changes its result.
</P>
<P>
   A famous Nobel laureate in physics, Dr. Richard Feynman, used
theoretical mathematics as the basis of his calculational
invention, the Feynman Diagram, which quickly became a universal
simplifying tool of physicists studying quantum electrodynamics. It
is used to describe what happens when, for example, an electron and
a neutrino collide.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the results predicted by theory were clearly out of
line, and in the late '60s, Veltman devised a computer program
called Schoonship to perform the complex calculations needed to
renormalize non-Abelian gauge theories. In 1969, Veltman was joined
by a 22-year-old student, t' Hooft, and together, the two
physicists devised a refined method of calculation that
successfully predicted the existence of two previously unknown
particles, the W and Z particles, and the properties of a then
undiscovered particle called the top quark.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chris Quigg, a theoretical physicist at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory, became a friend of t' Hooft's in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a brilliant instinct for putting things in their right
places,'' Quigg recalled in an interview Tuesday. ``You or I would
start a jigsaw puzzle by first finding pieces that would fit along
the edges. But he could start by taking a piece and putting it in
the middle somewhere, just where it would eventually fit
neighboring pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Zewail's snapshot invention, based on lasers, interferometers,
spectrometers and sophisticated sensors rather than beakers and
flasks, was a long step beyond traditional ``wet'' chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a chemist, but I like to look at the physics of
chemistry,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, Zewail's research group at Caltech found that
they could create a kind of moving picture of the making and
breaking of chemical bonds in a fast reaction by making a series of
frames of the reaction. To do that, they first fire a laser pulse
into the sample to initiate the reaction and then, a femtosecond or
so later, they trigger a second pulse, on which the spectroscopic
signature of the reacting molecules is imprinted on the laser light
as it passes through. Another femtosecond later, another pulse
registers the next phase of the reaction, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works just as well for recording chemical changes in
gigantic molecules like DNA as it does for simple molecules,''
Zewail said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his native Egypt planned a celebration of his
Nobel award, he said: ``I wouldn't be surprised. They've already
put my picture on a postage stamp.''

PBS PHOTOGRAPHY DOCUMENTARY ACTS TOO MUCH LIKE THE TOURIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American Photography: A Century of Images,'' the three-part
documentary beginning Wednesday night on PBS, begins with
devastating images: scenes of the havoc wreaked by tornadoes this
spring in Oklahoma and Kansas. But it's not the destruction that's
affecting; it's the photos.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshots, really. Hundreds, maybe thousands of them, neatly
laid out on tables in a community center. They were ripped out of
their homes by the tornadoes, recovered miles away, and now lie
waiting for their owners to reclaim them. They're mixed in a
confusing assortment, and people wander through the center, trying
to find their memories amid the mass.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, ``American Photography'' has implanted itself in
your brain: What if this happened to you? What if your photos,
documenting your family, your vacations, your celebrations,
suddenly vanished? The opening scene is a great device for
illustrating the importance of photography.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a great analogy for what's right and wrong with
``American Photography.'' Because out of hundreds of possibilities,
the series has uncovered some beautiful, striking examples of
photography as art and journalism _ and let dozens of others get
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the series' episodes, averaging a little more than 50
minutes apiece, focuses on an era. The first part, ``The Developing
Image,'' centers on the first third of the century, when
visionaries such as Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand helped
photography evolve as art. (The former used darkroom manipulation,
the latter worked creatively with the camera itself.) The first
episode also addresses photography's role in bringing home the
horrors of World War I, and Teddy Roosevelt's astute understanding
of how the camera can help construct a politician's image.
</P>
<P>
   The second episode, ``The Photographic Age,'' is about the
middle third of the century, with the growth of newspaper wire
services, the beginnings of the pinup, and the worldwide impact
that photos gave catastrophes such as the Hindenburg disaster and
Pearl Harbor. The third part, ``Photography Transformed,'' takes us
into the modern (and sometimes digitally altered) age. It rehashes
the oft-discussed way that President Kennedy knew how to take
advantage of the camera while President Nixon seemed defeated by
it, and offers glimpses of Vietnam, which one interview subject
calls the only ``uncensored'' war.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Photography'' rushes through these subjects with the
speed and brutality of a ``paparazzo's'' motor-driven camera. It's
a frustrating bit of must-see public TV _ must-see for what it
contains, frustrating for what it's missing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most famous images are here, and you'd be disappointed if
they weren't: the raising of the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima, Jack Ruby
shooting Lee Harvey Oswald, the ``whole Earth'' photo of the late
'60s, Buzz Aldrin setting foot on the moon, a student wailing over
a dead body at Kent State. Images you might not be familiar with _
photos of a World War I soldier's face blown into a half-moon by an
explosion, of Depression-era families enduring the Dust Bowl, of
atrocities of the pre-civil-rights era _ add depth to the series.
</P>
<P>
   But crunching 100 years into 160 minutes makes for some glaring
omissions. It's odd that a TV series would ignore the contributions
of television and movies, which are forms of photography; movies
began as a series of still photos, each slightly different from the
last, that became moving images when run together. (Maybe it's
because TV is ignored that the TV camera here insists on zooming in
on the still photos, telling you what to look at instead of letting
you decide for yourself.)
</P>
<P>
   The series' third episode is the most problematic, because it
gives lip service at best to photography's impact on pop culture.
Earlier episodes glance at the influence of ``Life'' and ``National
Geographic''; why does the last ignore ``Playboy'' (a cultural
phenomenon, like it or not) and ``Rolling Stone,'' which has
perhaps the best photography of many photo-obsessed magazines.
Where are the contributions that photography made to album covers,
movie posters and even television _ what would Farrah Fawcett have
been without her famous pinup photo?
</P>
<P>
   And although the series name-drops Andy Warhol and Robert
Rauschenberg, it never even mentions such luminaries as Annie
Leibovitz, Richard Avedon, Robert Mapplethorpe and Herb Ritts _ and
these are just the tip of a late-20th century iceberg. How can you
do a series about photos and not mention Leibovitz, perhaps the
pre-eminent celebrity photographer since the '60s?
</P>
<P>
   If anything, ``American Photography'' should have been longer;
this fascinating subject could easily have justified a
decade-by-decade, 10-episode series. It's like traveling to a
foreign land and taking pictures only of the landmarks. What you
see will make you ooh and aah. But there's a bigger picture out
there, and though this is a worthy series, it leaves that picture
underdeveloped.

RULING AGAINST BAN ON GAYS IN MILITARY RILES BRITISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a nation that clings fiercely to its traditions,
there was gnashing of teeth when a European court in France told
the British military that its ban against homosexuals was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, the voice of conservative Britain,
responded by devoting half of its letters page to the subject under
the headline, ``Devastating effects of open homosexuality in the
Forces.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who cherish tradition here will have to get used to
the idea of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights
having growing influence over their way of life. The ruling that
forced the British government to suspend the ban against
homosexuals in the military, and that may force it to scrap it for
good, is only one of many that will probably challenge and
fundamentally change longstanding British institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law passed last year by the British Parliament, the
European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into
British law in October 2000. It requires the British government to
make its domestic laws compatible with the convention and judgments
by the Strasbourg court based on the document. It will also
obligate British judges to interpret human rights according to the
convention, which has sided more often with individual rights than
with institutional ones.
</P>
<P>
   The British military is just the first of many institutions here
that will feel the results. The new law will:
</P>
<P>
   --End immunity for government agencies and open the door to
negligence suits against the police and social service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   --End or severely curtail the practice of Britain's intelligence
agencies of routinely blocking publication of critical books and
newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   --Expose the lucrative tabloid newspaper industry to huge
judgments for invasion of privacy, something it is used to doing
with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Emmerson, a lawyer who represented two of the four
homosexuals who won their case challenging the ban on gays in the
military, said the Human Rights Act that becomes law next year is
``the most significant legal reform ever in the history of the
United Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be piecemeal. It's going to affect every
single decision, from planning to crime, to family law, to
immigration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlos Eleftheriadis, a law lecturer at the London School of
Economics, agreed that the change wrought by the new focus on human
rights will reverberate through British society. But he said that
while traditionalists have tended to criticize the convention as
usurping British sovereignty, the European law can be used to
preserve tradition as often as to challenge it.
</P>
<P>
   The European convention provides Britons with legal protections
not specifically mentioned in British law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a right to privacy in English law,'' Eleftheriadis
said. But privacy is a concept with considerable case law in the
European court. Eleftheriadis said it has been used imaginatively
in environmental cases in which plaintiffs have argued successfully
against property development on the grounds it would result in the
loss of their home, and consequently their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Eleftheriadis noted that the United States and most European
countries have constitutions, while English legal tradition rests
in common law. Laws are made by Parliament, and no court here can
challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the European court cannot strike down British laws, it
can, as it did in the military case, declare that they are
incompatible with the Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strictly speaking, the Strasbourg decisions are not binding,
but in practice they are always respected,'' Eleftheriadis said.
``When they lose in Strasbourg, the British always comply.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it has never happened, and no country seems eager to be
a test case, any signatory to the convention that ignores the
Strasbourg court faces expulsion from the Council of Europe, where
membership is mandatory for all countries in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates say the new emphasis on human rights
will bring British law more into line with other European
countries. In maintaining its ban against gays, the British
military was swimming against the tide of Europe. The Netherlands
lifted its ban in 1972, Denmark in 1979. Italy has a ban that is
not enforced, while Germany does not have a ban.
</P>
<P>
   Britain not only has a ban, but rigorously enforced it. About
1,000 gay men and women have been thrown out of the military in
recent years. In response to last week's decision, George
Robertson, the minister of defense, ordered a halt to proceedings
against about 60 people in one of his last acts before becoming
general secretary of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Defense has always opposed allowing gays to
serve in the military, calling it an ``unwelcome social
experiment'' that would weaken morale and cause havoc.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan Lustig-Prean, 40, a former naval lieutenant commander
and one of the four who fought their discharges in the European
court, said he received support and sympathy from his naval
colleagues, not hostility, when it became clear the Royal Navy was
going to dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
   British courts had backed the military. The European court,
however, ruled that the ban was illegal because the process used to
investigate claims against gay servicemen and women violated their
right to privacy. The court said the British military's view that
having homosexuals in the military would create trouble was
``founded solely upon the negative attitudes of heterosexual
personnel toward those of homosexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cary James, editor of The Pink Paper, a newspaper of the gay
community, said the court's ruling would have repercussions for
other employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a domino effect,'' he said. ``Once the military
falls, the rest can. This could be the driving force for equal
rights for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists such as James have turned their attention to
abolishing Section 28, a clause in the 1988 Local Government Act
that prohibits ``the intentional promotion of homosexuality'' by
local authorities and ``the teaching of homosexuality as a pretend
family relationship'' in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the military case, the judges said homosexuality is
innate,'' James said. That, he said, means any law in Britain that
excludes people based on their sexual orientation would violate the
European Convention on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   While some view the Strasbourg court as another example of
European institutions ruining British traditions, others have
sought to use it to safeguard tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Four independent schools that want to continue doling out
corporal punishment went to the court to challenge a ban against
caning that took effect Sept. 1. Those who want to ban professional
soccer matches on Sunday afternoons have also taken a case to the
court, arguing that the games interfere with their ability to
worship. Landowners want the Strasbourg court to strike down a
British law that gives Britons a statutory right to roam over 4
million acres of privately owned land in England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention is neither left-wing nor right-wing,''
Eleftheriadis said. ``It is the perfect compromise because you
retain parliamentary supremacy, but you create a system of checks
and balances.''

CALIFORNIA'S HOT JOB MARKET FUELS BETTER RAISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The prospect for California's job market appears
so good for next year that workers can expect to receive their
highest pay raises since 1993, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows that one in three companies expects to
hire additional workers.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 556 companies surveyed said they will
increase their budgets for salaries. Among the companies increasing
their budgets, the average merit increase next year will be 4.5
percent - the largest average percentage climb since 1993, when
salaries jumped 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in other compensation, including cost-of-living
raises, bonuses and lump-sum payments, raise the total compensation
to 4.8 percent in 2000, according to the ``Year 2000 Budget
Survey,'' released Monday by the Employers Group, one of the
nation's oldest and largest human resources organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey will get Alan Greenspan's attention, because the
wages generated by the tight labor market are definitely outpacing
the California Consumer Price Index, which is running around 2.5
percent,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It will get the Federal Reserve chairman's attention ``because
California is such a large part of the national economy... The Fed
might take it as a sign of inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-county Los Angeles region, the survey found that
hourly workers could expect on average a 4.72 percent raise.
Clerical and technical workers would average a 4.75 percent raise,
with salaried employees receiving a 4.96 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   Executives can expect to receive the largest raise next year,
with an average of 5.47 percent. The L.A. region encompasses Los
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing levels are also on the rise, with 33 percent of
companies in California expecting to increase their staff next
year, according to the survey. Fifty-five percent of companies
expect their staffing levels to remain the same, while 7.5 percent
of companies surveyed indicated they would lay off employees. The
remaining companies are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Los Angeles region 50 percent of the
companies surveyed indicated they would maintain the same level of
hourly employees, according to Juan P. Garcia, research director
with Los Angeles-based Employers Group.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that employee turnover was higher in Northern
California than in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one might expect, turnover for the past 12 months was
higher in Northern California because of the difficulty to recruit
and retain people in the information technology sector,'' Garcia
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-month period ending in September, Northern California
firms experienced a 16.9 percent turnover rate compared with a 13.9
percent rate in San Diego and 10.9 percent in the Los
Angeles-Orange County-Inland Empire region.
</P>
<P>
   This survey ``is semi-good news for California because it points
out we are a leader in high-tech,'' said Kyser, ``but also says we
are going to have to look closely at how we can keep up with the
demand for high-tech workers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is Anne Stephenson's ``New &AMP; Notable'' column forthe week
of Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``PHYSIOGNOMY: THE MARK SELIGER PHOTOGRAPHS'' &QL; 
(Bulfinch, $75) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have not lived until you've seen Brad Pitt in an evening
gown and goggles. Better yet, look at Drew Barrymore dancing nearly
naked with a sumo wrestler. Or Aerosmith's Steven Tyler with his
lips spread just as wide as they will go (that is to say shockingly
wide _ Tyler can look like a contortionist just by opening his
mouth). Or Keith Richards playing dominoes. Or Howard Stern wearing
a crown of thorns (think about it). On the cover _ the stunned
look, we assume, is from the makeup session _ is Jerry Seinfeld as
the Tin Man. Just inside is a perplexed-looking Tom Hanks
scratching his brow with ape hands. Trust us _ you will look at
this picture for a long, long time. In fact, if you pull this book
out in public, a crowd will gather _ it's that big a draw. Maybe
it's the celebrity factor. Maybe it's Seliger's unpredictable way
with his subjects, who seem willing to do the oddest things at his
request. As chief photographer for ``Rolling Stone,'' he has put
famous faces in the most surreal and unusual circumstances. The
photos go largely unexplained, and we found that to be irritating.
Also, the subjects remain unidentified until the very back of the
book, which makes for some confusion because it's really hard to
tell who some of them are. But those are quibbles. The book is
pricey but fun. With an introduction by Eric Bogosian. &QL; 
``SHE SAID YES'' &QL; 
By Misty Bernall (Plough, $17) &QL; 
It's at issue whether 17-year-old Cassie Bernall said anything at
all before she was shot to death in April at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo. Did Dylan Klebold ask her whether she believed
in God and did she say yes before he pulled the trigger? Her
parents choose to believe she did despite reports to the contrary,
and her mother has now written this book _ proof that grieving
people need to impart some meaning to the death of a child and that
the attention of strangers is oddly comforting. Beyond religious
fervor and parental sorrow, however, Misty Bernall tells another
important story. Three years ago, Cassie was a difficult
ninth-grader whose conversations with friends touched on drugs,
sex, self-mutilation and violence toward teachers and parents.
Misty discovered this when she read letters Cassie had written to a
friend, whereupon the stunned Bernalls did what Misty calls ``the
hardest thing you can ever do as parents: to put your foot down and
say, `This stops right here.' '' They immediately put Cassie into
another school, regularly searched her room, tapped the phone and
forbade her to see her old friends even though they knew it might
backfire and drive Cassie further away. When Cassie's friends
vandalized their house, they moved to another neighborhood to keep
her away from them. Cassie eventually got better, but it's
impossible to read about this troubled girl at war with her
desperate parents and not think of the boys who later murdered her.
What Cassie Bernall said that day is not as important as what two
other parents wrote to the Bernalls a month later: ``We will never
understand why this tragedy happened,'' Sue and Tom Klebold said,
``or what we might have done to prevent it. We apologize for the
role our son had in your Cassie's death. We never saw anger or
hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life when we watched
in helpless horror with the rest of the world. . . . May God bring
peace and understanding to all of our wounded hearts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WHAT IF?'' &QL; 
Edited by Robert Cowley (Putnam, $27.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if, in the summer of 1941, Adolph Hitler had made his major
attack not into Soviet Russia but into Syria and Lebanon _ would he
then have won a strategic position that could have brought him
eventual victory? Or what if, early in his invasion of the Persian
empire, the young King Alexander had been dealt a second blow with
an ax (the first had damaged Alexander's helmet and left him
disoriented and unable to defend himself) by a Persian noble named
Spithridates? What if Alexander's bodyguard had not speared
Spithridates before he could strike again and destroy Alexander's
chance of becoming ``great''? If you feel your blood pounding, the
goose bumps rising, your heart soaring with the thrill of it . . .
then you must be a historian. If you dozed off before the first
question mark, you are a civilian and should refrain from looking
at this book lest you asphyxiate on the futility of it all. This is
an expansion of the the 10th anniversary issue of ``MHQ: The
Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' in which the editor asked
historians to write about the most important ``might-have-beens''
of military history. They had so much fun that many came back for
more. Contributors include John Keegan (who explores the
aforementioned Hitler scenario), David McCullough, Stephen E.
Ambrose and James M. McPherson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LONG PROGRAM'' &QL; 
By Peggy Fleming (Pocket, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figure-skating champion Peggy Fleming is too nice to write a
book. She didn't get angry at her son when his girlfriend turned up
pregnant. She doesn't blame her mother for being a control freak.
She has been married to the same man for a million years. She went
into a depression during her recent treatment for breast cancer,
but that was caused by a drug _ she stopped taking it, and her
sadness disappeared. We ask you: Where's the dirt? Where's the
trouble? The answer is that there is none. Fleming is as nice as
she appears to be and then some (she calls Nancy Kerrigan ``a very
ungracious loser'' for her behavior after Oksana Baiul beat her in
the 1994 Olympics _ for Fleming, that's like hurling obscenities).
This memoir, which covers her career and personal life, is not
exactly scintillating reading, but Fleming is so likable that we
decline to say more. &QL;

REVELATIONS FROM A DELTA JOURNEY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Tony Scherman is the author, most recently, of ``Backbeat: Earl
Palmer's Story.''  
 By TONY SCHERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1941 and 1942, the folklorist Alan Lomax visited the
Mississippi Delta to document its African-American folk music. One
of his major objectives was to record the Delta's most famous
cultural product, the blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi the Blues Lineage'' (Rounder 11661-1825), whose
contents Lomax selected before a stroke incapacitated him several
years ago, represents his early-'40s Delta blues fieldwork. It's
part of the ambitious ``Alan Lomax Collection,'' whose eventual 140
or more CDs will embrace Lomax's 50-plus-years of worldwide song
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   Lomax didn't record the greatest of the Delta blues singers; by
1941, Robert Johnson was three years dead. But Eddie (Son) House,
who gives four performances here, was Johnson's teacher, and
McKinley Morganfield, who gives two, was Johnson's disciple, later
to become world famous as Muddy Waters.
</P>
<P>
   The album includes several other good bluesmen _ David
(Honeyboy) Edwards, still performing today at 84, and the otherwise
unrecorded William Brown of Memphis _ but to hear these journeymen
and then House and Waters is to grasp the difference between
competence and mastery.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after these sessions, Muddy Waters left for Chicago,
where he pioneered the electric blues band and died in 1983, full
of years and renown. On his too-brief appearance here (an album's
worth of Waters' Lomax songs, ``The Complete Plantation
Recordings,'' is available on MCA), he plays bottleneck guitar with
a nimbleness and speed he rarely displayed later on.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, he is recognizably himself, though without the gravitas
of later years. The up-tempo ``I Be Bound to Write You'' is a
version of Waters' early signature tune, ``I Be's Troubled'' (in
Chicago it became ``I Can't Be Satisfied''). ``You Gonna Miss Me
When I'm Gone,'' a slow shuffle, sounds like Robert Johnson's
``Come on in My Kitchen,'' but without Johnson's edge of panic.
Even in his mid-20s, Muddy Waters has a reassuring solidity.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation to most listeners will be Son House, whom blues
fans know either as a stiff-fingered old man past his prime (he was
rediscovered in 1965) or from a half-dozen abysmally recorded 78s
made in 1930. When Lomax found House, the singer was 39 and at the
top of his form.
</P>
<P>
   While the voices of most Delta bluesmen have a liquid pliancy
(except Charley Patton's, which sounds like a buzz saw), House's
rings like burnished iron. Although the dominant emotion in his
songs is anguish, it sounds somehow involuntary, wrenched from
inside. House's three solo performances are worth the price of the
CD (and there's more to come: eventually, an entire CD of House's
1941-42 recordings).
</P>
<P>
   But the track that makes this album indispensible is the last
one, ``Walking Blues,'' featuring House singing and whaling away on
rhythm guitar; Willie Brown on lead guitar (not the William Brown
mentioned above but the legendary musician invoked by Robert
Johnson _ ``tell my friendboy Willie Brown'' _ in Johnson's
``Crossroads Blues''); Fiddlin' Joe Martin playing lickety-split
mandolin runs and yelling encouragement, and Leroy Williams on
harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all my times with the blues, this was the best one,'' Lomax
wrote later, ``better than Leadbelly, better than Josh White, Sonny
Terry, and all the rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking Blues'' swaggers infectiously, an unamplified portent
of the electric blues that would rock postwar America. But postwar
America was light years away from the feudal cotton kingdom into
which Alan Lomax of Washington came barreling, armed with a
recording machine, immense curiosity and the instinct that led him
unerringly _ as it had before and would again _ to several of the
most splendid American performers of the century.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a Marine Corps pilot in the 1970s, Michael Quiello
learned to appreciate the teamwork necessary to take off from or
land a plane safely on a rolling, pitching aircraft carrier. In his
subsequent 19 years as a pilot for Delta Air Lines, Quiello, who is
now Delta's system manager for international operations, has been
equally impressed by the teamwork necessary to make an airport hum.
And in his opinion, no large airport functions as smoothly as
Hartsfield Atlanta International.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best airport in the world,'' said Quiello, who has
flown in and out of such highly regarded airports as Charles de
Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Changi in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   With 73.5 million passengers last year, Hartsfield is now,
incontestably, the world's busiest airport, pushing the perennial
front-runner, Chicago O'Hare, to second place. But is Quiello being
objective when he says it's the best? After all, his employer,
Delta, has its main hub here and, together with its regional
subsidiary, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, accounts for almost 80
percent of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   His praise for this onetime raceway, though, is echoed by other
pilots. ``There are taxiways all over the place, it's easy for
passengers to get around in, and they planned it very well,'' said
Larry Coy, a longtime pilot for Continental Airlines, which has its
main hubs at Houston and Newark, N.J. ``It's just a great
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from perfect, for with its phenomenal growth have come
flight delays, parking shortages and clogged traffic. But while
some cities, like New York, have been glacially slow in providing
airport rail links, Atlanta has a quick rail route from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield, then, may offer a shining example of how an airport
can become a giant and help transform a city into a global
crossroads. Yet it also provides a cautionary tale about the
downside of the boom in air travel. And as more and more people
take to the skies, Atlanta and other cities have little choice but
to make do with existing airports, for the cost of building new
ones is increasingly prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's a good airport,'' said Henrietta Aswad, owner of
the Global Journeys travel agency in Atlanta. ``But there are never
enough parking spaces. They don't have enough spots where you can
pick up or drop off passengers. And getting into the airport from
the main highway is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield's general manager, Benjamin DeCosta, said: ``We're
No. 1 in passengers, and we intend to stay No. 1. But we're also
the most delayed airport in the U.S., with an average of eight-plus
minutes a flight. We're committed to changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy, even for DeCosta, a determined Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born lawyer who was general manager of Newark International
Airport and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey until he was recruited
last year by Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the delays is that when Hartsfield's last
master plan was drawn up, in the 1970s, it envisioned a maximum of
65 million passengers a year, said John Boatright, a vice president
at Delta (which has been a continuous Hartsfield tenant since
1934). The current master plan, not yet formally adopted, forecasts
121 million passengers a year by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something is done well before then, aviation specialists
say, delays could average a half-hour or more and at peak times
departing planes could be backed up as far as the eye can see. The
airport's growth, after all, remains rapid. So far this year,
Hartsfield has handled almost 3.4 million more passengers than
O'Hare. For the first time ever, it also leads all U.S. airports in
takeoffs and landings, its 295,000 so far this year more than
10,000 higher than O'Hare and more than 27,500 ahead of Dallas/Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic will get worse, too, because in spite of predictions
that Atlanta would slide backward after its 1996 Olympics high, the
city has become more of a destination, less of a stopover.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, 70 percent of Hartsfield passengers connected to
other flights, DeCosta said. That is down to about 55 percent,
thanks in part to the city's growth as a business center. In
addition, though international passengers, especially from Europe
and Latin America, account for fewer than 6 percent of the
Hartsfield total, they have been growing about 20 percent a year
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield has been able to accommodate as many passengers as it
does in part because of what Joe Leonard, chief executive of the
airline AirTran Holdings Inc. (which also has its hub here), said
are its skilled air traffic controllers, control tower operators
and ``an airport whose superb design has stood the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That design consists of a terminal building and six concourses
flanked by four east-west runways _ the direction of the prevailing
winds in the region. Taxiways are wide enough for two jumbo jets to
pass on their way to or from any of the 143 domestic or 24
international gates. And the airspace over Atlanta is not as
congested as it is over New York and other urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with only four runways here, compared with seven at
O'Hare and Dallas,'' said assistant general manager James Stogner,
``Hartsfield can get people and planes in and out more efficiently
than any airport in the world. We were a hub before that word was
ever used for an airport. Delta pioneered bringing a tremendous
number of people into a central station and sending them out
again.''
</P>
<P>
   What is now the airport was an abandoned auto racetrack until
the city of Atlanta bought the site in the 1920s and turned it into
Hartsfield International. Hartsfield owes its current stature to a
blessing in disguise _ the economic downturn in the 1970s, which
cut air travel and thus the need to expand quickly to accommodate
more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us some breathing room,'' said Stogner, who has
served under eight of the airport's nine general managers. ``So we
went back and refined our research, this time with substantial
input from the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that input came from Eastern Airlines as well as Delta.
Eastern, which shut down in the 1990s, had the first continuous
passenger service from Atlanta to New York, in 1930, and the first
international flight out of Atlanta, to Montreal in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   From atop a hill at the southern edge of the airport, it is
possible to see what Quiello described as the airport's daily
``coming together like a symphony orchestra.'' As waves of planes
land and take off on adjoining runways below, Thomas Nissalke, the
airport's aviation simulation manager, said: ``In good weather, we
can simultaneously depart 94 planes an hour and can land 90 an
hour. No other airport can handle as many airplanes in an hour on a
four-runway system.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for those 121 million passengers expected by 2015,
some city officials would like to build a second airport _ a
project that would face many hurdles. Meantime, Hartsfield is going
to build another runway _ but the one on the drawing boards is
already outmoded for today's jets. That is because it was planned
as a runway for commuter planes, and when environmental and legal
clearances for the project were approved, in 1994, most commuter
aircraft were prop planes, not jets.
</P>
<P>
   Though DeCosta and others hope to extend the runway, some
property owners who would be displaced in nearby College Park are
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, Hartsfield's strengths are its relative
convenience and, despite the long distances involved, the relative
ease of getting from here to there. But arriving by car can be
numbing _ cars clog the approach roads at peak times, and even the
31,000 parking spaces can sometimes all seem to be occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hartsfield moves masses of people more efficiently than
most. It is one of the few U.S. airports with a mass-transit rail
station inside the terminal, transporting about 8,000 people to the
airport each day and connecting the airport and downtown in about
20 minutes for $1.50. Nine trains make a 3.5-mile loop underground,
stopping at 13 stations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield maintains a squad of volunteer hosts in red shirts or
blouses who help passengers throughout the airport and a bicycle
patrol trained to answer questions. DeCosta is a stickler for
passenger satisfaction and a clean, orderly airport. He personally
inspects men's rooms and picks up litter, and each month he
alternates with his deputies in the terminal's atrium fielding
passengers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With an annual payroll of $1.9 billion, the airport, which is
owned and operated by the city of Atlanta, brings in nearly $15
billion a year to the local and regional economy. About 43,000
people are employed by the airport, its suppliers and
concessionaires. ``The support the city gives is excellent,'' said
Leonard of AirTran. ``They and the officials at the airport do a
nice job of investing in facilities and keeping them up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the relationship is not always smooth. In April 1998,
Campbell dismissed Angela Gittens, the independent-minded general
manager, and replaced her with DeCosta. Also independent-minded, if
more circumspect than his predecessor, DeCosta says he has more
authority here than he had in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples he cited were a recent meeting with Sen. Max
Cleland, D-Ga., to brief him on expansion plans _ plans that are
forecast to cost $5.4 billion in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many others in Atlanta's Department of Aviation, DeCosta
contends that a second airport is unnecessary. He favors a master
plan proposal that Hartsfield buy the property to expand the
projected fifth runway, add and expand terminals and add many more
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   He also suspects that a change in technology, specifically
planes capable of vertical landings and takeoffs, will help make a
second airport unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there is the matter of cost. ``A new airport is very
expensive,'' he added, ``so you would have to identify who would
pay off the bonds. That would have to be an airline with deep
pockets, and so far I don't know of any volunteers.''

<P>
   The president and vice president of the United States are being
accused of having ``lost'' Russia _ the assumption being that
Russia was there to be ``lost'' by the West in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia is being portrayed in the media as perhaps the
most corrupt place in the world. The implicit message is: ``Don't
touch Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago I asked former Secretary of State George Shultz what
he thought had gone wrong in the U.S.-Russian relationship. ``We
should have found a way to show that we respect your country,'' he
replied, ``that we are ready to treat it as a real partner despite
its problems.'' Next to all the current confusion, that sounds good
to me.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the ``point man'' on
Russia in the Clinton White House, despite his expertise, has been
rather defensive and not very helpful: ``We have been aware from
the beginning that crime and corruption are a huge problem in
Russia and a huge obstacle to reform. Russian reform is not over,
but it's going to take decades and the problem will only get worse
if you isolate Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, for his part, has insisted
that all the negative headlines regarding Moscow going down the
drain are rooted in U.S. electoral politics and aim at
``besmirching Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But these reactions badly miss the point. There never was a
debate in the West about how to ``engage'' Moscow, and it truly
doesn't sound as if one is about to start now.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the so-called money-laundering, IMF-loan scandal.
It certainly shows no sign of abating. This is purported to involve
money from Russia, perhaps IMF loans, high-ranking Russian
officials and the Bank of New York. The story so far is complex and
convoluted and has fact, fantasy and flawed reasoning mixed in
unknown proportion.
</P>
<P>
   As to facts, it seems clear that large amounts of money, of
murky and possibly criminal origin, went through accounts in the
Bank of New York without triggering any reporting or regulatory
alarms or procedures. How this could happen in banking _ which is
arguably the most regulated area in the U.S. economy _ is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect that this would be the first question for the
media and congressional watchdogs to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly charged political atmosphere, the debate has taken a
different turn. ``Hands off Russia!'' ``Russia was never any
good!'' ``No wonder Russia lost the Cold War!'' _ this gloating is
a mere diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue that troubles me,'' says Condoleezza Rice, a top
adviser to likely Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush,
``is: Were we accepting the rhetoric of reform rather than real
reform in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the right questions to ask. Rice is also right to
use the word ``we,'' because the same mistake was made by President
Bush and President Clinton, by Republicans and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
   Once the fundamental assumption was made that Russia was a
nation defeated in the Cold War, once the rhetoric of U.S. ``aid''
for Russia replaced the idea of cooperation, subsequent
developments flowed almost automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Troops of American university presidents with little or no
knowledge of the realities of Russia's economy arrived in Moscow to
``advise on economic reform,'' with no regard for the cultural
obstacles they were facing or the need to create a legal framework
for economic change. Sending fly-by-night academics to ``give
advice'' and then looking the other way as ``the new Russia''
degenerated into an orgy of oligarchy and corruption was not the
best way to show respect and willingness for partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, in a recent article in The Washington Post, U.S.
national security adviser Samuel Berger asserts that that was the
only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Well then, one has to live with the consequences. Mafia-style
economics and a merging of organized crime and bureaucracy become a
very real result when know-nothing advisers put fancy plans into
action that destroy a government's economic control _ and nothing
is put in place instead.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not President Yeltsin and members of his family were
involved in any improprieties is almost irrelevant. What matters is
that Yeltsin is presiding over a system that has made a mockery of
democracy, market economics and the rule of law _ achieving those
goals was among Russia's priorities since the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, still, the possibilities for cooperative U.S.-Russian
programs are virtually limitless. They exist today, as they have
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   As two former senators, Gary Hart and Gordon Humphrey, wrote
recently in a letter to The New York Times, ``Why not a U.S.-led
program to create a sound banking system, a mortgage-lending
program, long-term oil purchase contracts to provide revenues for
infrastructure rebuilding and jobs, and a program to establish a
desperately needed pharmaceutical industry?''
</P>
<P>
   It will probably take elections in both countries to cool down
the rhetoric and assess what has been happening and where to go
from here.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it would not be a bad idea to quit lamenting
the death of Russia and instead take a long, hard look at the
global economy and what has happened to the barriers that once were
in place to prevent the free flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someone might even stand up (when all the noise pipes
down about ``dreadful Russia'') and ask this: Has it not become too
easy for the barons of dirty money to make and hide their mountains
of gold?

 &HT;    Coca-Cola: 'Always' ready for a change
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Always'' may not be forever at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a 7-year-run, the company's ``Always Coca-Cola''
campaign may give way to a new ``Enjoy Coca-Cola Classic'' theme
that could debut around Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of initiatives in the works for brand
Coca-Cola that you will see early next year in the marketplace, but
we're not going to comment on speculation,'' company spokesman Bob
Bertini said Tuesday. He was referring to trade publication reports
about the expected change.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all elements of our marketing mix, we're constantly
looking to enhance and strengthen our connection with consumers,''
Bertini said.
</P>
<P>
   While Coke Classic is still, by far, the most popular soft drink
in America, its 20.6 percent market share remained the same last
year by growing at the industry's overall rate of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, some non-cola brands have surged in popularity.
Case sales for Sprite, for example, which Coca-Cola Co. sells,
jumped 9 percent last year, and Pepsi's Mountain Dew rocketed 9.9
percent, according to Beverage Digest. That trend has continued so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, industry experts have been predicting for months
that the Atlanta-based beverage giant would rejuvenate its flagship
Classic brand with new and more heavily financed advertising and
marketing campaigns. During the first six months of this year, the
company spent about $58 million on U.S. media ads for Coke Classic,
according to Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, we're going to see a major push behind Coke
Classic,'' said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage
Digest. ``Coca-Cola is the name on the door and the biggest brand,
and its strong growth is critical to the company.``
</P>
<P>
   Sicher said Coke bottlers have told him they've been instructed
to replace the ``Always'' red disk design with new ``Enjoy''
graphics on various Classic promotional and display items. The
graphics are expected to show the neck of the contour bottle with
the cap popped off and soda fizzing out, Beverage Digest reported.
The words ``Coca-Cola'' are in very large letters, while
``classic'' is in lower-case small type.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the publication said, there will be a new tagline
for point-of-sale promotional materials: ``Enjoy All That's
Inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts speculated Tuesday that the company might
still find a way to use the word ``Always'' in a less prominent
position in its marketing because of the equity that has been built
up in the word.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, expect the company to make a clean break with
the past.
</P>
<P>
   The company currently is using a number of advertising agencies
for Classic, including Edge Creative and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy. It
developed the ``Always'' campaign with Creative Artists Agency.

HEADING A Y2K TEAM, AS TIME RUNS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Del.)  (mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Cinda Hallman suspects that she helped to
create the Year 2000 computer problem. As a young systems analyst
fresh out of Southern Arkansas University, she joined Conoco Inc.
in 1966 and wrote software for processing gasoline taxes that did
not look ahead to the need to handle dates starting in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallman, now a senior vice president at DuPont Co., the
chemical giant that owned Conoco from 1981 until spinning it off
last August, assumes that the tax program is still in use and
probably had to be repaired recently to avoid malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   If so, she has more than made up for that small contribution to
the global computer mess that has come to be known as Y2K. As chief
information officer of DuPont in 1995, she sounded the Y2K alarm in
the top reaches of management. She then created an organization
that mapped DuPont's vulnerability to the problem and developed
performance benchmarks to hold managers' feet to the fire when
their groups lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured it was going to cost $350 million to $400 million,
and that's how it is turning out,'' Ms. Hallman said at DuPont's
headquarters here. ``People have been surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   DuPont's war on computer malfunction is just a variation of the
management challenge that faces all global companies. The land
mines lie not just in DuPont's own systems and electronic machinery
but also in possible disruptions among the 4,800 companies most
critical to its supply chain, in the operations of its 2,700 major
customers and in outside services it depends on, like
telecommunications, air-traffic control and customs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the individual fixes tend to be simple, the sheer
number of variables and the complexity of all the links have led
some experts to call Year 2000 the greatest management challenge
since World War II. DuPont's repair budget is bigger than most but
hardly exceptional; AT&AMP;T expects to spend more than $700 million
and Citigroup, $950 million.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 is an opportunity to update some systems, of course,
but the main driver is fear: There will be hell to pay if computers
choking on Year 2000 dates lead to business disasters. ``Unlike
other information-technology projects, this one is much more
visible to the public and to boards of directors _ and being late
isn't an option,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information
Technology Association of America, a trade association for the
computer industry. ``Managers' heads are on the chopping block in a
much more visible way than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   At DuPont, some managers have already been found wanting. The
company took at least four people off special Year 2000
contingency-planning assignments after they proved too slow in
meeting their targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half of '98 was a high-anxiety period of
organizing,'' said Paul Couvillion, a former nylon plant manager
who was appointed by Ms. Hallman to oversee Year 2000 work.
Couvillion had to make sure that goals and timetables were set for
hundreds of Year 2000 operations, from repairs of individual
computer programs to overall readiness of major divisions. He also
established a system of green, yellow and red ratings for progress
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was scale: H. Dale Martin, who had surveyed
150 separate DuPont manufacturing plants in helping to set up a
global environmental program in the early 1990s, discovered that he
had to investigate nearly 2,100 DuPont addresses in laying the
groundwork for monitoring Year 2000 readiness by site. And hundreds
of those addresses turned out to be either duplicate designations
for the same place or abandoned locations that had not been excised
from company records.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was that Year 2000 concerns were initially given
short shrift in some divisions. When senior managers were too busy
to have ``gotten it on their radar,'' Ms. Hallman said, she put it
there for them. Last year, for example, she saw that one of
DuPont's major businesses _ she declines to say which one _ had
fallen behind its schedule for repairing the software that
processes orders and manages product shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Time was running out, and Ms. Hallman invited herself to the
office of the corporate vice president in charge of the business to
tell him so. Pointing out the red marks that he had been ignoring
in the reports, she told him bluntly ``to put someone of a Gen.
Patton nature on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and the unit caught up, she said. ``Now, every time he
sees me, he wants to tell me how well they are doing,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallman, a tall Arkansas native who began making
money-management decisions for her family as a 15-year-old after
her father died, came to the Year 2000 project with plenty of
credibility within DuPont. She achieved wide recognition in
information-technology management circles for sharply cutting
DuPont's expenses while modernizing its systems. She also won
praise in trade publications for negotiating a novel three-way,
10-year alliance with Andersen Consulting and Computer Sciences
Corp. in 1996 that shifted 3,200 DuPont employees to the two
vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hallman was promoted to global vice president in 1997 and,

<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a Marine Corps pilot in the 1970s, Michael Quiello
learned to appreciate the teamwork necessary to take off from or
land a plane safely on a rolling, pitching aircraft carrier. In his
subsequent 19 years as a pilot for Delta Air Lines, Quiello, who is
now Delta's system manager for international operations, has been
equally impressed by the teamwork necessary to make an airport hum.
And in his opinion, no large airport functions as smoothly as
Hartsfield Atlanta International.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best airport in the world,'' said Quiello, who has
flown in and out of such highly regarded airports as Charles de
Gaulle in Paris, Schiphol in Amsterdam and Changi in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   With 73.5 million passengers last year, Hartsfield is now,
incontestably, the world's busiest airport, pushing the perennial
front-runner, Chicago O'Hare, to second place. But is Quiello being
objective when he says it's the best? After all, his employer,
Delta, has its main hub here and, together with its regional
subsidiary, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, accounts for almost 80
percent of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   His praise for this onetime raceway, though, is echoed by other
pilots. ``There are taxiways all over the place, it's easy for
passengers to get around in, and they planned it very well,'' said
Larry Coy, a longtime pilot for Continental Airlines, which has its
main hubs at Houston and Newark, N.J. ``It's just a great
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from perfect, for with its phenomenal growth have come
flight delays, parking shortages and clogged traffic. But while
some cities, like New York, have been glacially slow in providing
airport rail links, Atlanta has a quick rail route from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield, then, may offer a shining example of how an airport
can become a giant and help transform a city into a global
crossroads. Yet it also provides a cautionary tale about the
downside of the boom in air travel. And as more and more people
take to the skies, Atlanta and other cities have little choice but
to make do with existing airports, for the cost of building new
ones is increasingly prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's a good airport,'' said Henrietta Aswad, owner of
the Global Journeys travel agency in Atlanta. ``But there are never
enough parking spaces. They don't have enough spots where you can
pick up or drop off passengers. And getting into the airport from
the main highway is a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield's general manager, Benjamin DeCosta, said: ``We're
No. 1 in passengers, and we intend to stay No. 1. But we're also
the most delayed airport in the U.S., with an average of eight-plus
minutes a flight. We're committed to changing that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy, even for DeCosta, a determined Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born lawyer who was general manager of Newark International
Airport and Teterboro Airport in New Jersey until he was recruited
last year by Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the delays is that when Hartsfield's last
master plan was drawn up, in the 1970s, it envisioned a maximum of
65 million passengers a year, said John Boatright, a vice president
at Delta (which has been a continuous Hartsfield tenant since
1934). The current master plan, not yet formally adopted, forecasts
121 million passengers a year by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something is done well before then, aviation specialists
say, delays could average a half-hour or more and at peak times
departing planes could be backed up as far as the eye can see. The
airport's growth, after all, remains rapid. So far this year,
Hartsfield has handled almost 3.4 million more passengers than
O'Hare. For the first time ever, it also leads all U.S. airports in
takeoffs and landings, its 295,000 so far this year more than
10,000 higher than O'Hare and more than 27,500 ahead of Dallas/Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic will get worse, too, because in spite of predictions
that Atlanta would slide backward after its 1996 Olympics high, the
city has become more of a destination, less of a stopover.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, 70 percent of Hartsfield passengers connected to
other flights, DeCosta said. That is down to about 55 percent,
thanks in part to the city's growth as a business center. In
addition, though international passengers, especially from Europe
and Latin America, account for fewer than 6 percent of the
Hartsfield total, they have been growing about 20 percent a year
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield has been able to accommodate as many passengers as it
does in part because of what Joe Leonard, chief executive of the
airline AirTran Holdings Inc. (which also has its hub here), said
are its skilled air traffic controllers, control tower operators
and ``an airport whose superb design has stood the test of time.''

CARROLL FACES TOUGH WEEK OF PREPARATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Patriots' loss to the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday
not only was their first defeat of the season, but it led to some
private second-guessing of coaching decisions by a few players.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Pete Carroll and his staff are facing their toughest week
of preparation thus far as they deal with their first dollop of
negative feedback while trying to get their team back on the right
track quickly for this week's game against Miami that for the first
time this season has suffered adversity.
</P>
<P>
   An injury to wide receiver Troy Brown's ankle, more severe than
originally thought, has became an issue. Some of the Patriots
wondered why Brown was called upon to serve as a kick returner,
even though Kevin Faulk had returned to the active roster after a
two-week hiatus with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown went down on the opening kickoff, it left the
Patriots with three healthy wide receivers. The team had decided to
activate cornerback Tebucky Jones over Vincent Brisby, fearing that
the play of an ailing Steve Israel would be limited. As it turned
out, Israel played the whole game and Jones didn't see any action.
</P>
<P>
   The three healthy receivers were then called upon to run several
deep routes, fatiguing them and leaving them wondering why there
weren't more underneath calls made. Plus, quarterback Drew Bledsoe
was getting hammered while he had to wait for the long routes to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has a high left ankle sprain, similar to his injury of
last season, which usually means at least four weeks of recovery.
Last year's injury kept Brown out for six weeks, though this one
doesn't appear quite as severe.
</P>
<P>
   It appears linebacker Tedy Bruschi (sprained left knee) will
also be out Sunday, which would move Marty Moore into his spot for
the first time in three years. The Patriots don't want to shift
Andy Katzenmoyer if they don't have to. The Patriots' lack of depth
at the linebacker spot is highlighted along with their lack of
faith in Vernon Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is anxious to beat the Patriots; Carroll has defeated
Jimmy Johnson four of the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who fear they'll face the same noise level in New
England as the Patriots encountered in Kansas City, are also the
popular choice to win the Eastern Division. Meanwhile, their
biggest issue thus far has been Johnson a's criticism of
quarterback Dan Marino two weeks ago. Marino answered it by having
a great game and defeating the Indianapolis Colts last Sunday in
the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots need to pressure Marino, but they'll have to figure
out a better rotation on their defensive line. Last week, Ferric
Collons began to be a real force, which means he probably needs to
be on the field a little more. And if the Patriots want to get more
out of Chad Eaton and Henry Thomas, they probably should begin
thinking about activating Bob Kuberski, who has yet to play after
being signed as a backup in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive line, there also appears to be a growing
sentiment that Max Lane needs to be kept at one position. Heath
Irwin also had a lot of problems with the noise and counts in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game, the Patriots play the Broncos and Cardinals
before their bye week Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll appears confident as the team heads into its ``all-out
street fight'' this Sunday, as one player put it.

 ATLANTA: of time.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That design consists of a terminal building and six concourses
flanked by four east-west runways _ the direction of the prevailing
winds in the region. Taxiways are wide enough for two jumbo jets to
pass on their way to or from any of the 143 domestic or 24
international gates. And the airspace over Atlanta is not as
congested as it is over New York and other urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with only four runways here, compared with seven at
O'Hare and Dallas,'' said assistant general manager James Stogner,
``Hartsfield can get people and planes in and out more efficiently
than any airport in the world. We were a hub before that word was
ever used for an airport. Delta pioneered bringing a tremendous
number of people into a central station and sending them out
again.''
</P>
<P>
   What is now the airport was an abandoned auto racetrack until
the city of Atlanta bought the site in the 1920s and turned it into
Hartsfield International. Hartsfield owes its current stature to a
blessing in disguise _ the economic downturn in the 1970s, which
cut air travel and thus the need to expand quickly to accommodate
more passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gave us some breathing room,'' said Stogner, who has
served under eight of the airport's nine general managers. ``So we
went back and refined our research, this time with substantial
input from the airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that input came from Eastern Airlines as well as Delta.
Eastern, which shut down in the 1990s, had the first continuous
passenger service from Atlanta to New York, in 1930, and the first
international flight out of Atlanta, to Montreal in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   From atop a hill at the southern edge of the airport, it is
possible to see what Quiello described as the airport's daily
``coming together like a symphony orchestra.'' As waves of planes
land and take off on adjoining runways below, Thomas Nissalke, the
airport's aviation simulation manager, said: ``In good weather, we
can simultaneously depart 94 planes an hour and can land 90 an
hour. No other airport can handle as many airplanes in an hour on a
four-runway system.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for those 121 million passengers expected by 2015,
some city officials would like to build a second airport _ a
project that would face many hurdles. Meantime, Hartsfield is going
to build another runway _ but the one on the drawing boards is
already outmoded for today's jets. That is because it was planned
as a runway for commuter planes, and when environmental and legal
clearances for the project were approved, in 1994, most commuter
aircraft were prop planes, not jets.
</P>
<P>
   Though DeCosta and others hope to extend the runway, some
property owners who would be displaced in nearby College Park are
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   For passengers, Hartsfield's strengths are its relative
convenience and, despite the long distances involved, the relative
ease of getting from here to there. But arriving by car can be
numbing _ cars clog the approach roads at peak times, and even the
31,000 parking spaces can sometimes all seem to be occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hartsfield moves masses of people more efficiently than
most. It is one of the few U.S. airports with a mass-transit rail
station inside the terminal, transporting about 8,000 people to the
airport each day and connecting the airport and downtown in about
20 minutes for $1.50. Nine trains make a 3.5-mile loop underground,
stopping at 13 stations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield maintains a squad of volunteer hosts in red shirts or
blouses who help passengers throughout the airport and a bicycle
patrol trained to answer questions. DeCosta is a stickler for
passenger satisfaction and a clean, orderly airport. He personally
inspects men's rooms and picks up litter, and each month he
alternates with his deputies in the terminal's atrium fielding
passengers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With an annual payroll of $1.9 billion, the airport, which is
owned and operated by the city of Atlanta, brings in nearly $15
billion a year to the local and regional economy. About 43,000
people are employed by the airport, its suppliers and
concessionaires. ``The support the city gives is excellent,'' said
Leonard of AirTran. ``They and the officials at the airport do a
nice job of investing in facilities and keeping them up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the relationship is not always smooth. In April 1998,
Campbell dismissed Angela Gittens, the independent-minded general
manager, and replaced her with DeCosta. Also independent-minded, if
more circumspect than his predecessor, DeCosta says he has more
authority here than he had in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Among the examples he cited were a recent meeting with Sen. Max
Cleland, D-Ga., to brief him on expansion plans _ plans that are
forecast to cost $5.4 billion in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many others in Atlanta's Department of Aviation, DeCosta
contends that a second airport is unnecessary. He favors a master
plan proposal that Hartsfield buy the property to expand the
projected fifth runway, add and expand terminals and add many more
parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   He also suspects that a change in technology, specifically
planes capable of vertical landings and takeoffs, will help make a
second airport unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, there is the matter of cost. ``A new airport is very
expensive,'' he added, ``so you would have to identify who would
pay off the bonds. That would have to be an airline with deep
pockets, and so far I don't know of any volunteers.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The constant, scolding ache in my right shoulder, I
am somewhat relieved to report, is not a new symptom of age, nor is
it anything that will require surgery. It's my shoulder bag.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it's the sleek, sexy laptop computer I carry in
that bag, a laptop I chose because it weighs so little _ only 2.9
pounds. That doesn't count the spare battery, which weighs nearly a
pound but gives me four extra hours of mobile work time. It doesn't
count the A/C charger that I take along when I travel, just in case
I use up those four extra hours. Or the notes (file folders, steno
pads, documents) that are the raw material for what eventually goes
on the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   I weighed it all the other day. My lightweight laptop, with its
case and its baggage, means I'm lugging an extra 13 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hardly the only one carrying the weight of the work on her
shoulder. Any morning, on any train platform, dozens of bags make
mine look underfed. Waiting for the 7:29 to Grand Central the other
day, Lisa Chung sagged under a bulging leather case that held two
laptops _ not just her Thinkpad but also her Portege _ plus her
office pumps plus a doorstop-size book she was reading for an
after-hours leadership seminar. She guessed the combined weight to
be ``about 10 pounds?'' On the moon, maybe. My relative sense of
weight is based on the 20-pound barbells at the gym (I don't use
them, but I put them back onto the rack occasionally), and this was
much heavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my exercise for the day,'' she said with a shrug. ``That,
and running for the train.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is not how much are we carrying, but why are we
carrying it. The simplest answer is that we have more work to do.
So much more that we can't do it during the confines of a
traditional workday, so we have to do it at home and on the way
home. On the way back to work again. The corollary to this is that
we've shaped our world so that we can work anywhere _ which also
means we have no excuse not to work everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But then why are so many people with overstuffed briefcases not
actually working? Look at them. They're reading the newspaper or
napping or chatting on cell phones. For a two-hour flight to
Indianapolis last week, I packed the laptop and a 500-page
deposition I was reading as research for an article, but I never
got around to glancing at the document or starting up the machine.
I did, however, manage to plow through the stack of thick, glossy
magazines I bought before I boarded.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists have theories about us. Work, says Dr. Alan
Manevitz, who drags his own briefcase to New York-Presbyterian
Hospital every day, has become our ``transitional object,''
something we cart around because it makes us feel secure. Like my
8-year-old son, who would happily cart his Pokemon collection back
and forth to school, even though his teacher forbids him to take it
out of his backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Back on my train platform, a few feet from where Lisa Chung was
bench-pressing her laptops, Hartley Konnett was Exhibit A of this
hypothesis, having a cigarette before his trip to the trading
floor. At his feet was his briefcase, which he says ``goes under my
desk, where it sits all day, until I carry it back home, where it
sits all night.'' He's tried to leave the thing at work, he says,
but ``you come into the office without it and you feel naked;
people actually comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Yamins, who never leaves his office at Maimonides
Medical Center without packing prescription pads, journal articles
and his computer, and who spends his daily commute listening to
tapes of psychiatry residents and their patients, says this need to
work isn't necessarily a bad thing. ``We're getting an awful lot
done,'' he says. ``What's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so sure. I recall my grandmother and the five-hour
flight we took together when I was 13. An avid reader, who was
still taking courses in subjects like Chinese history in her 80s,
she didn't open a book or even plan her itinerary. Instead, we
talked. On train rides, she looked out the window. My grandmother
knew how to sit and watch. Now my generation has improved the world
so much we don't remember how. As an experiment, I rode the train
empty-handed this week, save for my wallet. I lasted 12 minutes.
Then I gave in and began to scribble a to-do list on the flap of my
checkbook.

STOCKS IN BROAD RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices staged a broad, sharp retreat Tuesday,
pulled down by rising interest rates, political instability in
Pakistan and the prospect that third-quarter corporate earnings may
not live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates rose in reaction to a surge in crude oil prices.
Late in the day, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond stood at
6.22 percent, its highest level in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about rising rates was exacerbated by an announcement
from Raytheon Co. that sales and earnings would not be up to
expectations for the balance of this year and in 2000. Word of a
possible military coup in Pakistan, a development that could
heighten tension with India, became an additional source of
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still stuck squarely in a trading range, but it looks
like the market may be adjusting to the downside again,'' said
Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``It will be tough to get positive momentum back until many
of the issues that are confronting the market are resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 231.12
points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,417.06, its biggest decline in more
than four months. Of the thirty stocks that make up the blue chip
index, only two, Chevron and International Paper, managed to rise
in price. Hewlett-Packard, American Express and IBM all fell by
more than three points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index lost 22.17, or 1.7
percent, to 1,313.04.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, the biggest loser among S&AMP;P 500 stocks, did not trade
for much of the day. The stock suffered its worst one-day decline
in nearly two decades once it finally did open for trading, and
closed at 24 1/4, down 18 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index, which set a record on Monday, fell
43.52, or 1.5 percent, to 2,872.43. And the Russell 2000 index of
small company stocks dropped 5.51 or 1.3 percent, to 424.68.

   At 772 million shares, trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was fairly light. But losing stocks outnumbered those that
rose in price by a margin of five to two.
</P>
<P>
   On the NASDAQ stock market, 992 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Additional questions about the market's near-term direction
surfaced after the close Tuesday, when technology bellwether Intel
released an earnings report that fell a bit short of expectations.
During regular trading, Intel was one of a small number of stocks
that moved higher on the day, closing at 76 11/ 16 , up 3/16. But
the stock was down as much as 5 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology has been solid, but with this announcement from
Intel we will have to see if that sector stays okay,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of brokerage houses, including PaineWebber Group and
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, posted results that were better than
expected. Weyerhaeuser, the nation's third-largest forestry
company, said its third-quarter net more than doubled from the same
period a year ago. And after the market closed, Motorola, another
big technology firm, reported earnings that were squarely in line
with forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   In what was generally a bad day for financial service company
stocks, Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette rose 2 3/16, to 42 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhaeuser led a strong performance by paper and forest
products company stocks, gaining 1 1/16, to 60 1/2. But Motorola
fell 1 11/16, to 94 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in crude oil prices helped to boost oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 5/8, to 58. Chevron was up 1 1/8 to
88. And BP Amoco rose 7/8, to 54.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in interest rates hammered big Internet stocks. America
Online fell 7 1/16, to 114. Yahoo! fell for a second day, dropping
7 1/2, to 173 7/8. And eBay lost 5, to 144 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve Board has to be happy to see some air come
out of the market,'' said David Mead, chief investment officer at
Harris Bank in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said stocks could correct a bit more from here, and that
over the near term bonds seem a better investment.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that so many stocks have been beaten so far off
their 52-week highs that he is beginning to make some selective
purchases.

 (ATTN: Pa., N.J., Mass.)   MORE BOSSES ENCOURAGE NAPPING DURING WORK HOURS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sterling McCullough doesn't mind getting caught napping at work.
A half-dozen times in the last year, he has disappeared down a
little-used hallway at Deloitte Consulting in Pittsburgh, stretched
out in a leather chair and nodded off.
</P>
<P>
   His bosses don't care. That is because Deloitte, where
McCullough is a senior manager, has created a nap room for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Falling asleep on the job may be a cardinal taboo of the
workplace, but a smattering of companies around the country are
defying common wisdom and actually encouraging the practice. They
are discovering that it increases morale _ and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society is chronically sleep-deprived,'' said Dennis W.
Holland, director of alertness management at Union Pacific Corp.,
the nation's biggest railroad, which adopted a pro-napping policy
in 1998. ``It's worse than it was in the past, and we have to
address it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Union Pacific and its main rival, Burlington Northern Santa
Fe Railway Corp., allow conductors and engineers to take sleep
breaks of up to 45 minutes, as long as the train is stopped and
another crew member is awake. Other employers, including a handful
of Silicon Valley companies, have set up nap rooms, some of which
offer reclining chairs, blankets, alarm clocks and even
classical-music CDs to lull workers into slumber. British Airways
permits pilots on transoceanic flights to catch a few winks so they
will be fresher for landings. Even the U.S. Army, convinced by
recent sleep research, has begun telling officers to permit, and
take, naps when possible.
</P>
<P>
   Employees generally welcome the idea, though many can't shake
off a feeling of guilt when they initially indulge. McCullough
remembers the first time that he ventured into the company's nap
room, closed the door and uneasily lowered the ceiling-to-floor
shades. ``You're looking for a camera or a tape recorder,'' he
said. ``You're wondering, `If I snore, will they catch me?' The
first time, it's kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   As more managers bedded down, employees took the cue and joined
them, said the human resources director, Sandy Francis. During the
day, the room is now occupied more than it is vacant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, those 20 minutes give you energy to go on for a few
more hours, rather than faking lucidity for the rest of the day,''
said Frank M. Ligons, 23, a business analyst who says he used to
try to beat fatigue by staring blankly at the work on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The nap-at-work movement remains nascent, to be sure, but it
gives hope to anyone who has ever nodded off in front of the
computer screen or sneaked off to the storage closet, bathroom
stall or space under the desk _ as the character George Costanza
did in one ``Seinfeld'' episode, to limited success.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans sleeping roughly 20 percent less than their
great-grandparents did, it is no wonder that two out of five
workers report that fatigue regularly interferes with their ability
to function, according to the National Sleep Foundation in
Washington. The problem is likely to worsen, too, thanks to the
Internet explosion, all-night television, 24-hour stock trading and
other temptations of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new nap policies began bubbling up two or three
years ago. Since then, some pioneers have struggled to convince
workers that lying down on the job really is OK. When Burlington
Northern authorized the practice two years ago, it said conductors
and engineers could sleep only if they radioed in the plan to
headquarters. ``It was a complete failure,'' said Alan L. Lindsey,
the railway's general director for safety and rules. ``People would
make fun of them'' over the radio.
</P>
<P>
   So the company dropped the restriction and gave all 15,000
employees who work on trains carte blanche to curl up when the
train was stopped and a colleague was awake. By early 2000,
Burlington Northern will allow 8,000 track workers to nap, too.
``We know this has always been going on,'' Lindsey said. ``Now,
we're putting a structure to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the napping movement is not exactly sweeping the
nation. No major white-collar employer has publicly adopted a
pro-sleep policy. Wal-Mart Stores, the country's largest employer,
says its 815,000 workers are free to repair to company lounges for
quick rests during their scheduled breaks, but not to doze on the
job. In general, bosses worry about sanctioning any innovation with
goof-off potential, especially when e-mail and computer games are
already vying for employees' attention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, advocates of workplace napping say it is the wave of the
future. After all, it has a proud history in many lands as the
siesta, and doctors say afternoon drowsiness is part of the body's
natural rhythm, not just a response to a heavy lunch. ``You hit
that 2-to-3-o'clock period, and you think, `Nap! I need to lie
down,''' said Kimberly Oliver, the marketing director at OP
Contract Inc., an office-furniture dealer in San Francisco that set
up a nap room when it expanded last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when she is hit by ``sleep coma,'' as office workers call
post-lunch fatigue, Ms. Oliver heads to the nap room, plunks down
on a chaise lounge, puts on eyeshades and listens to a CD of
Pachelbel's Canon, provided by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific argument for naps has won over branches of the
government, too. The Army sends sleep specialists to elite training
grounds, to tell rising officers that troops should ``nap early and
nap often,'' said Col. Gregory Belenky, a doctor at the Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research, who often delivers the speech.
</P>
<P>
   A cottage industry is developing to exploit the trend. ``The Art
of Napping at Work'' (Larson Publications), by a Boston University
professor, William A. Anthony, and his wife, Camille, will be in
bookstores next month. Workplace napping ``is not an easy sell,''
the book acknowledges. But, it adds, ``Neither, for that matter,
was fluoride in the drinking water or women wearing slacks to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Company Store, a New Jersey-based seller of textiles, offers
an ``executive napping kit,'' complete with a pillow and an earlier
book by the Anthonys for $79. Mark R. Rosekind, a sleep researcher
at NASA, left his post two years ago to start Alertness Solutions
Inc. For a fee, it advises companies on how to fight employee
fatigue.

 &HT;    Italy asks U.S. to ban trade in antiquities
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Italy, concerned that American markets for ancient
Roman, Greek and Etruscan artifacts are spurring the destruction of
its cultural heritage, has asked the United States for help in
halting international traffic in its archaeological treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The request, coming on the heels of a crackdown on artifact
smuggling operations by Italy's national police, seeks import
restrictions on a wide range of art and artifacts spanning more
than 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department review of the request Tuesday triggered angry
objections from U.S. art dealers who contend that such a sweeping
embargo is both unnecessary and unenforceable. Archaeologists say
it is needed to help halt a ``furious tide of looting to supply
antiquities for the international art market.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy is the first industrialized country to seek such
protection under the U.S. Cultural Property Protection Act since it
was passed 15 years ago. The sheer size of the market in Italian
antiquities _ with imports estimated in the range of $50 million a
year _ is also making the request the most controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is heightened by the last week's introduction of
legislation _ proposed by Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles
Schumer (both D-N.Y.) and supported by art dealers _ that would add
new, and some say potentially crippling, limitations to the act.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed by Italy, the import ban would apply to statuary,
sculptures, ceramics, glass, frescoes and other objects from the
5th millennium B.C. to the 5th century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few countries in the world can claim an archaeological
heritage as rich as Italy's,'' said Boston University archaeologist
Ricardo Elia, representing the 30,000 members of the Archeological
Institute of America in support of the import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But despite strong legislation and strenuous efforts, it
remains plagued by archaeological site looting and other forms of
art theft. And sadly, the United States has long been a major
market for antiquities coming from Italy,'' Elia told the U.S.
Cultural Property Advisory Committee, which is expected to
recommend a course of action to the State Department this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some countries, where looting goes largely unchecked,
Italy has moved aggressively to stamp out the looting and smuggling
inside its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1997, Italian police seized more than 120,000
artifacts from clandestine excavations by Italian tomboroli, or
tomb robbers. Late last year, they broke up a Sicilian smuggling
ring and confiscated 10,000 illicit antiquities worth an estimated
$30 million. Another raid in March netted 11,000 objects.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Italian authorities say the looting continues. Only
last month, thieves backed up a truck to the Emperor Hadrian's
second century B.C. villa outside Rome and made off with a
3-foot-high pink marble column weighing hundreds of pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The daring theft prompted Gen. Roberto Conforti, the head of
Italy's art theft squad, to note that with 40 million visitors
expected in Rome for next year's millennium jubilee, the country is
in danger of becoming a ``help-yourself service'' for artifact
thieves. ``If every tourist takes home a souvenir of the Eternal
City, there will not be much of it left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Italy had forbidden the export of any of its art and antiquities
for more than 60 years, but without cooperation from countries
where such goods are sold, it has been difficult to recover objects
after they leave the country. In one of the rare exceptions, U.S.
courts this year ordered the return of a $1.2 million gold bowl
that had been smuggled out of Italy and purchased by New York
financier Michael Steinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. art dealers say any blanket ban on the importation of
Italian antiquities only in the United States would not solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``More needs to be done to stop theft and looting at the
source,'' said Rena Moulopoulis, an attorney for Sotheby's in New
York. ``Italy needs more domestic deterrents to this activity, like
stiffer penalties and prompt prosecution.''

 &HT;    Home not too sweet for Thrashers
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They play in a $213 million arena considered far ahead
of the industry curve. They practice in a $2.3 million facility
that has as many television sets as it does Lifecycles. In many
cases, they live in country-club homes that allow them to golf
during down time.
</P>
<P>
   Nice.
</P>
<P>
   Bu three home games before sellout crowds, the Thrashers
are looking forward to _ airplane food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time we got out of Dodge,'' said coach Curt
Fraser, whose team opens a three-game trip Thursday against the New
York Islanders in Uniondale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I played,'' Fraser said, ``it always seemed like
when you got on the road things happened a little easier for
everybody. You're more relaxed. You're not squeezing splinters out
of the wood on your sticks. We've been tight here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers managed a 5-5 tie with Buffalo Saturday after
losing to New Jersey 4-1 and Detroit 7-1. The Islanders will be a
nice departure from the trio of Stanley Cup contenders, but the
players appear to be looking forward mostly to a change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play in a different environment, you have to stick
together a little more,'' defenseman Chris Tamer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' center Mike Stapleton said, ``when you're at home
you're trying to impress everybody (in the stands), especially
being in a new city. On the road you don't feel like you have to
put the show on. It's a simple game. Maybe that's what we need.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will also give us a chance to get to know each other
better,'' Stapleton said, ``When you're on the road is when you
spend most of your time together, and that's when you become a
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip is illogical _ north to the Islanders, back to Atlanta,
south to Tampa Bay on Saturday, then north again to the New York
Rangers on Sunday. But as center Ray Ferraro said, ``There won't be
any distractions, because there won't be any time for them on this
ridiculous schedule. Play, fly, practice, play, fly, play.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip is the first for the Thrashers since they made their
final roster cuts. Since then, players have been getting settled
into new homes and making arrangements for family members who came
to town during the opening homestand. Players will tell you that
the distractions are no excuse for the poor defensive play to open
the season, but they won't be present during this trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always found that when you get into different
surroundings, you gel more as a team,'' team captain Kelly
Buchberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Edmonton, we could have 18-day road trips sometimes, and
you had to get along,'' he said. ``It builds team chemistry. That's
especially important with this team because we're all new players.
When you're away from home, you talk hockey more because you're not
with your family. Everything is hockey.''

COMMENTARY: BUSH'S BIG CHANCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that George W. Bush is defining himself on domestic policy
by trashing his own party's congressmen, maybe it's time for him to
define himself on foreign policy by trashing Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. should welcome Buchanan leaving the party _ indeed,
he should see it as an opportunity,'' says Bill Kristol, editor of
the conservative Weekly Standard, who, with his colleague Robert
Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, is mounting a campaign against
Republican isolationism. ``It is the only way we are going to
restore Republican internationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol has a point. The Republican Party has lost its way on
foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. Try a little test:
Say the words ``Trent Lott'' and ``foreign policy,'' and see what
images or ideas pop into your head. Anything? The International
House of Pancakes, perhaps? Beef Wellington? Nothing? OK, now
substitute ``Dennis Hastert.'' Nada? Zippo? Well, it's not
surprising. They have no ideas _ only politics, and it doesn't stop
at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Without the threat of a morally vile and strategically lethal
enemy _ the Soviet Union _ the Republican Party has drifted toward
a sort of know-nothing, ``drive-by'' foreign policy. Its members
drive by the White House, shout some putdown of President Clinton,
demand more money for a missile shield and drive on. Their only
interest is defeating the president, not defining a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because on one end the GOP is pulled by Buchananite
isolationists. Buchanan's brown-shirted view of America is that
it's just like Germany or France _ a nation shaped not by an idea,
but by a territory and by who was born here and who not. ``So
Buchanan is all in favor of fighting Indians and Mexicans to
conquer this continent,'' says Kristol, ``but he turns against any
war abroad that might involve defending American principles and
ideals _ not just soil. He doesn't want to export our ideals,
because, deep down, he doesn't value our ideals. He is a
European-style conservative. He looks to blood and soil as our
identifying characteristic, not the Declaration of Independence and
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the GOP are the realists. They have a world
view: The world is a jungle, there are no norms, and the only thing
that matters is that potential foes be balanced and contained. When
the USSR existed, Republican realism appeared to have a real moral
content, since it was about balancing and containing communism,
argues Kristol.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he says, ``in a world where America is the overwhelming
superpower, and there is no Soviet threat, or any other immediate
threat to contain, Republican realism can slide into Buchanan-like
isolationism.''
</P>
<P>
   It leaves a GOP that on foreign policy seems as if it's against
everything _ from Kosovo to arms control to foreign aid. And that
brings us back to Buchanan, who is still deciding whether to run
for president as a Republican or from the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican establishment view is, `Don't pick a fight with
Buchanan, so we don't alienate his voters,''' says Kristol. ``That
is wrong. The party should encourage him to leave. This is not
about who Pat Buchanan is _ we know who he is _ it's about who
George W. Bush and the Republican Party are. Do they stand for
American ideals and global leadership in foreign policy, or are
they just a tent to raise money and accumulate votes?''
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that the Republican leadership doesn't want
to pick a fight with Buchanan, but, on the other hand, notes Kagan,
``They aren't even saying, `We must not have these views in the
party.' Because the truth is their own foreign-policy views _
except for John McCain and a few others _ are not really that far
from Buchanan's.''
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s biggest foreign-policy proposal has been for a
commission to review U.S. troop deployments abroad, suggesting
there were too many. Not exactly ``the vision thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be tempting to say that this is politics and Bush
should just triangulate his way to election. ``But you need to lay
the groundwork during the campaign for how you are going to
govern,'' says Kristol. ``If, as a presidential candidate, you
don't take on the most extreme isolationist in your party, then as
a president you are going to find it very difficult to lead a
Congress, already tilting isolationist, toward any kind of serious
engagement abroad.''

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People passing through 14th and Constitution in Washington on
Sept. 30 had no idea that the world's first private spy camera was
orbiting 400 miles overhead. But the spacecraft snapped a picture
of the intersection in resolution sharp enough to show their cars,
as well as surrounding buildings, monuments and city bustle.
</P>
<P>
   Inaugurating a new commercial era, Space Imaging Inc., the
private company in Thornton, Colo., that built the spacecraft, made
the photograph public Tuesday. It is the world's first commercial
image from space whose sharpness rivals those of military spies in
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The release caps many years of planning, delay and debate. The
emerging spy satellite industry holds promise for geographers,
urban planners and others, but it also poses knotty security and
privacy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other uses, the industry is expected to aid detection of
states trying to set off underground nuclear explosions in secret,
augmenting global sensors that can detect rumbles from clandestine
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most significant developments in the history
of the space age,'' said John E. Pike, head of space policy at the
Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington.
``It was revolutionary when it was available to the nuclear powers,
and one expects it to have similar potential now that it is
commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration gave the go-ahead in 1994 for such
private space cameras. Space Imaging launched the first successful
satellite of the class on Sept. 24, after a similar effort failed
in April. Three other companies have announced plans to put similar
craft in orbit by the end of next year, and experts say that
perhaps a dozen or so may fly in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The new wave of commercial space cameras can see objects as
small as a few feet wide _ down to one meter _ and thus show cars,
homes, roads, boats, trees, buildings, pipelines, bridges, convoys,
tanks, jets and missiles _ but not individual people. The image
released Tuesday shows the Washington Monument, part of the White
House ellipse and buildings like the Department of Commerce and the
American History Museum of the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it was taking orders, but no images would be
sold until late this year. The Pentagon is expected to be a main
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Mark E. Brender, a Space Imaging spokesman, said prices would
range from $30 to $600 per square mile. He added that the minimum
order, at least for now, would be $1,000.

   Brender said the satellite was being run through calibration
tests, including photographing painted lines on a runway in Texas
that are exactly one meter wide ``so we can see precisely how
accurate the sensors are.''
</P>

   Eastman Kodak, a top contractor for military spy satellites,
built the camera and telescope system, whose main mirror is 27
inches wide.

<P>
   Space Imaging is a private company owned by the Lockheed Martin
Corp., which makes many of the military's spy satellites, and
E-Systems Inc., a unit of Raytheon that provides many of their
communication links. International investors include Mitsubishi and
Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
   An illustration of how spy satellites can expose plans for
secret explosions came in 1977 when South Africa was preparing to
detonate a nuclear device beneath the Kalihari desert. As Seymour
M. Hersh recounted the episode in ``The Samson Option'' (Random
House, 1991), an American spy satellite found signs of preparation
for an underground test.
</P>
<P>
   Alerted to the activity, President Jimmy Carter helped lead a
quiet campaign of international protest. South Africa, facing the
loss of diplomatic relations, scrapped the planned detonation.

   On the morning of the 1996 presidential election, Sharon Denny
drove to the local polling place, an elementary school in her
Houston neighborhood. On the way, she gave herself a pep talk.
``This is so important,'' she told herself. ``And it makes such a
difference to our country. You have got to go vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But standing in line for the voting booth, Ms. Denny grew
anxious. What if she got inside and did not know what to do? What
if she punched the wrong holes? She broke into a cold sweat, she
recalls, and she remembers thinking, ``This is why they don't want
people with mental illness to vote, because what if I get up there
and I really want to vote for Bill Clinton and I don't, I end up
voting for Dole?''
</P>
<P>
   Defeated, Ms. Denny, who has suffered from manic-depression for
35 years, returned home, her ballot uncast, as it has been in every
election since she first registered to vote 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in next year's presidential election, Ms. Denny, 51, knows
that she will make it to the front of the line, and that she will
finally vote for the candidates and initiatives that she believes
in.
</P>
<P>
   She is certain of this because in August she joined the Mental
Health Voter Empowerment Project, an effort to create a nationwide
constituency of people with mental illness by locating potential
voters _ whether in hospitals, at advocacy events, in housing
projects, clinics or support groups _ registering them, educating
them about mental health issues and making sure they get to the
polls on Election Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether such an effort will be embraced by
politicians, especially in a climate where they must respond to
highly publicized incidents of violence involving mental illness,
like the death of Kendra Webdale, who was pushed off a New York
subway platform by a man suffering from schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue further, many politicians have only
recently become aware of mental health as a political issue: a few
even believe, mistakenly, that the mentally ill cannot vote.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer from the project will call to remind Ms. Denny to
vote, accompany her to the polling place and help her in the voting
booth, if necessary. Ms. Denny will arrive fully informed about the
candidates, and in particular about their stands on topics of
concern to the mentally ill, like equal health insurance coverage
for psychiatric illnesses, HMO reform, involuntary commitment and
financing for mental health programs and services.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 44 million Americans meet the diagnosis criteria
for some form of mental disorder, according to the National
Institute of Mental Health, and 5.6 million of those live with a
serious mental illness, like schizophrenia or manic depression.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such numbers could represent a powerful voting bloc,
one any political candidate might feel obliged to court. But people
with severe mental illness, who often subsist on disability
benefits and may spend years bouncing from psychiatric hospitals to
jails to the streets, have been ignored by politicians because they
offered neither money nor votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Steele, who started the voter empowerment project in New
York City in 1994, said that the idea came to him after hearing a
speech by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. In the speech, Steele
recalled, Cuomo said that his signing of a mental health bill was
``a good and compassionate thing,'' but that it was not smart
politics, because the mentally ill did not vote.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four years, Steele, a veteran of 35 years spent in
state hospitals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, registered an
estimated 28,000 New York City voters. And 15,000 of those newly
registered voters, he and his staff of volunteers learned through
their tracking efforts, cast their votes in the November 1998
election.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mental Health Association of New York State, backed by a
federal grant and financing from a pharmaceutical company, is
expanding Steele's project throughout the state, and the Mental
Health Association of Houston and Harris County has launched its
own version of the program. The National Mental Health Association,
which has its headquarters in Alexandria, Va., will hold regional
training sessions for the project beginning this fall in Orlando,
Los Angeles and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to have our issues be part of the 2000 debate,''
said Joseph Glazer, president of the New York association, ``and
the only way to get our issues to that level is to have a strong
base of registered voters and a sufficient voice so that the mental
health consumer community has to be listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele compared the fight for political visibility to earlier
struggles by women and African-Americans: ``This is a civil rights
movement, like those that preceded it. Every one of those movements
began with access to the vote. Until we, the mental health
consumers, are seen as a constituency of consequence, we will not
close the holes in the mental health system.''

   Voter registration drives are nothing new, and many
organizations, at one time or another, have tried to increase
political participation among the disenfranchised, including people
with mental illness, by registering new voters.
</P>
<P>
   But such drives often are limited in effectiveness, the
organizers of the voter empowerment project contend, because they
rarely address the obstacles _ transportation, education, fear _
that prevent the newly registered from actually getting to the
polls or into the voting booth. Nor is the typical voter drive
conceived as part of a larger political strategy, one that in this
instance aspires to imitate influential interest groups like the
Christian Coalition, the gay rights movement or the environmental
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that you're going to see mental health become a
single issue that's going to determine an election,'' said Clarence
Sundram, a human rights consultant in Albany and former director of
the New York State Commission on Quality Care. ``I don't think it's
going to have the hot-button effect like abortion has. But I think
the political organizing and advocacy that consumers do can and
does have an effect on laws that affect the lives of people with
mental illness.''

<P>
   For a variety of reasons, consumer leaders argue, the emergence
of a national ``mental health'' constituency is more possible today
than at any time previously. While the stigma that accompanies a
diagnosis of mental illness persists, Americans as a whole are
better informed about the difficulties that confront those who
suffer from depression, manic-depression and other illnesses, in
part as the result of public figures ``coming out'' about their own
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore,
revealed that she received treatment for clinical depression after
their son, Albert, nearly died after being hit by a car in 1989 at
age 6. Activism on Capitol Hill by groups like the National
Alliance for the Mentally Ill, an organization of family members
and some consumers, has also helped raise awareness of mental
health issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the voices of consumers themselves have been
growing steadily stronger. What began in the early 1970s as an
``anti-psychiatry'' campaign by mental health system ``survivors,''
dedicated to exposing abuses in psychiatric hospitals and other
treatment institutions, has matured into a broader-based advocacy
movement, encompassing a range of viewpoints unified by a
commitment to improving the mental health system.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days a lot of people felt the need to free people
from psychiatry,'' said Joseph Rogers, executive director of the
National Mental Health Consumers Self-Help Clearinghouse, which in
August sponsored the National Summit of Mental Health Consumers and
Survivors, a meeting that drew 450 consumer leaders to Portland,
Ore. ``Now we still definitely have folks who feel that way, but
we've grown to include people who have had positive experiences as
well as negative experiences.'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In many states, consumers have become part of the mental health
system itself, offering their perspective in a variety of official
capacities and running self-help services, like drop-in clinics,
and housing and employment programs.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 survey of state mental health commissioners, Dr. Jean
Campbell of the University of Missouri School of Medicine found
that 91 percent reported that mental health consumers served on
state advisory boards; 85 percent said that consumers took an
active role in developing their state's mental health services.
``We're broadening and pushing the mental health system and making
it a better place,'' said Sally Zinman, executive director of the
California Network of Mental Health Clients.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet there remain barriers to turning local activism into a
national political presence, not the least of which is a lack of
wealthy donors, of the type who nurture the coffers of many
special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   The voter empowerment project, for example, is eligible for
federal grants and financing by corporations because of the Mental
Health Association's nonprofit status. But that status also
obligates the project to remain nonpartisan in its drive to
register voters. And while some organizations have given up their
nonprofit status in order to push a political agenda, most mental
health groups cannot afford to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a recent training session for the project, held in
Binghamton, N.Y., the leaders of more than a dozen consumer groups
and mental health organizations learned how to find unregistered
voters _ events that offer food are a sure-fire draw, they were
told _ how to establish a confidential database with voters' names,
phone numbers and addresses, how to teach new voters about the
electoral process and how to organize events like candidates'
nights.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also instructed in educating people about mental
health issues while avoiding endorsement of particular candidates.
An educational pamphlet, for example, might inform project members
that a certain politician had referred to the mentally ill as
``mentally deficient,'' they were told, but the pamphlet could not
recommend voting against the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Such constraints lead some to view the voter empowerment project
as a rather tepid political endeavor. ``It's Political Action
101,'' Rogers said. ``When you're actually supporting candidates,
that's real political action. My hope is that after that, people
will take the next step, which is to get really involved in
directly trying to affect policy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, project organizers believe that the voters they register
``get it,'' and will use their ballots to support candidates with a
good record on mental health issues. And they hope that politicians
will eventually get the message, viewing them as a constituency to
be wooed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether political candidates will want the votes of people with
mental illness is another matter. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who
has attended candidate events held by the empowerment project, said
he thinks an organized group of voters with mental illness would be
treated like any other voting bloc. ``Any constituency that has any
size and sticks together and votes together is one that people are
going to be interested in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers are under pressure from other directions, as well:
Constituents who react every time there is a widely publicized
incidence of violence involving mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every Tipper Gore, you have news coverage of some deranged
person committing a horrible act,'' Sundram said. ``Those things
reinforce negative stereotypes of people with mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in virtually every such instance, consumer advocates
contend, violence can be traced to a lack of adequate services and
treatment. The mentally ill, studies have shown, are no more
violent than other groups, except when alcohol or drug abuse is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the stigma that clings to mental illness is not so
easily combatted. And it is a discomfort so powerful that it often
infects even those who themselves are ill.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who have been treated for mental illness believe,
incorrectly, that they cannot vote because they have been
hospitalized, or that they will lose their disability benefits if
they register. Only adult citizens who have been convicted of a
felony or declared mentally incompetent are ineligible to vote.
``I've been mentally ill for most of my life, and I didn't really
feel I had the right to vote,'' said Peter Lasher, a 44-year old
New York man who has been hospitalized repeatedly for
manic-depression.
</P>
<P>
   Lasher did not register to vote until four years ago, when he
was persuaded to do so by the voter empowerment project.
</P>
<P>
   He has now voted in several elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains nervous about the process and is afraid of the
voting machines. He cast an absentee ballot in 1996 and said he
would do so again in the next presidential election _ once he
decides who to vote for. ``I sort of like Gore,'' he said, ``and I
like Tippy _ she's very pro-mental health.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore presidential campaign,
said the campaign would welcome a chance to hear the empowerment
group's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to vote is obviously something that is very, very
important,'' he said, ``and we would do everything we can to
encourage those who are eligible to vote.''

WHY I PAID SO MUCH FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   (Editors : The first paragraph, which identifies the author, should
appear in italics.) 
 &HT;    (DW) 
 By ARTHUR A. LEVINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur A. Levine is editorial director of Arthur A. Levine
Books, an imprint of Scholastic Inc., which has published three
best-selling children's books about a junior wizard, Harry Potter.
Scholastic paid more than $100,000 for the first manuscript by an
author who was then unknown.
</P>
<P>
   I had never paid so much for an acquisition before. I bought
Harry Potter in 1997 at the Bologna, Italy, book fair before it had
ever been published anywhere. It's a scary thing when you keep
bidding and the stakes get higher and higher. I was getting a
tremendous amount of support from my company. And that's a
wonderful thing, but it's a great risk. If people believe in you
and you flop, then you walk out on the plank and plunge.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to say I love this first novel by this unknown
woman in Scotland and I want to publish it. And it's another thing
as the bidding goes higher.
</P>
<P>
   Do you love it this much? Do you love it at $50,000? At $70,000?
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction was to call the author, J.K. Rowling, to tell
her not to be frightened because I knew it would be a tremendous
amount of pressure on her.
</P>
<P>
   I called her very late, and we had a very nice conversation _
our first. I said don't be scared, and she said, ``Thanks; I am.''
We both said now that we've paid this much we've got to concentrate
on making the book work.
</P>
<P>
   The thing I loved the most about reading Harry Potter is the
idea of growing up unappreciated, feeling outcast and then this
great satisfaction of being discovered. That is the fantasy of
every person who grows up feeling marginalized in any way. Along
with the imagination and the wonderful writing, that's the
emotional connection that drew me to the book.
</P>
<P>
   It's the experience of being a smart kid in public school and
not being particularly athletic. I think any kid who has that
experience is marginalized.
</P>
<P>
   I was Jewish in a non-Jewish town, in Elmont, N.Y. I was a
musician, and that's great among musicians, but that's not
necessarily valued in public school. I was the first clarinetist.
Great, that will get you a nickel. I didn't have a miserable,
oppressed childhood, but I did have those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   I think that the biggest lesson from the success of Harry Potter
is that you need to try not to follow a trend. It's almost a
cliche. You have to follow your heart. In Harry Potter, the wand
chooses the wizard; and when the wand chooses you, you take it. You
don't try to find which other books are selling, which ones are hot
right now.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about publishing is that we are continually mourning
the changes in our industry.
</P>
<P>
   We editors and publishers mourn how it doesn't work the same
anymore and there are all these pressures to find books that work,
and understand what makes a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   The nicest thing about Harry Potter was that it was generated in
an old-fashioned way _ from a discussion to publish a book that is
great.

 &HT;    Mother of Atlanta office shooting victim sues
 &HT;    Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A third lawsuit resulting from Mark O. Barton's July
29 killing spree at two day trading firms has been filed in Fulton
County State Court.
</P>
<P>
   Alyce F. Wenzel, the mother of 30-year-old shooting victim Scott
Allyn Webb, claims in her lawsuit that Momentum Securities, Jones
Lang LaSalle Americas and Barton Protective Services failed to
prevent the killing of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum should have known Barton was engaging in high-stakes
trading and suffering major losses, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentum . . . knew or should have known through exercise of
due care, that the business of day trading is a high risk,
stressful and volatile enterprise,'' according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the three companies ``should have known of the
potentially dangerous conditions contained on the premises and
failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the invitees
within the office complex from the reasonably foreseeable criminal
acts of a third person.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities is the company where Webb and three other
people were shot and killed July 29 by Barton. Five other people
were shot to death across the street at a second day trading firm.
Jones Lang LaSalle Americas is the owner and manager of the
building at 3500 Piedmont Road where the killings took place, and
Barton Protective Services is the company responsible for the
building's security.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's estate is also named as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum Securities released a brief statement expressing
sympathy for the victims of the shooting rampage, but said it is
not responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that Mark Barton, not Momentum
Securities, is the one who was and is responsible for these tragic
and unforeseeable events,'' the statement read in part.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants either declined comment or could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Wenzel is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages,
court costs and attorney's fees.
</P>
<P>
   In August, two weeks after the shooting, the family of Dean
Delawalla, who was shot to death, filed a similar lawsuit. On Sept.
27, the family of Yuzef Liberzon, who is recovering from gunshot
wounds at Atlanta's Shepherd Center, did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fourth lawsuit is likely on the way, said Jan P.
Cohen, an attorney for the victims' relatives. Cohen declined to
identify who would be filing the fourth lawsuit.

HIS `SAME OLD SONG' IS, FOR HIM, ANYTHING BUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ White-haired, straight-backed, good humored, Alain
Resnais seemed quite amused by the idea that it took him 35 years
to have his first genuine box office hit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at 77, he could well afford to display nonchalance,
what with his place in the history of modern cinema having long
been assured by his remarkable early films ``Hiroshima Mon Amour''
and ``Last Year at Marienbad.'' Even so, the success of this
Frenchman's latest movie, ``On Connait La Chanson,'' or ``Same Old
Song,'' surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always refuse to talk numbers,'' he said, chuckling as he
prepared to contradict himself, ``but my films usually sell about
300,000 tickets. I did not expect this film to sell 2.6 million in
France alone. I had warned the producer that it would not be easy
to export, but it also did well in Germany, Italy, Japan. Now let's
see what happens in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the charm of ``Same Old Song,'' which opened in New York
on Friday, derives from the way its six main characters lip-synch
popular French songs. They do not stop and break into song as they
might in a musical; rather, the songs flow from the action, the
lyrics arising out of normal conversation or of a character's
thinking aloud. The songs, which many French moviegoers know by
heart, nonetheless add a dimension of passion or poignancy or
absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   But will it be the same to understand the songs through
subtitles?
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea, my hope, is that it is not necessary to know the
songs beforehand in order to enjoy the movie,'' Resnais said.
``There is not one song in the film that does not have genuine
musical quality, so they're not there just because they were
hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrative tradition of La Chanson Francaise helps. Thus,
while Resnais and his screenwriters, Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre
Bacri, did not build the movie's story line around the songs, they
had no trouble finding 36 songs or excerpts that fitted the twists
and turns of their plot.
</P>
<P>
   Among familiar voices heard are those of Maurice Chevalier,
Edith Piaf, Leo Ferre, Gilbert Becaud, Serge Gainsbourg, Eddy
Mitchell, Johnny Halliday and Julien Clerc.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is clever but not original, Resnais hurries to remind,
because he took his inspiration from the English writer Dennis
Potter, who used the same technique in ``The Singing Detective''
and ``Lipstick on Your Collar,'' both originally made for
television. His challenge, Resnais said, was to borrow without
copying.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Potter, who died in 1994, usually used entire songs,
Resnais rarely does. And the mood of ``Same Old Song'' is decidedly
lighter than much of Potter's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potter was extremely pessimistic,'' Resnais said. ``His are
films of a man who has suffered a great deal, who creates
characters who are paranoid. The songs are in total contrast with
the situations in the film. We tried to have the song always come
from inside the head of the character, to reflect the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Resnais's story itself has the complexity of a soap opera. Odile
(Sabine Azema), who is married to dull Claude (Pierre Arditi), is
eager to buy an apartment being promoted by a real estate agency
headed by the smoothie Marc (Lambert Wilson). Odile's scholarly
sister, Camille (Ms. Jaoui), falls for Marc just as Marc's elderly
employee, Simon (Andre Dussollier), falls for Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Odile's old flame, Nicolas ( Bacri), who has
reappeared in Paris, has Simon showing him apartments to rent.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, is quite as he or she wants to be seen. Camille
triumphantly completes her doctoral thesis and then slumps into
depression. Simon pretends to be writing radio plays until he is
exposed as a lowly real estate agent. Nicolas puts on the airs of a
business executive while working as a chauffeur. Claude seems to be
a devoted _ and obedient _ husband but in fact has a mistress.
Odile behaves heartlessly, then is gripped by remorse. Only Marc
the cad remains true to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never plan to leave a precise message,'' Resnais said over
coffee near the Paris Opera's Palais Garnier. ``Usually, I meet a
writer and say, `We have a producer; would you like to try to make
a film together?' The writer says yes or no, we meet, we look for
topics, they develop. In this case, some ideas came out about
appearances, about people who are very different the more you know
them, about the way you imagine them and the way they are. But
there was never the idea of, `Let's make a film about ... '''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Resnais is a very un-French director: he does not
write his own movies, he always works with a screenwriter, he does
not consider himself an auteur and he demands that the opening
credits of his films do (italics)not(end italics) include that all
too contagious formula: ``A Film by Alain Resnais.'' A French
dictionary of movie directors even posed the question: ``Does Alain
Resnais really exist?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors and writer are equally auteurs of a film,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Resnais is modest, but there is also reason for his modesty: he
never intended to become a director. Rather, he began his career in
the mid-1940s as a film editor working for the influential producer
Pierre Braumberger. And it was Braumberger who pushed him into
making short documentaries about the visual arts, notably ``Van
Gogh,'' Picasso's ``Guernica'' and ``Gauguin.''
</P>
<P>
   His 32-minute documentary about Auschwitz, ``Nuit et
Brouillard,'' reached a broader audience in 1956, but it was not
until two years later that he made his first feature film,
``Hiroshima Mon Amour,'' again at the insistence of producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to make a film about the atomic bomb, mainly
because they had some yen they couldn't take out of Japan,'' he
recalled. He began working with the French documentary filmmaker
ChrisMarker. ``But we decided we had nothing to add to the two
existing documentaries, one English, one Japanese,'' Resnais said.
``They asked if I'd like to work with Francoise Sagan. I said fine,
but she was never approached. I then mentioned Marguerite Duras,
and she heard about it and contacted me. I happened to remark that,
while we were having tea, planes carrying A-bombs were flying
around the clock. Perhaps that would be one way of looking at the
film, with the bomb in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   From this conversation, Duras developed a script that dwelled on
a Japanese man and a French woman meeting in Hiroshima, both
carrying the scars of World War II, the woman because she had been
punished as a collaborator for having an affair with a German
soldier during the occupation, the man because of the A-bomb that
ended the war in Japan. The film was widely acclaimed as a
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   With his next film, ``Last Year at Marienbad,'' (1961) the
backing of a producer led Resnais to the novelist Alain
Robbe-Grillet and resulted in one of the most mysterious, and
discussed, movies of the 1960s, an unsettling dreamlike tale of a
man meeting a woman with whom he may _ or may not _ have had an
affair the previous year at a spa in Marienbad.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Resnais has generally followed the same routine: a
producer comes up with some money, he finds a writer, an idea for
an original screenplay is thrashed out and eventually a film is
made. In 1993 with ``Smoking/No Smoking,'' he broke the pattern by
turning Alan Ayckbourn's six-part play, ``Intimate Exchanges,''
into two movies.
</P>
<P>
   But the actor-writers invited to adapt the play, Ms. Jaoui and
Bacri, then became Resnais's writing team for ``Same Old Song'' (in
the meantime, they wrote and acted in ``Un Air de Famille''). Their
only condition was that they should also appear in Resnais's film.
</P>
<P>
   Resnais said he always took time to cast his films, but on this
occasion he took three actors _ Ms. Azema, Arditi and Dussolier _
with whom he had frequently worked before, along with the two
screenwriters and Wilson. They all then formed what is known
affectionately as the ``Resnais family,'' the close-knit team that
makes the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before shooting, he organizes individual work sessions with
each actor at his home during which a very precise agreement is
reached on the psychology of the character and the situations,''
Ms. Jaoui said.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to making ``Same Old Song,'' Wilson said the
biggest challenge was to avoid showing that he was going from
talking to lip-synching.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you hear the music, it is hard to resist the
beat,'' he recalled. ``Ignoring the beat, even for something as
simple as lighting a cigarette, is much harder than I thought it
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, two years after the movie's release in France, Resnais's
attention has now turned to his next movie, but as so often _ he
has only made 14 feature films in 40 years _ things are moving
slowly. And with Ms. Jaoui and Bacri busy on their own projects, he
has still to find a writer with whom he wants to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want someone who has written for theater,'' he said. ``I am
looking for a particular sound, the sound of someone who knows how
to manipulate words. Jaoui and Bacri can do that. But Agnes Jaoui
is now making her own film. She no longer needs a director. I
suspect that if I asked them, they'd say, `We'll make it
ourselves.'''

IN THE TRAUMA OF BARBARITY, ART SPEAKS OUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Though artists are usually advised to choose
what they know as their subject matter, the risks of such a
strategy here are obvious. By any measurement, Colombia is one of
the most violent countries in the world, with guerrillas, drug
dealers, paramilitary groups and gangs of ordinary criminals all
killing and kidnapping against the backdrop of a decades-long civil
conflict in which more than 300,000 people have died.
</P>
<P>
   But Gloria Zea, director of the Museum of Modern Art here,
believes that no matter the dangers, ``artists cannot evade their
moral and civic responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   So in an effort to provoke what she calls ``a profound and
unhurried meditation'' that can ``help change behaviors and habits
that impede civil discourse,'' her museum, the capital's most
prestigious, has organized the first systematic examination here of
``the scourge that has bled the country dry,'' as she puts it, in
an unsettling exhibition entitled ``Art and Violence in Colombia
Since 1948.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the show's dozen sections, spread over four floors,
addresses one specific manifestation of the violence that afflicts
this nation of 40 million people: torture, kidnappings and
disappearances, refugees, even ``The Mutilation of Corpses,'' as
one section is called. Some works are disturbingly graphic; others,
allegorical.
</P>
<P>
   There are oils, sculptures, etchings, photographs and
installations, including video displays. But all, regardless of
style or medium, have as their focus the barbarity, both
politically and drug-inspired, that is tearing this society apart.
</P>
<P>
   For Colombians, the decision to make 1948 the exhibition's
starting point is logical and needs no explanation. On April 9 of
that year, Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, the Liberal Party leader and the
front-running presidential candidate, was assassinated, an act that
touched off riots and a vicious civil war, known simply as ``La
Violencia,'' that continued on and off until 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The show's 50-year sweep is intended to provide historical
perspective, but it also permits the organizers to do something
else: chronicle the long and difficult search of Colombian artists
for a creative language of their own. An early work like Alejandro
Obregon's 1948 canvas ``The April 10 Massacre,'' for example, takes
the form of a conventional abstract, powerful in its portrayal of
destruction but still clearly derived from Picasso's ``Guernica.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Debora Arango's 1953 portrait of Gen. Gustavo Rojas
Pinilla, the military dictator who had just come to power in a
coup, resorts to the imagery of Hieronymous Bosch.
</P>
<P>
   But as the decades passed and violence became more embedded in
Colombian society, artists, particularly those who are now 35 to 50
years old and who have lived with savagery around them their entire
lives, began to experiment with form and technique and to find new
ways to express their anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started to put this exhibition together 18 months ago,
we intended to have 100 works by about 30 artists, with a focus on
older, established artists,'' said Alvaro Medina, the chief curator
of the show. ``But when we began to investigate, we found that more
younger artists than ever before are working this theme, and with
great forcefulness, so we have ended up with some 150 works by
about 50 different artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and viewers seem to have been especially moved by ``What
Was Left,'' a multimedia installation by Patricia Bravo, 33, a
artist from Medellin, a city notorious for its drug cartel and its
sicarios, or freelance assassins. In 1996, a year in which 4,675
people died violently in that city, Ms. Bravo went to the scene of
every bomb explosion and was allowed by the police to collect bits
and pieces of the debris.
</P>
<P>
   She then laminated the fragments onto 200 rectangular panels,
which were then mounted on three walls near the main entrance of
the museum. The objects are ordinary ones from daily life (buttons,
letters, a tape measure, ribbons, a child's homework, a first
communion card) but seem strangely totemic after being wrenched out
of context not once but twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is much like that of an archeologist, an effort to
document the relationship between human beings and their
surroundings at a particularly difficult historical and political
moment,'' Ms. Bravo said in an interview. ``I wanted these vestiges
of lives to be laminated and sealed so that they could be frozen in
time as a testimonial to this very violent epoch we are living
through.''
</P>
<P>
   In a four-minute video installation that has also drawn a strong
response, Juan Manuel Echavarria uses the destruction of a plate
belonging to Simon Bolivar as a metaphor for the national
experience. As an electronic dirge plays in the background, hammer
blows smash the platter, which is engraved with the motto
``Republic of Colombia Forever,'' into ever smaller pieces until
nothing is left but dust. The dust then metamorphoses into a pile
of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the message to be clear, so that you don't have to be
initiated into the world of art to understand this work,''
Echavarria said. ``I wanted people to feel an emotional as well as
an intellectual response, to show how Bolivar's dream has played
out, how Colombia is coming apart. I knew I had succeeded when one
of our former presidents came to me after he saw the exhibition and
said that my piece made his blood freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Echavarria, 50, is a novelist who took up photography four years
ago, he said, ``out of desperation and frustration, because I would
spend a month writing a page of fiction and not be able to find le
mot juste'' to describe the brutality going on. For one work,
``Florist's Cuttings,'' he photographed human bones and then, in
the manner of an 18th-century botanical expedition, labeled them in
Latin with the names of forms of torture that are commonly employed
here.
</P>
<P>
   Literally overpowering is another multimedia installation,
ironically entitled ``Musa Paradisiaca,'' a Latin phrase that means
``Heavenly Muse'' but that also refers to the scientific name for
the banana. In a dark room, Jose Alejandro Restrepo has hung
bunches of green bananas from the ceiling and attached them to
television screens. The screens broadcast recorded news reports of
clashes between government troops and guerrillas or attacks by
paramilitary forces on remote villages. In the small, enclosed
space, the smell of the bananas ripening is sickeningly sulphurous,
like the stench of death.
</P>
<P>
   Bananas also figure in Victor Laignelet's 1988 canvas ``Zone,''
a still-life that portrays two bunches of the fruit, one green, the
other blood-red. To Colombians, both works refer to the 1928
massacre of 1,000 striking banana workers, one of the most
traumatic events in modern Colombian history, and also the source
of a central episode in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel ``One
Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The show includes nothing, though, by the country's most
renowned artist, Fernando Botero, who lives in Italy in
self-imposed exile in part because of concerns for his own
security. But the 303-page catalog accompanying the exhibition
depicts three Botero works: an early 1949 canvas called ``Woman
Crying,'' a self-explanatory 1973 acrylic called ``The War'' and an
untitled 1978 depiction of two policemen beating a pedestrian with
nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To bring Botero's paintings back from overseas would have cost
us at least $15,000 in insurance, and we didn't have that kind of
money, because this is a moment of national crisis that finds most
of our usual sponsors doing quite badly economically,'' Medina
explained. ``So we didn't even ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalog, assembled by Medina and Ms. Zea, goes beyond
paintings, sculptures and installations to includes essays that
examine novels, plays and films that address the role of violence
in Colombian life.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also sponsored panel discussions and debates open
to the public, some of which have generated great controversy in
the politically charged atmosphere here.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the show opened, in mid-May, in fact, the museum
received telephone calls warning that curators would be killed
unless the exhibition was canceled. ``Nothing happened,'' Medina
said, ``but I have to admit that we were in a state of fear and
anxiety for a couple of days, and that when the news got out, some
school groups decided to cancel the visits they had planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such threats, more than 60,000 people saw the show
during its initial three-month run. As a result of the
extraordinary impact it has had, there are now plans to remount the
exhibition in at least two more Colombian cities. Medina said
similar offers had also been received from museums in Spain and
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main emotion I felt seeing this show was fear, both for
myself and for what has become of us as a society,'' said Claudio
Sanchez, 30, an art teacher who was visiting the show one Saturday
morning in July with two pupils. ``The more I saw, the more
frightened I became.''

 &HT;    Motion filed to bar UGA use of race
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ White female plaintiffs want a judge to order the
University of Georgia to halt immediately the consideration of race
in admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Tuesday, the women asked U.S. District Judge
B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah to issue an injunction against UGA.
If Edenfield agrees, the order would affect admissions decisions
for next year's freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   The motion is part of lawsuits that have been filed by four
women denied admission to UGA this school year. Their suit contends
UGA unconstitutionally discriminated against them by providing
preferences to male and African-American applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The motion asked Edenfeld to hold a hearing this month on an
injunction.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, UGA President Michael Adams said race would remain
a factor in evaluating some high school seniors who apply to UGA.
The university wants to be fair, accessible and representative of
the state's population, Adams said, explaining his reasons to
engage in a legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Adams stands by that position, UGA spokesman Tom Jackson said
Tuesday. ``How we admit and why we think it is important is well
known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of admitted students, including most of the
blacks accepted as freshmen, will be accepted solely on academics,
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   For a relatively small percentage of applicants, admissions
officials employ the Total Student Index. The index is a list of
several factors, including the minority status of an applicant,
that give added weight to the student's academic standing.
</P>
<P>
   An injunction would not be relevant until March, when Total
Student Index decisions are made, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Lee Parks, who represents the plaintiffs, noted
Tuesday that Edenfield gave UGA ``a clear indication on the
constitutional problems with the program. . . . It's important to
have this heard quickly so it doesn't affect another class.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks was referring to a ruling Edenfield issued in July in
which he said, ``UGA cannot constitutionally justify the
affirmative use of race in its admissions decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Parks said UGA is making admissions decisions
that ``overtly'' use race as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such racial quota systems and other racial favoritism is
unconstitutional,'' the motion said. ``(UGA's) present admissions
policy affords nonwhite applicants a huge preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Admissions decisions for the next school year are being made and
students are being notified on a ``rolling basis,'' the motion
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly, a need for immediate relief is present,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   UGA no longer uses gender in its admissions process. But Parks
asked Edenfeld to issue an order prohibiting its further use as
well. Otherwise, UGA will be free to return to its old ways, Parks
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office apparently is gearing up for
the legal battle. Last week, it hired as special assistant
attorneys general Mark Cohen, former Gov. Zell Miller's chief
counsel, and Mike Kaufman, both of the firm Troutman Sanders, and
Rodney Strong, the former director of the city of Atlanta's
minority business program.

INCREASING NUMBER OF WOMEN ARE ACCEPTING PAIN MEDICINE DURING
CHILDBIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More and more women are deciding that labor pain is a rite of
passage they can do without, and are gratefully accepting pain
medicine during childbirth, doctors reported on Tuesday at an
anesthesiology conference in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It is a development that pleases many doctors, who say that
women should not suffer needlessly during labor. But the trend
troubles some childbirth educators, midwives and other advocates of
natural childbirth, who say that young women who pass up the
opportunity to prevail over labor pain are missing out on one of
life's great transforming experiences, and needlessly exposing
themselves and their babies to the side effects of anesthetic
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the doctors said, the change is a result of
improvements that allow effective pain relief with much smaller
doses of anesthetic drugs and fewer side effects. There also
appears to be a relaxing of attitudes among women that the use of
anesthesia in labor is a sign of weakness or selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   From 1981 to 1997, there was a tripling of the percentage of
women in labor at large hospitals who had regional anesthesia _
spinal or epidural injections _to 66 percent from 22 percent. At
smaller hospitals, from 1992 to 1997, the percentage doubled, to 42
percent from 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Regional anesthesia numbs the pelvic region but does not affect
the mind, so patients remain fully aware and in control.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, from a survey of 750 hospitals around the United
States, were presented by Dr. Joy L. Hawkins, director of obstetric
anesthesia at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hawkins presented her findings on Tuesday at a meeting of
the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change comes from women going to childbirth education
classes, reading about the birth process, talking to
anesthesiologists and obstetricians and exploring their options so
they can make a decision about what they want,'' Dr. Hawkins said.
``And I think obstetricians are very comfortable now recommending
epidurals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, she said, many hesitated, out of fear that the
drugs would slow down a woman's labor, decrease her ability to push
and increase the likelihood that she would need a Caesarean.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is clearly not the case,'' Dr. Hawkins said. ``The
techniques we have are so safe and effective that it should come
down to what a woman needs to give herself the ideal birth
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Birnbach, director of obstetric anesthesiology at St.
Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, said that a major
change occurred about five years ago when doctors began to offer
patients ``walking epidurals,'' an injection of anesthetic into a
space near the spinal column that relieves pain but does not take
away sensation or the woman's ability to walk. The walking
epidurals use much less medication than earlier epidurals, which
did numb the legs and made it impossible to move them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our satisfaction rates are sky high,'' Birnbach said.
``Doctors and patients are both asking for it. Patients can enjoy
the birth experience. They can fully participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Birnbach said, only 10 percent of women giving
birth at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital had epidurals. Now, he said,
more than 90 percent do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York City, most of the hospitals now have 60 to 80
percent epidural rates,'' he said, adding that was typical of most
large cities. But rates tend to be lower in smaller communities,
where there may be fewer anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, we said drugs were dangerous and may be bad
for the baby,'' Birnbach said, adding that patients were told to
use breathing techniques and self-hypnosis to help them deal with
the pain, without drugs. ``The vast majority of women are in
extreme pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that anesthesia is safer, he said, women are telling their
doctors that they don't want to suffer the pain unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics still say that the use of epidurals can
lead to an increase in Caesarean sections, Birnbach said that at
his hospital, as the use of epidurals has continued to grow, the
Caesarean rate has dropped every year during the past five years,
to about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our obstetrician with the highest epidural rate has the lowest
Caesarean rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Epidural anesthesia for childbirth costs from $500 to $1,000,
and is covered by most insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epidurals sell themselves,'' Birnbach said.
</P>
<P>
   But what doctors call progress saddens those who favor natural
childbirth or childbirth without anesthesia. Ina May Gaskin,
president of the Midwives Alliance of North America, in Summertown,
Tenn., said, ``If you tap into the popular culture, there's a huge
fear of birth. Women are saying, `I've got to get my epidural.'
It's more acceptable, I think to the dismay of nurse midwives.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural childbirth is ``hugely empowering,'' Ms. Gaskin said.
``It's hard, yes, but we do things in life that are hard. We don't
shrink from them. After a natural birth, you have so much power you
feel you could do anything. Women go on being grateful for that
birth and will go on remembering it as a signal even in their lives
that changed them. If you cancel out the awareness of the body in
labor, you miss a lot of the ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaskin also said she did not think that women were fully
informed about the risks of epidurals. She said there was not
enough data about the newer, low-dose versions to determine whether
or not they impeded labor. In addition, she said, some women had
adverse reactions to the drugs or developed fevers from them that
led doctors to fear infection and to put newborn babies through
invasive tests to rule out infection.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hawkins said that the main complications from epidurals were
soreness at the injection site, a drop in blood pressure and a 1 in
200 chance of a headache. She said other problems were ``incredibly
rare.''

 &HT;    Appeal of Georgia death-row decision declined
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. Supreme Court let stand Georgia's refusal to
provide lawyers for death-row inmates who challenge their sentences
through civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the high court, without comment, declined to
consider the case of Exzavious Gibson. In 1996, Gibson became the
first prisoner in the modern history of the death penalty to be
denied a court-appointed lawyer in a habeas corpus lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Habeas lawsuits attack the constitutionality of sentences and
convictions after direct appeals are exhausted.
</P>

   Georgia is the only state in the country that does not provide
lawyers for death-row prisoners during this process. In February, a
deeply divided Georgia Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled that
prisoners have ``no state or federal constitutional right to an
appointed lawyer'' in habeas proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is now represented by lawyers from the Atlanta firm King
&AMP; Spalding. The American Bar Association, NAACP Legal Defense Fund
and the Southern Center for Human Rights filed briefs in support of
his U.S. Supreme Court petition.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of Gibson's habeas hearing indicated he had little
idea of what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Described as being borderline mentally retarded, Gibson told the
judge he did not know how to plead during a hearing that did not
require a plea. He offered no evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was ``one of the most unfair and one-sided
evidentiary hearings imaginable,'' Gibson's new lawyers, Joseph
Bankoff and Courtland Reichman, told the high court. ``The outcome
of this case, and those that are accumulating in its wake, is
shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, more than half _ 113 of 221 _ of Georgia's capital
cases affirmed by the state Supreme Court have been overturned
during habeas corpus review, the Southern Center for Human Rights
said in its brief to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is doubtful that the harmful errors in any of these cases
would have been detected and proven in the absence of counsel,''
the center's director, Stephen Bright, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was convicted in 1990 of killing Douglas Coley, an
Eastman, Ga., grocer.

AS UNESCO HOLDS JOB INTERVIEWS FOR TOP POST , 11 APPLY  
(DW)

 (ATTN: Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia, Saudia Arabia, Senegal,
Spain, Great Britain, Egypt, Japan, Trinidad and Tobago, The
Philippines, Hungary, France)   By ALAN RIDING

<P>
   PARIS _ In a cautious move toward greater openness, UNESCO's
executive board will hold job interviews on Wednesday for the post
of the organization's director general.
</P>
<P>
   No less unusual, all 11 candidates have been campaigning
publicly, creating the impression that for the first time
personality and ideas may be as important as back-room political
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Political maneuvering has of course not stopped, with some
countries and regions openly backing candidates and rumors flying
of ``checkbook'' lobbying by at least two governments. But the
quality of the contenders may become more relevant than in past
years when the 58-nation board votes in secret next week to pick a
successor to Federico Mayor Zaragoza of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The single candidate to be presented to UNESCO's 186-nation
general conference on Nov. 12 must win a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that although vote pledges were usually made only
for the first vote, it is possible that no winner will emerge from
the first four votes, on successive days, starting Monday. If that
happens, a runoff will be held between the two front-runners on
Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake is a six-year term to run a 2,326-member staff,
a $544 million annual budget and a mandate as broad as the
Paris-based organization's full name: the United Nations Education,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the new director general will also take over a UNESCO still
plagued by bureaucracy, inefficiency and nepotism and widely viewed
as urgently needing an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say UNESCO today is nonetheless a far cry from
the left-leaning talk shop that the United States and Britain
abandoned in frustration in 1985. Britain rejoined in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, with Amadou Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal as director
general, UNESCO became particularly identified with promotion of a
so-called new world information order, which was aimed at breaking
a perceived monopoly of Western news organizations and which
Western governments viewed as an attempt at global censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor, who has served two terms and is not seeking re-election,
immediately dropped that campaign and made some administrative
changes during his first term. But he has been increasingly
criticized in recent years, within the organization and among many
member governments, accused of being a tireless self-promoter and
of hiring friends and allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd left after one term, he'd have been hailed as an
excellent director general,'' one Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, eager to find a new director general more
answerable to UNESCO's members, the executive board instituted new
rules for picking a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, candidates had to register before Sept. 10 _ in the
past, they could be nominated during the voting process _ and each
had to write a 2,000-word essay with his or her vision of the job
and submit to a 30-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules brought some openness to the election process,
even though UNESCO's constitution still says candidates should be
nominated ``in confidence.'' As a result, apart from the customary
lobbying of UNESCO board members, the candidates have been giving
interviews _ and have set up their own Web sites _ with a view to
raising their public profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Serageldin, an Egyptian intellectual who is a vice
president of the World Bank, likes to describe himself as the
candidate of ``civic society'' and, as such, has been most active
in mobilizing outside support, with 43 Nobel Prize winners
endorsing his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ghazi Algosaibi, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to
London, has the Arab League's backing. Coming from a country with a
monarchical form of government, he has been eager to portray
himself as a poet and liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's ambassador to Paris, Koichiro Matsuura, starts with the
advantage that Japan is the largest contributor to UNESCO's budget,
to which he adds the promise of an efficient administration of
UNESCO. Gareth Evans, until recently Australia's foreign minister,
is a late candidate who is thought to enjoy considerable European
support. Neither Matsuura nor Evans is fluent in French, which may
be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   The next director general is widely expected to be one of those
four men, although seven other candidates will also have a chance
to make their pitch on Wednesday: Senake Bandaranaike, Sri Lanka's
ambassador to France; Ion Caramitru, Romania's culture minister;
Lawrence Carrington, a diplomat from Trinidad and Tobago; Daniel
Janicot, a French diplomat, currently UNESCO's deputy director
general; Rosario Manalo, the Philippines' deputy foreign minister;
Makaminan Makagiansar, Indonesia's delegate to UNESCO, and Pal
Pataki, a Hungarian diplomat.

   DALLAS _ When prom season comes next spring, the 200 or so
limousine companies in Dallas-Fort Worth will be busy _ and the
owners of two of them will be worried. Brad Goodbread of Truly
Texas Limousine is one of the concerned operators. Some of his
clients hire limousines for proms in Dallas, where he has to keep
an eye out _ so he won't be ticketed. ``I've been told that they've
got two people in Dallas who enforce the regulations, mainly during
prom season. They hang out at the hotels, watching to catch
somebody,'' he says. So far, Goodbread has been lucky. ``I guess I
just haven't been caught.'' The problem that Goodbread has with

BAPTIST FOUNDATION OF AMERICA PACKAGE &QL; 
 &QL; 
AFFINITY FRAUD (Phoenix) - It's a seductive thought _ give money to
a good cause, and get a good return. Most of the investors in the
Baptist Foundation of America were drawn to it because it was
``doing God's work.'' The sting of mismanagement is even stronger
when the organization that does you in ostensibly shares your
values, ethics or religion. And there are more and more shysters
and incompetents out there ready to prey on those who want their
investors to do good. We will talk to national experts in this
field, tying their comments to specifics about the BFA situation.

   SECURITIES (Phoenix) - TheArizona Corporation Commission
securities division is supposed to provide oversight. Yet there is
ample evidence that problems at the Baptist Foundation of America
were reported to the commission as early as seven years ago. Three
to four years ago, a major change in the board should've raised
eyebrows. Investors were being shown a 1997 prospectus as late as
this year. Yet the Corp Comm waited for the BFA to come to it with
a proposal to freeze its assets and clean house. Only then did the
Corp Comm begin its investigation in earnest. Who's watching out

financial disaster at the Baptist Foundation of America might take
two years, or more. This story should touch on the key factors in
this developing story: the concept of affinity fraud, the lack of
regulation, the long list of victims, not to mention the Baptist
Church itself. We'll investigate the civil cases already filed,

PAKISTAN COUP INTRUDES ON NUCLEAR-BAN DISCUSSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As US senators debated the fate of a nuclear test
ban treaty Tuesday, the government of a far-off nuclear power,
Pakistan, was overthrown in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   That the two events collided at the same hour sounded too
fantastical at first, the oddness of senators debating about
nuclear tests as the whiff of danger emerged in Pakistan, where
only last year the government followed India's nuclear tests with a
test of its own that defied the world.
</P>
<P>
   But as the day wore on, and as clever senators wove into their
test-ban speeches lines about the potential instability in
Pakistan, the uncertainties of the post-Cold-War world were laid
bare. Tuesday afternoon, Washington and Islamabad could have been
an opening chapter of a Tom Clancy novel.
</P>
<P>
   The two events were linked by subject, by timing, by the fears
raised in the nearly empty Senate chamber and the shots heard in
some Islamabad neighborhoods. Little was done to bridge the gulf,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the coup, the senators, reluctant to ratify a treaty
to ban nuclear testing, may have been sending the wrong signal to
nuclear newcomers such as Pakistan and India. And despite the
Pakistani situation and the ominous move by neighboring India to
put its soldiers on high alert, senators gave no chance to revive
the all-but-dead ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the events in South Asia turned the Senate debate into more
than a theoretical exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Now there was an unfolding internal crisis of a country with a
nuclear bomb that borders another country with a nuclear bomb, with
both countries sharing a history of enmity. They had fought three
wars prior to their back-to-back nuclear tests last year, and
Clinton intervened earlier this year to get Pakistan's prime
minister to withdraw troops from the disputed Kashmir _ an act that
enraged Pakistani military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious question was what would happen next in Pakistan
and India, and what the US government should do to try to stabilize
the situation. In South Asia, some worried that the lack of US
ratification for ending nuclear tests added another element of
danger to an unpredictable situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everything is uncertain in Pakistan,'' said Sugata Bose, a
Calcutta native and professor of diplomacy at the Fletcher School
of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ``I have been worried
ever since the nuclear tests of last year, and today's development
adds to the worries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bose, who returned to Boston on Friday after spending nearly two
weeks in India to watch the electoral campaign, said the
``Republican opposition to the test ban treaty hasn't helped in
India or Pakistan. It's been a contributory factor to this kind of
uncertainty and instability. If the US had ratified it, it would
have focused the minds of India and Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   In his discussions with some members of India's new government,
Bose said he ``heard from many people, `Why should we waste our
time debating this issue when the US doesn't seem to be prepared to
ratify?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Islamabad, General Pervez Musharraf said the military seized
power after Sharif's government ``systematically destroyed'' state
institutions and drove the economy toward collapse. The ouster came
hours after Sharif tried to fire the general, but Sharif's
unpopularity had been rising in the military following orders to
withdraw militants from Kashmir and to aid the hunt for terrorist
Osama bin-Laden.
</P>
<P>
   With Sharif ousted, President Clinton loses an ally in his
efforts to help stabilize relations between India and Pakistan. In
addition, Musharraf is viewed with great suspicion in India and
believed by some government leaders as an instigator of the Kashmir
conflict earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, halfway around the world, some US senators cited the
Pakistani coup as proof that the test ban treaty should be
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense for us to consider what's happening around the
world,'' said Senator Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat and ranking
minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said Senate action on the treaty ``does have impact upon''
the Pakistani situation. Without Senate ratification, ``we lose any
leverage we would have to impose upon the Pakistanis'' to stop
nuclear tests, Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans, both moderate and conservative, said the
flaws of the treaty were too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, which has been ratified by 26 of the 44 nuclear
powers and needs ratification of all 44 before going into force,
calls for the creation of an organization that will conduct on-site
inspections of nuclear weapons. The organization also will keep
watch for any nuclear tests through ground vibrations, air sampling
and infrasound tests.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to the US stockpile of weapons? That has been
the main concern of Republican senators, who stated the treaty
would put the United States at risk by not allowing tests.
</P>
<P>
   The United States voluntarily has not tested its nuclear
missiles since the early 1990s, and instead embarked on a $4.5
billion program to monitor the stockpiles. Scientists debate the
degree of erosion from the aging of the missiles, but no one
disagrees that some components of nuclear weapons degrade over
time. Of particular concern are non-nuclear parts on missiles, such
as fuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I certain that if we fired missiles that all the missiles
would go off? No,'' said Theodore A. Postol, professor of national
security policy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``There's
always uncertainty. . . . But the question is, would you rather
live in a world of uncertainty where you have a test ban treaty, or
live in a world where you don't have a treaty. My view is the world
with the test ban is a better world to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Postol said the Pakistani situation underscores the need for
stricter measures guarding against the use of nuclear power _ not
just in Pakistan, but in every nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be very concerned about the long-range situation
in Russia,'' he said. ``And I think the problems of India and
Pakistan are particularly significant right now because you have
two nuclear weapons states bordering each other with deep
unresolved conflicts and a history of war.''

 &HT;    Bradley concentrates on California high-tech sector,
independents
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before unveiling his health care plan here two
weeks ago, Democrat Bill Bradley warmed up his crowd with some
basketball humor.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson, a New York Knick
teammate, hadn't come West to make the Lakers NBA champions,
Bradley deadpanned. ``He came here because he is part of my
southern California presidential strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, back in California to raise money this week, needs all
the help he can get. With 434 delegates to the Democratic
nominating convention, the most in the country, California is the
Big Kahuna of the 2000 sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   But no where does Bradley's outsider campaign for president face
bigger obstacles, the latest hurdle being the expected AFL-CIO
endorsement of Vice President Al Gore today .
</P>
<P>
   Though unions are sagging elsewhere, California's 1.5 million
union members accounted for 29 percent of the state electorate in
1998, compared to 22 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is also pushing up against the full weight of the state
Democratic Party, which was energized in 1998 with the landslide
victory of Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every state or federal elected Democratic office
holder, from Davis on down, has endorsed Gore. The enthusiasm for
Gore, who made his 60th trip here as vice president this week,
extends to local activists, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many of us, Bradley is an unknown quantity,'' says Elton
Hall, president of the Conejo Valley Democratic Club near Los
Angeles. ``With Gore you've heard speech after speech....People are
tired of dog and pony shows. They want to see substance and Gore
has really laid out his positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also isn't benefiting from voter disaffection with
President Clinton, one of his primary appeals elsewhere. Clinton
and Gore are both popular in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is booming,'' says Keith Umemoto, a former
chairman of the state party's Asian &AMP; Pacific Islander caucus.
``Why sever that?''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the disadvantage he faces among Democratic loyalists,
Bradley has centered his California campaign around an appeal to
workers in the booming technology sector. He is using the Internet
to enlist ``thousands'' who follow the campaign through e-mail,
according to state director Gale Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it is a lot to overcome,'' said Kaufman of Gore's
edge. ``My hope is we get a lot of people ... who have not been
working on campaigns before. That's where the energy comes from,
and there is no monopoly on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy appears to have paid off in fund-raising. In the
first half of 1999, Bradley raised $2 million in California,
compared to Gore's $2.2 million. Bradley's donors include Hollywood
celebrities Dustin Hoffman and Michael Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of California's open primary on March 7, however,
both help and hurt Bradley. Only registered Democratic voters count
toward picking convention delegates. If Bradley captures
independents or even Republicans in the primary, they won't help
him win delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But delegates are allocated proportionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-loser for Bradley,'' says Bob Mulholland an
advisor to the state party. ``You can leave the state a distant
second and still head to the convention with 100 delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   With its ethnically diverse electorate, California has become
the epitome of interest-group politics. Ethnic minorities now
outnumber whites in California, according to the latest estimates,
and California's Latino voters -- 14 percent of the electorate --
are generating new political energy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has aggressively courted Latinos and has the endorsement of
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. Gore has also been courting
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Huffman, a national party member, arranged for Gore to
meet about 70 African-American leaders last month. Bradley taught
at Stanford University after he left the Senate in 1997. He has
made two major campaign trips here. And he hopes strong showings in
Iowa and New Hampshire will give him momentum in California and
other early primary states.

 &HT;    Bauer taps Atlantan to chair his campaign
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer on
Tuesday named Atlanta businessman Ronald Blue his new national
campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Blue replaces Charles Jarvis, who left Bauer's campaign amid
concernthat Bauer was spending too much time behind closed doors
with a young, single woman.
</P>
<P>
   Blue has known Bauer for 15 years through their work on
conservative family values issues. He said he examined Jarvis'
concerns and found them without merit. ``Several of us . . . sat
down and looked at the facts and said this is all smoke, there's no
fire there at all,'' Blue said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, now an adviser to GOP candidate Steve Forbes, never
publicly accused Bauer of having an affair, which Bauer in any case
denied. His aides feared the tumult would damage his campaign among
the religious conservatives whose support he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Blue said his experience as a financial planner and investment
manager did not prepare him for politics. ``As a businessman,
things run with structure and organization and have processes in
place,'' he said. ``Political campaigns, in my experience so far,
seem to run from crisis to crisis. Things tend to get distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue, 57, said he will serve in an advisory capacity and will
remain with his business, Ronald Blue and Co., in Atlanta. Bauer's
campaign is his first involvement in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Blue had been serving as Bauer's finance chairman. ``The thing
that has pleased me is Gary's ability to raise money, especially
from small donors,'' Blue said.
</P>
<P>
   While paying homage to the fund-raising powerhouse of George W.
Bush's campaign, Blue said Bauer has enough money to remain in the
game. ``You never know what's going to happen in politics,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blue is on the board of the Family Research Council, the family
values group Bauer led until he decided to run for president.

SPORTS  COLUMN : RESPECT IS NOT A BASEBALL ISSUE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They were caught in an apparently fatal tail spin only
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were shunted by Major League Baseball to the late, late
show to satisfy an arriviste franchise out west.
</P>
<P>
   They have been denigrated by their manager as not among the
brightest of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bizarre If Not Amazing Mets have returned to where the
craziness all began.
</P>
<P>
   Last evening they were due to play the Braves in the first game
of the National League championship series with a gathering
rainstorm threatening to disrupt matters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were back in Turner Field, insisting that they are not
the same becalmed outfit that lost three straight to the Braves
here, then three straight in Philadelphia, then two of three to the
Braves in New York. Some of the Mets have acted as if those numbers
were invented. They actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did not get respect from baseball, which put its first
two games on at 11 p.m., beyond the reach of younger fans. It is
all well and good for Commissioner Bud Selig to say they
``agonized'' over the decision. The fact is, they did it.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, baseball lucks out again, with East Coast teams,
four storied franchises with great angles no matter who wins.
Atlanta-Boston? There are old curmudgeons up in Boston who haven't
gone to a game since the Braves left town. They would go out and
cheer Chipper Jones as if he were Bob Elliott reincarnated.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mets, so much has happened to them since their slump
that it almost seems like another age. The manager has had his mood
swings _ often within seconds of each other _ from fatalistic to
antagonistic to grandiose. The players have failed in the clutch
and performed in the clutch. Still, the Mets are with us.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Braves' superiority have any carryover in this series?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I hope none of that comes into play,'' Bobby
Valentine said last night. ``But it's probably some factor there
that you have to factor in. I heard Joe Torre said, `You're
supposed to rip up what happened in the past once you get to these
playoffs.' I like that statement a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the baseball fact of life that good pitching
stops good hitting, as proven by the way Pedro Martinez of Boston
shut down the slugging Indians when he materialized in the middle
of another slugfest in the deciding American League game Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding like McGuire in the movie, ``The
Graduate,'' who pompously intoned that the future lay in plastics,
one could solemnly state that the future of any given playoff
series lies in pitching. The high level of
Maddux-Millwood-Glavine-Smoltz could shut down a hot streak in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a great deal of talk generated by Valentine, who
has had it both ways, saying the Braves do not respect the Mets,
then noting that the Braves have no need to respect the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially silly business because ``respect'' is really
something out of the contact sports, the kind of thing Pat Riley or
Bill Parcells would tell their troops to inspire them to throw
their bodies around.
</P>
<P>
   Respect is really not a baseball concept. There could be all
kinds of respect, but when a Martinez starts bending his pitches
around the sharp corners of a strike zone, what's respect got to do
with it?
</P>
<P>
   The players are all in the same union, and it shows. The hang
around the batting cage and chat with each other _ and why not?
They could be changing sides, voluntarily, in the next year or two,
so why antagonize a future teammate or a current lodge member?
</P>
<P>
   Just a glimpse of the batting cage before last Saturday's game
between the Yankees and Texas showed a dozen Hispanic players from
both sides chatting among themselves. When the game began, the
players would do their best to beat each other, but there was no
missing the pride and respect ball players generally have for each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's acerbic comments may reflect the tensions he
generates. Other players and managers tend to get huffy when he is
mentioned, so he broadens it into a general condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke, a joke, the lack-of-respect angle,'' Bobby Cox,
the Braves' manager, said Monday. ``I don't know where that came
from. They've got our respect. They have a lot of good players on
that team and they're good guys. I like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have survived their low moments. Here they are, with a
chance to win back some of the perceived loss of respect, external
or internal.

GENERAL WHO LED COUP IN PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS `POLITICAL' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (With PAKISTAN-COUP, PAKISTAN-REAX) 
(mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pervaiz Musharraf, the Pakistani general who ousted the civilian
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was an unlikely
coup-maker because he appeared to be an apolitical officer who took
over the army at a time when military coups seemed to be a thing of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   He replaced a man who had political ideas and who was pushed
aside largely because he did. Musharraf, 58, on the other hand, had
been a military officer for 35 years, and he had spent his career
as a field officer _ a soldier's soldier _ rather than in the
centers of political power.
</P>
<P>
   An artillery officer with commando experience, Musharraf, with
his scholar's rimless glasses, took over as Pakistan's chief of
army staff only a year ago, after the resignation of a predecessor
who had suggested resurrecting a broader role for the military in
national policy-making. Sharif had succeeded in curtailing military
impunity through a change in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after fending off rumors that a military coup
might be imminent, Musharraf won a two-year extension of his
appointment. He also won a pledge of support from Sharif. No reason
was given publicly for the dismissal of Musharraf on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cohen, an expert on the Indian and Pakistani military at
the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that Musharraf seemed
an unlikely ``political'' general in the mold of other Pakistani
officers who have seized power in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect he is going to want to get out of power as quickly
as he can,'' Cohen said in an interview. ``This is not his kind of
thing. He's regarded as a good professional soldier by his
colleagues. He is not regarded as a great strategic thinker like
most special forces people. He has a narrow focus on things.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf, who was decorated for service in the 1965 war with
India, is a graduate of the Pakistani Command and Staff College at
Quetta and also studied at military institutions in Britain. He has
commanded an infantry brigade and artillery regiments as well as
serving in various commando battalions.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New Delhi, India, in August 1943, then migrated
to Pakistan with his family and lived as a child in the port city
of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Pakistan's army in 1964 and served in an artillery
regiment after training in the well-known military academy of Kakul
in North West Frontier Province.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he fought Indian troops in the Khem Karan sector in
Punjab province during the 16-day war with India, taking part in
intense battles for which he received a medal for gallantry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, when Pakistan again went to war with India, Musharraf
was a member of the elite military Special Services Group of
commandos.
</P>
<P>
   He has also commanded an infantry division and a strike corps
and has received a number of military decorations.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on the faculty of the Command and Staff College in
Quetta and of the war wing of the National Defense College.
</P>
<P>
   As a lieutenant general, his last key posting came in 1995 when
he became a commander in Mangla in Punjab, an important military
area close to the border with India.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed army chief in October 1998 after the
resignation of former military chief general Jehangir Karamat, who
stepped down after making remarks seen critical of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about his personal life. He is known to have a
son and daughter, both of whom are married.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Musharraf may have seized the moment of his
dismissal to respond as much to civilian frustration with an
ineffective government as to festering army resentment at Sharif's
withdrawal in July of support for a Himalayan border war with
India.
</P>
<P>
   With an economy in shambles and continuing violence among ethnic
minorities and Shia and Sunni Muslims, the military under Musharraf
decided this spring to support militants who had crossed into
India, only to have army support abruptly withdrawn by Sharif under
pressure from Washington in July, said Sumit Ganguly, a visiting
fellow specializing in South Asia at the center for International
Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the mountain region called Kargil was a popular
campaign in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Benazir Bhutto, who was twice dismissed as prime minister for
corruption and misuse of power, has been actively campaigning
against Sharif in the West, where she lives in exile to avoid an
arrest warrant in Pakistan. On Tuesday, in an interview on CNN
International, Ms. Bhutto was very complimentary toward Musharraf
and said that she was eager to return to Pakistan and take part in
another election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Musharraf was my director general of military operations,''
she said. ``He wasn't a cleric. He was a professional soldier and I
thought that he was very courageous and brave. He'd been a
commando, and a person who is a commando can take tremendous risks
and think afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Tuesday that they were uncertain where the fault
lines lay in the Pakistani military after the army takeover.
Clearly Musharraf had considerable support if soldiers loyal to him
were able to reject Sharif's order of dismissal and move into
positions around important government installations in Islamabad
before the general had returned to the country from a visit to Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   In his television address early Wednesday in Pakistan, Musharraf
accused Sharif of trying to create dissension within the army for
political reasons. And, speaking in English, he made this pledge:
``Your armed forces have never and shall never let you down.''

HARVARD TO PAY MILLIONS IN WORKER SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Harvard University has agreed to pay millions
of dollars in back pay and benefits to 300 to 500 employees who
were misclassified as casual workers.
</P>
<P>
   The university also will offer a significant number of workers
from the group both full-time employment and monetary compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Tuesday by Harvard and the 3,600-member
Harvard Union of Clerical &AMP; Technical Workers, comes two months
after the university publicly acknowledged misclassifying the
workers, despite a union contract requiring that after three months
on the job casual employees must be reclassified as full-time. That
contract, as well as a longstanding university policy, defines a
casual employee as anyone who works less than 17.5 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Taylor, general counsel and vice president of Harvard, said
the total payout would be ``in the millions, but exactly how much
no one knows at this time . . . This is a creative solution, a fair
solution, and an imaginative solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Union president Adrienne Landau said she was ``encouraged'' by
Harvard's willingness to fix the problem. ``We were able to be our
usual tenacious, but highly civil, selves because the university
recognized that this was an important issue,'' she said, ``and it
knew this agreement was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Union director Bill Jaeger, who helped draft the agreement,
described the measure as ``an approximation'' of the benefits and
pay workers have lost since 1995. He acknowledged that while a
handful of workers had been on the casual or contingent list
longer, a compromise was reached to cover four years because a
majority of the workers had been denied the benefits of full-time
employment within that period. Jaeger added that the university had
some concerns about the challenge of recreating old pay and
compensation records.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, the rate of pay for these workers was not
regulated. So, they received substandard pay,'' said Jaeger. ``They
were also shut out of a comprehensive benefits package.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, compensation will be based on a formula
that assesses the number of hours a casual employee worked, as well
as length of service, dating back the four years when, Jaeger said,
the bulk of the violations occurred. Jaeger said compensation would
vary from a lump sum of about $250 to a maximum of $12,000 that
will paid to workers over three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we tried to push (the time period) back as far as
possible to make this right for as many people as possible,''
Jaeger added. ``So this was a compromise. To my mind, it was a good
and fair compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of misclassification of temporary or casual workers
has been pushed to the forefront in recent years by high-tech
workers and by professional employees who claim they were kept on
projects for years, without benefits or job security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a federal study found that 29 percent of some 1.3
million temporary employees had been at the same job for a year or
longer, up from 25 percent of 1.1 million temporary workers in
1995. Such workers, often described as perma-temps, have been the
focus of a number of highly publicized lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud of this (agreement),'' said Taylor. ``There
certainly has been activity in the legal world surrounding this
issue, but (Harvard) is one of the first employers to say, `We're
going to belly up to the bar and address it.' ''

AMERICAN LEAGUE MATCHUPS _ REDSOX VS. YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; YANKEES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees rested for three days after sweeping the Texas
Rangers in the division series, giving Manager Joe Torre plenty of
time to line up his rotation. Orlando Hernandez goes in Game 1, and
whether he is 64 or 24, Hernandez will be a challenge for the
Boston hitters: El Duque has demonstrated a penchant for big games,
having generated an 0.41 earned run average in his first three
postseason starts. David Cone pitches in Game 2 and is scheduled to
throw Game 6 _ both of which are to be played in Yankee Stadium _
and though he was inconsistent in the last months of the regular
season, he was always good at home. His ERA of 1.90 in Yankee
Stadium was the best home mark in the American League this season.
Roger Clemens will throw Game 3 _ and Game 7, if necessary, with
Andy Pettitte in Game 4. Mariano Rivera, the closer, hasn't allowed
a run since July 21. The Yankees' biggest concern now is the
effectiveness of those five pitchers (Mike Stanton, Allen Watson,
Ramiro Mendoza, Hideki Irabu and Cone) who did not work in the
first round. Stanton and Mendoza, in particular, are more effective
with regular game action. Stanton hasn't pitched since Oct. 2,
Mendoza since Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had an efficient attack in the division series
against Texas, scoring 14 runs in three games, and again they
showed the patience that is the foundation of their offense,
forcing the Texas starters to go deep into pitch counts and tire in
the middle innings. That strategy won't be as effective against the
Red Sox, except when Pedro Martinez pitches, because the Boston
manager, Jimy Williams, is quick to call on his relievers when Bret
Saberhagen and Ramon Martinez pitch. Paul O'Neill is going to try
to play in spite of his broken rib, but he really doesn't feel as
if it affects his swing as much as it does his defense. Chuck
Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, Darryl Strawberry and Bernie Williams all
are swinging the bat well, and Ricky Ledee seems poised for a
breakout. Joe Girardi, who would be the starting catcher in four of
the seven games, batted .367 with runners in scoring position, and
something always seems to be happening when he's hitting: He's the
most likely Yankee to drop a sacrifice bunt and to attempt a
hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE:
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's status will have a significant impact on the Yankees'
defense. If his injury forces him to the bench, then Torre will
play either Ledee or Shane Spencer in right field, and while
Spencer might have more experience in right than Ledee, neither is
as good as O'Neill. Right field in Fenway Park might be the most
difficult outfield position in all of baseball, with its low,
curving fence from right field to right-center, and its huge
expanse. Bernie Williams played terrifically in center in the
division series, Chuck Knoblauch's throwing problems were no
problem, and the Rangers never had enough runners to try to exploit
the inability of the Yankees' starters to hold potential
base-stealers.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BASES:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees did not attempt a single stolen base in the series
against Texas, a reflection of Ivan Rodriguez's throwing ability,
as well as the Yankees' passiveness in base-stealing situations.
Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, almost uniformly sends runners
from first, or first and second, when the count is 3 balls and 1
strike or 3-2 with less than two outs, and he does like to
hit-and-run with Girardi and Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   X-FACTOR:
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill took batting practice Tuesday under the scrutiny of
about 20 cameramen and 100 reporters. Every move he makes will be
examined, dissected, and if his injury appears to cause him any
distress and affect his swing, his base-running or his defense, the
Red Sox surely will look to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RED SOX &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PITCHING:
</P>
<P>
   Boston essentially has two separate staffs _ Pedro Martinez, and
the rest. When Martinez pitches, a reliever or two might be
required for the last few outs; when Martinez doesn't pitch,
everybody is available, and Manager Jimy Williams has shown a
willingness to use anybody at any time. Williams went to his
bullpen 16 times in the five-game series against the Cleveland
Indians. His bullpen might be void of stars, but it is deep and
versatile, and the relievers are all accustomed to pitching in any
situation. Derek Lowe throws a hard, sinking fastball and generated
3.17 groundballs for every fly ball, an extraordinary ratio. Rich
Garces was 5-1 with a 1.55 earned run average in 30 appearances in
the regular season, throwing fastballs and breaking balls. Rheal
Cormier is left-handed _ the only left-hander in the Boston bullpen
_ and this year, he held left-handed hitting opponents to a .198
batting average; Williams figures to save him for Paul O'Neill,
Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez in the late innings. Bryce Florie
throws sinkers, Tom Gordon fastballs and curves and Pat Rapp will
try to spot his pitches. Ramon Martinez, the Game 2 starter, is
recovering from shoulder surgery, and from one start to the next,
the Red Sox aren't sure if he'll have his good fastball and
command.
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSE:
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox do not really hit for a high average, as do the
Texas Rangers. They don't have the power of the Indians, the
Seattle Mariners or the Yankees. They had the fewest stolen bases
of any team in the league, and their average of 3.70 pitches per
plate appearance is mediocre for a contending team. They drew more
than 100 fewer walks than the Yankees. Nomar Garciaparra, their
shortstop, might be the only name from their lineup vaguely
recognizable to casual fans who will be watching. But they are a
dangerous team, their confidence apparent in the production they
generated and the swings they took against the Indians. Jason
Varitek, the catcher, is aggressive and confident at the plate, and
John Valentin smashed three home runs in two games against the
Indians. Mike Stanley is always dangerous, and Troy O'Leary broke
out of a slump with two home runs and seven RBIs in Game 5 against
Cleveland, after the Indians intentionally walked Garciaparra twice
to get to him.
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE:
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is among the best shortstops in baseball, and
Varitek is _ to use a scout's phrase _ empathetic with pitchers,
which is to say that he will draw the best out of his battery
mates. The rest of the Boston infield is poor, the second baseman
Jose Offerman weak at turning double plays, Valentin's range at
third greatly reduced by injuries and Mike Stanley adept at digging
balls out of the dirt at first but rangeless. The Boston outfield
is strong, with O'Leary comfortable playing the Green Monster in
Fenway Park, Darren Lewis capable of covering lots of ground in
center and Trot Nixon solid in right field. Opposing teams have had
success running against Pedro Martinez, swiping 21 bases in 31
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE BASES:
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Red Sox movement on the bases comes with hit-and-run
plays, and when runners are on the move with full counts. They had
the fewest steals in the league, with Jose Offerman (18 steals) and
Garciaparra (14) responsible for about half of those.
</P>
<P>
   X-FACTOR:
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Red Sox have no chance. The Yankees' pitchers are
rested, in line, their offense is more potent, they are rich with
postseason experience, and in the late innings, they have
baseball's best reliever, Mariano Rivera, who can enter in the
eighth and finish a game. But there's something strange about this
Red Sox team, some mystical weirdness following them. They are
playing hard, playing well, and they are not afraid of the Yankees,
having won eight of 12 games from them during the regular season.
If you believe in The Curse of the Bambino, then you might believe
that because the Red Sox won the first World Series of the century,
they are destined to win the last.

DISCO LIVES! ACTUALLY, IT NEVER DIED

<P>
   When the staged version of ``Saturday Night Fever'' opens on
Thursday at the Minskoff Theater, it should, by rights, look as
quaint as the 1950s of ``Grease'' did in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the movie released in 1977, marked the
apogee of disco, a lucrative moment in pop that quickly generated a
backlash, a record-business crash and a widespread repudiation.
Twenty years is the usual nostalgia gap, the time it takes for fond
memory to replace the embarrassment of succumbing to a long-gone
trend; hence the Broadway-bound ``Saturday Night Fever,'' despite
negative reviews of its London production.
</P>
<P>
   But while there's plenty of nostalgia attached to disco, the
music doesn't seem distant. In all but name, the disco era never
ended. Only the haircuts are obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Dance music, disco's current alias, still fills clubs from here
to Tokyo, and the disco beat, that steady thump that disk jockeys
call four-on-the-floor, is still the music's common denominator,
unsubtle but supremely effective. Disco songs from the late 1970s
are all over movie soundtracks, period or not. And beyond its
persistence as dance music, disco has stayed current in more
stealthy ways.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything that was initially reviled in disco _ its
monotonous rhythm, its gimmicky sounds, its disposability, its
superficiality, its emphasis on physical function over literary
meaning, its notion of music as pure dumb fun, not to mention its
gay undercurrents _ has become entrenched in the pop mainstream,
from the Backstreet Boys to Mary J. Blige to Ricky Martin to Beck.
Disco, once mocked for being shallow and synthetic, has turned into
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, disco rose fast and burned out faster. The music had
been percolating since the mid-1970s at gay men's parties and
clubs, where disk jockeys sought out uptempo soul songs that pulled
people onto the dance floor. They favored a more basic beat than
the crafty, jumpy rhythms of great early-1970s funk, and they
appreciated singers who were melodramatic to the point of
campiness; they also liked instrumental passages and interludes of
pure rhythm that they could stretch out (using two copies on two
turntables) to keep people moving.
</P>
<P>
   As disco taste grew focused, producers working out of basement
studios and selling albums from the trunks of their cars started
catering to the new niche. Major labels followed, pushing songs
onto the radio and up from the gay underground. The disco beat
became premeditated rather than fortuitous: four-on-the-floor,
saved from tedium by syncopated bass lines and sparks from Latin
percussion. But it was also cosmopolitan, embracing European
electronics, funk rhythm guitar, big-band arrangements and carnival
beats.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, disco became glamorous. It was the music of the jet
set, cordoned off behind velvet ropes for the fashion elite in New
York clubs like Studio 54, yet as accessible as a record store or a
radio for those who wanted to fantasize.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it generated an angry reaction from some of the people
outside the ropes: blue-jeaned rock fans who wanted to see their
music as natural, authentic and handmade.
</P>
<P>
   Long after ``Pet Sounds'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' staked out the recording studio as a place to create
illusions, most rock still hid the artifices of recording and tried
to make songs sound like bigger, better versions of concert
performances. But disco, as its name declared, made the recording
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The music had to sound good from the turntable, not the stage
(where most disco performers ended up singing along with their
taped studio tracks). It was made to be canned, and no one
pretended otherwise. Rock had spent a decade insisting it was art,
not an act, and then disco called its bluff.
</P>
<P>
   Disco challenged rock's star system, which counted on fans'
loyalty for the length of a performer's career. Dancers were
attached only to the song and the beat, listening to the invisible
voice hired to front the band but not curious about its past or
future.
</P>
<P>
   Disco had haphazard effects on careers. Except for a handful of
performers like Donna Summer, who managed to escape facelessness,
disco was a world of one-hit wonders, while true fans learned to
follow producers like Giorgio Moroder or Nile Rodgers or Gamble and
Huff. With the right beat and the right song, disco offered a way
for minorities and pop outcasts _ blacks, Hispanics, gays, older
singers, fat singers _ to be heard, however briefly, in the
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Disco revived the fortunes of vocal groups like the Trammps and
the Manhattans, but it sandbagged the best 1970s funk bands like
the Meters, whose music was compulsively danceable but not
rudimentary enough for disco use. It was one of rock's periodic
simplifications, a dark ages for rhythm even as more fans decided
that they should be dancing. It took some time before dance-music
producers figured out how to rebuild some of what had been thrown
away.
</P>
<P>
   Disco was denounced as formulaic, mechanical, contrived,
forgettable: all true, but all irrelevant as lights flashed and
mirror-balls rotated. Actually, there was plenty of variety in
disco, which made hits out of songs as diverse as the Cameroonian
funk of Manu Dibango's ``Soul Makossa,'' Thelma Houston's
gospel-charged ``Don't Leave Me This Way,'' the ditsy pop novelty
of A Taste of Honey's ``Boogie Oogie Oogie,'' the orchestrated soul
of the O'Jays' ``Use ta Be My Girl'' and the severe minimalism of
Kraftwerk's ``Trans-Europe Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after disco became a fixed commercial genre, some bands,
like Chic and Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, still tried to
slip ideas and ironies onto the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   With groups like the Village People dispensing gay-culture
double entendres, disco represented an unspoken detente between
straight and gay styles: don't ask, don't tell, just dance. The
love story in the ``Saturday Night Fever'' movie gave disco a
heterosexual face and insisted that, yes, straight men could dance
to it.
</P>
<P>
   With the reassuring, white-suited images of John Travolta and
the three Brothers Gibb, the ``Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack
album _ part Bee Gees, part best-of-disco compilation _ became the
all-time best-selling album until Michael Jackson's ``Thriller''
came along in 1982. Rock stars like David Bowie and the Rolling
Stones were already putting on the disco thump like a new polyester
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   But as disco radio stations appeared and the recording business
jumped on the disco bandwagon, listeners outsmarted merchants. They
realized that most disco songs were about as durable as the
one-night stands that started on the dance floor, and that it was
more sensible (and cheaper) to keep up with the latest songs on the
radio, or in the clubs, than to collect them.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies saw sales plummet from 726.2 million albums,
singles and tapes in 1978 to 575.6 million in 1982; the Grammy
Award category for Best Disco Recording lasted exactly one year
(won by Gloria Gaynor's ``I Will Survive'') before it was quietly
terminated. Diehard rockers thought they had won the war of style,
and cued up ``Stairway to Heaven'' one more time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know. Disco had shown people a good time again,
free of rock's earnestness. It was a return to utilitarian music,
doing its job with as little pretension as a pop-up toaster, and it
was a harbinger of pop's increasing specialization. Punk, which
arose around the same time, acquired the monopoly on rock's noisy,
rebellious impulses, but disco grabbed the franchise for physical
pleasures and party fun, not something the pop audience wanted to
renounce.
</P>
<P>
   While mid-1970s disco hits now conjure a pre-AIDS age of
hedonism, explaining their popularity as soundtrack tunes, the 4/4
thump has survived as a pop mating signal.
</P>
<P>
   Disco had also suggested, at its best moments, a zone of
dance-floor democracy where class, race and sexual preference
didn't matter (though youth and beauty did). It was a plastic
utopia, but it was still a nice place to visit, and dancers and
listeners still did.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1980s, the primitive synthesizers and drum machines
that had been embraced by disco producers grew more complex and
flexible, allowing the music to grow ever more mechanized and less
realistic, an excursion into a sonic neverland.
</P>
<P>
   Styles jelled and acquired their own names with accelerating
specialist snobbery: electro, hi-N.R.G., Latin freestyle, house,
techno. Even industrial rock, brandishing punk attitude and
dystopian science-fiction concepts, was steady-thumping canned
music for use on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Punk-era rockers like Blondie and Talking Heads allowed
themselves to use four-on-the-floor after the declared death of
disco; performers in all sorts of genres let their songs reappear
as remixes with a steady dance beat. Through her rise in the 1980s,
Madonna never tagged herself as disco, but her music bubbled out of
clubs to reach the pop charts, and her appreciative scanning of gay
culture (leading to her appropriation of rituals like voguing) made
her the disco queen of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The disk jockeys' judgment that music could, and should, still
be manipulated after it was recorded _ in dance-floor segues and
overlays and in extended, rhythm-happy remixes _ was not about to
be forgotten. It surfaced quickly at the block parties in the South
Bronx where hip-hop was being born.
</P>
<P>
   Disk jockeys toyed with funk records and current disco hits; the
bass line for Chic's ``Good Times'' resurfaced on the first hit rap
record, the Sugar Hill Gang's ``Rapper's Delight'' in 1979. With
disco and hip-hop, the seeming permanence of recordings was
thoroughly destabilized; there would always be the possibility of
another version, another mix.
</P>
<P>
   Because it existed primarily as canned music, disco easily
anticipated the music-video era. Nearly every band that wants a hit
now has to can itself for music video _ in the process,
lip-synching over its prerecorded music track like a disco diva
doing a ``track date'' appearance. What seemed artificial as the
1970s ended has become unremarkable, just the way things are done.
</P>
<P>
   Handmade rock hasn't disappeared by any means. Onstage, at
least, it's still a way of life for punk, hard-rock, country and
rap-metal bands. But in the 1990s it has to compete with music that
uses disco methods: blunt repetition, synthetic sounds, mechanized
rhythms, puppet singers.
</P>
<P>
   Rock bands don't necessarily rule out any of those methods in
the studio; after all, they all own drum machines, too. The disk
jockey's attitude toward sonic information has prevailed, as both
working bands and lone producer-arranger-songwriters agree that
what comes through the speakers is the only thing that matters, and
that anything in the archives of recorded sound is fair game. That
attitude prevailed by way of hip-hop, not disco, but the result is
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hip-hop has regularly plundered disco for material;
Wyclef Jean even went back to ``Saturday Night Fever'' to remake
the Bee Gees' ``Stayin' Alive'' as ``We Trying to Stay Alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Where hip-hop insists on ``keepin' it real'' _ despite its
studio-manipulated soundscapes and stylized rhymes _ disco's legacy
is a happy suspension of reality. Voices, lyrics and pop structures
tethered 1970s disco to everyday life. But in clubs, disk jockeys
increasingly stripped away those signposts, narrowing the music
down to the beat, the hook, the texture, working for direct
physiological and psychological effect.
</P>
<P>
   Current electronica acts like the Chemical Brothers and disk
jockey-programmers like Paul Oakenfold put together songs only to
splinter them when they perform; they make a chord pulsate and
expand until it fills a club, then cue a drum-machine salvo to make
dancers shout almost by reflex. The music is canned and repetitive,
but it ignores permanence or repeatability; it's about immediate
experience, about getting lost in the euphoric present.
</P>
<P>
   It's a primal approach to music, one that has nothing to do with
reflection or judgment or posterity. Despite its tackiness and its
cliches, its crassness and its silliness, disco in the 1970s was
reaching for something that rock, with its increasing
self-consciousness, had almost given up. Jungle boogying and booty
shaking and loving to love, disco chanted inane mantras.
</P>
<P>
   But it restored pop's connection to direct physical release with
a beat so elementary that anyone could feel it. By reminding the
pop audience that it could simply enjoy the sensations of the
moment, disco made its own moment last far longer than anyone could
have guessed.

ONLINE COMPANIES TRY TO DEVELOP POLITICAL E-CLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN and MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Internet companies have taken Wall Street by storm,
and now they're trying to do the same in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in Internet commerce and services _
including Seattle's Amazon.com _ have lined up behind the effort.
America Online, eBay, Excite &LR; Home and Yahoo! are among the other
companies joining forces as NetCoalition.com.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: influence decisions affecting companies whose
business is purely Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Uppermost on the current agenda: Keep cyberspace free of taxes
and regulation; stop legislation that could curb growth.
</P>
<P>
   Their lobbying aims to cut a distinctly different swath in
high-tech political opinion making in Washington. That's partly
because the companies don't think the efforts of big, broad-based
firms like Microsoft necessarily represent their views.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies themselves also don't fit the profile of
industrial clout in the nation's capital. Internet executives are
often twentysomethings. And the companies they run may be small,
start-up enterprises that have yet to show a dime of profit _ not a
prescription for getting attention in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The effort got off the ground in July, and in recent weeks
Amazon government affairs counsel David Gabrieli and the lobbyist
for NetCoalition.com have been meeting with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to become part of the process in D.C., to bring
the pure-play Internet perspective to D.C., and to act as a
resource to Congress and the executive branch,'' said Gabrieli, who
represents Amazon.com, the world's largest Internet retailer and
one of the e-commerce companies that hasn't yet turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional staff members said the Internet industry needs to
court members of Congress from its home states, who are its natural
advocates, as well as members of key committees, such as Commerce,
that regulate issues of importance to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive step,'' said Tony Williams, chief of
staff for Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has championed Microsoft
in Congress. ``These high-tech companies don't think about
government and politics because they're busy starting their
businesses, but at some point they realize government is having an
impact, and they need to get engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top officials of Internet companies don't even know
their own members of Congress, let alone the myriad elected
officials who have a voice in enacting laws that can affect the
companies, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you grow, you get bigger and you run into regulations and
people who don't understand your issues,'' he said. ``We want them
to keep growing, but they need to have a relationship with us so we
understand what impacts them.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have approached Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., who has
been active in the debate over how to regulate the export of
encrypted software, which is technology that allows secure
transmission of e-mail and financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All industries want to get their voices heard on the (Capitol)
Hill, so this is not surprising, but we think it's great,'' said
Ali Weise, Smith's spokeswoman. ``Technology is now so pervasive in
our lives that every committee in Congress deals with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is paying increasing attention to the Internet. More
than 75 pieces of legislation now pending would regulate the
Internet in some way, and there's increasing talk about taxing
electronic commerce. Before any decisions are made, the companies
want Congress to recognize their chief executives as the experts in
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some of the lobbying is being done by the
companies' chief executives and other top officers, who fly to
Washington periodically to visit lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones on the front line in making the Internet
work,'' said Elizabeth Wang, general counsel for Internet
advertising company DoubleClick Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall mission is that Congress turn to us before bills
are passed,'' added Todd Krizelman, co-chief executive of
theglobe.com, a New York company that lets Internet users set up
free Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet has grown so rapidly and affected so many
different industries, the government needs to understand how these
changes are going to impact the economy and evaluate when and when
not to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of NetCoalition's CEOs don't fit the traditional image of a
lobbyist, or even of a chief executive officer. Theglobe's co-CEOs,
for example, are both in their mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   Members are selling a product some members of Congress aren't
familiar with. Executives from NetCoalition said some lawmakers
have rarely been online and have only a vague understanding of what
Internet companies do or how legislation might affect them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers are used to being courted by large, rich
corporations, not small, high-growth _ and often money-losing _
start-ups. Stephan Paternot, the other co-chief executive of
theglobe, said the NetCoalition's influence in Washington shouldn't
be measured by traditional yardsticks like profit. In this new
industry, growth rate, brand recognition and ability to attract Web
users are what's important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the companies that are already being responsibly run,
and we want to make sure some shop out in the middle of nowhere
doesn't come out and taint what we do,'' Paternot said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also want to distinguish themselves from
broad-based technology giants like Microsoft Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp.,
which, although well-known to lawmakers, may not represent the
interests of companies whose fortunes are tied solely to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   NetCoalition says it worries that Congress' new-found interest
in cyberspace could spawn laws that will limit or slow the growth
of the Internet. Technology behemoths _ with heavy stakes in other
businesses such as software or telecommunications _ could survive
that, but companies like those in NetCoalition couldn't, said Tim
Stevens, a corporate counsel for Inktomi Corp. The success of these
companies rides on the Internet alone _ and its explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, adjusting to the pace of Washington's bureaucracy has
been ``like putting on the parking brake after going 75 miles an
hour,'' said Brian O'Shaughnessy, a former policy director at the
Internet Alliance who is now senior manager for corporate
communications at Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies has spent much money on the new lobbying
venture. They committed funding for only one year, though they
expect it to last longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will commit for as long as it takes,'' said Amazon's
Gabrieli.
</P>
<P>
   NetCoalition rents office space from Wiley, Rein &AMP; Fielding, a
blue-chip lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., that will help
represent the group. The group has a single employee, Daniel Ebert,
who says he now functions as its coordinator but in the future will
also lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The nine member companies each have one vote on important issues
and will decide together whether to add other companies. No one
company is leading the group, which Gabrieli said meets about twice
a month by conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of electronic commerce has spurred talk in Congress
of taxes and consumer protections _ even as both political parties
present themselves as friends of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Internet bills introduced so far have been referred
to committees and stayed there. Of those that have passed, most
seek to protect consumers: for example, setting a standard for
electronic signatures used to identify online credit card users and
the authors of e-mail, and establishing civil penalties for misuse
of online information such as real estate listings or stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies in NetCoal-ition are less than 5 years
old. Besides DoubleClick and theglobe, the smaller Internet
companies in NetCoalition are Inktomi Corp. and Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Though getting involved in government is generally not part of a
start-up business' culture, Krizelman said the Justice Department's
lawsuit against Microsoft has been ``a great lesson'' for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught us `better approach Washington pre-emptively, rather
than wait until there is a problem,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft nearly doubled its spending on lobbying, to $1.2
million, in the last six months of 1997 compared to the prior
half-year. That spending boost coincided with the Justice
Department's reopening its antitrust investigation, in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft execs, from Chairman Bill Gates on down, have
repeatedly acknowledged their naivete in the ways of Washington,
and have tried to make up for lost time with a flood of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we probably got big enough three or four years
ago to get involved in issues related to communications, (and) we
should have stepped up our activities there a bit sooner,'' Gates
said in March 1998.

   WTO-NADER (Washington) _ In a lengthy critique that is likely to
form the basis for much of the protest in Seattle next month,
consumer activist Ralph Nader Wednesday will release a study of the
World Trade Organization alleging that the body is undermining
environmental and public health laws around the world. The
book-length report analyzes five years of WTO rulings and finds
that the organization, meeting in secret, has decided against every
public health, safety and environmental regulation it has ever
considered.

   ARMY-LEWIS (Undated) _ The Army will undergo a fundamental
transformation to make America's land forces more responsive to

   GORE-ENVIRONMENT (Seattle) _ If any presidential candidate
expect to be embraced by the environmental movement, it would be Al
Gore. But when the vice president arrives in Seattle Wednesday to
kick off his state campaign with a $1,000-a-plate dinner,
environmental leaders are likely to greet him not with open arms,
but with detailed demands. Environmentalists have not abandoned
Gore. But their pressuring of the vice president points out not
only some problems in the Gore campaign, but also how the
environmental movement and its political clout have shifted.

MERCKER NAMED STARTER AGAINST YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By now, Red Sox fans have given up trying to guess
Jimy Williams's next move, and the manager flummoxed them again
Tuesday by naming Kent Mercker as Boston's starter in Wednesday
night's opening game against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But the real surprise came when Mercker explained why he pitched
so dismally Sunday night against the Indians in Boston, lasting
only 1 2/3 innings and giving up two runs on three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker has had sore ribs for the last month, but the lefthander
said Tuesday, ``My ribs didn't bother me. That was my problem. I'd
had 13 days off, and this probably sounds funny, but I felt too
good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker first injured his ribs when he and third baseman Wilton
Veras collided while chasing a popup Sept. 6 in Seattle, and
Mercker tweaked the injury while reaching for a high hopper off the
bat of the White Sox' Mike Caruso later that month. He missed a
start against Baltimore during the last series of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put all the things together _ the rest, the not feeling
pain, the adrenaline, the situation _ and I was just out there
trying to throw as hard as Pedro (Martinez),'' said Mercker. ``And
so I fell behind batters and didn't pitch the way I am capable of
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   With his staff beleaguered after a tough five-game series
against the hard-hitting Indians, Williams seemingly had three
choices for the opener: Pat Rapp, Tim Wakefield, or Mercker. With
the Yankees apparently a bit more vulnerable to lefthanded starters
(19-14 on the season, though 13-5 in Yankee Stadium), Williams
chose the lefty, even on two days rest.
</P>
<P>
   The short rest, Mercker believes, ``will be good for me because
I'm not going to be feeling like Superman out there. I'll be able
to stay within myself and make better pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt he was the right one to start this particular
game,'' said Williams. ``His command maybe wasn't what he liked it
to have been in that game (Sunday) and maybe it will be better and
he'll get (ahead) of hitters better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker conceded that he was getting the start by default, ``but
I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``This is a chance that not
many people get, and I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker spots his fastball and has a good changeup, but his best
weapon, as with so many of these Red Sox, is that so many outsiders
expect so little from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a source of motivation to try and prove everybody
wrong,'' said Mercker, repeating the Red Sox' 1999 mantra. ``It's
obvious we're an underdog, but we were an underdog against
Cleveland, too.''

THE DANGERS OF UNDERESTIMATING BOSTON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Nomar Garciaparra was intentionally walked the first time
on Monday night, Troy O'Leary took no offense and found no great
revenge when he blasted a grand slam to put the Boston Red Sox in
front of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   After the Indians once again issued an intentional pass to
Garciaparra in the seventh inning, O'Leary responded to the slight
with a three-run homer to help the Red Sox reach the American
League Championship series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said Tuesday that he not only understood Cleveland's
strategy, but would probably have done the same thing if he were an
opposing manager.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary may be selling himself short, the same way Manager Mike
Hargrove of Cleveland did. His Indians, meanwhile, feel they have
been slighted by the news media and the fans across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While most see the Red Sox as little more than a speed bump on
the way to the Yankees' 25th World Series title, the players
chuckle a little bit at the notion. They are more than happy to
play the part of the lightly regarded underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been written off by everybody,'' O'Leary said.
``Obviously, you guys have been wrong. We don't have the big-name
guys. We've just got a lot of guys with a lot of heart that know
how to play the game, know what it takes to win, know their job. We
all kind of clicked together and when you bring that all together,
it turns out to be a very good baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox happily count off the names of the Yankees'
All-Stars, while humbly acknowledging that Pedro Martinez and
Garciaparra are perhaps the only players anyone outside of Fenway
Park might recognize.
</P>
<P>
   This season O'Leary led Boston in home runs with 28, and he
drove in 103 runs, more than anyone on the team other than
Garciaparra. The Red Sox did win 8 of 12 from the Yankees this
season, with O'Leary hitting a pair of homers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, O'Leary was 1 for 16 in the post-season against the
Indians and he did not have a home run in the divisional series
this season until the decisive game. But in two pitches he proved
that there is more to the Boston lineup than Garciaparra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary might epitomize the image that is reflected in players
like Damon Buford, Brian Daubach and Mike Stanley: lesser-known or
more well-traveled than their Yankee counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary was acquired by the Red Sox on April 14, 1995, on
waivers from Milwaukee, having got a small taste of the majors in
each of the two previous seasons. A month later, he was a starter,
a role he has not relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a bunch of guys in here that believe in
themselves,'' Stanley said. ``We don't get involved in who's
favored. Nobody picked this team higher than fourth, nobody picked
us to beat Cleveland. It's a cliche, but we're just taking it one
game at a time.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would not bite for such talk. Andy Pettitte,
scheduled to pitch Game 4, said: ``There's a danger, definitely, in
looking at them as a one-man team with Garciaparra, because you've
got another big league hitter coming up behind that guy. I think
O'Leary's gotten a lot of respect this year for the year that he's
had. I don't think you hear a lot about Stanley. I've always
thought he was a good hitter. You don't hear a lot about Jose
Offerman and he can swing the bat pretty good. Jason Varitek
obviously has some power. They've got a good lineup.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey, who came to the Red Sox in a trade from Seattle in
midseason, is well aware of the aura that surrounds the Yankees,
having seen it during his time across town with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the same players over there that just get a little
more TV exposure,'' Huskey said. ``Why couldn't Troy O'Leary be an
All-Star? When you put him on a baseball field with those guys over
there, he's going to go out there and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the locker room, the Red Sox still enjoy jabbing at the
notion that the season was lost when Mo Vaughn left to join the
Angels. By surviving a wild-card race with Oakland and Toronto, and
then pulling off the divisional series after spotting Cleveland a
2-0 lead, the Red Sox continue to enjoy the perception that nobody
else believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, nobody has given us any credit, but as you saw from
the Cleveland series, we've done OK,'' O'Leary said. ``We wouldn't
be here if we weren't for real.'' Huskey added: ``Why should we
think of ourselves as underdogs? If you go out there and execute
and do the little things that you're supposed to do, after nine
innings you may find yourself ahead of the big dogs.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Another day of waiting in Ramsey case
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ A long day of high expectations for the
JonBenet Ramsey grand jury ended Tuesday with a jury taking no
action and deciding to meet again today.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week remains in the jury's term as speculation continues
to mount that a decision is imminent in the 3-year-old murder
mystery. With no word emerging from the meeting held in secret by
the grand jury, Boulder County District Attorney spokeswoman
Suzanne Laurion said she assumed, ``They are still immersed in
casework.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday offered slim pickings for more than 100 news people
waiting outside the Boulder Justice Center, anticipating a feeding
frenzy on the story that has rarely strayed from headlines or news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Observers continued to speculate that the grand jury has begun
deliberating the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone assumes they are deliberating,'' said Craig
Silverman, a former Boulder deputy district attorney who has
watched the case closely. ``They could be deciding whether to see
additional witnesses. They may be studying John and Patsy Ramsey's
video (discussion with authorities).''
</P>
<P>
   If the grand jury is deliberating, Silverman noted, such
deliberations rarely last more than two days in Boulder. Despite
Tuesday's lack of action, the grand jury of eight women and four
men appears to be speeding to a conclusion. The panel began sitting
in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet Ramsey was found strangled and beaten in a basement
room of her family's home in Boulder the day after Christmas of
1996. Her father discovered her body that afternoon about seven
hours after his wife said she had found a ransom note demanding
$118,000 for the girl's safe return.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey,
remain under an ``umbrella of suspicion.'' The Ramseys have
steadfastly maintained their innocence. They have since moved to
the Atlanta area with their 12-year-old son, Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter met over the
weekend with Dr. Henry Lee, the noted forensic expert who helped
undermine evidence in the O.J. Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tough case,'' said Lee of the prosecution. ``Any
case needs a lot of information. Alex Hunter and the police have
done tons of work, but there is no major, major evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The media frenzy outside the courthouse drew curious onlookers.
``It looks like OJ,'' said Hope Colcord, 79.

 &HT;    Huff waived as Falcons seek LB help
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons linebacker Keith Brooking has told some
members of the organization he plans to play Sunday against the
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   That's bravado. In reality, it's unclear when he'll return from
a partially torn medial collateral right knee ligament, but
Brooking has been told he'll be out two to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be missed right away, because his speed would come in
handy against a 4-0 St. Louis team that frequently uses running
back Marshall Faulk as a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (1-4) waived defensive tackle Ben Huff on Tuesday to
clear a roster spot at linebacker. Lamont Green, an undrafted
rookie from Florida State cut at the end of the preseason, is
likely to be activated from the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons aren't likely to sign a free agent or acquire a
player through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking, the team's first-round draft choice in 1998 from
Georgia Tech, became a starter on the weak side after the Falcons
waived '98 leading tackler Cornelius Bennett in February. Brooking
and free safety Eugene Robinson are tied for the team lead with 39
tackles, trailing only strong safety Marty Carter, who has 58.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the second half of Sunday's 20-17 victory
in New Orleans, where fullback Bob Christian's season ended last
Dec. 13 when he tore ligaments in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrapping up (Saints running back) Ricky Williams and my
foot was planted, when I think (Saints left tackle) Willie Roaf
landed on my leg,'' Brooking said. ``My foot didn't give, but my
leg did.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooking tore the same ligament as a freshman at Tech and missed
about eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot worse,'' he said. ``(Monday) my leg was stiff,
but by (Tuesday), I already had a lot of my range of motion back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won't know until later in the week whether middle
linebacker Jessie Tuggle can play. He aggravated a strained left
patella tendon against the Saints, missing most of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin Hamilton replaced Brooking, but backup strong-side
linebacker Craig Sauer, who's quicker, might start on the weak
side.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jeff Kelly is the likely candidate to start if Tuggle
can't play.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given the fervor created by the success of New York's
two baseball teams this year, you might think that America's former
national pastime (baseball) has a chance to eclipse its current
national pastime (trading stocks).
</P>
<P>
   This column will examine the history of the interplay between
the two. To wit: What, if anything, does success for New York's
baseball players have to say about the likely success for those who
play stocks?
</P>
<P>
   The historical answers are clear. The New York Yankees are good
for stocks, but the Boston Red Sox are better. The Atlanta Braves
are also good, but a New York Mets appearance in the World Series
would be a bad omen. Previous Subway Series have been followed by
subpar market performances.
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions are based on the completely unreasonable
assumption that what happens to the stock market in the year after
a World Series is somehow influenced by which teams played in the
Series. To study the effect, the performance of the Dow Jones
industrial average was checked from the end of each October to the
end of the following October. The figures were analyzed for the
year after each World Series, beginning with the first one in 1903,
but excluding the two years when no World Series was played. The
average annual gain was 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The market has done much better in years after the Yankees
appeared in the World Series. The average during those 35 years was
a gain of 10.5 percent, compared with an average rise of just 5.6
percent when Yankees fans were presumably depressed by the failure
of their team to win the pennant. In other words, the market does
nearly twice as well after the Yankees win a pennant than it does
after their defeats. (The figures include the Dow's rise of 21.2
percent from the end of last October through Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   Boston has been in the series nine times, leading to an average
gain of 12.9 percent, far better than the Yankee figure. After the
five Series that it won _ the last in 1918, to be sure _ the gain
averaged a very impressive 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been in the World Series three times, and those
three years were not among the best for stocks, to say the least.
In the 12 months after the ``Miracle Mets'' Series championship of
1969, the Dow fell 11.7 percent as the great 1950s-1960s bull
market began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mets World Series appearance, in 1973, boded even
worse. The 1973-74 bear market was on by then, and in the next
year, the Dow fell 30.4 percent, for its worse showing in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The last Mets appearance, a victory over the Red Sox in 1986,
produced the best performance, with the Dow rising 6.2 percent from
October to October. But that period ended with the 1987 stock
market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that sorry record to the performance of the Atlanta
Braves, a team that has appeared in four World Series in the 1990s,
winning one. The average gain for the Dow in the aftermath of those
appearances was 17.4 percent, with the best showing, a rise of 26.8
percent, coming after the Braves won in 1995. (If one includes the
four previous series for the peripatetic Braves, two each in Boston
and Milwaukee, the average performance falls to 12.9 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a Yankees-Mets Subway Series. But there
have been 13 Subway Series, seven against the Brooklyn Dodgers and
six against the New York Giants, with the Yankees winning 10 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   More important for this purpose, the average performance of the
Dow in the year after a Subway Series has been a gain of only 6.0
percent. By contrast, the average has risen 13.2 percent a year in
the year after a Yankees World Series appearance against teams not
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   While it has historically been a good stock market omen for the
Yankees to get into the World Series, it has been an even better
one for them to lose. The average gain for the Dow after the 11
Yankees losses was 12.9 percent. The average gain after the 24
Yankees' wins was 9.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have an outstanding performance record even though
the team was not in any World Series during the first 13 years of
the current bull market, which began in 1982. Its appearances in
1996 and 1998 helped, but much of the record can be traced to the
fact that the Yankees were a superior team when stocks went crazy
in the 1920s, but that the team then missed the World Series for
three years from 1929-31, thus avoiding the worst years of stock
market collapse.
</P>
<P>
   If you've come this far, perhaps you'd like to know what would
happen if the World Series were abolished, freeing stock market
players from such distractions. History says it would be great. The
average performance for the Dow after the two years there was no
series _ in 1904 when the New York Giants refused to play the
Boston Pilgrims, and after a labor dispute wiped out the 1994
series _ was a gain of 27.3 percent.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Hours after Pakistan's prime minister fired
the powerful army chief on Tuesday afternoon, the army struck back
with a swift, apparently bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   Troops surrounded the prime minister's home, closed all the
major airports and shut down the state-run television and radio
stations for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:50 a.m. on Wednesday, the army chief, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, addressing the nation on state television in a tone of
patriotic earnestness, said the military had ousted Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and his government to stop any further politicization
or destabilization of the military. The general offered no
timetable for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my advice,'' said the general, neatly attired in a
camouflage uniform and wire-rimmed glasses, ``they tried to
interfere with the armed forces, the last remaining viable
institution in which all of you take so much pride and look up to
at all times for stability, unity and integrity of our beloved
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, where generals have ruled for almost half its 52
years as an independent nation, Sharif's sudden, unexplained
decision to fire the army chief was risky and came only a year
after he had replaced another army chief who had sought a greater
role for the army in running the country.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no public protest against the coup and some
processions celebrated Sharif's demise, including one near
Parliament House in Islamabad. Sharif, whose party won a landslide
victory in February, 1997, had become increasingly unpopular in
recent months because of the country's deteriorating economy and
out-of-control sectarian violence, as well as Sharif's handling of
a crisis with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The military takeover is likely to have serious international
repercussions for economically troubled Pakistan, which is
desperately in need of assistance from international lenders. A
State Department spokesman said that if a coup was confirmed, the
United States would call for the earliest possible restoration of
democracy and would not carry on ``business as usual'' with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India, too, voiced ``grave concern'' about the coup and placed
its military on high alert along the border it shares with
Pakistan. The deepening political crisis in Pakistan raises new
questions about the prospects for restarting peace talks between
Pakistan and India. These two new nuclear powers, bitter
antagonists who have fought three wars, edged close to a fourth
conflict this summer over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Sharif and the military had soured over his
handling of that conflict with India. India fought intensely for
over two months this summer to drive out infiltrators who had
crossed from Pakistan to occupy Indian-held portions of Kashmir,
the Himalayan territory both Pakistan and India want for their own.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Clinton in July, Sharif had called
for the withdrawal of forces that Western analysts now believe were
mainly Pakistani soldiers. Army leaders, including Musharraf saw
the withdrawal as a capitulation to American pressure, the
surrender of a rare military victory over India and a humiliation
of the army, according to analysts and reports in the Pakistani
press.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing of the coup was curious. Only two weeks ago,
apparently attempting to quash rumors about a clash between the
country's civilian and military leaders, Sharif had publicly stated
that the army chief would complete his tenure. It was not clear
whether something had happened since than that inspired Sharif's
abrupt decision to fire the general while the army chief was in Sri
Lanka.

 &HT;    ALCS: Memories fuel matchup
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It defies all odds. Someone in Yankee Stadium tonight
cannot recite chapter and verse of the Bucky Dent story. ``I don't
remember that,'' Orlando Hernandez said. ``They only have
two-channel television in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Dent hit a home run in a one-game playoff to keep Boston from
reaching the postseason in 1978, and the Yankees went on to win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   No ALCS ever has been like this one. The New York Yankees and
Boston Red Sox, owners of baseball's meanest rivalry, meet for the
first time in the postseason, summoning nearly a century of bad
blood, busted hopes and spilled beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are asking me for too much now,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   But the asking has only started.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque gets the ball for Game 1, facing ex-Brave Kent Mercker
and a Red Sox team that beat the Yankees like no other this season.
This series is the most significant Yankee-Red Sox meeting at
Yankee Stadium since 1949, when Boston hit town in the season's
last weekend with a one-game lead and two games to play _ and lost
the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history, this will happen,'' New York's
David Cone said. ``This is the first time the Yankees and the Red
Sox can get together in an LCS. Without the wild card, it wouldn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Mercker said, ``is why you play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Joe Torre, who growing up in Brooklyn was steeped in New
York rivalries, is jacked up about this one. His Yankees lost eight
times in 12 tries against the Red Sox and then watched Boston work
the impossible comeback against Cleveland. Even without what went
before, these games would tantalize his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that even if (the Yankees) don't know the ancient
history that has these two clubs involved,'' Torre said, ``I think
they have seen Bucky Dent's home run more so on that scoreboard
than they want to, especially with my bench coach (Don Zimmer)
being the manager of the Red Sox at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no question,'' Torre said, ``that you feel that
this is going to be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made the Bronx, running on fumes from Monday night
and their third consecutive victory over Cleveland. Boston has not
been to an ALCS since 1990, when it was swept by Oakland. Suddenly,
with the improved health of Pedro Martinez's back and the drama of
returning from an 0-2 deficit to win the AL Division Series, the
Sox look like a gathering force.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep going and hope you keep flying to
different cities,'' said Williams, whose team was 3-2 at Yankee
Stadium this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary won't hit two homers every night, just as Martinez
won't be coming out of the bullpen. But what happened in the LDS is
that quite unexpectedly, the most amusing two teams in the league
wound up here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dynamite,'' Torre said. ``It really is.''

TAILORING ARIAS TO SUIT THE VAGARIES OF THE VOICES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Will Crutchfield is a conductor specializing in 19th-century
opera.  
 By WILL CRUTCHFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Transposition is in the news at the Metropolitan
Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras just concluded a series of
performances of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of
the score restored to the higher keys in which the composer
originally wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Placido Domingo has been reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly
_ and both are being a bit misunderstood as often as not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transposition'' in music refers to the collective lowering or
raising of a group of notes, a process that leaves the essential
musical message intact. Yes, they sound different; but a tune that
starts on E is the same tune if you start it on D, as long as you
move all the other notes down by the same distance.
</P>
<P>
   Any piece of music can be transposed, but in professional
practice, it is almost exclusively a vocal issue. An oboe is an
oboe, and what is well written for oboe in one key need never be
moved to another. What is well written for piano or violin may,
indeed, suffer considerably if it is moved, because the mechanics
of execution (just where the violinist shifts from one string to
another, for instance, or which notes are easily accessible to the
pianist's thumb) are so particular that a passage that is
satisfyingly brilliant in one key can become dauntingly awkward in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But singing is a different matter. One soprano, one baritone, is
not like another. Each voice is a unique instrument, and though
there is enough correspondence to allow a great deal of music to
pass from artist to artist unaltered, there has also been a lot of
tailoring as music has been committed to paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by rewriting individual lines to add or subtract notes
at the end of the range or by transposing entire pieces, it has
always been necessary to organize a fit between the voices one
wants and the music one wants them to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Such things happen a thousand times a day in the world of
popular song, and no one is concerned; even musicians who are
prepared to take Gershwin's ``Who Cares?'' quite seriously as a
piece of skillful composition (and they should) do not care what
its ``original key'' might have been. The same is largely true in
the world of classical lieder, though pianists know that sometimes
the singer's convenience can add hours to their practice schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But in opera, it's news. The reasons range from a sportive
interest in competitive statistics (how high can Dame Joan
Sutherland still sing this season?), through sensitivity to the
color of a particular key (we tend to think that D major sounds
``military'' and D flat sounds ``warm''), to concern for the
long-range harmonic relationships between one key and another that
were _ sometimes _ important to the way composers conceived their
music over the span of an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these aspects has its complications. The earlier we look
in operatic history, the simpler the answers, for two reasons.
Until, say, Mozart's time or a little after, operas were composed
for specific singers and, if revived at all, recomposed for the new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the orchestrally accompanied musical units (arias and,
eventually, ensembles) were linked by the keyboard-accompanied
dialogue we call ``recitative,'' whose harmonic structure was
intentionally loose, having no purpose but to prepare the key of
the next piece.
</P>
<P>
   Recitative is infinitely adjustable to accommodate whatever that
next key might be. So Handel transposed his arias all over the map,
a step, a third or a fourth above or below their original keys as
the situation might require, expertly rewriting the instrumental
parts to avoid awkwardness in the orchestra. (If the composer was
not around, the presiding maestro of any operatic season stepped in
to do this job.)
</P>
<P>
   Both these situations changed, and that is the reason we have an
issue today. At more or less the same time, composers moved toward
a more continuous musical texture, reducing and eventually
eliminating the arbitrary nature of the ``linking'' material; and
they began thinking in terms of a coherent artwork that would pass
more or less unaltered from one theater to another.
</P>
<P>
   So singers had to become more adaptable. Then, too, a further
complication was gradually introduced: the exploitation of extreme
vocal notes for their particular character and impact. All the
notes of an aria by Vivaldi or Bach make sense if you play them on
the violin; the same is not true of Verdi, because some notes are
there for a more purely vocal impact.
</P>
<P>
   These changes did not happen in a flash. Different composers
attempted different degrees of continuity and coordination. And
even when those were at their maximum, it remained a matter not of
principle but of the musical particulars of the moment whether a
certain transposition was easy or difficult, justifiable or
questionable, noticeable or hidden.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that in all generations before our own,
transposition was practiced a lot more frequently than it is in our
museum-oriented opera houses. The less we do it, the more we talk
about it: just now, the Internet is buzzing with debate over
``Lucia'' and Domingo. But any Met season 50 or 100 years ago
involved far more transposition and far less consternation.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples. We think of the conductor Arturo Toscanini as a
purist, but even at the end of his operatic career, and even in the
shrinelike environment of the Salzburg Festival, he made
transpositions to accommodate his singers in both ``Fidelio'' and
``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latter opera illustrates one frequent cause for
transposition: the Queen of the Night is written for an
extraordinarily high soprano voice, and the voices that are both
sufficiently high and appropriately dramatic are rare. The Queen's
``vengeance'' aria is composed in D minor. Dame Joan was criticized
for singing it in C minor the one time she performed the role, in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Toscanini was not criticized, as far as I know, for letting his
Queen do the same in the 1930s. At the Met in 1901, Marcella
Sembrich lowered it farther (to B minor), apparently without
raising eyebrows. Nowadays we tend to prefer slighter voices and
the original key; different compromises for different times.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the tip of the iceberg. The beloved Rosa Ponselle
made extensive transpositions in ``Aida,'' ``Il Trovatore,''
``Norma,'' ``La Traviata'' and much else. The baritone aria in
``Faust,'' the tenor arias in ``La Boheme'' and ``Il Trovatore,''
and the bass arias in ``The Barber of Seville'' have probably been
heard as often in transpositions as in their original keys.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been understood that transposition could become a
problem, and in earlier times, composers and singers freely
adjusted vocal lines within the original key to solve problems
without transposing, when that was the more practical solution.
That still happens at the drop of a hat when a new composition is
being prepared, but it has fallen out of favor in familiar operas,
probably because so many listeners have memorized them from
recordings that the adjustments would be too easily commented on,
and singers are shy about revealing their limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the limitations exist, and it is silly to suppose that
adaptation to them should or could be forbidden. Tenors are
especially prone to need it; we all love the sound of a good
tenor's high range, but the fact is that many fine tenors have the
right sound without having the last few notes their higher
colleagues command.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Schipa, also at the Met, transposed a good deal more of
``Manon'' than Domingo is transposing of ``Otello.'' And yes, it
meant that his co-star had to adjust to some passages lower than
she might have wished. ``Of course it was a little difficult,''
Bidu Sayao, the Manon of one Saturday broadcast that has been
preserved, told me many decades later, ``but he was such an artist
that it was worth the effort.'' Good attitude.
</P>
<P>
   As for the composer's intentions: what is lacking in many
discussions is an appreciation of how flexible and contingent these
were. It is wonderful to see the long-range harmonic structure of
an opera composer who worked that way, but this is not the same as
thinking that the opera is ruined if the structure is modified on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart did work that way, but it did not stop him from
transposing afterward when he needed to. Verdi, as far as the
evidence suggests, did not work that way, though he did seem to
care about the local color of individual keys; yet he, too,
willingly transposed all his life.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Verdi is complicated, and this is relevant to the
current ``Otello'' fracas. It's true that he once called for a
contractual right to forbid transposition in his scores, but only
as part of a general program of asserting control over rights,
royalties, cuts and casting that he pursued in the middle of his
career to assure the success of his operas and his (then
unprecedented) right to veto their production when he deemed
success unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He was dealing with a situation in which Amelia in ``Simon
Boccanegra'' might substitute a Donizetti aria for ``Come in
quest'ora bruna'' (this happened), so his verbal pronouncements on
the matter have to be seen as exaggerations in that context.
</P>
<P>
   But practice was another matter. In ``Rigoletto,'' Verdi
composed Gilda's ``Caro nome'' in F and transposed it himself
before finishing the score. He made a midpiece modulation from G to
F in ``I Lombardi'' specifically to give the soprano high As
instead of Bs, ``because that note is particularly effective'' in
the particular singer's voice. He transposed a high-C showpiece
from the original St. Petersburg ``Forza del Destino'' to B flat
precisely because, as he put it, ``nobody will be able to sing what
was written for Tamberlik.''
</P>
<P>
   Violetta's duet with Germont in ``La Traviata'' went from E to E
flat because for the second production of the opera he had a
lower-voiced baritone; Verdi referred to his revision of this scene
as ``some tranpositions and adaptations for the new cast,'' though
in fact he also made other improvements: the reason he had the
second version published in place of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Even his oft-quoted letter objecting to the transposition of
``Celeste Aida'' is followed by one saying, in effect, ``OK, give
the permission, but let's not let this become a habit.'' (Verdi
also approved, advised and practiced copious local rewriting for
the sake of vocal comfort, up to and including his last opera,
``Falstaff.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Verdi's predecessors did all this even more than he. In the
case of Donizetti and ``Lucia,'' it is probably exaggerated to call
the current Met production a different ``version'' of the score. A
different approach, yes, because Sir Charles has rethought the
embellishments from the ground up. He has also restored many cuts;
but so did the team that performed the opera with Edita Gruberova a
few seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Lucia'' at the Met, even at its most transposed and
altered, has always been closer to the composer's original than,
say, ``Giulio Cesare'' or ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' have been.
</P>
<P>
   As for the keys: since the Lucia arias have traditionally been
sung in lower keys and very high notes have been added at their
conclusions, it has been easy for many to assume that the high
notes are the reason for the transpositions. But history does not
bear this out; the Lucia arias were being sung (and published) in
the familiar transpositions within a decade of the opera's
premiere, long before the ultrahigh added notes became standard.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary record, for those who enjoy poring through it,
is clear that as late as the turn of the expiring century, more
Lucias sang the role without high E flats than with. And yet they
were singing in the lower keys. It is much more a matter of the
usual reason for transposition: general vocal ``fit'' between
singer and music.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual fossilization of certain ``standard'' interpolations
_ in this opera and in many others _ was a phenomenon of the
post-World War I period, as the few surviving operas from the age
of improvisation were equipped for life in an operatic environment
no longer hospitable to improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   So everybody should lighten up. Wagner was the most continuous
and least transposable of opera composers (and he sensibly avoided
unusual high notes, probably in part for that reason); yet even
Wagner accepted transpositions for the abandoned first production
of ``Tristan,'' and certain transpositions have functioned well
enough in his scores. Helen Traubel always sang Brunnhilde's Battle
Cry in B flat, not B. At Bayreuth itself, Senta's Ballade was
transposed upward for the young voice of Anja Silja (just as the
little aria of Mozart's Masetto is usually transposed up for the
youngish baritones who sing the part).
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of practicality, not principle. If the
transition can be made with some harmonic elegance, and if the
musical loss is either negligible or, at worst, small enough to be
outweighed by the performance it makes possible, then _ no big
deal. If it can't be, then one decides, OK, that singer can't do
that role.
</P>
<P>
   The ``overall harmonic conception'' is important to the
composer's inspiration if it is _ and sometimes it is. But as the
composers themselves knew, that takes its place among many other
priorities when it comes down to what happens on the individual
night, and sometimes it can yield.
</P>
<P>
   As for Domingo, meanwhile: if Verdi had not opened up his
autograph score and scratched out some key signatures, ``Otello''
itself would be with ``Lucia'' and ``Norma'' on the list of operas
that changed between manuscript and publication. The quartet in Act
II, where Desdemona asks her husband's pardon and Iago finagles the
famous handkerchief from his wife, was originally composed in B.
Verdi moved it to B flat during rehearsals, and though we have no
correspondence on the matter, the reason could hardly be more
obvious: as written, the piece required two sustained high Bs, a
note Otello is otherwise required to touch only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to surmise, from what we know of Francesco Tamagno,
that these were difficult for the original singer of Otello,
especially given the lyrical context of the lines in question.
</P>
<P>
   If Tamagno had needed the other transpositions that are being
used at the Met, would Verdi have provided them? Or would he have
made local adjustments in the vocal part to render them
unnecessary? Or would he have said, ``All right, too much, let's
get another singer''? We can't know.
</P>
<P>
   If he were around right now, and ``get another singer'' meant
forgoing the services of a beloved artist who had much to offer, in
a role whose distinguished exponents are painfully rare _ well, I
don't think there's a lot of doubt here.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to remember is that what happens on a given
evening cannot really ``damage'' a musical score. It is still
there, and nothing prevents its being performed unaltered another
day. The moment an Otello of comparable caliber arrives who is
comfortable with the original keys (as our current one was from
1976 until now), those keys will be right there waiting for him.
Meanwhile, rest easy, Maestro Domingo; the ghost of Verdi is on
your side.

 &HT;    ALCS NOTEBOOK: O'Neill probably will playBy Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ If Paul O'Neill can get out of bed this morning,
expect him to be in right field tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankee still has a broken rib, but he expects to
play in Game 1 of the ALCS, barring a flare-up after a full workout
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was like I don't want to do to much. I might tear
something,'' he said. ``It's not that. (The pain) is going to be
there. It is there when I wake up in the morning. It is there when
I go to bed at night. It is something you can get in the game and
forget about. Hopefully, that is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill was first injured in the next-to-last game of the
regular season, when he crashed into a wall at Tampa Bay's
Tropicana Field and suffered a non-displaced fracture of the 10th
rib on his right side. He went 2-for-8 in the first two games of
the AL Division Series against Texas before being held out of Game
3.
</P>
<P>
   His Monday workout came after three days of inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see (this) morning, and we'll try to push it right up
against the deadline as far as announcing the roster,'' manager Joe
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ALCS rosters must be submitted at 10 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our team,'' shortstop Derek Jeter said.
``You want to have all your guns when you're going into a series
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck works
</P>
<P>
   Former Brave Kent Mercker draws the first postseason start of
his career in Game 1, as well as his first October work since 1995
in Atlanta. With Boston's rotation knotted up, how did manager Jimy
Williams make this call?
</P>
<P>
   ``Managerial decision,'' Williams said. And that's all he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox' biggest decision might have been to knock
knuckle-baller Tim Wakefield off the ALCS roster, along with
reliever John Wasdin. The Red Sox added right-handers Pat Rapp and
Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker started Game 3 of the AL Division Series, gave up a pair
of runs, never got out of the second inning, and Boston won by 17
runs. Even though that was four days ago, Mercker sensed he was the
logical choice to work tonight, because Pedro Martinez, Ramon
Martinez and Bret Saberhagen had thrown substantially more than he
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I guess I was getting to start by default,'' said Mercker,
who allowed three runs in 12 innings of postseason relief with the
Braves. ``I think Jimy is doing it out of necessity, that there's
no one else that can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got confidence in me, but I am going to take
advantage of it. This is a chance not many people get, and I am
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not. With O'Neill and Tino Martinez batting
left-handed in the middle of the lineup, they went 19-14 against
left-handers this season and did not have to face one in the Texas
LDS.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield done
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will keep an 11-man pitching staff for the series,
but it will not include Wakefield, a veteran of three postseason
teams in Pittsburgh and Boston and who served the Red Sox as a
starter, middle reliever and closer at various times of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough decisions,'' Williams said, ``but (you) have to make
them.''

NEW MALARIA PROGRAM TO USE TREATED BEDDING NETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 &HT;    c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   The World Health Organization plans to announce Wednesday an
ambitious new program to fight malaria among children in Third
World countries by distributing special mosquito-net bedding dipped
in insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a WHO initiative called Roll Back Malaria that
started last year, project manager Dr. David Nabarro said WHO wants
to help provide 60 million African families with these
insecticide-treated mosquito nets over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 2 million African households are estimated to have
bed nets, and the number of households actually using them properly
is much lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria, spread through mosquito bites between dusk and dawn,
kills 1.1 million people worldwide each year, and about 1 million
of them are in Africa. One of every four childhood deaths in Africa
is from malaria, resulting in 700,000 children in Africa, most of
them under five years old.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, studies showed that insecticide-treated nets
could reduce malaria deaths by 25 percent. The nets were dipped in
synthetic pyrethroids, a substance derived from a plant common in
East Africa that has a long safety history and is
environmentally-friendly. The insecticide creates an invisible
chemical wall that keeps the bugs away.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not the only solution, treated nets are a cheap
and immediate solution to combatting the increase of malaria, said
Dr. Dyann Wirth, director of the Harvard Malaria Initiative. ``Nets
alone are really not effective,'' said Wirth. ``It is clear that we
have the technology and it can have a huge effect now on child
deaths with malaria,'' said Nils Daulaire, president and chief
executive of Global Health Council, a membership alliance of
improving health worldwide. ``Nobody leaves from the hospital
anymore without a child car seat in the US, but that doesn't make
more than a five percent difference in our child death rate. With
malaria, no mother in Africa should leave the hospital without a
bednet.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1996, Vietnam launched a new anti-malaria
treatment drug and distributed insecticide-treated bednets on a
massive scale, and was able to reduce the malaria incidence by more
than 95 percent, said Dr. Kamini Mendis, a WHO malaria specialist
in Geneva. Mendis said that a trial of only treated bednets in the
southern part of Sri Lanka resulted in reducing the number of
malaria infections by 80 percent over 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria control experts meeting this week at a conference in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, are discussing strategies to increase the
availability of bednets, working with manufacturers to bring down
the cost, and promoting the need to regularly re-treat the bednets
every six months with the safe insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will reduce the reliance of DDT,'' said Nabarro.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank, one of the core partners of the Roll Back
Malaria initiative, is supporting loan financing to countries to
begin to provide bednets, working with the bednet producers, and
trying to reduce the tax and tariffs of the bednets. In some
countries, bednets are still categorized as a luxury or
higher-tariff good, not a public-health good, such as
pharmaceuticals, said Julie McLaughlin, health specialist for the
World Bank. In some places, a net could cost $20, although Nabarro
said he hopes that they can eventually get the cost down to $3.50
for a net.
</P>
<P>
   The United Kingdom's Department for International Development,
the British equivalent of the US Agency for International
Development has already pledged $70 million for the bednet project.
</P>
<P>
   But one main problem will be distribution, said Dr. Peter Winch,
a specialist in behavior change interventions in tropical disease
control at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time people need nets and anti-malaria drug treatments the
most is in the rainy season, but that is also when people don't
have the money because the harvests haven't come in yet, and roads
are impassable because of the rain,'' Winch said.

CLINTON ORDERS CAMPAIGN TO ENROLL CHILDREN IN U.S. HEALTH INSURANCE
PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR and ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton directed federal officials
Tuesday to visit America's schools and enroll children in a health
insurance program that he said had fallen far short of his original
goal of providing coverage to 5 million youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply inexcusable that we're sitting here, and have
been, with the money for two years to provide health insurance to 5
million kids, and 80 percent of them are still uninsured,'' Clinton
said at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau data show that the number of children without
health insurance has increased by 15.6 percent since Clinton took
office, to 11.1 million last year from 9.6 million in 1993. The
number of uninsured children rose by 330,000 in 1998 alone, despite
an exceptionally strong economy and billions of dollars of new
federal money made available to pay for children's health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the new program, the Children's Health
Insurance Program, in 1997. It provided $24 billion over five years
and a total of $39 billion over 10 years, but states have used less
than 25 percent of the money made available so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to bring health care coverage to more children,
we have to start with where the children are _ in the schools,''
Clinton said Tuesday. He instructed officials from the Departments
of Education, Agriculture and Health and Human Services to find
eligible children in the schools and sign them up in the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said schools would disseminate information on health
insurance along with the forms used to apply for school lunch
subsidies. ``Millions of parents who fill out their school lunch
forms now will have a chance to learn about these health
programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president said, ``thousands of Americorps and
Vista volunteers who deal directly with low-income families every
day'' will be trained to enroll children in Medicaid and in the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   But children are not the only ones without insurance. A new
study shows that 20 percent of all uninsured people are offered
health insurance by employers, but choose not to take it. Most of
those people cite cost as the reason, saying premiums are too high.
</P>
<P>
   The study was issued Tuesday by a research organization, the
Center for Studying Health System Change. Peter Cunningham, a
co-author of the study, said: ``If all uninsured people with access
to employer-sponsored health plans were to enroll in those plans,
that would do more to reduce the number of uninsured than any of
the incremental expansions of coverage that have been passed or
proposed in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven business, consumer and medical groups said Tuesday that
they would work together to investigate ways of providing coverage
to the uninsured. The groups include Families USA, a consumer group
that supported Clinton's proposal for universal insurance coverage
in 1993-94, and the Health Insurance Association of America, which
helped kill the Clinton plan with television advertisements
featuring ``Harry and Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pollack, executive director of Families USA, and Charles
Kahn III, president of the insurance association, said Tuesday that
they wanted to force candidates to address the problems of the
uninsured in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   These groups will offer proposals to help the uninsured at a
conference in January. Detailed proposals will also be offered by
the other participants: the American Hospital Association, the
American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the
Service Employees International Union and the Chamber of Commerce
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A poll commissioned by Families USA and the Health Insurance
Association of America indicates that two-thirds of Americans would
be willing to pay $50 a year in additional taxes to insure that all
Americans had health coverage. The poll, conducted by Celinda Lake
and William McInturff, also suggests that at least half of all
adults would be more likely to vote for a presidential candidate if
the candidate talked about expanding access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that the number of Americans touched directly or
indirectly by a lack of health insurance was much larger than
commonly assumed. Twelve percent of people ages 18 to 64 said they
were currently uninsured. Seventeen percent said they had coverage
now but had been uninsured at some time in the last three years.
And 43 percent said they had been insured for three straight years,
but knew someone who had been uninsured in those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are large numbers of people who drift in and out of
coverage,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, based on telephone interviews with 800 adults from
Sept. 29 to Oct. 4, had a margin of sampling error of 3 to 4
percentage points.

VOTE TALLY   IN AUSTRIA   PUTS FAR RIGHT   IN 2ND PLACE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel)   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   VIENNA &UR; , Austria &LR;  _ With 250,000 absentee ballots finally
counted, the results of Austria's Oct. 3 elections were declared
official Tuesday, with the far-right Freedom Party holding onto
second place by a mere 415 votes.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to give the party, led by Joerg Haider, a good
chance of being in whatever government is eventually formed.
Haider's bitterest opponents have openly called him a Nazi _ for
his anti-immigration stance, for once referring favorably to Third
Reich employment policy and for praising a war-veterans' group that
included some concentration camp guards.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, was quoted on Vienna
radio stations Tuesday as having told Israeli army radio that he
would cut off relations with Austria if Haider gets a government
role.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian government reacted angrily, issuing a communique
saying Levy's comments were ``totally unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   Many moderate Austrians are angered by what they consider an
overreaction by the world outside and the suggestion that Nazism
has any place in current Austrian politics.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny vote gap between second and third place and the counting
of absentee ballots was important because the leader of the
third-place Austrian People's Party promised in mid-campaign that
if his party came in behind Haider's, he would drop out of the
``grand coalition of reds and blacks'' that has controlled Austrian
politics for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, his party appeared to be keeping that promise,
saying after a meeting of the party leadership that it would go
into opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief of the conservative business- and church-oriented
party, Wolfgang Schuessel, couched the announcement in careful
phrasing, saying his party leaders had voted to ``put the switches
in motion to move into opposition.'' Journalists and others
covering the late-evening announcement said the sentence gave him
an out and that he might still form the ``grand coalition'' if
talks with the governing Social Democrats _ the reds _ proved
fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel has said the coalition should not form again until it
works out disagreements on budget cuts, employers' payments to the
government benefits pool and military policy.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the official tally, Interior Minister Karl
Schloegl, a Social Democrat, said the People's Party ``will not
lose face if they negotiate with the Social Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   A politics professor from the University of Vienna, Anton
Pelinka, analyzing the results for Austrian television, suggested
that all coalition talks would fail because the parties are so far
apart and at nearly equal strength. He predicted that talks would
drag on until Christmas and that new elections would be called.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel's party, known as ``the blacks,'' fell 415 votes short
of Haider's ``blues'' party, but each got 26.9 percent of the 4.6
million votes cast and each will have 52 seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats ended up with 33.2 percent of the vote.
Although it is still the dominant party, its percentage of the vote
has fallen year after year, while Haider's has grown. The Freedom
Party had only 5 percent of the vote when Haider took it over in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the political spectrum, the Green Party has
doubled the percentage of its vote since 1995. Tuesday, after the
absentee ballots were counted, it had picked up a 14th
parliamentary seat and will be able, in egalitarian fashion, to
seat seven men and seven women.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has said he is willing to negotiate a coalition
government with virtually anyone. Speaking at a news conference
Tuesday in Klagenfurt, in his home province of Carinthia, he said
the vote showed that the red-black coalition was dead with the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's success in winning 27 percent of the vote has created
Austria's biggest foreign relations crisis since 1986. It was
revealed then that Kurt Waldheim, a former U.N. secretary general
who had been elected Austria's president, had lied about his German
army service in World War II, in a unit implicated in atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the leader of Austria's strong Roman Catholic Church,
Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, toured the Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial in Jerusalem and reminded Israelis that nearly 75 percent
of voters had not selected Haider.
</P>
<P>
   Even though frustration with the dominance and bickering of the
red-black coalition is widespread, weekend opinion polls indicated
that between 54 and 59 percent of Austrians wanted it to continue
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a ban on immigration into Austria, Haider favors a 23
percent flat tax, wants every mother who is an Austrian citizen to
get a $400 check each month and opposes the social security cuts
the government reluctantly made to qualify for the euro, the
European currency.

 Will Crutchfield is a conductor specializing in 19th-century
opera.  
 By WILL CRUTCHFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Transposition is in the news at the Metropolitan
Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras just concluded a series of
performances of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of
the score restored to the higher keys in which the composer
originally wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Placido Domingo has been reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly
_ and both are being a bit misunderstood as often as not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transposition'' in music refers to the collective lowering or
raising of a group of notes, a process that leaves the essential
musical message intact. Yes, they sound different; but a tune that
starts on E is the same tune if you start it on D, as long as you
move all the other notes down by the same distance.
</P>
<P>
   Any piece of music can be transposed, but in professional
practice, it is almost exclusively a vocal issue. An oboe is an
oboe, and what is well written for oboe in one key need never be
moved to another. What is well written for piano or violin may,
indeed, suffer considerably if it is moved, because the mechanics
of execution (just where the violinist shifts from one string to
another, for instance, or which notes are easily accessible to the
pianist's thumb) are so particular that a passage that is
satisfyingly brilliant in one key can become dauntingly awkward in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But singing is a different matter. One soprano, one baritone, is
not like another. Each voice is a unique instrument, and though
there is enough correspondence to allow a great deal of music to
pass from artist to artist unaltered, there has also been a lot of
tailoring as music has been committed to paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by rewriting individual lines to add or subtract notes
at the end of the range or by transposing entire pieces, it has
always been necessary to organize a fit between the voices one
wants and the music one wants them to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Such things happen a thousand times a day in the world of
popular song, and no one is concerned; even musicians who are
prepared to take Gershwin's ``Who Cares?'' quite seriously as a
piece of skillful composition (and they should) do not care what
its ``original key'' might have been. The same is largely true in
the world of classical lieder, though pianists know that sometimes
the singer's convenience can add hours to their practice schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But in opera, it's news. The reasons range from a sportive
interest in competitive statistics (how high can Dame Joan
Sutherland still sing this season?), through sensitivity to the
color of a particular key (we tend to think that D major sounds
``military'' and D flat sounds ``warm''), to concern for the
long-range harmonic relationships between one key and another that
were _ sometimes _ important to the way composers conceived their
music over the span of an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these aspects has its complications. The earlier we look
in operatic history, the simpler the answers, for two reasons.
Until, say, Mozart's time or a little after, operas were composed
for specific singers and, if revived at all, recomposed for the new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the orchestrally accompanied musical units (arias and,
eventually, ensembles) were linked by the keyboard-accompanied
dialogue we call ``recitative,'' whose harmonic structure was
intentionally loose, having no purpose but to prepare the key of
the next piece.
</P>
<P>
   Recitative is infinitely adjustable to accommodate whatever that
next key might be. So Handel transposed his arias all over the map,
a step, a third or a fourth above or below their original keys as
the situation might require, expertly rewriting the instrumental
parts to avoid awkwardness in the orchestra. (If the composer was
not around, the presiding maestro of any operatic season stepped in
to do this job.)
</P>
<P>
   Both these situations changed, and that is the reason we have an
issue today. At more or less the same time, composers moved toward
a more continuous musical texture, reducing and eventually
eliminating the arbitrary nature of the ``linking'' material; and
they began thinking in terms of a coherent artwork that would pass
more or less unaltered from one theater to another.
</P>
<P>
   So singers had to become more adaptable. Then, too, a further
complication was gradually introduced: the exploitation of extreme
vocal notes for their particular character and impact. All the
notes of an aria by Vivaldi or Bach make sense if you play them on
the violin; the same is not true of Verdi, because some notes are
there for a more purely vocal impact.
</P>
<P>
   These changes did not happen in a flash. Different composers
attempted different degrees of continuity and coordination. And
even when those were at their maximum, it remained a matter not of
principle but of the musical particulars of the moment whether a
certain transposition was easy or difficult, justifiable or
questionable, noticeable or hidden.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that in all generations before our own,
transposition was practiced a lot more frequently than it is in our
museum-oriented opera houses. The less we do it, the more we talk
about it: just now, the Internet is buzzing with debate over
``Lucia'' and Domingo. But any Met season 50 or 100 years ago
involved far more transposition and far less consternation.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples. We think of the conductor Arturo Toscanini as a
purist, but even at the end of his operatic career, and even in the
shrinelike environment of the Salzburg Festival, he made
transpositions to accommodate his singers in both ``Fidelio'' and
``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latter opera illustrates one frequent cause for
transposition: the Queen of the Night is written for an
extraordinarily high soprano voice, and the voices that are both
sufficiently high and appropriately dramatic are rare. The Queen's
``vengeance'' aria is composed in D minor. Dame Joan was criticized
for singing it in C minor the one time she performed the role, in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Toscanini was not criticized, as far as I know, for letting his
Queen do the same in the 1930s. At the Met in 1901, Marcella
Sembrich lowered it farther (to B minor), apparently without
raising eyebrows. Nowadays we tend to prefer slighter voices and
the original key; different compromises for different times.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the tip of the iceberg. The beloved Rosa Ponselle
made extensive transpositions in ``Aida,'' ``Il Trovatore,''
``Norma,'' ``La Traviata'' and much else. The baritone aria in
``Faust,'' the tenor arias in ``La Boheme'' and ``Il Trovatore,''
and the bass arias in ``The Barber of Seville'' have probably been
heard as often in transpositions as in their original keys.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been understood that transposition could become a
problem, and in earlier times, composers and singers freely
adjusted vocal lines within the original key to solve problems
without transposing, when that was the more practical solution.
That still happens at the drop of a hat when a new composition is
being prepared, but it has fallen out of favor in familiar operas,
probably because so many listeners have memorized them from
recordings that the adjustments would be too easily commented on,
and singers are shy about revealing their limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the limitations exist, and it is silly to suppose that
adaptation to them should or could be forbidden. Tenors are
especially prone to need it; we all love the sound of a good
tenor's high range, but the fact is that many fine tenors have the
right sound without having the last few notes their higher
colleagues command.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Schipa, also at the Met, transposed a good deal more of
``Manon'' than Domingo is transposing of ``Otello.'' And yes, it
meant that his co-star had to adjust to some passages lower than
she might have wished. ``Of course it was a little difficult,''
Bidu Sayao, the Manon of one Saturday broadcast that has been
preserved, told me many decades later, ``but he was such an artist
that it was worth the effort.'' Good attitude.
</P>
<P>
   As for the composer's intentions: what is lacking in many
discussions is an appreciation of how flexible and contingent these
were. It is wonderful to see the long-range harmonic structure of
an opera composer who worked that way, but this is not the same as
thinking that the opera is ruined if the structure is modified on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart did work that way, but it did not stop him from
transposing afterward when he needed to. Verdi, as far as the
evidence suggests, did not work that way, though he did seem to
care about the local color of individual keys; yet he, too,
willingly transposed all his life.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Verdi is complicated, and this is relevant to the
current ``Otello'' fracas. It's true that he once called for a
contractual right to forbid transposition in his scores, but only
as part of a general program of asserting control over rights,
royalties, cuts and casting that he pursued in the middle of his
career to assure the success of his operas and his (then
unprecedented) right to veto their production when he deemed
success unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He was dealing with a situation in which Amelia in ``Simon
Boccanegra'' might substitute a Donizetti aria for ``Come in
quest'ora bruna'' (this happened), so his verbal pronouncements on
the matter have to be seen as exaggerations in that context.
</P>
<P>
   But practice was another matter. In ``Rigoletto,'' Verdi
composed Gilda's ``Caro nome'' in F and transposed it himself
before finishing the score. He made a midpiece modulation from G to
F in ``I Lombardi'' specifically to give the soprano high As
instead of Bs, ``because that note is particularly effective'' in
the particular singer's voice. He transposed a high-C showpiece
from the original St. Petersburg ``Forza del Destino'' to B flat
precisely because, as he put it, ``nobody will be able to sing what
was written for Tamberlik.''
</P>
<P>
   Violetta's duet with Germont in ``La Traviata'' went from E to E
flat because for the second production of the opera he had a
lower-voiced baritone; Verdi referred to his revision of this scene
as ``some tranpositions and adaptations for the new cast,'' though
in fact he also made other improvements: the reason he had the
second version published in place of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Even his oft-quoted letter objecting to the transposition of
``Celeste Aida'' is followed by one saying, in effect, ``OK, give
the permission, but let's not let this become a habit.'' (Verdi
also approved, advised and practiced copious local rewriting for
the sake of vocal comfort, up to and including his last opera,
``Falstaff.'')

RAYTHEON STOCK DROPS ON WARNING OF LOWER SALES, PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. stock dropped 44 percent Tuesday after it warned
that sales and profits will be far below expectations this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
   After trading was halted most of the day while the company
discussed its problems with analysts and reporters, the stock fell
18 3/4 to close at 24 1/4. In July, the stock hit a high of
74-15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said it plans to eliminate about 2,380 jobs,
including 140 from its Lexington, Mass., headquarters and 200
elsewhere in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The layoffs are in
addition to the thousands of positions the company has shed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burnham, Raytheon's chief executive, said the company's
condition ``fills me with anger, embarrassment and guilt.'' He said
he hoped the company's candor about its difficulties would help
Raytheon ``re-establish credibility'' with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among its immediate woes, Raytheon said it expects no new orders
this year for its Patriot ground-to-air missile and said it will
have to write off other munitions inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also tried to address bigger questions surrounding the
company, which has released a stream of warnings about its outlook
in recent months. In general, Burnham said, the company has moved
too quickly to integrate defense units it acquired from Texas
Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronics Corp. two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we tried to do too much too fast, given the
size of the task, our state of readiness, and the depth and
maturity of the management team,'' Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also backed off his much-vaunted goal of growing revenue
by 6 to 8 percent a year and profits by 10 to 12 percent a year,
and set more modest expectations for 1999 and 2000. In addition,
Burnham said the company would take pretax charges of $638 million
this year, up from a charge of as much as $450 million the company
said last month that it planned to take during its third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's update was aimed at investors worried by
Raytheon's statements last month, and Burnham pledged the company
would continue to grow 1 or 2 percent faster than the overall
defense market.
</P>
<P>
   But the update calmed few shareholders, who among other things
were spooked by Raytheon's forecast that profit margins will
probably fall from 15 percent to 12 percent next year at Raytheon
Systems Co., the defense contracting unit that accounts for
three-quarters of Raytheon's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much uglier,'' said Bill Fiala, an analyst at
Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``What makes this so serious is that the
problems that were disclosed today were in areas that are the bread
and butter of Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``US defense contracts are what make Raytheon tick and dropping
the ball in that area is a serious issue,'' Fiala said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said
he was troubled by continual shifts in guidance Raytheon has given.
``The credibility has gone to near-zero, and its going to be a long
time before it is back,'' said Nisbet. He compared Raytheon's
problems to those at Lockheed Martin Corp., whose stock has also
fallen this year after it issues earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Of the job cuts announced Tuesday, Raytheon said it would cut
the bulk of positions _ 1,850 _ from plants in California, New
York, and Texas. About 150 positions will come from its Engineers &AMP;
Constructors unit, mainly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon had previously indicated it would cut jobs at its
headquarters. Of the other 200 layoffs pending in Massachusetts and
New Hampshire, Raytheon spokesman David Polk said the company
couldn't be more specific about the locations of positions to be
cut. The company also wasn't able to say how many positions were
new cuts and how many related to previous layoff efforts under way
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has made no decision about the fate of a
microelectronics plant in Quincy, which employs about 450 and for
which the company is considering a sale or closure, Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   In all Raytheon will spend $92 million on severance packages,
and another $55 million for facility closures, none of which will
occur in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for several hours on their conference call Tuesday,
Burnham and chief financial officer Frank Caine ran through a
litany of issues facing Raytheon, the country's third-largest
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Of great concern to investors is the success of Raytheon's
Patriot missile, which it markets heavily to countries like Greece,
Taiwan, and South Korea in packages worth around $1 billion and up.
Raytheon had hinted it was close to another major deal, but said it
expects no major Patriot orders before next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, increased competition from Russian and French suppliers
means it expects slimmer profit margins on Patriot than it once
expected, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said the single largest portion of the charge it will
take, $320 million, relates to various operating shortcomings at
Raytheon Systems Co. and at Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors,
which builds power plants and other big infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that amount, $105 million, relates to two military
programs the company said it couldn't identify pending further
negotiations with the Pentagon. In addition, Raytheon said it will
have to write off certain inventories of its AMRAM and Sparrow
air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said $25 million of the charge relates to work in
a joint venture with Boeing Co. for business jets. On work for that
contract, ``Our performance has not been good and created a $25
million embarrassment/overrun for us,'' Caine said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it now estimates 1999 revenue of about $20
billion, about $600 million less than previously forecast, and that
revenue in 2000 won't grow by more than 3 percent, down from its
earlier growth estimate of 6 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company now estimates it will earn $2.70 to $2.80 per share
before charges, compared with analyst estimates of about $3.56 per
share. For next year Raytheon estimates earnings of $2.10 to $2.25,
compared to Wall Street estimates of about $3.91 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Also, revenue suffered because the company couldn't hire enough
software engineers, Burnham said, falling 1,000 short of its goal
of hiring 6,000 workers with such skills this year.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said about $35 million in charges relate to
Raytheon's involvement in the troubled Iridium satellite-phone
network, led by Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon had planned to detail its bad news at analyst
conferences scheduled for Wednesday, but the company scrubbed those
meetings and moved up its schedule because of an article published
in The Wall Street Journal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources, the story said the company had been
criticized by Pentagon procurement officials for lagging work on
contracts including those for the Tomahawk cruise missile, RC-135
aircraft and Javelin shoulder-fired missile.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham and Caine denied the central elements of that article,
however, saying work on all three programs is proceeding on or
ahead of schedule. A Pentagon spokesman said the agency retains its
confidence in the company, and a Navy spokeswoman for the Tomahawk
program said work is proceeding on schedule and under budget.
Officials for the other programs couldn't be reached to comment
late Tuesday.

 NEW YORK: opera, ``Falstaff.'')  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And Verdi's predecessors did all this even more than he. In the
case of Donizetti and ``Lucia,'' it is probably exaggerated to call
the current Met production a different ``version'' of the score. A
different approach, yes, because Sir Charles has rethought the
embellishments from the ground up. He has also restored many cuts;
but so did the team that performed the opera with Edita Gruberova a
few seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Lucia'' at the Met, even at its most transposed and
altered, has always been closer to the composer's original than,
say, ``Giulio Cesare'' or ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' have been.
</P>
<P>
   As for the keys: since the Lucia arias have traditionally been
sung in lower keys and very high notes have been added at their
conclusions, it has been easy for many to assume that the high
notes are the reason for the transpositions. But history does not
bear this out; the Lucia arias were being sung (and published) in
the familiar transpositions within a decade of the opera's
premiere, long before the ultrahigh added notes became standard.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary record, for those who enjoy poring through it,
is clear that as late as the turn of the expiring century, more
Lucias sang the role without high E flats than with. And yet they
were singing in the lower keys. It is much more a matter of the
usual reason for transposition: general vocal ``fit'' between
singer and music.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual fossilization of certain ``standard'' interpolations
_ in this opera and in many others _ was a phenomenon of the
post-World War I period, as the few surviving operas from the age
of improvisation were equipped for life in an operatic environment
no longer hospitable to improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   So everybody should lighten up. Wagner was the most continuous
and least transposable of opera composers (and he sensibly avoided
unusual high notes, probably in part for that reason); yet even
Wagner accepted transpositions for the abandoned first production
of ``Tristan,'' and certain transpositions have functioned well
enough in his scores. Helen Traubel always sang Brunnhilde's Battle
Cry in B flat, not B. At Bayreuth itself, Senta's Ballade was
transposed upward for the young voice of Anja Silja (just as the
little aria of Mozart's Masetto is usually transposed up for the
youngish baritones who sing the part).
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of practicality, not principle. If the
transition can be made with some harmonic elegance, and if the
musical loss is either negligible or, at worst, small enough to be
outweighed by the performance it makes possible, then _ no big
deal. If it can't be, then one decides, OK, that singer can't do
that role.
</P>
<P>
   The ``overall harmonic conception'' is important to the
composer's inspiration if it is _ and sometimes it is. But as the
composers themselves knew, that takes its place among many other
priorities when it comes down to what happens on the individual
night, and sometimes it can yield.
</P>
<P>
   As for Domingo, meanwhile: if Verdi had not opened up his
autograph score and scratched out some key signatures, ``Otello''
itself would be with ``Lucia'' and ``Norma'' on the list of operas
that changed between manuscript and publication. The quartet in Act
II, where Desdemona asks her husband's pardon and Iago finagles the
famous handkerchief from his wife, was originally composed in B.
Verdi moved it to B flat during rehearsals, and though we have no
correspondence on the matter, the reason could hardly be more
obvious: as written, the piece required two sustained high Bs, a
note Otello is otherwise required to touch only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to surmise, from what we know of Francesco Tamagno,
that these were difficult for the original singer of Otello,
especially given the lyrical context of the lines in question.
</P>
<P>
   If Tamagno had needed the other transpositions that are being
used at the Met, would Verdi have provided them? Or would he have
made local adjustments in the vocal part to render them
unnecessary? Or would he have said, ``All right, too much, let's
get another singer''? We can't know.
</P>
<P>
   If he were around right now, and ``get another singer'' meant
forgoing the services of a beloved artist who had much to offer, in
a role whose distinguished exponents are painfully rare _ well, I
don't think there's a lot of doubt here.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to remember is that what happens on a given
evening cannot really ``damage'' a musical score. It is still
there, and nothing prevents its being performed unaltered another
day. The moment an Otello of comparable caliber arrives who is
comfortable with the original keys (as our current one was from
1976 until now), those keys will be right there waiting for him.
Meanwhile, rest easy, Maestro Domingo; the ghost of Verdi is on
your side.

IN SHIFT, PHILIP MORRIS ACKNOWLEDGES EVIDENCE THAT SMOKING CAUSES
DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. is acknowledging that scientific evidence
shows that smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases,
after decades of disputing the findings of the U.S. surgeon general
and other medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette
maker, has moved closer to prevailing scientific opinions about the
health risks of smoking, as it has faced increasing pressure from
smoking-related lawsuits, regulators and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on a new Internet site it is unveiling Wednesday as part of
a $100 million corporate image campaign, the company unequivocally
states there is an ``overwhelming medical and scientific consensus
that cigarette smoking causes'' diseases including lung cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that smoking ``is addictive as that term is most
commonly used today.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' move is part of a trend among tobacco producers
to try to put health-related issues behind them, after agreeing in
the last two years to pay $246 billion to settle lawsuits brought
by states seeking to recover their Medicaid costs for treating ill
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   By making more disclosures about smoking risks, producers also
want to make it harder for those who start smoking now to sue by
claiming they were unaware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. created a Web site with
information on health issues last year, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. is in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-smoking advocates who were read the new statements
by Philip Morris said they were a marked shift for the company,
particularly in the area of smoking and health. Previously, the
company had contended, for example, that smoking was a ``risk
factor'' or a ``causal factor'' in diseases like lung cancer, not
that it caused the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a profound change,'' said Dr. David Kessler, the former
head of the Food and Drug Administration, who launched a federal
effort to regulate tobacco, in response to the company's
statements. ``It really sets a new stage for regulation and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
an advocacy group in Washington, agreed but added that Philip
Morris still had not taken the final step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acknowledgments seem to be an abandonment once and for all
of the campaign of sowing doubts in the minds of consumers,'' said
Myers. ``But it falls a critical step short because it doesn't say
whether Philip Morris agrees with these conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Philip Morris chairman Geoffrey Bible testified
before a Senate committee that the company acknowledged that
substantial evidence supported the ``judgment that smoking plays a
causal role'' in diseases like lung cancer. Bible also testified
that the company recognized that ``under some definitions,
cigarette smoking is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bible declined Tuesday to be interviewed. But responding to
Myers' comments, Steven Parrish, a senior vice president at Philip
Morris, said that Philip Morris was ``not going to dispute that
smoking causes cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the company would still require any
plaintiff in a lawsuit to prove that their disease was caused by
smoking rather than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish added that the change in Philip Morris' position was not
the result of any new scientific findings. He said it had come
because the company had decided to take a less combative and
defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Philip Morris had not changed its stance earlier, he
said ``that is all water under the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company's new Internet site (www.philipmorris.com) is one
part of the Philip Morris campaign intended to reshape its
corporate image. Company officials said they will spend some $100
million annually on the effort, which will include television
advertisements emphasizing the company's charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, Philip Morris will also downplay its
role as a cigarette producer. For example, while the company Web
site will contain the logos of two of its major divisions, Kraft
Foods and Miller Brewing, it does not show the distinctive logo of
the Philip Morris tobacco division or the red-and-white chevron of
its leading brand, Marlboro.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parrish also said that another major goal of the campaign would
be to redirect the often-acrimonious debate about smoking into a
constructive one. ``This is a serious and good faith effort on our
part to try to engage in a dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco revised its Internet site
to reflect its stance on smoking and health issues. On it the
company states it ``believes that it is appropriate for the public
health community to conclude and warn the public that cigarette
smoking causes certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Payne, an official of R.J. Reynolds, said that producer
was also creating an Internet site that will speak ``more directly
and candidly'' about the issues of smoking and health. Payne said
he believed the industry effort followed a recently settled round
of lawsuits between cigarette makers and state attorneys general
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In those lawsuits, the states argued that cigarette makers
should reimburse them for the cost of smoking-related health care
costs because they had misled the public by vigorously disputing
government findings about smoking and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new phase from a manufacturer's standpoint of how
you talk about the issues surrounding cigarettes,'' said Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco producers, however, still face numerous legal problems.
In September, the federal government filed a major lawsuit that
charges cigarette makers with fraud and seeks to recover billions
in health care expenses. Two smokers also recently won separate
multimillion dollar judgment against Philip Morris, though the
company has appealed the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, said he believed
that the recent steps by Philip Morris were important in that they
might give cigarette makers an opportunity to act on decisions they
might have made decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry could have gone down this road in 1964
but decided instead to engage in a campaign of fraud and deception
that it is now paying for,'' he said.

   The Good-Natured Goliath
</P>
<P>
   If you ever were around Wilt Chamberlain up close, you had to
believe he might someday be the world's oldest living person. Maybe
nobody has ever been that big, that strong, and in that good shape.
For him to die suddenly at age 63, of a heart attack, well, you
just never thought anybody or anything would dare attack him.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the basketball court ever did.
</P>
<P>
   He once said, ``Nobody loves Goliath,'' but he was a
good-natured Goliath. In the 1970 National Basketball Association
finals, he was falling back on defense when Knicks guard Dick
Barnett tripped. While keeping his eyes on the ball, the 7-foot
275-pound Laker center reached out with his right arm and, to
prevent Barnett from falling, cradled him in mid-air as if he were
a child.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently thinking Wilt was holding him on purpose, Barnett
pumped his legs and swung his arms in frustration. With his eyes
still on the ball, Wilt gently restored Barnett to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   As big and strong as Wilt was, if he had been mean and nasty, he
would have been frightening, but he was never really belligerent.
Brutal sometimes, if only by accident, but never belligerent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt scored 100 points in a game for the Philadelphia Warriors
against the Knicks in Hershey, Pa. on March 2, 1962 when some NBA
teams still played a few home games in small nearby cities. That
same season he averaged 50.4 points a game. Averaged.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt once grabbed 55 rebounds in a game against the Celtics in
the Boston Garden. Some centers now don't get 55 rebounds in five
games, but Wilt got them against Bill Russell, the Celtics'
spider-armed center, who remembers that game only too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw every one of those 55 rebounds,'' Russell has cackled.
</P>
<P>
   Those who saw Chamberlain and Russell will always argue who was
better. For team value, Russell was the center of gravity in the
Celtic dynasty: 11 NBA championships in 13 seasons, from 1957 to
1969. For sheer individual dominance, Chamberlain was incomparable;
he also dominated two championship teams, the 1967 Philadelphia
76ers and the 1972 Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt had flaws. Although he hit 28 of 32 free throws in his
100-point game, later in his 14-year career his free-throw
percentage once dipped as low as .380. At the foul line he simply
appeared psyched out. When he was criticized for shooting too much,
he sometimes preferred to pass the ball rather than shoot just to
prove he wasn't a ball hog.
</P>
<P>
   He lived as large as he was. Never married, he claimed in his
autobiography that he had made love with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   For all his fame in basketball, his private passion was
volleyball. He once hoped to be allowed to try out for the U.S.
Olympic volleyball team, but in those years his status as a pro
basketball player made him ineligible for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, more than a quarter of a century after he stopped
playing basketball, the NBA has never had a player quite like him.
Nobody that big and that strong.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after Wilt stopped playing, he toyed with the idea
of a comeback. On the day he visited the Knicks' offices in Madison
Square Garden, he talked to Red Holzman, then strode out to the
elevator. When it opened, two deliverymen were struggling with a
dolly piled high with boxes of office supplies, mostly letterheads
and envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   The load was so heavy, the elevator had stopped maybe four
inches below the floor level and now the deliverymen were huffing
and puffing, but they couldn't raise the dolly high enough to get
it on the floor level.
</P>
<P>
   After maybe two minutes of the deliverymen's huffing and
puffing, Wilt, his biceps bulging in a tank top, peered down at
them and intoned, ``Gentlemen, maybe I can help.'' They stepped
back, he stepped into the elevator, grabbed each end of the rope
slung under the dolly and without much exertion, quickly lifted the
dolly onto the floor level.
</P>
<P>
   Looking up in awe, the deliverymen said, ``Thank you.'' Wilt
said, ``You're welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilt stepped into the elevator and rode down to the street level
as another witness followed the two deliverymen toward the Knick
offices and asked, ``How much does all this weigh?'' They quickly
surveyed the stack of big boxes of office supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close to 600 pounds,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain had lifted that load only a few inches, but
those two husky deliverymen hadn't been able to budge it. He did it
as easily as he had once cradled Dick Barnett in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe nobody loved Goliath, but he was a good guy.

 &HT;    WITH DEAL ELUSIVE, TEST BAN TREATY FACES FATAL VOTE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shadowed by a military coup in the world's newest
nuclear power, President Clinton and his Democratic allies sought
in vain Tuesday for a deal that would prevent Senate rejection of
an international ban on testing atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans vowed to kill the test ban treaty outright on
Wednesday unless its backers pledge in writing to abandon the
accord until after Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that the White House does not feel
comfortable
</P>
<P>
   with,'' responded White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``I think
it sends the message that, no matter what happens in the world, we
have given up our leadership position in nonproliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lockhart spoke at the White House, military officials in
Islamabad announced that they had overthrown the democratically
elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was
reportedly placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's coup in Pakistan, which joined the nuclear club 17
months ago, provided an ominous backdrop to several hours of Senate
debate over the fate of the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to be voting down the treaty on the day that
there's a coup in Pakistan?'' asked Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the
ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``This
is high-stakes poker here.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the treaty about 20 votes short of the support needed
for ratification in the Senate, the body's Republican leadership
made it clear that one way or another, the treaty would be laid to
rest on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when all the sand drains out of this glass,'' said John
Czwartacki, press spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly comfortable having a vote,'' Lott told
reporters. ``This treaty is fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became the first national leader to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would outlaw test explosions
of nuclear bombs, in 1996. The next year he sent the treaty to the
Senate, asking that it be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The pact has been signed by 154 nations, but will not take
effect unless the United States and 43 other nuclear-capable
countries ratify it. So far, roughly half of them have done so.
</P>
<P>
   A ratification vote in the Senate had been expected as early as
Tuesday, but it was put off and scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification requires a two-thirds majority vote in the
100-member Senate, but fewer than 50 Senators are thought to favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is opposed chiefly by Republicans, who contend it
would hamstring U.S. weapons development efforts, undermine the
American nuclear deterrent, and would be susceptible to cheating by
rogue states with nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in the best interest of our nation to ratify this
treaty,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world would be a more unstable ... not a more stable
place,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., ``if this treaty were to be
ratified.''
</P>
<P>
   With the treaty facing certain defeat, disheartened Democrats
pleaded with Republicans to defer a vote on the accord, in the hope
of keeping it alive for possible ratification next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of the treaty have won, for now, so why push for
a vote?'' asked Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Can't we find a
way to avoid just good old-fashioned gridlock?''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties were trying to agree on a way to put off
the vote. As of late Tuesday, though, no deal had been struck,
according to Lott's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several drafts going back and forth,'' said
Czwartacki. ``The key is finding the airtight language that
guarantees it (the treaty) not come up in this Congress. ... hat's
what's proving elusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had proposed language that would allow the treaty to
be revived in the current Congress if there were extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hole big enough to drive a truck through,'' objected
Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the treaty's foes opposed any such deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had plenty of time to study the treaty,'' Smith said.
``We're here to vote, that's what we're here for.''

 &HT;    Lagerfeld gives Chanel wearability
 &HT;    By Robert Janjigian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Among fashion insiders, when a collection is described
as ``commercial,'' it is tantamount to saying a designer has taken
a rest from pushing the edge of the style envelope. In other words,
there's something wearable lurking in there.
</P>
<P>
   At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld managed to create a spring-summer
collection that incorporated many of the directional concepts seen
on other runways, while making them palatable for the women who
actually buy and wear high-ticket, high-fashion clothing. It was a
collection of great depth and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   He employed snakeskin, but made the material his own by dyeing
it in colors and applying a little sparkle to the surface. There
was leather and there was lace. Colors were brilliant, and included
melons, yellows, pinks, orange and lavender, as well as basic black
and white.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld used denim, but not in an overwhelming way. The
designer handled the fabric as another texture, rather than making
it an excuse to bring street looks to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Layering also played a big part in the Chanel show look, but
with new twists. There was something for the minimalist, as in
sleek two-piece day dresses with a simple geometric Courreges-style
look, as well as the maximalist _ puffy satin party dresses. These
followed the trend toward shorter cocktail lengths for evening, but
were upbeat and sassy.
</P>
<P>
   With tweedy suits, Chanel's bread-and-butter, Lagerfeld updated
them by including a soft, contrasting scarf hem.
</P>
<P>
   Big, bold abstract floral printed silks, which included double-C
logos, were soft and ruffled and cut into sensible dresses and
skirts. Long dresses, all in black, made an elegant statement from
the house where little black dresses originated.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld hasn't given up his quest for giving Chanel a singular
presence, a signature identity in a competitive fashion arena where
everybody's clamoring to create an identifiable look. Most
designers resort to sticking their name or initials onto as many
things as possible. Lagerfeld has gone beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   While many models indeed had jeweled double-C logos tattooed on
their upper arms or across their chests (a temporary measure that
was hopefully for the runway only), you didn't leave the
presentation thinking you'd witnessed a Chanel logo fest, or that
you couldn't go out of the house wearing anything unless your name
started with ``C.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lagerfeld turned his full attention toward the quilted
surfaces associated with Chanel handbags. He chose a more pillowy
version of the grid quilting, applying it to a large number of
ensembles, such as the waistband of pleated skirts. Quilted vests
and asymmetrically wrapped bustiers were a refined step away from
fencing or bulletproof protective garb. The gauntlet-style gloves,
which were made of quilted leather, prompted one onlooker to
comment, ``Hey, those would make great grill mitts for next
summer's barbecues.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the message of the quilting was clear and its
application clever.

AFL-CIO EXPECTED TO ENDORSE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore, who has endured weeks of
bad political news and ever-tightening polls, Tuesday hailed the
all-but-certain endorsement of AFL-CIO as a campaign turning point
that will provide thousands of key organizers and millions of
dollars in financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lift for the campaign. This puts us in a strong
position to win the nomination,'' Donna Brazile, who was promoted
to be Gore's campaign manager in the recent shake-up, said in an
interview here Tuesday. ``In 1992,labor provided one quarter of the
delegates to the Democratic convention, so this is important.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said the endorsement,
which is to be made official Wednesday, will provide Gore with an
unspecified amount of money _ he called it ``gazillions'' _ as well
as invaluable support from organizers who can turn an election in
key states such as Iowa, California and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the optimistic words, the AFL-CIO endorsement hardly
assures Gore a victory over his lone rival for the nomination,
former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley. Some unions are likely to
go their own way, endorsing Bradley or perhaps the Republican
nominee. And union members don't always take the suggestion of the
party leadership. Still, the AFL-CIO remains one of the most
important political and financial players in Democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can use all the help he can get. In the most recent round
of bad news for Gore, a CNN-USA poll found that Gore leads Bradley
by 51 percent to 39 percent among likely Democratic primary voters.
By comparison, the same poll taken last month found Gore ahead by
63 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was significant because Bradley's strength until
recently has been concentrated in the few early primary and caucus
states where he has campaigned heavily. The poll indicated that the
burst of positive publicity that Bradley has received in the past
few weeks has translated into national support.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal acknowledged that the union membership and support
might be less important in some early states such as New Hampshire,
Delaware and South Carolina. But he said it could be a decisive
factor in many other states, particularly the large bloc that votes
next March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that Al Gore can win the nomination and the
White House and we think he is a much better candidate than the
media depicts,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement has been all but certain for days. Sweeney said
in an interview last week that the only question was when the
endorsement would come. Tuesday night, any remaining doubt was
expected to be erased when the AFL-CIO's political committee met to
vote on a recommendation. Union officials said there was no doubt
that Gore would get the nod, although Teamsters president James
Hoffa continued to try to urge other union leaders to delay an
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to speak publicly about the endorsement until it
becomes official Wednesday, but he said through his spokesmen that
he expected it to be a turning point in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first primary of the Democratic campaign,''
Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said at the Los Angeles convention
center, where the AFL-CIO convention is being held _ and which is
also the site of next year's Democratic national convention. Lehane
said that the endorsement was ``good groundwork'' for winning the
nomination at the convention center next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore arrived in Los Angeles Tuesday and promptly began visiting
the hotels of union presidents, thanking them for support.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley had little hope of snaring the AFL-CIO
endorsement, the former senator did hope to delay it for several
months. Bradley spent considerable time courting the Teamsters,
siding with the union in their request to block Mexican trucks with
imported goods from crossing the US border until more inspectors
are hired. While Bradley helped write the North American Free Trade
Act (NAFTA), he hoped his support of the delay of the
truck-crossing measure would translate into union support. Gore,
also a NAFTA backer, has also said he is reviewing the truck issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, as the incumbent vice president, has used the
advantages of his office to court labor, and President Clinton has
worked hard on Gore's behalf, promising to implement pro-labor
policies and meeting last Thursday in New York City with Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While union membership has been declining, it is still important
politically. The AFL-CIO believes that labor played a major role in
the election of Democratic governors in Iowa and California in
1988, which are important states in the presidential campaign as
well. Still, labor strength varies greatly from state to state.
Lehane said, for example, that union members make up 20 percent of
likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, 28 percent in New York,
36 percent in California and 38 percent in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said that as soon as the endorsement is announced, the
AFL-CIO will begin conducting state-by-state meetings aimed at
organizing the Gore vote. The labor leaders will work closely with
the Gore campaign and state organizations to register voters,
especially minorities, and launch get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal vowed to run a positive campaign on Gore's behalf,
noting that Bradley has ``served himself very well over the last
few months in establishing strong ties to labor. We intend to run a
very positive campaign about Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was invited to speak to the convention, and he had hoped
to appear here if the AFL-CIO decided to delay the endorsement. But
even though Bradley is slated to be in the Los Angeles area for
fund-raising, he is not expected to show up at the convention
because Gore is getting the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaign officials could not be reached for comment
Tuesday night on the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's win with labor did not come without a glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee AFL-CIO President Jim Neeley, attending the
convention, made excuses for the vice president, whose campaign
hired a non-union contractor last week to do the initial wiring of
his new Nashville, Tenn., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Modern Electrical Contracting had 30 phone and computer lines
installed for Gore by last Friday, when the New York Daily News
first reported the contract. They were pulled from the job Friday
night.

FRENCH-ITALIAN ALLIANCE TAKES CONTROLLING STAKE IN FENDI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The world's biggest luxury-goods company, LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France, forged an unusual alliance
Tuesday with the Italian fashion house Prada to take control of
Fendi SpA, ending a months-long battle for the Rome-based design
house known for its trendy Baguette bags, chic sunglasses and furs
by the designer Karl Lagerfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement announced Tuesday, LVMH and Prada paid an
undisclosed amount for a 51 percent stake. Advisers said privately
that the two buyers paid about $520 million, which values the
company around $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale hands control of Fendi to Bernard Arnault, the chairman
of LVMH, and the Prada chairman, Patrizio Bertelli, but leaves the
general management, styling and promotion in the hands of the five
Fendi sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fendi today is maybe like Gucci or Prada five years ago; we
want to give this name the full potential,'' Arnault said. ``It is
a very, very hot brand.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to inject a note of continuity, the announcement said that
the Fendis, LVMH and Prada would ``count even in future on the
valuable collaboration of Karl Lagerfeld,'' Fendi's ready-to-wear
designer since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The prominent mention of Lagerfeld lent credence to reports here
that the five sisters, who each own 20 percent of Fendi, had relied
on Lagerfeld's judgment in deciding upon a new majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal was the latest in a series of corporate
shake-ups in the world of luxury goods, which is undergoing rapid
consolidation. That a Frenchman could step in and buy control of
one of Italy's hottest fashion houses was thought by analysts to
have been made possible by the alliance with Prada and Bertelli,
its acquisitive owner.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Arnault of LVMH fought a bitter takeover
battle for another star of the Italian design world, Gucci. In the
midst of that battle, Bertelli emerged as an ally, when he agreed
to sell a 9.5 percent stake in Gucci that he had amassed to LVMH.
But Gucci's chairman, Domenico De Sole, thwarted the hostile bid by
LVMH when he sold a stake in Gucci to a white knight, Francois
Pinault, a French billionaire and owner of the department-store
chain Pinault-Printemps-Redoute.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking Fendi, Arnault and De Sole fought again. Though
Fendi's sales have been booming _ thanks largely to its Baguette
bags, a sought-after item since their introduction in the fall of
1997, and Lagerfeld's acclaimed ready-to-wear collection _ the
company is poorly managed and lacks the capital to finance global
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Arnault, in an interview, said that ``on the side of Prada, they
will bring production and creativity in Italy,'' while LVMH would
``bring the international network of shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Prada and LVMH are obligated to acquire any of
the 49 percent of Fendi that the sisters should decide to sell in
the future. Arnault said LVMH and Prada held a common view on
quality and image, and on where the market is going.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gucci, which made $3 billion when it sold a 45 percent stake
to Pinault, the Fendi decision was the second setback in recent
days. On Friday, Gucci reported hitches in its plans to acquire
from Pinault the company that controls the Yves Saint Laurent
brand, Sanofi Beaute, apparently over difficulties with Pierre
Berge, the partner of Yves Saint Laurent and the company's chief
executive. But Gucci says it expects to settle that deal within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   De Sole evidently backed away from Fendi when the bidding with
Arnault pushed the price that Fendi was asking beyond what he was
thought Gucci should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Fendi says it expects revenue from direct sales and licensed
products to total $330 million this year, up from $321 million in
1998. But De Sole saw the revenue figures as considerably lower.
</P>
<P>
   What appears to have tipped the scales in favor of the
LVMH-Prada link, beyond price, was the concession to Fendi's
creative control of the company. Anna Fendi, one of the sisters and
the mother of Silvia Venturini, the designer of the Baguette bag,
told an Italian news agency, Radiocor, that, ``we will keep Fendi,
even if there will be a merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Prada and LVMH have been spending freely in recent months
to fatten their portfolios of luxury-goods companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, LVMH paid roughly $800 million to acquire the
Swiss maker of luxury watches, Tag Heuer AG, and took a controlling
share in a San Francisco cosmetics company, Benefit Cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, LVMH acquired a controlling share of a British
high-quality shirtmaker, Thomas Pink. Prada, for its part,
announced this summer that it was acquiring controlling stakes in
two privately owned fashion houses, Jil Sander of Germany, and
Helmut Lang, an Austrian design house now based in New York.

anything other than a gift to the audience. It's never been just
for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ralph Fiennes &LR; , who was in a London production of ``Ivanov,''
made some ``fundamental'' errors. ``He chose to play passion loud.
The danger of that is the minute you play passion loud, it's
tantamount to being aggressive. You put the audience at arm's
length.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Anthony Hopkins &LR;  is ``an intriguing actor, &LR; '' but ``a strange
creature. He feels that if he isn't shaking his head, he's not
getting his passion across. ... If you shake your head and shout,
it can give the impression that you don't understand. ... That's
when it becomes what is called ham.''
</P>
<P>
   On the difference between movies and the theater, Hurt said,
``Theater presents something. In cinema you let people into the
world you're weaving. That's the glory of film. It's immensely
private. You get to create a reality and invite the audience to see
things that they don't normally see.''

JOHN HANCOCK PRESIDENT TO BECOME CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a swift reshuffle on the eve of its metamorphosis
into a Wall Street-listed player, John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. said Tuesday that its president, David F.
D'Alessandro, would succeed Stephen L. Brown as chief executive
next June.
</P>
<P>
   The change, approved by Hancock's board, is designed to reassure
investors about management issues before the Boston-based insurer
sells around $2 billion in stock to the public in early 2000, in a
highly anticipated initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, Hancock's president and chief operations officer,
had long been pegged for the top job. But with company policy not
requiring Brown, 62, to retire for another two years,
D'Alessandro's ascension to the main post will come sooner than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The change will bring the insurance industry's most unorthodox,
flamboyant, and outspoken player to the helm of a once-staid
company in the midst of major change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted things to be clear before the IPO and the
roadshow,'' D'Alessandro said in a brief interview, referring to
presentations that Hancock will make to investors around the
country before selling stock. Brown will remain chairman of Hancock
and play a more active role in overseeing its mutual fund
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock officials said it was Brown's idea to step down on June
1 after eight years in the top job. ``It is very important for our
policyholders, our future investors, and Wall Street to know who
will be at the management helm of our company, what role they will
play,'' Brown said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro, 48, is the youngest chief executive ever in
Hancock's 137-year history. A journalism and public relations major
at Utica College who took one semester of mathematics and never
went to business school, he is a far cry from the typical,
gray-suited insurance executive. A marketing specialist famed for
his flashy ties, he joined Hancock in 1984 as a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Atypical for a hidebound industry, his activities have gone
beyond traditional insurance. D'Alessandro is best known in Boston
as the man who revived the flagging Boston Marathon. And earlier
this year he became a vocal critic of the International Olympic
Committee and its corruption scandal _ despite Hancock's status as
a major Olympics sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the low-profile Brown, a trained actuary who spent
his entire career at Hancock after graduating from Middlebury
College in 1958, joined the company when he was 21 and rose slowly
through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the company is going to demand to be run
differently,'' D'Alessandro said in a brief interview. ``This
company is going to be driven by shareholder value, which is an
entirely different concept from focusing on just earnings and
surplus growth.'' The latter is a measure of wealth particular to
the insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is a mutual insurer, meaning it is formally owned by its
policyholders. Like many of its competitors, it no longer regards
that centuries-old form of ownership as practical in the modern
financial services world, and will instead become a publicly traded
company, with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Eligible policyholders will trade their ownership ``rights'' for
cash, stock, or souped-up policies.?
</P>
<P>
   But the IPO, which could be the industry's largest ever, is not
just designed to raise extra cash to pay shareholders. Hancock
wants stock in order to finance acquisitions and to attract and
retain top talent.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, one of the insurance industry's most profitable
companies, sells various forms of insurance, including life,
long-term care and annuities, and mutual funds, which are sold
through through third-party channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see Hancock recognize its role more actively
as a manufacturer, rather than as a distributor, of products,''
D'Alessandro said, referring to plans to expand Hancock's presence
in the investment management business.
</P>
<P>
   While Hancock cannot make acquisitions for two years after the
public offering, some industry analysts see it merging with another
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're not interested in a bank, but when you look
at their operations, there are natural synergies to be gained in
being with a broader financial services company,'' said Michael
Cowan, an industry analyst at A M Best, a ratings firm.
</P>
<P>
   Under Brown, the nation's sixth-largest mutual insurer doubled
its assets under management to $124.4 billion and grew net income
by 140 percent to $627 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro is credited with revamping Hancock's career sales
ranks and launching successful advertising campaigns. As president,
he is in charge of insurance and retail investments, technology,
personnel, marketing, and financial operations.
</P>
<P>
   As chief executive, D'Alessandro will also oversee Hancock's
investment operations, institutional pension business, and
corporate strategy. Hancock said D'Alessandro now oversees
Hancock's investment and pension sector. Brown remains on Hancock's
important policy-making committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the personality of the chief executive says a lot
about the personality of the company,'' Cowan said. ``With Dave,
you're going to see some real action.''

DILEMMAS OF A SINGLE MAYOR
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Jason Nastke &LR; , 20-year-old mayor of Valatie, N.Y. (population
1,500), is interviewed in the latest issue of Seventeen magazine.
His remarks on leisure activities might be instructive for San
Francisco's bachelor mayor:
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``What do you do in your free time?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ``What I love most is dating! I get so many dates because of
who I am. People are intimidated by me, but I tell them, `Hey, I'm
just Jason!' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHN HURT'S ACTING LESSONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The British actor  &UR; John Hurt &LR;  shares some unusually frank
appraisals of fellow actors in the latest issue of Madison
magazine:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Robert De Niro &LR;  is ``brilliant in comedy because he stops
worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Hurt has never known ``a performance of  &UR; Brando &LR; 's that was
anything other than a gift to the audience. It's never been just
for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ralph Fiennes &LR; , who was in a London production of ``Ivanov,''
made some ``fundamental'' errors. ``He chose to play passion loud.
The danger of that is the minute you play passion loud, it's
tantamount to being aggressive. You put the audience at arm's
length.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Anthony Hopkins &LR;  is ``an intriguing actor, &LR; '' but ``a strange
creature. He feels that if he isn't shaking his head, he's not
getting his passion across. ... If you shake your head and shout,
it can give the impression that you don't understand. ... That's
when it becomes what is called ham.''
</P>
<P>
   On the difference between movies and the theater, Hurt said,
``Theater presents something. In cinema you let people into the
world you're weaving. That's the glory of film. It's immensely
private. You get to create a reality and invite the audience to see
things that they don't normally see.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANCHORMAN SPEAKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A letter from the Cultural Institutions Group, a New York
consortium of museums and arts groups, protesting Mayor  &UR; Rudolph &LR; 
 &UR; Giuliani &LR; 's threats to the Brooklyn Museum over its ``Sensations''
show went unsigned by a third of the group's members. One major
abstainer was Carnegie Hall, whose representative told the New York
Times: ``The only statement we can make is that we have no
statement to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so board member  &UR; Peter Jennings &LR; . Although Jennings, the
ABC-TV anchorman, said he was unable to attend the meeting in which
a vote was taken, he stepped beyond the traditional journalist's
neutrality on the issue. ``It's a mistake for Carnegie Hall, a
leading cultural institution, to remain mute,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ An appeal for blood donors by German Health Minister  &UR; Andrea &LR; 
 &UR; Fischer &LR;  elicited a response from  &UR; Count Dracula &LR; , says a note from
Chemical and Engineering News forwarded by  &UR; Peter Linde &LR; . The
count, whose full name is Ottomar Rudolphe Vlad Dracul Prince
Kretzulesco, is the last link of the Dracul family, &LR;  and lives in a
castle near Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   He led an August campaign for blood, &LR;  and attended vampire movie
screenings intended to attract donors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Science fiction editor, actor and writer &UR; Forrest J. Ackerman &LR; ,
81, who was  &UR; Ed Wood &LR; 's agent and coined the term ``sci-fi,'' got
his start in the genre with his first published story, in The San
Francisco Chronicle in 1929. In Ackerman's story, ``A Trip to
Mars,'' a copy of The Chronicle saved the world from destruction.
Personals returns the favor by mentioning he'll be at Booksmith on
Haight Street on October 15  &LR; at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Variety reports that Sen.  &UR; John McCain &LR; , R-Ariz., a
presidential candidate, has sold movie rights to his book, ``Faith
of My Fathers,'' to USA Films, which is run by  &UR; Barry &LR; 
 &UR; Diller &LR; . Buyer and seller are refusing to discuss dollar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love bed. I (was) ... in bed for seven years, and then got
up and went around the world. Of course, in those days there were
more servants to bring you the food and things. But it was nice,
wasn't it? Just went to bed for seven years.''

CONSULTANT ON PREVENTING SCHOOL VIOLENCE IS KEEPING BUSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By SCOTT COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ These are busy days for Ronald
Stephens, an expert on school violence.
</P>
<P>
   A stack of 20 as-yet-unanswered phone messages bellows like an
accordion from Stephens' open briefcase. His well-thumbed date book
is jammed with appointments in a tiny scrawl. He started the week
leading a seminar in New Mexico; now he is about to fly to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in deep trouble,'' he jokes, when asked how his wife copes
with his long absences from home (about a third of his time since
January).
</P>
<P>
   As horrible as the nation's spate of school shootings has been
for students, parents and administrators, it has been a boon for
Stephens, head of the National School Safety Center in this
wealthy, bucolic Los Angeles suburb just east of Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   He has become one of the nation's most widely quoted authorities
on school violence. In May, a month after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., Stephens appeared on
television 25 times. His writings on school safety have been
published in a number of newspapers and magazines, from USA Today
to the Journal of the American Medical Association. He crisscrosses
the country, giving workshops on school violence, training
administrators to watch for volatile youngsters and inspecting
their schools for security and evaluating their evacuation plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy at Columbine High School has underscored how much
work remains to be done,'' says Stephens, a trim, graying man of
52.
</P>
<P>
   Schools, Stephens hastens to say, remain relatively safe. One of
his favorite statistics, which he often uses in conversations, is
that young people are 99 times more likely to be shot and killed on
the street or at home than in school _ a figure that may bring cold
comfort to worried parents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he belies his own nonchalance by counseling principals
and teachers to be prepared for anything. He seems to be trying to
find a middle ground _ reassuring parents that schools are safe but
making sure that administrators are ready for violence when it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I divide administrators into two camps,'' Stephens said.
``Those who've faced a crisis, and those who are about to.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a recent workshop in Westlake Village, Stephens invited
Pasadena Police Chief Jarado Blue to deliver a rough-and-ready talk
to 37 administrators and school board members who traveled from as
far away as Georgia to get pointers on dealing with violence in
schools. Blue quickly disposed of any remaining complacency in the
room when he referred to the participants in the workshop as ``soft
targets'' _ that is, sitting ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you don't evacuate into an area where a sniper could
shoot,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of his colleagues, Stephens focuses on how to
prevent school violence rather than investigating its root causes.
In preparing his workshops and booklets, Stephens borrows freely
from school districts whose policies he admires. His approach is
mainly prescriptive: administrators should engage in random locker
checks, review the students' use of the Internet at school and
strictly limit visits by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   He encourages schools to develop detailed crisis plans, and he
gives workshop participants quizzes to help them evaluate their
districts' readiness. Arguing that careful preparation can stem a
catastrophe, he notes that eight different SWAT teams responded to
the Columbine shootings, which made coordination difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, Stephens is not a big fan of metal
detectors and closed-circuit cameras, which he believes can create
a false sense of security. ``There's not a high-tech strategy
around that can predict whether a youngster will commit an act of
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many officials, who say they are besieged by would-be safety
experts after every school shooting, have come to trust Stephens as
a consistent and moderating influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he's probably the most knowledgeable person involved
with school safety,'' says Bob Moore, superintendent of the
Independent School District in Amarillo, Texas, which paid Stephens
$2,000 last July to talk with school officials.
</P>
<P>
   After his district had a nonfatal shooting in 1991, Moore said,
``We had all these safety consultants coming out of the walls _
they're all trying to sell you something, and a lot of them don't
know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less enthusiastic about Stephens' work. Some critics
are skeptical of his self-scoring checklists, which are supposed to
evaluate problem students and a school's potential for violence.
One such test asks officials, ``Has there been a recent emergence
of an underground student newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Big Brother, doesn't it?'' scoffs Kevin Dwyer,
president of the National Association of School Psychologists in
Bethesda, Md. Dwyer believes such lists often encourage snap
judgments based on weak evidence. ``I think it gets us into this
whole area of `profiling' that we're worried about'' in the society
at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stephens is a Vietnam War veteran who was a social-studies
teacher and school administrator before becoming an education
professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu. In 1984, President
Ronald Reagan created the National School Safety Center, with
support from the Education and Justice departments, and the center
was affiliated with Pepperdine. Stephens was chosen to run the
center in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He is still sorting out some of the hot-button issues
surrounding school violence. When asked his position on gun
control, he said: ``This is a hard topic for me. I feel like
criminals are going to get handguns anyway. I'm still not convinced
that we have to take handguns away from every responsible
citizen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nor has Stephens escaped political controversy. Pepperdine is
perhaps best-known for once offering a job at its law school to
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel whose investigation of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal led to President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the center failed to win a renewable $1 million
federal grant, Stephens, according to a published report, accused
Clinton appointees of rejecting the application because of Starr's
investigation. Education officials denied the charge, and Stephens
now says a reporter misconstrued his position.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the loss of funds has hurt the center, and its annual
budget has plummeted to $250,000 from $1.2 million, requiring
Stephens to lay off half of his eight-member staff. (In the 1980s,
the center had about 30 employees.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said he planned to make up for the shortfall through
corporate sponsors and fund raising, as well as through fees from
workshops and booklets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, Stephens said he was more committed than
ever to spreading his message of school safety. That is partly
because of the headlines that every parent has now grown to dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're dealing with more challenging circumstances now
than ever before,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE RED SOX COULD HIJACK THE SUBWAY SERIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Boston Red Sox beat up on the Cleveland
pitching staff badly enough to outscore the New York area's two
professional football teams combined, 44-9. Now if the Red Sox can
out-hit the Yankees, if they can come up with someone other than
Pedro Martinez to pitch, they just might find themselves with the
chance to ruin two baseball teams in the town that has tormented
them most.
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise that has managed to simultaneously be storied
yet sad, this is the opportunity of the century, the Great American
Century, which happens to acknowledge, that's right, Boston, as its
first official World Series winner in 1903. Now that the 1999 Red
Sox have rid the playoffs of an Indians' logo that is so
insensitive to Native Americans, and with the Mets teaming with
destiny to obstruct the irritating tomahawk-choppers in Atlanta, it
could mean that the baseball gods are trying to settle old debts
before turning the page.
</P>
<P>
   Afford the Red Sox last ups, one finalat a rousing finish
to a century of pain. Give them a shot at denying the hated Yankees
their 25th World Series trophy and the greatest .250 average
baseball will ever know. Then bring on the Mets, and let the Red
Sox square things for the most humiliating experience of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to see who gets to the Series,'' Darryl Strawberry
said. ``It's been a long time for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been since 1918 since the Red Sox won the Series, but they
never suffered as when they were last there, in 1986. No one in the
current Red Sox lineup could vouch for this, like the Yankee who
will start Game 3 of a American League Championship Series that
begins Wednesday night. Roger Clemens wasn't up Tuesday for
dwelling on past failure. Strawberry, however, sounded happy to
report that he's sure Clemens ``looks over at me in here and is
thinking, `He's wearing the ring I should be wearing.'''
</P>
<P>
   An out away in Game 6, the one a young Clemens started, no one
on, and some of the Mets' biggest stars already back in a clubhouse
resigned to defeat, uniforms off. Then a base hit. Then another.
And another, and soon, a wild pitch, and the tying run was crossing
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Someone, as Strawberry recalled Tuesday, in the Mets' clubhouse
said: ``Let's put our clothes back on.''
</P>
<P>
   After being undressed by the Yankees for decades, here come the
Red Sox, the underdog Red Sox, the little engine that could hijack
New York's Subway Series. Here they come for more major league
misery or, if you believe they are armed with the magic of
Martinez, poised to get the last 100-year laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez one-hit the Yankees several weeks ago at Yankee
Stadium, good reason to believe they weren't celebrating the
collapse of the Cleveland staff Monday night. If the Red Sox can
manage a split of the first two games in New York, if the series
somehow goes seven, the Yankees battle cry will be: Gimme an Uh and
an Oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the physical things that Pedro brings to the table,
he's got that psychological edge because of what he's accomplished
this year,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, who gets points
for taking the dramatic license to match Clemens against Martinez
Saturday at Fenway Park in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is nit-picking, but what, exactly, were Martinez and
the Red Sox waiting for Monday night, once Martinez had resolved to
withstand the pain in his back and pitch? Obviously, they were
hoping to get by without him, so he could go three times against
the Yankees. Given the way the rest of the Red Sox pitch and how
the Indians hit, it was a never-say-die script Harrison Ford should
read. Somehow it worked out. The Curse of the Bambino was lifted,
the way it was in Game 5 of the league championship series in 1986,
when the Angels were an out away from taking out the Red Sox in
five.
</P>
<P>
   Then it reappeared, disguised as a ground ball between Bill
Buckner's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible, at the turn of the Millennium, that could be
gone for good?
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what teams are left after this, you're going to have
a great end of the baseball season,'' said Jim Leyritz, the
Yankees' spare part who passed briefly through Boston doing the
journeyman's shuffle the last few years. ``You couldn't have
written a better script.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unless you live west of the Eastern time zone. Honey, we've
shrunk the majors. Sorry, Los Angeles. Too bad, Arizona. How's
that, Bud Selig? This is what the baseball gods have to say about
New Yorkers being made to stay up until 2 a.m. last week to watch
the Mets. When the clock strikes midnight now, we will be
conditioned, alert, waiting for something weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Red Sox win the Series, they might shut down Boston
for a few days,'' said John Valentin. ``And maybe the President
will come to Boston instead of us going to the president.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be the very least they could ask.

TREATY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate conservatives on Tuesday rejected a
compromise by the Republican and Democratic leaders to postpone
action on a treaty banning underground nuclear testing, imperiling
the fate of the accord.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders said they would resume talks on Wednesday to find
wording acceptable to all senators, acknowledging that the treaty
lacks the two-thirds majority to pass. The issue now, they added,
is whether the Senate defeats the pact or finds a face-saving way
to withdraw it from consideration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The setback illustrates the tricky political position
confronting the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. He is juggling
the demands of 55 diverse Republicans, many of whom want to delay a
treaty vote to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment and others who want
to kill the pact regardless of the international repercussions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lott took a step toward averting a vote when he
signaled that he would accept assurances from Senate Democrats that
they would not seek action on the treaty until President Clinton
leaves office. Republicans had insisted that Clinton make that
pledge, but he has refused.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can be guaranteed that it would be set aside and not
come up in this Congress, then we could accept that,'' Lott told
reporters after a spirited luncheon with other Senate Republicans.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, answered Lott's call, saying
in a letter that he would support Clinton's request to postpone the
vote and agreed not to reschedule the treaty, absent ``unforeseen
changes in the international situation.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Republicans balked, Daschle changed the phrase to
``extraordinary circumstances,'' as defined by the two leaders.
Democrats insisted on that provision in the event Pakistan or
India, for example, resumed nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the wording drew strong opposition from Republican
hard-liners like Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, who complained that Democrats would use the ``loophole''
to seize on the slightest global disturbance and wield the treaty
as a campaign issue next year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The objections killed a proposed exchange on the Senate floor
between Lott and Daschle that would have defused the political and
procedural brhip that has engulfed the treaty since Lott
surprised Democrats two weeks ago by answering their demand to
bring it up with a no-notice vote.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed agreement, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
would be sent back to the Foreign Relations Committee for further
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's setback, a growing number of Democrats and
Republicans seemed eager to postpone the vote. Sens. John Warner,
R-Va., Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., released a
letter today to their two leaders, endorsing efforts to delay
Senate action on the treaty until the next Congress convenes in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen senators have signed the letter so far.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned half a dozen
moderate Republicans on Tuesday, urging them to consider the
diplomatic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters have warned that the Senate's defeat of the
accord would send a dangerous signal to emerging nuclear nations
like India and Pakistan that it was acceptable to continue testing.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, amid reports of a military coup in Pakistan, Lott
scoffed at those concerns and said the unrest in Pakistan would not
have any bearing on the Senate's action.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it have any bearing on this debate? Lott said.
``What we're talking about in this treaty is the national security
of our own country. Nothing we do here will have any affect on the
government in Pakistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes maneuvering overshadowed the Senate's
second day of debate on the treaty itself. Critics and supporters
mostly read from prepared statements, speaking to a largely empty
chamber.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expressed astonishment that Republicans would insist
on voting on a pact that the president requested withdrawn for
national security reasons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of the treaty have won, for now,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Why push for this vote if the president
of the United States has asked for delay because of his fears? This
isn't politics. This goes to the heart of our security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics argued the pact would permanently bind the United
States' ability to test while rogue nations, and perhaps even China
and Russia, cheated and conducted nuclear explosions that eroded
America's atomic deterrent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty is based on noble, idealistic goals, but it fails
the hard-reality test,'' said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. ``The U.S.
usually lives up to the agreements it signs. But there is no
guarantee that other nations would follow the letter of the law.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To put the treaty into effect, ratification by 44 nations
believed to have a nuclear capacity is needed. Only 26 countries,
including Britain and France, have done so. China, which has not
ratified the pact and is taking its lead from the United States, on
Tuesday urged the Senate to approve the treaty.

A HIGHER LEVEL, EVEN FOR PEDRO MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago he was simply being called
baseball's ``dominant pitcher.'' In recent weeks, however, his name
had often been preceded by the words ``shoo-in Cy Young Award
winner.'' But Monday night in Cleveland, Pedro Martinez reached an
even higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez now has a rare athletic aura encircling him. He now has
a mystique about him.
</P>
<P>
   He had popped a few Advil into his mouth Monday night and, two
days after not being able to throw a baseball 40 feet because of a
strained back muscle, he had held baseball's best-hitting team
hitless for six innings. Martinez did not have his fastball, but he
had his heart. And that was enough to lead the Red Sox to a 12-8
victory in the deciding Game 5 of their American League Division
Series against the Indians. It was a rare moment in Boston's
storied baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' the Mystique Man said in the Yankee Stadium
clubhouse Tuesday. ``I am sure I can work through it. And now I
have more days to rest, I should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he will have four days rest when he takes the mound
Saturday amid what may be the most electric atmosphere inside
Fenway Park in years: Martinez pitching Game 3 of the AL
Championship Series for the Red Sox against Roger Clemens for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro vs. Roger? It may sound like an enticing personal duel to
Boston fans, but not to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not facing Roger,'' he said. ``Roger is not the one
hitting against me. I'm facing the New York Yankees. That's who I'm
worried about, not Roger. Roger doesn't hit. Roger has to worry
about my teammates, Nomar (Garciaparra), the (Troy) O'Learys, those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the Mystique Man offered this coup de grace: ``Roger?
Roger is just a pitcher out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A significant part of the Martinez mystique is pride. As
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, teammate Mike Stanley, and other Red
Sox said in the happy mayhem following Monday night's win in
Cleveland, Martinez doesn't just want to be in that situation, he
craves it.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than older brother Ramon Martinez, who
was so worried when Pedro walked to the mound in the fourth inning,
sore back and all, then was so proud after his little brother had
pulled off his marvel of marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came into the game, I knew he wasn't 100 percent,''
said Ramon. ``I was so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro got through that fourth inning, Ramon rushed over to
his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him how he feel, and he said he felt fine,'' recalled
Ramon. ``Pedro say, `Everything under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ramon asked his little brother how the other part of him
felt _ his emotions, his mind _ when two days earlier he could not
throw a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask Pedro how he feel,'' said Ramon, ``and Pedro say,
`Nervous. But everything's under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After every inning _ the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth _ Ramon would go over to Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   The question from big brother was always the same: ``Pedro, how
do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the little brother's assurances, Ramon could not
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous,'' he said. ``I was in the dugout, but every
time Pedro throw the ball, I was ready to run out to the mound. And
when he come back to the dugout, I'd ask him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon acknowledged that at least part of the reason he kept
asking the same question was simply to say something, to say
anything to relieve the twin pressures of the Red Sox absolutely
needing to win the game and his brother risking an aggravation of
his back injury. But, really, Ramon never had to ask Pedro a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my brother, I know him so well,'' said Ramon. ``I could
see in his eyes. I look in Pedro's eyes and I see the fire. I could
see from his eyes he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon had seen the fire as early as Sunday night, when no one
else knew that Pedro would be ready to pitch Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask him after the (fourth) game and Pedro tell me, `I'm
going to be there,' '' said Ramon. ``And I told Pedro that all of
us were going to be there for him. He was happy to hear that. And
that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre agrees that Martinez has the Mystique:
``There is no question that aside from all the physical things that
Pedro brings to the table, he has got that psychological edge of
what he has accomplished this year. There is no question. We will
go out there and hopefully be able to match him.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will hope to match Martinez on Saturday by sending out
Clemens, which ``will be a lot of fun,'' said the manager.
``Obviously, what Roger has meant to that organization and that
ballpark for a number of years and, of course, what Pedro has done
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, what Martinez did Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Martinez went over to Kerrigan and manager
Jimy Williams ``and he just wanted to assure us he was OK,'' said
Kerrigan. ``I was as surprised as anybody else. We had formulated
our game plan before the game, and all we were thinking was maybe
Pedro could give us an inning at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third inning, though, the score was 8-8, and Martinez had
seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to settle the game down,'' said Kerrigan. ``We
just wanted to bring some normalcy to the game. It was looking like
one of those backyard softball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was amazed by what he saw. Instead of Martinez giving
his all for an inning or two, said the pitching coach, ``I saw him
getting looser and then he got stronger as he went on.''
</P>
<P>
   And each inning, when Martinez stepped out of the dugout, said
the pitching coach, ``I was watching Pedro when he got back to the
mound and watched him throw his warmup pitches and I was looking
for any stiffness. I was just watching for him tightening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was expecting Martinez to throw maybe 40 pitches.
Instead, the ace went out inning after inning, six of them in all,
throwing a total of 97 pitches. Kerrigan could only marvel at what
he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Pedro,'' he said. ``That's the legend of Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in the outfield at Fenway Park, Martinez could toss
the ball only a few times before having to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I thought Pedro had no chance of pitching,'' said
Kerrigan. ``No chance. He and I threw only four or five balls, only
at a distance of 40 or 50 feet, and Pedro told me, `No, I can't do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in the gloom and mist and drizzle of late afternoon
in Fenway, Martinez was encouraged by being able to toss the ball _
tossing it only moderately, mind you _ for all of eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pedro was still a little fatigued depite playing catch in
the outfield for only eight minutes,'' said Kerrigan. ``That was on
my mind. The fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, in the mayhem of the Red Sox clubhouse in
Cleveland, as Kerrigan looked on as Pedro and Ramon Martinez hooked
arms and danced to a salsa beat, the pitching coach was nearly
speechless when asked to put Martinez's performance into context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know . . . geez,'' said Kerrigan. ``It was one of the
most heroic, gutsy performance you've ever seen. I mean, Pedro was
so alive. I mean, Pedro brought so much life to our bench. I mean,
he'd come in between innings and he was nothing but a chatterbox,
bringing our offensive people along with him. He was real loose, he
was chattering away, he was having fun out there. He loves that
situation. He lives for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he had never before felt what he felt when the Red
Sox carried him off the Jacobs Field mound on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great, great feeling,'' he said. ``It was my
first time I experienced something like that and, you know, you
pretty much have to live it to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is hoping to keep the feeling going. It's all about
winning, whether in this historic Red Sox-Yankees rivalry or any
other series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rivalry is really against any team,'' said Martinez.
``That's my personal rivalry. I'm going to feel about the Yankees
the way I feel about any team. I don't have anything against any
team; I don't have anything against Roger. I respect Roger just as
Roger has to respect our team.''
</P>
<P>
   So, concluded Martinez, ``I'm just going to go out there and
play the way I know how to play and forget about the fact that Babe
Ruth was traded in 19 . . . I guess, 18? Or sold. Or whatever. And
just go out there and play my game.''

 &HT;    Popular Potter books get green light in Georgia while S.C. takes
up debate
 &HT;    By Jim Galloway and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A metro Atlanta school system has given a green light
to Harry Potter, student wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Principal Jerry Locke of A.L. Burruss Elementary
School asked a fifth-grade teacher to stop reading one of the
Potter books to her class until he could review it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's read the book and thinks it's just fine, a Marietta
school official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harry Potter books are now being read to two classes at
Burruss. And as it turns out, a Harry Potter book has been in the
school library since spring _ the principal simply didn't know
about it, said Kelly Henson, associate superintendent for the
7,228-student Marietta schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ban. There is no ban,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   The highly popular Harry Potter book series by British author
J.K. Rowling outlines the education of a broomstick-riding student
at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Burruss' Locke declined to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for him, Henson said the Marietta schools have not
received any complaints about the Potter books. But, at a September
meeting, Marietta elementary principals were cautioned that the
book could provoke the concerns of parents who object to the
literary themes of magic and witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   That warning, and the fact that Harry Potter made the cover of
Time magazine, prompted Locke, the Burruss principal to scrutinize
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When new material comes into the school, any good principal is
going to review it,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   While a flap over Harry Potter may have ended in metro Atlanta,
another has begun in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books have a serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect
and sheer evil,'' said Elizabeth Mounce of Columbia, who asked that
state's Board of Education to remove the books from school
libraries. Protesters who identified themselves as ``concerned
Christian parents'' told the board the books promote violence and
interest in the occult.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina protest is the fourth serious challenge to
the book series in the past two weeks, according to the American
Library Association's office for intellectual freedom in Chicago.
The other challenges have come in New York, Michigan and Minnesota
_ the incident in Marietta isn't counted. Three Potter books have
been printed. New York-based Scholastic Inc. has published 5
million hardback copies of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone,'' ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and last
month's release, ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The books are not about witchcraft,'' said Judy Corman, senior
vice president for Scholastic. ``(They are) about the power of the
imagination.''

 &HT;    Former University of Georgia graduate student murdered in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Those who knew him say Valentin Krumov was focused
on life. Living it.
</P>
<P>
   Like many eastern Europeans, he smoked cigarettes, lots of them.
But he didn't worry about his health.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, he was overweight. But he never worried about
dieting.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as a man who could walk into any group of
people in the world and make conversation. It certainly helped that
he spoke several languages _ English, Russian, French, his native
Bulgarian and some Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, international police officials in Kosovo said
that gift for language may have gotten the former University of
Georgia student killed. Krumov was mobbed, beaten and then shot in
the head after enraging a group of ethnic Albanian teens by
speaking Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   That he was murdered on his first day on the job doing what he
seemed born for _ working with the United Nations civilian mission
in the troubled Serbian province _ came as a shock to friends and
colleagues in Athens. In May, after almost 10 years of off-and-on
work at the Athens campus, Krumov had received his doctorate from
UGA.
</P>
<P>
   To his major professor, Gary Bertsch, Krumov's death was the
epitome of irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was a real professional. He knew what that region was
all about,'' Bertsch said. ``But he was a peacemaker. He was one of
the most friendly, gregarious guys that you would ever run into.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were ever caught on a street with a mob, I would like to
have Valentin with me. Because he was both smart and bright and
friendly and would talk his way out of something like that. But
apparently this was one of those senseless tragedies that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch, who wrote his own dissertation on ethnic relations in
Yugoslavia, said the killing was only ``explicable because of the
terrible and ugly consequences of excessive nationalism in this
part of the Balkans. Still it was a shock . . . to hear it was
Valentin.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumov, 38, who received his undergraduate and master's degrees
in his native Bulgaria, was killed Monday on one of the busiest
streets in Kosovo's capital, Pristina. According to reports from
that city, Krumov had just finished dinner and was walking with two
colleagues on Mother Teresa Street near the Grand Hotel, the base
for many employees of international organizations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Serbian, Albanian youths apparently asked him for the
time. Krumov, who could have answered in any of several languages,
is believed to have replied in Serbian, unaware that he was
apparently being put to a kind of ethnic identification test. The
Serbian language is hated by the ethnic Albanian majority in
today's Kosovo, and the mistake apparently cost Krumov his life.
</P>
<P>
   A mob set upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One individual proceeded to hit him with his fist, and others
kicked him,'' said U.N. Police Inspector Gilles Moreau. ``A large
crowd gathered around the altercation. All of a sudden, a shot was
heard, the crowd dispersed and the body . . . was on the ground,
lifeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreau said the assailants were believed to be about 16 or 17
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch said because the Slavic languages are so similar, Krumov
could have answered in Bulgarian, but the youths mistook it for
Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Krumov was single. His parents are professionals and his mother
reportedly was working in Russia at the time on an engineering
project.
</P>
<P>
   He applied to UGA for doctoral work about 10 years ago. Bertsch
had just founded UGA's Center for International Trade and Security
_ a research and teaching center _ and he was after this Bulgarian,
Krumov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited him. We were interested in international students
like Valentin. I think he was the first graduate assistant we
hired,'' Bertsch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Krumov, though a scholar, was intent on being in the working
world. He would come and go from Athens and occasionally worked
with the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of us knew him very casually,'' said Mike Beck,
who himself recently received his doctorate at UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say any of us really got to know him because he was
constantly on the move, coming and going. But he was very friendly
with a great sense of humor. He liked to have a good time. I know
every time I was around him it gave me a chance to practice my
Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco Becchi supervised Krumov's work in New York at the United
Nations Office for Project Services, which helps developing
countries achieve peace, stability and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very close for a couple of years,'' said Becchi,
a senior project manager. ``He was a very nice person, very
enthusiastic, very professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumov also worked for the U.N. between the end of 1996 and the
middle of 1997 in Bratislava, Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   He was dedicated to the ideals of the United Nation and
presumably wanted a long career with the organization, Becchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Becchi last saw Krumov on Friday evening, when he dropped by the
office to say goodbye before leaving for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came after his medical clearance from the U.N., and he came
in to see me to share with me the joy of his new assignment,'' said
Becchi, who was shocked to learn that the U.N. peacekeeper who was
killed was his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Allen, who served on Krumov's dissertation committee said
he was ``very much a scholar, but very much a human being. Great
with people. He was a dedicated student, but less interested in
academic scholarship. He wanted to serve in the policy area.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint in Athens, Krumov lived with the Bertsch
family until he found an apartment. He worked toward his doctorate
over the years. The money as a graduate assistant helped him pay
his fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took his time doing his Ph.D. because he worked for the
U.N. part of the time. And after finishing all his Ph.D. work, he
decided to go work full time for the U.N.,'' said Bertsch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bertsch wouldn't give up on his prize pupil. He felt
Krumov deserved to have that doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked several times. I always told him that he deserved to
have that Ph.D.. Finally, he came back,'' Bertsch said. Krumov
defended his dissertation and got his doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his Ph.D. in political science. But we employed him in
the research/teaching center where students like Valentin work on
problems of international relations and promoting peace and
development. That was his job with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean this is a guy who came from Bulgaria to the American
dream to come and study at the University of Georgia and earn his
Ph.D. And then to get his dream job with the U.N. and really apply
what he was ideally suited for: That is working with people from
all pats of the world. He had a deep interest in people. He was an
extroverted person.''
</P>
<P>
   When there was social life around the political science
department, Valentin was the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could walk into any room and strike up a conversation with
anybody. He was the life of the party. Whenever we had parties
people congregated around him. He was telling stories and
singing,'' Bertsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch said Krumov liked to date and have fun, but he was still
serious and focused on his goal of working with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had his hand in many different things. A conference
here. A conference there. Then back here for a quarter. He was
always busy,'' Bertsch said. ``He smoked cigarettes like crazy,
which is typical of eastern Europeans. . . . I have to admit some
Americans didn't like to get close to him because he sometimes
smelled like a cigarette butt. Some people treated him rudely
because he looked like a `Bulgarian.' He was a large man,
overweight_ maybe 40 or 50 pounds. Swarthy. But he was a good man
who loved life.''
</P>
<P>
   Krumov didn't worry about diets or health. And, Bertsch said, he
probably didn't worry about himself while he was walking down the
streets in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably walking down the street thinking about life
and other people,'' Bertsch said. ``And suddenly found himself
being attacked.''

ON PAPER, BUDGET BALANCES WITHOUT RAID ON SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Something symbolically enormous may have happened
Tuesday: the Congressional Budget Office announced that the
government may have balanced the budget in fiscal 1999 without
spending Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would be the first time that has happened since 1960,
when Dwight Eisenhower was president, gentlemen sported felt
fedoras and women wore fox stoles.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who have struggled to find a way to balance the
2000 budget without spending Social Security money, jumped on the
budget office's estimate as evidence of their fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with all the emergency spending we had in '99, we did not
spend Social Security dollars,'' said the House majority leader,
Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``This is, like, the first time, and we really
stepped over the line now.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the Republicans in Congress are locked in
a political struggle over whether the spending bills that Congress
writes and the president signs will once again dip into the Social
Security surplus. Both parties have portrayed themselves as
protectors of the retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement may make those arguments more politically
potent than ever. But budget experts continue to point out that the
arguments are over such relatively small figures that they have
almost no impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached the promised land, at least temporarily,'' said
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the budget office from 1989 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscally, it's irrelevant,'' he said. ``But it's
psychologically and symbolically very important. If any budget
expert told you in 1997 that we would have balanced the budget by
1999, this person would have been committed'' to an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The budget office said the government's general revenues showed
a $1 billion surplus for fiscal 1999, which ended Sept. 30. It
cautioned that the figures were preliminary. They may be off by as
much as $3 billion, so the promised land may be a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus Social Security funds have functioned as money under the
mattress for Congress for four decades. When general government
revenues to run federal agencies run out, Congress taps into the
retirement funds. Almost all outside experts say that spending
Social Security surpluses has had no effect on its benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been vowing almost daily never again to spend
the money. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert again promised Tuesday never
to ``return to the days when Democrats raided Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle, which both sides have represented as a fight to
``save Social Security,'' has driven the Republicans to employ tens
of billions of dollars in accounting devices, which even some in
their own party are calling gimmicks and tricks, to make their
spending bills appear to keep that promise.
</P>
<P>
   Though both parties rushed to claim credit for Tuesday's
supposed surplus, the new numbers calculated by the budget office
show that everyone in Washington underestimated the force that may
have balanced the budget: unexpectedly high tax revenues generated
by a rip-roaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, most people believed that Congress had spent at
least $21 billion and as much as $37 billion in Social Security
funds in the fiscal 1999 spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tax money rolled into the federal counting house this
spring and summer, that number dwindled. Tuesday, on paper, it
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The report that the budget may be balanced ``is probably worth a
good headline, but beyond that it is not clear what it will
portend,'' said Dan Crippen, director of the budget office since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we are on one side or another of the line by a billion
is not as important as the economic growth that caused us to arrive
at the line,'' Crippen said.
</P>
<P>
   And Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council,
credited the White House for ``an enormous fiscal achievement that
seemed unimaginable when President Clinton took office.''
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer, a veteran of past budget battles, demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every likelihood that we will fall from grace in the
current fiscal year unless saved again by the power of the economy
to generate unexpected revenues,'' he said ``And woe be to those
who are blamed for a fall from grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The new budget office figures show about $125 billion in excess
Social Security funds for fiscal 1999, above and beyond the
projected $1 billion surplus in general government revenues.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress really has the will to keep its hands off the Social
Security surpluses for the next 10 years, about $2 trillion of
those revenues will accrue, says the budget office.
</P>
<P>
   Left untouched, they would halve the federal debt of more than
$3.6 trillion.

TWO TEAMS JOINED BY HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so, destiny brings them together again in the final October
of the 1900s, 21 years after Bucky Bleeping Dent's wedge shot found
the screen above The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   They have been intertwined, the Red Sox and Yankees, since they
came down to the final day in 1904 (they were the Pilgrims and
Highlanders then) and Happy Jack Chesbro uncorked a wild pitch to
give Boston the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox opened Fenway Park in 1912, they played New York.
When Yankee Stadium opened in 1923, Boston was the visitor. Babe
Ruth hit his first home run against the Yankees. Lou Gehrig hit his
first against the Red Sox. Ted Williams played his first game in
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Roger Maris hit his 61st homer in 1961, Boston's Tracy
Stallard served it up. When Joe Cronin broke his leg and ended his
career, he did it at Yankee Stadium. When Williams spat at the
Fenway fans in 1956, he'd just been booed for muffing Mickey
Mantle's fly ball. When Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson nearly came
to blows in the dugout, it happened at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   They are Sparta and Athens, these two, the Bronx and the Fens,
pinstripes and carmine hose, World Series rings _ and the Curse of
the Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Yankees are the ``lyric bandbox'' and the House That
Ruth Built, the Splendid Splinter and the Yankee Clipper, Curt
Gowdy and Mel Allen. They are Joe McCarthy pinch-hitting for Ellis
Kinder, Cy Young pitching a no-hitter at 41, Martin and Jimmy
Piersall fighting in the runway, Bill Lee calling the Yankees
``brownshirts,'' Thurman Munson slamming into Carlton Fisk at the
plate, the Boston Massacre, Yaz popping up to third, and Boggsie in
pinstripes, riding a victory horse in the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Yankees are World Series tickets sold in New York
and torn up in Boston, SOLD OUT signs for the big weekends and a
showdown atmosphere even in May. ``It's like the World Series every
day,'' Fisk once said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox-Yankee rivalry is the stuff of obsession _ at least
on the Boston side. When Tom Yawkey bought the Red Sox in 1933, he
said his only reason was to beat the Yankees. It took him 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we never not talk about the Yankees,'' Fisk once
conceded. `` `What did the Yankees do?' You hear that from the
first spring training game on.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees aren't consumed by what's happening 240 miles
north, it may be because there usually has been relatively little
to be consumed with. Since the day Sox owner Harry Frazee (a New
Yorker, of course) sold them Babe Ruth in 1920, the Yankees have
won 35 pennants and 24 world championships. The Red Sox have won
four and none.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, whenever the two clubs have gone head to
head _ at the trading table or on the diamond _ the Yankees have
prevailed. Boston sent four Hall of Famers to New York. New York
sent back a few hundred grand and Danny Cater. The Red Sox lost the
1949 pennant to the Yankees on the final day. The Red Sox lost the
1978 pennant to the Yankees on the day after the final day.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry has been lopsided in New York's favor ever since the
cash-strapped Frazee sold Ruth for $100,000 and a $300,000 loan to
pay off his note on Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be sore as hell at me for what I'm going to
tell you,'' Frazee told Sox manager Ed Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to sell the Big Fellow,'' Barrow guessed. ``I
expected it, Harry. But let me tell you this _ you're going to ruin
yourself and the Red Sox in Boston for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the ``Rape of the Red Sox,'' a four-year flesh
auction that sent the core of the ballclub _ pitchers Waite Hoyt,
Joe Bush, Sam Jones, George Pipgras, and Herb Pennock, catcher
Wally Schang, shortstop Everett Scott and third baseman Joe Dugan
to New York for cash and nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who hadn't won a thing until they suited up Ruth,
claimed six pennants and three World Series in the next eight
years. The Red Sox, who had won three Series in four years,
finished last in eight of the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Frazee wanted was the money,'' said a bitter Harry Hooper,
whom Frazee traded to the White Sox. ``He was short of cash and he
sold the whole team down the river to keep his dirty nose above
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees always had the money, which came pouring out of
owner Jacob Ruppert's brewery. But they've also had the knack of
stiffing the Red Sox at both ends of the bargain. In 1923, Boston
traded Pipgras to New York for a backup catcher and cash. Pipgras
went 93-64 in nine seasons for the Yankees, won 24 games in 1928
and was 3-0 in three World Series. After the Red Sox bought him
back a decade later for $100,000, Pipgras went 9-9 in three seasons
and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the cosmic joke has been on the Red Sox. They ship a
castoff to New York, he becomes a god. Pitcher Wilcy Moore was 4-10
when Boston sent him back to New York in the middle of the 1932
season. Moore ended up winning the decisive game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox traded first baseman Babe Dahlgren to the Yankees for
cash. Dahlgren took over for Lou Gehrig and played in the 1939
World Series. Ray Scarborough was 1-5 when Boston sold him to New
York in the middle of the 1952 season. He went 5-1 for New York and
pitched in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Red Sox nearly two decades to recover from losing
Ruth and the rest. What brought them even, finally, was Yawkey's
cash and Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, the two ballclubs
were nearly back level _ and baseball's most enduring rivalry
developed in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 and 1949 seasons set the tone for the passion, the
anxiety, the drama _ and in Boston, the disappointment. (In 1946,
when the Red Sox won their first pennant since 1918, the Yankees
finished 17 games back.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the Red Sox eliminated New York in the next-to-last
game of the season and ended up losing the pennant playoff to
Cleveland when Joe McCarthy bypassed 18-game winner Jack Kramer for
journeyman Denny Galehouse because the wind was blowing toward The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the Yankees won by beating Boston twice at the Stadium
on the final weekend. For Bostonians, the tease and the torment
began then. After falling 8 1/2 games back in June after Joe
DiMaggio swept them in Fenway all by himself (and got a standing O
from Bostonians), the Sox (who had five .300 hitters) went 59-19
over the second half of the season and climbed into first place
with five games to play.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Calling it a major step to prevent gun violence,
Gov. Christie Whitman on Tuesday signed into law a measure that
will make New Jersey the fourth state in the nation to prohibit the
sale of any new handgun unless it is accompanied by a trigger lock.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger lock bill, which had the support of some gun groups,
was approved only after legislative leaders blocked a far more
sweeping proposal to enact the nation's first mandate for what are
called smart guns, firearms equipped with an electronic device to
prevent anyone but an owner from firing.
</P>
<P>
   As the first state to enact an assault weapon ban in 1990, New
Jersey was considered promising territory by many proponents of
smart guns, who have been advocating their proposal in Trenton, the
state capital, since 1998. In the aftermath of the Columbine High
School shootings in Colorado, which left 15 dead, public opinion
polls indicated that as many as 80 percent of state voters wanted
stricter gun control and that even a majority of gun owners favored
smart guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican legislative leaders and Whitman ultimately turned
away from the bill after a furious lobbying campaign by gun owners
and concerns that the legislation was ahead of the technology
currently available. The speaker of the state Assembly, Jack
Collins, a Republican, said he did not allow the measure to come up
for a vote because, he said, no reliable smart gun would be on the
market for years, so the law would have been a de facto gun ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates said they had hoped the legislation would
spur firearms manufacturers to improve smart-gun technology, in the
same way that Congress passed auto safety laws compelling car
manufacturers to speed the development and deployment of air bags.
In the end, however, the gun control forces called the trigger lock
bill only a marginal improvement and said it illustrates that even
at a time when shootings in schools and elsewhere have made gun
violence a national concern, any tightening of gun control remains
a difficult political proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, it's a step in the right direction,'' said Joe
Sudbay, an analyst for Handgun Control Inc., an advocacy group
based in Washington. ``But in New Jersey and a lot of other places,
the gun lobby is still effective, even when its wishes go against
the overwhelming majority of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's trigger lock law comes at a time when gun control
efforts have met with mixed results in Congress and other states.
The U.S. Senate, reacting to the public outcry after the Columbine
shootings in April, passed an assortment of proposals including the
requiring of background checks for handgun sales at gun shows. That
proposal is now stalled in conference committee with the House of
Representatives, and the House majority whip, Tom Delay, R-Texas,
this week warned against efforts to strengthen it, declaring that
``this House is a pro-gun House.''
</P>
<P>
   In state legislatures, gun control advocates have had more
success in recent years, but have still been limited to incremental
steps. Connecticut passed a law and Illinois enacted legislation
which requires that parents safeguard their firearms from minors by
using trigger locks or locking gun cases. And advocates for gun
rights have temporarily scaled back their push for laws broadening
the right to carry concealed weapons in states like Michigan,
Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The most sweeping gun restrictions adopted in recent years were
in California, where candidates who supported gun control won the
governor's race and several key legislative elections in 1998, and
the state passed a package of bills outlawing assault weapons and
so-called Saturday night specials, mandating trigger locks and
limiting the sale of handguns to one per month.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's smart gun bill, sponsored by the Senate minority
leader, Richard Codey, a Democrat, and Sen. Joseph Palaia, a
Republican, appeared to gain crucial momentum after the Columbine
shootings. It cleared Law and Public Safety Committee and the
Senate president, Donald DiFrancesco, a Republican who plans to run
for governor in 2001, said at the time he would allow it to the
floor for a vote by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gun rights groups used their extensive network of shooting clubs
and gun dealers to rally opposition to the bill. They offered
telephone banks and campaign volunteers to legislators who opposed
the smart gun proposal and sponsored a bill to loosen restrictions
on carrying concealed weapons. One of the state's most prominent
proponents of gun rights even publicly threatened to open what he
said was a secret file of complaints against DiFrancesco from
former law clients because he dared defy the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   By June, Collins, whose district in rural Salem County is
considered far more supportive of gun rights than other regions of
the state, said he was not inclined to let the Assembly vote on the
smart-gun proposal. So DiFrancesco instead pushed through a version
of the bill that would require smart gun technology on all guns
sold in the state without setting a date when the requirement would
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Miller, director of the Coalition of New Jersey Sportsmen,
a hunting group, said his group did not publicly oppose trigger
locks, but that it was still so adamantly against smart-gun
legislation that he was determined to exact his revenge on
DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Assembly races this fall, my goal in life is to
prevent Donny DiFrancesco from becoming the next governor,'' Miller
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democrats hope to regain the momentum on the issue by
making gun control a major part of their campaign in the state's 80
Assembly races this fall, according to Julie Roginsky, the campaign
director for Assembly Democrats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Collins, who is also expected to seek the Republican
nomination for governor in 2001 and is likely to receive the
backing of gun rights advocates and other conservative groups, said
he believed the trigger lock law and the $1 million research grant
for smart-gun technology would strike voters as a sensible,
forward-looking approach to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun owners' groups said they would be providing intensive
campaign support to candidates who have ardently defended gun
rights. The New Jersey Association of Rifle and Pistol Clubs, which
opposed both the proposals on smart guns and trigger locks, said it
would provide telephone banks and volunteers for at least five
Assembly candidates who opposed smart guns and supported a recent
bill to loosen restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon,
according to Nancy Ross, a spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   When the Legislature begins its new session in January, Ms. Ross
said, the group expects to fight a new attempt to revive the
smart-gun initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trigger locks, smart guns, they're all just gimmicks by
politicians trying to look like they're doing something by
demonizing law-abiding gun owners without addressing the problem of
criminals who use guns,'' Ms. Ross said. ``I'm sure it will
resurrect it's ugly head again. Then we'll reach out to legislators
all over again.''

 &HT;    Weiss' heroics help put him on starting roster for NLCS
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walt Weiss got his first start of the 1999 postseason
Tuesday after making quite an impression in the division series.
</P>
<P>
   His play on a grounder up the middle helped rescue the Braves
from a bases-loaded, no-out situation in the 10th inning of Game 3.
He also entered Game 4 in the fifth inning after a Jose Hernandez
error.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting only .148 in August while recovering from a
quadriceps injury, Weiss bounced back to hit .261 (6-for-23) in
September and October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did play down the stretch in a few ball games and looked
good,'' Cox said. ``He looked good in Houston when he came in, and
Don (Baylor) has him swinging a lot better right now. He's a great
defensive shortstop, and I thought I'd go that way for tonight's
game anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, the every-day shortstop since the Braves acquired him
from the Cubs on July 31, struggled offensively to end the season,
hitting only .236 (17-for-72) the last month. He was 1-for-11 in
the division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say anything about it,'' Hernandez said. ``He's the
skipper, he does the lineup. Whenever they need me, I'll be there.
I hope I can be in the lineup tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said he was surprised not to see his name in the
lineup, given how well he has hit Mosato Yoshii. He's 5-for-7
against him in his career with a double, home run and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cat on the mend
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga had a CT scan on his lower back Tuesday morning
and was given the go-ahead to take the next step in his workouts as
he continues his rehabilitation from lymphoma with an eye toward
returning next season.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's test results will be sent to his specialist in
Chicago for a second look, but Galarraga was told by Braves team
orthopedist Dr. Joe Chandler on Tuesday that the bone in his lower
back, which had been stricken with cancer, was getting stronger.
Galarraga has been walking on the treadmill and doing some
stair-climbing. Now he can jog and lift light weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the bone is much better, no question,'' Galarraga
said. ``I don't think I'll be able to swing (a bat) and lift the
heavy stuff until December, but it's good news. This will give me
some time to go step by step and be ready for spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the start
of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking with nine pitchers
</P>
<P>
   Cox decided to keep the Braves roster for the NLCS as is, with
nine pitchers and three catchers, despite the scare the Braves got
in Game 3 of the division series when they nearly ran out of
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always carried three guys that could catch,'' Cox said.
``Eddie (Perez) does have a little bit of a bad knee. . . .But nine
pitchers is a little dangerous, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has been playing the last half of the season with torn
cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   One player who was happy at the prospects was Greg Maddux, who
enjoys getting called on to pitch in relief. He faced one batter in
the division series, walking Craig Biggio on a checked swing that
appeared to be strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly on time
</P>
<P>
   For all the rain Turner Field took Tuesday afternoon and early
evening, Game 1 of the NLCS was only three minutes late starting,
at 8:15 p.m. It was originally scheduled for 8:12 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves did get some home field advantage with the weather
because it was only drizzling when they were taking their batting
practice Tuesday afternoon. It rained hard on the Mets, causing the
Braves grounds crew to clear the field to put the tarp down. The
Mets moved to the indoor batting cages.

</P>
<P>
   All they needed to do was win one of the final two games, with
two 20-game winners _ Mel Parnell and Kinder _ on the mound and
DiMaggio still weak from pneumonia. ``If we can't win one of two,''
Yawkey mused, ``we don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had a 4-0 lead on Saturday, with New York starter Allie
Reynolds in the showers early and manager Casey Stengel cursing in
the dugout. They lost, 5-4, when Johnny Lindell, who hadn't hit a
homer since July, ripped one down the left-field line with two out
in the eighth. ``I think we've got 'em,'' Stengel said. ``I can
feel it in my bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a first-inning triple by Phil Rizzuto, which dropped
20 feet from sun-blinded Ted Williams, Kinder shut the Yankees down
on Sunday. But when the Sox couldn't crack Vic Raschi through
seven, McCarthy pulled Kinder for a pinch hitter _ and came up with
nothing. The Yankees nailed Parnell and Tex Hughson for four more
runs, held off Boston in the ninth and went on to beat the Dodgers
in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The devastated Sox got drunk on the long train ride home and
Kinder berated McCarthy for lifting him. ``Goddammit, if the old
man had let me bat for myself that day,'' Kinder said later, ``we'd
have won the pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment in 1951, after the Sox swept the Yankees at Fenway
in early July to move ahead of them, they thought they were on the
way again. ``Hey, looks like we'll be in the World Series this
year, baby,'' clubhouse boy Johnny Orlando taunted DiMaggio, as the
Yankees walked through quietly on their way to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ways to go, John,'' DiMaggio advised him. ``Don't count
your money. Long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ended up clinching the pennant by sweeping a
doubleheader from Boston at the Stadium, with Reynolds pitching a
no-hitter, and beat the Giants in the Series. The Red Sox ended up
third.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rivalry after that, not for two decades. The
Yankees won 11 of the next 13 pennants. The Sox, a country-club
team playing sandlot ball, sank slowly toward the cellar. In 1965,
when they lost 100 games and played a home game in front of 461
people, they were blanked for three innings by ancient Satchel
Paige, who was 59 going on 65.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Boston rose from the dead with the Impossible Dream
season of 1967, the Yankees were sagging and sullen. After pitcher
Thad Tillotson knocked down Joe Foy, who'd clocked a grand slam a
day earlier, Jim Lonborg plunked Tillotson and both benches
brawled.
</P>
<P>
   That was a prelude to the feuding and febrile '70s, when Athens
and Sparta went at it annually. In 1973, the clubs scrapped after
Munson slammed into Fisk on a suicide squeeze. In 1974, after
blowing a seven-game lead in late August, Boston and New York
helped wipe each other out. The Yankees won two at Fenway in
September; the Sox took a doubleheader at Shea a week from the end,
as Yankee fans littered the diamond with tennis balls and
firecrackers and fought among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Boston took three of four in Fenway to knock New York
out of first place in late June, then shut out the Yankees in both
ends of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium in July to finish them off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the bad blood spilled over in Yankee Stadium in May
when Dwight Evans gunned down Lou Piniella at the plate and
Piniella bowled Fisk, knees against chest. That touched off a
brutal brawl that ended with Mickey Rivers and Graig Nettles
mugging Sox pitcher Bill Lee and dislocating his shoulder _ and
essentially ending Boston's season.
</P>
<P>
   Owner George Steinbrenner and manager Billy Martin were
``Nazis,'' Lee would charge in 1977, when the Yankees overtook the
Sox down the stretch and went to the World Series. Martin sent Lee
a fish and a note: ``Stick this in your purse, you (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was gone in 1978 and so, it seemed, were the Yankees, 14
games out in July. Boston was 62-28 and soaring _ until the
All-Star break. By Labor Day, the Sox were unraveling quickly and
the Yankees had won 13 of 15. That set the stage for the ``Boston
Massacre,'' a stunning four-game sweep in the Fens by astounding
scores _ 15-3, 13-2, 7-0, 7-4 _ that threw the clubs into a
first-place tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' muttered dumbstruck Sox skipper
Don Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   After New York took two of three at the Stadium a week later and
began printing ALCS tickets, Boston was shaken and bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you sit in front of your locker,'' said shortstop
Rick Burleson, ``and ask God what the hell is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston needed to win its final eight just to get into a one-game
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it should be,'' declared Yankee reliever
Sparky Lyle, a Sox refugee.
</P>
<P>
   After six innings, up, 2-0, the home team sensed a pennant in
the breeze. ``RED SOX AHEAD,'' proclaimed the Globe's
late-afternoon edition, which rolled off the presses just as Dent
stepped to the plate with two on and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Torrez, whom Boston had signed away from the Yankees as a
free-agent amulet, watched Dent loft a routine fly to left and
began walking off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked over my shoulder on the way to the dugout and
couldn't believe it,'' Torrez said. ``Yaz is back to the wall,
popping his glove, looking up. I said, `What's this? What the . .
.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 3, Red Sox 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goddamn,'' Torrez said to himself. ``Goddamn, how could that
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Boston knew, Yastrzemski was popping to third and
the Yankees were spraying each other with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 163d game, 5-4, with a man on third and two out in the
ninth,'' Reggie Jackson marveled.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 21 years, but here in Athens, Yaz is still staring
up at the sky, cursed and cursing. The Spartans have won three more
rings since then and Roger Clemens is vowing to win them another.
It is the final October of the 1900s, and destiny has brought the
Yankees and Red Sox together one last time.

 &HT;    It's not `war,' it's baseball
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everywhere you turn, a phony war breaks out. The Mets
are miffed because the Braves don't respect them. The Mets are
miffed because Chipper Jones had the audacity to hit a slew of home
runs against them. The Mets are miffed. . . . well, because it's
1999 and everybody's miffed about something.
</P>
<P>
   The bemused Braves look on and wonder: What is it with those
guys? With Bobby Valentine speaking of ghosts? With Valentine
saying Chipper can't have another series like the one in September?
What did we do to that team besides beat it like a drum?
</P>
<P>
   This is how that trash-talking Bobby Cox fanned the flames
before Game 1: ``They've got a class ballclub. . . . There are some
guys in the league you wouldn't want on your team, but I can't say
that about any of their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about gall.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it is when you face a team based in New York. You
get not just the team but the tabloids. You speak a simple
declarative sentence _ C. Jones to the Mets' fans: ``I told them to
go on home and put on their Yankee stuff'' _ and it becomes a
headline three inches high. ``Let The War Begin'' declared the
frothing New York Post on Tuesday. Which seemed, you know, a tad
overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Because this isn't war.
</P>
<P>
   This the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Braves are every October.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we got a bit giddy around here in '91 and '92, when
this postseason business was new. But that was then. Now we treat
the NLCS as an autumnal rite, which also makes New Yorkers crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Since tickets for Games 3, 4 and 5 are prized commodities in
Gotham, New Yorkers can't grasp why Game 1 didn't sell out here.
The first question asked of both Cox and Valentine in their pregame
briefings Tuesday regarded tickets sold, or the lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like a pretty big series to me,'' said Valentine,
grinning that infernal grin.
</P>
<P>
   Said the questioner: ``After some of the things the Braves had
to say about your fans, do you think that says anything? At least
your fans show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now. The Mets drew 2.7 million this season. The Braves
drew 3.2 million. On the last Friday night of the regular season,
the crowd at Turner Field was 38,413. The throng at Shea Stadium
that night was 29,528. The Braves, it should be noted, had clinched
the NL East five days earlier. The Mets were still embroiled in the
wild-card chase. What does that say about showing up?
</P>
<P>
   Give Valentine credit. He made the salient point: ``Our fans
were great the last two weeks of the season. They were there in
force. They were very supportive. But then again, they haven't had
the opportunity in 10 years. (Eleven, actually.) Just about
everybody in this community (meaning Atlanta) probably has seen a
playoff game in the last 10 years. A little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Tuesday's was the 44th postseason game this city has staged
this decade. The Mets have played host to two _ last weekend. It's
more than a little different. The sight of empty seats at Turner
Field in October doesn't mean that people don't care about this
team. They do. But here there's an October every year. And here, it
might also be said, there are no tabloids to stoke the phony war.

 NEW DELHI, India: Sri Lanka. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drama began to unfold just a few hours after the state news
service reported at about 5 p.m. Tuesday that Musharraf was being
immediately retired.
</P>
<P>
   Troops began moving through Islamabad. They seized the Cabinet
building and climbed over the fence around the television station.
All flights were canceled as the troops took over the major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said in his speech that as he tried to return to
Pakistan from Sri Lanka, his commercial flight, short of fuel, was
ordered to land outside of Pakistan, endangering the lives of all
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks be to Allah, this evil design was thwarted through
speedy army action,'' said the general, whose flight landed in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's home was cordoned off and the road to it blocked. He
was reported to be inside. There were also reports that the
information minister, Mushahid Hussain; the foreign minister,
Sartaj Aziz, and the Kashmir affairs minister, Majid Malik, were
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As accounts of the army's takeover of government buildings began
to come in from witnesses, there was confusion about exactly what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to government and army spokesmen in Islamabad
rang unanswered. The television station went dark soon after
announcing that the prime minister had fired the general.
</P>
<P>
   The first official confirmation that the army had taken action
against the government came at 10:15 p.m., when the state
television came back to life and a news reader announced that
Sharif had been dismissed. After midnight, the state television
announced that all banks would be closed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, at almost 3 a.m., the general laid out the
reasons for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   He said the country was in a state of ``turmoil and
uncertainty,'' and the economy in a state of collapse. He accused
Sharif's government of systematically destroying the institutions
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces had taken over as a last resort to restore
stability, he said, and he pleaded with the public to continue to
be calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done so with all sincerity, loyalty and selfless
devotion to the country,'' he said. ``And the armed forces are
firmly behind me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate conservatives on Tuesday rejected a
compromise by the Republican and Democratic leaders to postpone
action on a treaty banning underground nuclear testing, imperiling
the fate of the accord.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders said they would resume talks on Wednesday to find
wording acceptable to all senators, acknowledging that the treaty
lacks the two-thirds majority to pass. The issue now, they added,
is whether the Senate defeats the pact or finds a face-saving way
to withdraw it from consideration.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The setback illustrates the tricky political position
confronting the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. He is juggling
the demands of 55 diverse Republicans, many of whom want to delay a
treaty vote to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment and others who want
to kill the pact regardless of the international repercussions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lott took a step toward averting a vote when he
signaled that he would accept assurances from Senate Democrats that
they would not seek action on the treaty until President Clinton
leaves office. Republicans had insisted that Clinton make that
pledge, but he has refused.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can be guaranteed that it would be set aside and not
come up in this Congress, then we could accept that,'' Lott told
reporters after a spirited luncheon with other Senate Republicans.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, answered Lott's call, saying
in a letter that he would support Clinton's request to postpone the
vote and agreed not to reschedule the treaty, absent ``unforeseen
changes in the international situation.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Republicans balked, Daschle changed the phrase to
``extraordinary circumstances,'' as defined by the two leaders.
Democrats insisted on that provision in the event Pakistan or
India, for example, resumed nuclear weapons tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the wording drew strong opposition from Republican
hard-liners like Sens. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, who complained that Democrats would use the ``loophole''
to seize on the slightest global disturbance and wield the treaty
as a campaign issue next year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The objections killed a proposed exchange on the Senate floor
between Lott and Daschle that would have defused the political and
procedural brinkmanship that has engulfed the treaty since Lott
surprised Democrats two weeks ago by answering their demand to
bring it up with a no-notice vote.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed agreement, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
would be sent back to the Foreign Relations Committee for further
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's setback, a growing number of Democrats and
Republicans seemed eager to postpone the vote. Sens. John Warner,
R-Va., Republican, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., released a
letter Tuesday to their two leaders, endorsing efforts to delay
Senate action on the treaty until the next Congress convenes in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen senators have signed the letter so far.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned half a dozen
moderate Republicans on Tuesday, urging them to consider the
diplomatic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters have warned that the Senate's defeat of the
accord would send a dangerous signal to emerging nuclear nations
like India and Pakistan that it was acceptable to continue testing.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, amid reports of a military coup in Pakistan, Lott
scoffed at those concerns and said the unrest in Pakistan would not
have any bearing on the Senate's action.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it have any bearing on this debate? Lott said.
``What we're talking about in this treaty is the national security
of our own country. Nothing we do here will have any affect on the
government in Pakistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes maneuvering overshadowed the Senate's
second day of debate on the treaty itself. Critics and supporters
mostly read from prepared statements, speaking to a largely empty
chamber.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expressed astonishment that Republicans would insist
on voting on a pact that the president requested withdrawn for
national security reasons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of the treaty have won, for now,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Why push for this vote if the president
of the United States has asked for delay because of his fears? This
isn't politics. This goes to the heart of our security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics argued the pact would permanently bind the United
States' ability to test while rogue nations, and perhaps even China
and Russia, cheated and conducted nuclear explosions that eroded
America's atomic deterrent.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty is based on noble, idealistic goals, but it fails
the hard-reality test,'' said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. ``The U.S.
usually lives up to the agreements it signs. But there is no
guarantee that other nations would follow the letter of the law.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To put the treaty into effect, ratification by 44 nations
believed to have a nuclear capacity is needed. Only 26 countries,
including Britain and France, have done so. China, which has not
ratified the pact and is taking its lead from the United States, on
Tuesday urged the Senate to approve the treaty.

VISIT FROM MICHAEL JORDAN SURPRISES STUDENTS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURGAW, N.C. _ The tall, well-dressed man strode confidently
Tuesday morning down the corridors of Pender High School.
</P>
<P>
   As a former high school player in a neighboring county, the man
with one of the most famous faces in the world was no stranger to
Pender County schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dreaded coming up here because you always knew it was going
to be a challenge, but it was a great atmosphere,'' Michael Jordan
said, recalling when his team from Laney High School in Wilmington
traveled to the old Pender High School, now Burgaw Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Jordan took on another challenge, seeking to
brighten the lives of about three dozen high school students whose
families had lost everything to the extensive flooding caused by
Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The swing through Pender County marked a rare public appearance
for Jordan in Southeastern North Carolina. The visit included
touring areas hit hard by flooding and a stop at a Salvation Army
disaster relief center.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Jordan and his wife Juanita made a $250,000
contribution to the North Carolina governor's hurricane relief
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Figured if I had to visit anywhere in North Carolina, it
better be close to home,'' he said, noting he has many relatives in
Pender County. ``I mean, when I was growing up here in Wilmington,
we thought it might happen, but it never did. Now it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he talked from the heart to the roughly 35 students who
had no idea why they were summoned from their classes for a special
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just want to tell them that sometimes God gives us
tests, deals you bad cards now and again,'' Jordan said as he
waited in a side office to be introduced. ``It's how you respond
that matters. All you can try and do is grow and get stronger from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The superstar took care that his appearance not become a media
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want a circus,'' said Estee Portnoy of Falk
Associates Management Enterprises, the Washington, D.C.-based
agency that manages Jordan's business affairs. ``He wanted it to be
personal, focused on the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 a.m. the three dozen students found themselves
facing Principal Dorothy Dempsey after having been summoned to the
home economics classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were all in trouble or something,'' sophomore
Steve Easley said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After being told a special guest wanted to see them, Michael
Jordan sauntered in grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, it really is Michael Jordan,'' said one student as
Jordan began laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan deftly answered questions about his cars, if he brought
the students any sneakers, and how cartoon character Elmer Fudd,
his costar in the movie Space Jam and recent MCI commercials, was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere changed when a student asked Jordan how he had
overcome the death of his father James Jordan, who was murdered in
1993 at the age of 56.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 36, said although the loss was devastating, on
reflection he felt lucky to have spent so much time with him and to
have had such a good role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my father for 30 years,'' he said. ``Some kids don't
have their father that long. I felt fortunate to have had him that
long, to have the chance to spend time with him, for him to teach
me how to make right decisions. That was the positive that came out
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   After signing all the hall passes used to call the students to
the meeting, and an odd towel, T-shirt, picture, notebook and
envelope, Jordan climbed into the driver's seat of a Range Rover
for the short drive to the Salvation Army center in Burgaw.
</P>
<P>
   There, adults looked wide-eyed in amazement as Jordan wheeled a
shopping cart full of underwear and Gatorade into the former
pharmacy building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do these go?'' he nonchalantly asked a volunteer as she
stood open-mouthed, not believing what she was seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation Army supervisor Ray Dalrymple said when he was told
Monday someone important was stopping by, he wasn't excited because
he thought it would be another politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's Mike!'' he said. ``He's bigger than any politician.''

 &HT;    Early results indicate Alabama votes down lottery; Mayor slot
may need runoff
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel and Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Gov. Don Siegelman's effort to establish a
lottery for education in Alabama appeared headed for defeat
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With 44 percent of the state's 2,627 precincts reporting, the
``no'' votes led 56 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my church-going customers said they voted no,'' said
Emilo Davis, owner of the downtown GroSouth plant and feed store,
where the lottery vote dominated conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery supporters predicted a turn-around before all the votes
were counted, but Rebecca Paul, CEO of the Georgia Lottery, was
among those who acknowledged that Siegelman may have to try again
in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a presidential election year, you've got a much better
chance of passing that constitutional amendment,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters streamed to polls statewide to cast ballots on the
constitutional amendment that would make Alabama the sixth state in
the Deep South with a lottery behind Florida, Kentucky, Virginia,
Louisiana and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In another major vote in Alabama on Tuesday, interim Mayor
William Bell, the hand-picked successor of Birmingham's first black
chief executive, led 13 challengers but a runoff appeared possible.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 percent of the city's precincts reporting, Bell had 34
percent of the vote, well short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a
runoff. City Councilman Bernard Kincaid was second with 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the statewide lottery vote, early forecasts indicated turnout
would exceed the 57 percent that voted in last November's
gubernatorial race. Siegelman was elected overwhelmingly then on
the promise of delivering a lottery that would fund HOPE
scholarships like those awarded in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``farm boy,'' Davis said he plays lotteries in
Georgia and Florida. He has hopes of a state-funded scholarship for
his son, Emilo Jr., and voted for a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the well-to-do people are against it,'' said
Davis, whose red brick store stands three blocks from the Capitol
and next door to the banquet building where lottery advocates
gathered Tuesday night. ``It seems like for the poor people, it's a
way for them to grow up to better things.''
</P>
<P>
   With scores of churches opposing the amendment, the choice in
many areas of the state was depicted as God vs. the governor.
</P>
<P>
   On Madison Avenue, a few blocks from the cold, marble steps of
the Capitol, a billboard with a white background loomed over
traffic. ``Lottery?'' the billboard asked. in bold, black letters.
The answer came in red letters: ``W.W.J.D. What would Jesus Do.?''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides got considerable help from Georgians. Former Georgia
Gov. Zell Miller stumped for the lottery alongside Siegelman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support them,'' said Wyck Knox, chairman of the Georgia
Lottery. ``Their goals and ours are the same: better education. So
we're not competitors in the bigger sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmett Henderson, executive director of the Georgia Council on
Moral and Civic Concerns, was among those helping Christian
conservatives leading the fight against the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said it's been difficult for lottery opponents to
mount an effective campaign. ``When you have a sitting governor
saying that anybody who doesn't support the lottery should be
ashamed of themselves, it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand the gambling craze that has gripped this
country,'' he said. ``For state government to be in that business
is wrong. ''
</P>
<P>
   The largest Christian group in the state _ the Alabama Baptist
Convention, part of the Southern Baptist Convention _ ferociously
opposed the amendment and donated tens of thousands of dollars to
anti-lottery groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voted no,'' said Faye Lipham as she and her husband walked
out of the brick city gymnasium in Lanett, a town near the Georgia
border. ``I'm a Christian and I don't believe in bringing anything
like that here. I've never known gambling to help schools.'' A
Democrat, Lipham voted for evangelical Christian Fob James in last
fall's gubernatorial election carried by Siegelman. Also in Lanett,
Elizabeth Yerta said droves of people pretended to be morally
anxious about the lottery, but still play the games in Georgia and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who's got religion has religion 24 hours a day,''
Yerta said. ``Those who are righteous are righteous when it's
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida opened the Deep South to lotteries when it began started
games in 1988. Critics later complained revenue generated by the
Florida lottery didn't supplement the education budget, but rather
became the primary source of funding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Georgia voters narrowly approved a constitutional
amendment that permitted a lottery. At the time, Miller, as a new
governor, offered HOPE scholarships, merit awards for students who
attended state colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall in South Carolina, where Jim Hodges also rode the
promise of an education lottery to the governor's mansion, voters
will decide whether to start a lottery there.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, Alabama polls consistently showed lottery
support at 60 percent. But a barrage of ads on both sides depressed
support to 49 percent in a poll taken Thursday by the Alabama
Education Association, which favors the lottery. However,
opposition remained stable at 35 percent but the number of
undecided voters rose to 15 percent _ an indication that voters had
wearied of lottery polls.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia officials _ including Miller, two of his former
press aides, his 1994 campaign manager and his one-time pollster _
boosted lottery advocates in Alabama. Miller's former press
secretary helped run Siegelman's gubernatorial campaign and acted
as the primary spokesman for the Alabama referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, federal government employee Steve McCarver said
he voted for the lottery because of the Legislature's reluctance to
raise taxes for anything, including education. But he was put off
by the visible opposition of organized religion, which openly
contributed to political action committees that opposed Siegelman's
lottery proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have their tax-exempt status yanked,'' McCarver
said. ``That's partisan politics. ``That should stay in church.
Once it travels out of church, it's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol Heights Community Center, a precinct dominated by
elderly retirees, Leon Anderson, 60, and his wife, Doris, both
voted yes despite their church and minister preaching against the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to buy a ticket,'' said Leon Anderson, retired
from the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Said Doris Anderson, a retired accountant for the state
Department of Education, ``I just wanted to keep the money in our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson thought of his two grandchildren, ages 10 and 14, who
live in Alabama. More than likely, they'll go to college in state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this wasn't for education, I wouldn't have voted for it,''
he said. ``This is a voluntary tax.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Seattle beat 40 other U.S. cities early this year
for the right to be the host of a meeting of the world's governing
trade organization, local leaders were exultant. Here in what is
often called the most trade-dependent region of the nation, they
said the conference would be a chance to showcase Seattle as a
world-class center of high-tech innovation and a friend to global
trade.
</P>
<P>
   All that may still happen when 5,000 delegates and dignitaries
from 134 nations _ including President Clinton _ gather to start a
new round of global trade negotiations here in November. Those
negotiations will encompass some of the most politically sensitive
issues facing the world's trading nations, including rules on
agriculture and new technologies. But it is increasingly clear that
the largest free-trade meeting ever held in this country has also
become a giant protest magnet for a broad array of environmental,
labor and other groups that say the trade body is a handmaid to
corporate interests whose authority should be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred groups are vowing to bring 50,000 people or more
to downtown Seattle to picket, demonstrate, hold teach-ins and
cause general disruption during the Nov. 30-Dec. 3 meeting that
could turn the city's streets into a carnival of protest and,
perhaps, a morass of gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of how crucial trade issues have become to average
people that a meeting once might have excited only policy experts
now has drawn the attention of a cross-section of America that
includes farmers, fishermen and assembly-line workers.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO has already been entangled in spats over items that
include Caribbean-grown bananas, hormone-fed beef from the United
States, gas refined in Venezuela and Japanese imported liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Even more contentious issues loom: over loss of price supports
for American farmers and over rulings about what kinds of
genetically modified foods countries can offer to consumers on
supermarket shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying all the individual issues is a fundamental
disagreement about the proper role of the trade organization.
Proponents say it serves a crucial role in bolstering the world
economy by tearing down trade barriers all over the globe. But
opponents believe that the WTO is using its power as an arbiter in
trade disputes to systematically undermine laws passed by various
countries to promote health, food safety, environmental protection
and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It is from those diverse concerns that a vigorous protest
movement has emerged. Just how extensive or disruptive any protests
will be is difficult to gauge, partly because even the groups
themselves, more than 300 at latest count, are not exactly of one
mind. Some say they have no plans to be unduly raucous and simply
want their perspective to be heard by the trade negotiators, while
others are boasting that their goal is to bring the city to a
standstill with guerrilla-like tactics like scaling skyscrapers to
unfurl huge banners, lying in the street to stop traffic or
chaining themselves to buildings and trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is already budgeting $6 million for a major
security operation and Mayor Paul Schell, noting the potential for
disruption, has taken to joking: ``I'm hoping for rain, frankly.''
While Seattle is indeed likely to get some rain at that time of
year, it may not dampen the fervency of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the camp that wants to shut the WTO down,'' explained
John Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society of Berkeley, Calif.,
which recently helped to lead what was called a ``Globalize This!''
training session for protesters at a farm near the Cascade
Mountains, outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the largest gathering of unaccountable
corporate power that has ever occurred on this planet, and it
should be stopped,'' said Sellers, who described his group as
``open to work with anyone who is working for progressive social
change on the left side of the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the protesters have already scored important
victories and in Seattle, a city with a long history of union
activity and a decidedly favorable bent toward environmental
causes, they are clearly generating some sympathy. The local King
County Council, for instance, recently haggled over and nearly
failed to approve wording for a routine resolution of welcome to
the WTO delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled when Seattle was selected,'' said Michael
Dolan, a field organizer for the protesters, who is deputy director
of the Global Trade Watch program of Public Citizen, a group
founded by Ralph Nader. ``It's almost like they're giving us
home-field advantage. There are great labor unions here, great
labor energy, all these environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters have commanded the attention of local news
organizations and, in what was clearly a bid to defuse some of the
potential for conflict, the Clinton administration has taken the
unusual step of pressing the WTO's leaders to hold a one-day
meeting just before the conference gets under way to listen to the
protester's concerns. The president also plans to send several
members of his cabinet to Seattle in the weeks before the
conference to talk up the benefits of free trade.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The new director-general of the Geneva-based trade body, former
New Zealand Prime Minister Mike Moore, was in Seattle earlier this
month and used a forum at the University of Washington to concede
that the trade body had not done an adequate job of explaining its
mission to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the case had been made,'' Moore said. ``But I guess
we have to back up the truck and explain how we got here. We've
never reached out.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the five-year-old trade organization and the 1948
framework pact that preceded it, the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, known as GATT, say it is helping to bolster the world
economy and lift workers out of poverty by bringing down barriers
to trade all over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents believe the WTO is using its power as an arbiter
to systematically undermine laws passed by various countries to
promote health, food safety, environmental protection and better
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In just one such case, several Asian nations won a preliminary
ruling from the trade organization last year after they charged
that the U.S. laws intended to protect sea turtles from shrimpers'
nets unfairly blocked their exports to U.S. markets. The protesters
also say a ruling in favor of Venezuelan gas exporters had the
effect of weakening anti-pollution laws in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record of the WTO speaks for itself,'' said Jeremy Madsen,
an organizer with the Citizens Trade Campaign, a coalition of
dozens of groups opposed to the WTO. ``It's not something that is
beneficial for workers, it's not beneficial for the environment. It
has an atrocious impact on everyone but the elite, the very
wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, clearly alarmed at the attention the protesters
have already generated here, plan to organize their own campaign to
promote the benefits of free trade. However, as a spokesman for one
such group said, they do not exactly plan to rappel down the Space
Needle to explain their point of view and therefore may not draw as
much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the story in terms of media coverage is that we do
pretty well in print, but we lose big-time on the pictures,'' said
Scott Miller, a lobbyist with Procter &AMP; Gamble who is chairman of
the United States Alliance for Trade Expansion, a group backed by
business and based in Washington, D.C. ``That will continue to be
the dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the trade organization say the organization
has adopted secretive operating rules that are practically forcing
critics into public protests. Even when Moore came to Seattle on
his scouting trip, he was met with protesters who carried signs
that said ``Stop child labor now'' and ``No globalization without
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't all that much left, really, because the system is
so closed,'' said Patti Goldman, managing lawyer of the
Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental group. ``It isn't
democratic. There's no participation process for the public to play
a role. That is a fundamental problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell, among others, is clearly walking a bit of a political
tightrope, but he says he simply wants to make sure that the city
is a good host to both those attending the trade conference and
those who come here to protest it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the other side of the picket lines, and so have a
lot of people here,'' the mayor said in an interview. ``They need
to be heard. Seattle likes hosting these kinds of things. We see
ourselves as an open city, a center for creative debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he added, ``one of the things I'm going to try to
convey to the protesters is that they are more likely to be
effective if they find the right ways to be heard. People listen
better when they're not being shouted at.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen of the Citizens Trade Campaign said the protests would be
respectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of everyone involved is to have a very peaceful
event, or series of events, that really speak to the issues,'' he
said. ``The goal is not really to disrupt the city per se. Traffic
probably is going to get clogged, it's going to be hard to get
downtown. But a lot of that won't have anything to do with us, it
will have to do with security perimeters set up by the police, the
FBI. The potential for real catastrophe is being greatly
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   But with such a widespread call to protest, and with some groups
already vowing disruption, the potential is certainly there, said
Walt Crowley, a local author and director of a Web site of Seattle
history, historylink.org.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the labor movement, the environmental movement, and
other interest groups have legitimate concerns and even grievances
with the WTO,'' said Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to reform a process and the structures for
guiding international trade, they're not trying to blow them up,''
he said. ``But they kind of have a protest going on with festival
seating, which means you really have no control over who's sitting
next to you. And I think there's some anxiety that the theatrics of
protest are going to eclipse the content.''

UCLA GRADUATE SCHOOL TO GET BIG DONATION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Peter W. Mullin, a Los Angeles entrepreneur and
philanthropist, is donating $5 million to the John E. Anderson
Graduate School of Management at UCLA, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin's donation will fund a chair and faculty research
projects on a wide range of business issues, said Bruce Willison,
dean of the Anderson School.
</P>
<P>
   The school is ranked among the top 10 graduate business programs
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very, very nice gift,'' he said. ``This is a powerful
statement of Peter's belief in the future of the Anderson School
and in the promise of the vital research done by our faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, who owns a firm that focuses on insurance and executive
compensation issues, attended the University of California, Los
Angeles for a year and became interested in the Anderson School
because of its work in the field of entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing leads to another. You give, then you want to get
more involved. You get more involved, and you want to give,''
Mullin said in a statement. ``I truly believe the Anderson School
is one of the finest management-education institutions in the
world. I want to do what I can to ensure that continues to be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin's gift will pay for the ``Peter W. Mullin Endowed Fund
for Faculty Excellence.'' The school is also renaming its
Anderson's Management Commons building the Mullin Management
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin supports a variety of charitable causes, particularly
those related to education in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of California, Santa Barbara, he
founded Mullin Consulting Inc. in 1969. He also co-founded
Strategic Compensation Associates and M Financial Holding Co.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS MAKING DEMANDS OF GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If any presidential candidate could be expected to be
warmly embraced by the environmental movement, it would be Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But when the vice president arrives in Seattle Wednesday to kick
off his state campaign with a $1,000-a-plate dinner in Seattle,
environmental leaders are likely to greet him not with open arms,
but with detailed demands.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are pressing Gore _ and the Clinton
administration _ for everything from rescue tugs at the Strait of
Juan de Fuca to including the removal of Snake River dams as an
option in salmon recovery plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's challenge is to reassert his historic leadership
position on the environment, which has been tarnished by seven
years of defending oft-compromised positions,'' said Bill Arthur,
director of the Sierra Club's Northwest office.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have not abandoned Gore, author of ``Earth in
the Balance.'' But their pressuring the vice president points out
not only some problems in the Gore campaign, but also how the
environmental movement and its political clout have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, environmentalism in the Northwest was a
bipartisan cause. Republican Govs. Dan Evans in Washington and Tom
McCall in Oregon fought to create a Hells Canyon National
Recreation Area on the Snake River. Evans and GOP Rep. Joel
Pritchard were instrumental in the fight for an Alpine Lakes
Wilderness Area.
</P>
<P>
   But the environmental lobby has turned away from Republicans in
recent years, arguing that the party of Theodore Roosevelt has
turned away from them. The Sierra Club has endorsed Democrats in
the past four presidential elections. Environmental groups serve as
off-season employers for Democratic campaign consultants and
pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain is
playing up his conservation credentials, the battle for the hearts
and minds of organized environmentalists is between Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   One small environmental group, Friends of the Earth, has already
endorsed Bradley, who is actively courting West Coast
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Gore's problems stem from the tempestuous relationship
the Clinton administration has had with environmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been willing to compromise conservation
programs in order to achieve other goals. He signed a controversial
timber rider that allowed some logging of old growth. He signed a
Kosovo emergency funding bill last May that included a rider that
cleared the way for a controversial gold mine in Okanogan County.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also opposed Republican congressional efforts to
roll back environmental laws. The proclamation of a 1.7
million-acre Escalante-Grand Staircase National Monument in Utah's
canyonlands helped Clinton become the first Democrat since Harry
Truman to carry Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue tug issue has been a particular headache for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, a bevy of top conservationists met with U.S.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater in Everett. They urged
Slater to find a way to put a tug at Neah Bay, and to demand that
the administration order escorts for laden oil tankers in the
Strait of Juan de Fuca west of Port Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggested the vice president's visit this week would be a
good time to announce any resolution of this issue,'' said Kathy
Fletcher, executive director of People for Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   (Transportation interests argue that a system is already in
place where tugs will come to the aid of stricken vessels, and that
additional requirements would hurt Puget Sound ports by burdening
shippers with unnecessary costs.)
</P>
<P>
   (``The industry has voluntarily implemented the state of the art
International Tug of Opportunity System in which more than 100 tugs
that travel the waters of Puget Sound and British Columbia can be
immediately called upon in emergency situations,'' said Jim Keough
of Sea-Land Services.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore, during a Seattle visit last year, said the Clinton
administration had a process under way for ``resolving'' the tug
escort issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the process will not be completed in a matter of
hours, I assure you it will be completed before the rough seas of
winter drive up the risk factors again,'' Gore said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists had hoped the issue would have been
resolved long before now.
</P>
<P>
   Are the environmentalists worth the price they are demanding?
Their clout is a matter of dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 and 1998 elections, a trio of Washington House
Republicans _ Randy Tate, Rick White and Linda Smith _ appeared on
the League of Conservation Voters national ``Dirty Dozen'' list of
alleged enemies of the environment in Congress. All lost.
</P>
<P>
   But now, ``All of the polls I've seen show the environment at
the moment a non-player in the presidential race,'' said Denis
Hayes, president of the Bullitt Foundation and a director of the
League of Conservation Voters.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups plan a major effort, keyed to Earth Day
2000, to raise the profile of such issues as clean air and urban
sprawl. Earth Day comes in April, just after key primaries that
will decide the GOP and Democratic nominations.
</P>
<P>
   They have well-heeled allies. Media mogul Ted Turner is putting
millions of dollars into such causes as the League of Conservation
Voters education fund. Seattle philanthropist Paul Brainerd has
committed $1 million a year over three years to make the
environment a more important political issue. Brainerd hosted Gore
at a Democratic fund-raiser last year.
</P>
<P>
   But cautionary notes are coming from some senior Democrats. One
of them, former Rep. Al Swift, represented a northwest Washington
House district that included a big green constituency as well as
resource and farming towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (environmentalists) could drive Gore beyond the pale,
even in our state,'' Swift said. ``You can be zealous to the point
of being blind to practicality. The Christian right has done it to
the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues have played well in the West Coast states
of Washington, Oregon and California _ all of which have Democratic
governors. In the Mountain West, however, even the Clinton
administration's limited environmentalism has cost the party
dearly. Democrats have lost five governorships since the
Clinton-Gore administration took office.
</P>
<P>
   Former Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who has helped preserve millions
of acres of public land, warns that Gore is already far too closely
identified with unyielding greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Gore has to take a major share of blame for the
decrease of Democrats in statehouses and congressional seats in the
(Mountain) West,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club's Arthur disagrees. ``Here are opportunities for
the vice president to stand up and say he is working to preserve
environmental laws,'' he said. ``I believe it plays well across the
country.''

NADER OFFERS BOOK-LENGTH CRITIQUE OF WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Detailing criticisms likely to form the basis for
much of the protest in Seattle next month, Ralph Nader Wednesday is
releasing a study of the World Trade Organization alleging that the
WTO is undermining environmental and public health laws around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But the critique is being disputed by the Clinton administration
and business officials, who say Nader is misportraying a variety of
actions taken by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The book-length report, published by a consumer group Nader
founded called Public Citizen, claims that, since its founding five
years ago, the WTO has decided against every public health, safety
and environmental regulation it has considered.
</P>
<P>
   The book claims that the WTO has usurped the right of nations to
determine their own environmental, health and labor laws, and calls
the WTO ``a slow-motion coup d'etat over democratic governance
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In approving the far-reaching, powerful World Trade
Organization and other international trade agreements ... the U.S.
Congress, like those of other nations, has ceded much of its
capacity to independently advance health and safety standards that
protect citizens ... ,'' Nader wrote in a preface to the book.
``Under this new system, many decisions affecting people's daily
lives are being shifted away from our local and national
governments and instead are being made by a group of unelected
trade bureaucrats sitting behind closed doors in Geneva,
Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism was immediately rejected by the Clinton
administration and business groups that have argued that the U.S.
economy and workforce have benefited from the nation's membership
in the WTO, and that the rules-based trading which the WTO
represents opens new markets for U.S. exports. President Clinton
plans to make a speech tonight outlining his objectives for the WTO
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been ceded,'' said Dianne Sullivan, director of
trade policy for the National Association of Manufacturers and a
key adviser to a pro-WTO business coalition, U.S. Alliance for
Trade Expansion. ``There isn't any WTO case that has said anything
to the contrary. It's just that we have to apply all laws equally
to domestic companies and foreign companies.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. trade official, who asked not to be identified,
said that the United States has not compromised any of its
environmental or other values even when it has had to change
regulations to comply with WTO rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (WTO) appellate body has gone out of its way to recognize
and acknowledge the legitimacy of environmental objectives,'' the
official said. ``We can disagree with the appellate body on whether
our measures were being implemented in a discriminatory way, but
we're quite able to comply and correct perceived discrimination in
a way that meets our environmental objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader brings to the WTO debate some credibility, as well as
controversy, as the country's best-known consumer advocate. Nader
became famous for challenging automobile industry safety practices
in the mid-1960s. When he criticized Microsoft's practices in 1997,
the company went out of its way to praise him even as it disagreed
with his complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Nader argues that the WTO, because of its emphasis on fostering
barrier-free trade, inevitably views national labor, environmental
and public health laws as trade barriers. And he argues that the
organization is unusually secretive.
</P>
<P>
   His complaints are not new, but the Public Citizen book
represents the most comprehensive effort to date by WTO critics to
spell out the reasons for their concerns. Critics have been
promising widespread protest in Seattle when the world's trade
ministers gather for a WTO meeting starting Nov. 30, but at times
some of the groups have seemed longer on slogans than on specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The book argues that the United States has already weakened laws
protecting endangered sea turtles and dolphins and has weakened
domestic clean air regulations to comply with edicts of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trade official said those cases are being misconstrued
by the WTO critics.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Citizen Action claims that, ``the U.S. relaxed
standards designed to limit gasoline contaminants after Venezuela
won a WTO challenge.'' According to the trade official, the United
States did have to revise regulations that were being applied
differently to foreign oil companies than to domestic companies,
but clean air standards were not relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Action claims that, because of the WTO, ``the Clinton
administration worked ... to water down a popular U.S. law designed
to prevent dolphins from being killed in tuna nets.'' The U.S.
trade official said the changes in law were supported by a variety
of environmental groups, including Greenpeace and the World
Wildlife Fund.

HIGH COURT TO HEAR STARR'S APPEAL IN HUBBELL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ariz., Ga., Va., Pa., Texas)  (bl) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whatever unfinished business remains in the office
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, that business now includes a
new Supreme Court case. The justices Tuesday agreed to hear Starr's
appeal in a case growing out of his prosecution of Webster Hubbell,
the former Justice Department official and law partner of Hillary
Rodham Clinton, on a charge of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell pleaded guilty in June to the charge, a misdemeanor, as
well as to an unrelated felony charge, receiving probation for both
with no fine and no jail time. The tax plea was conditional; the
indictment would be dismissed entirely unless Starr could persuade
the Supreme Court to overturn a federal appeals court decision that
had sharply limited his ability to build a case on financial
records that Hubbell had produced under a grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told the justices in his brief that the appeals court had
``made it infeasible to bring Hubbell to trial'' under its
restrictive interpretation of the federal immunity statute in the
context of a subpoena requiring the production of documents that
turn out to be incriminating. Although neither side has much left
at stake in the case, the Supreme Court probably accepted the
appeal to examine an immunity question that could recur in ordinary
federal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The precise legal question in the case is whether, in order to
be able to use the documents despite an earlier grant of immunity,
the prosecution has to show it already knew with ``reasonable
particularity'' that the incriminating documents existed when it
issued the subpoena. Hubbell had turned over some 13,000 pages of
his business records, and Starr has conceded that he would not be
able to show that when an Arkansas grand jury issued a subpoena for
this material, he knew that it would contain evidence that Hubbell
had failed to pay taxes and penalties of more than $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district judge who threw out the case last year
denounced the independent counsel's tactics as ``a quintessential
fishing expedition.'' The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit then vacated that ruling, giving Starr another
chance to use the tax records but setting the standard that he says
is impossible to meet.
</P>
<P>
   As the appeals court interpreted the Supreme Court's precedents,
the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled
self-incrimination applies to producing personal papers as well as
to giving testimony, on the theory that providing documents of
which a prosecutor is unaware is itself a form of testimony that
serves to validate the papers' existence and authenticity. Only
when the existence and possession of the documents is a ``foregone
conclusion,'' the appeals court said, is there no testimony
involved.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, United States vs. Hubbell, No. 99-166, Hubbell
refused to produce his records without a grant of immunity, which
Starr gave him. In defending the indictment he later obtained,
Starr is arguing that the grant of immunity did not extend to the
purely physical act of producing documents that Hubbell had created
voluntarily, long before they were sought.

 WASHINGTON: were sought.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a busy day at the court, these were some of the justices'
other actions.
</P>
<P>
   Parochial School Tuition
</P>
<P>
   For a second week, the court declined to address the question of
government support for religious school tuition. Without comment,
the justices turned down a pair of cases from Maine, where a state
law gives school districts the option of not building their own
high school, but instead paying tuition for parents to send their
children to nearby public or private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of parents with children in Roman Catholic high
schools sued to require the state to pay parochial school tuition
as well. An earlier version of the law had made no distinction
between religious and secular schools, but in 1981, the state
attorney general issued a formal opinion declaring that under
Supreme Court precedent, the government could not provide a direct
subsidy for religious school tuition. The legislature then amended
the law.
</P>
<P>
   In their respective lawsuits, one filed in state court and the
other in federal court, the groups of parents argued that while
there was no right to have the state pay for private school
tuition, once such a program was established, the state was obliged
to support, on a neutral basis that did not discriminate against
religion, the private choices that individual parents made.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court rejected this argument in
Bagley vs. Raymond School Department, No. 99-163, as did the 1st
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Boston, in Strout vs. Albanese,
No. 99-254.
</P>
<P>
   Neither these cases nor a tuition tax credit case from Arizona
the justices turned down last week directly presented the Court
with a pure school voucher case of the sort now working through the
courts in Ohio and Florida, under which parents receive public
money for tuition at the school of their choice. The justices have
evidently decided to wait for more legal developments.
</P>
<P>
   Right to Counsel
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court refused to hear a death penalty
appeal from Georgia that raised the question of whether the
Constitution requires a state to provide competent counsel for an
inmate challenging his death sentence in a state petition for a
writ of habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate in this case, Exzavious Gibson, did not have a
lawyer, and repeatedly told the judge that ``I don't know what to
plead.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is a right to counsel at trial, the Supreme Court
has not extended that right to post-conviction proceedings like
habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   The court's last pronouncement on the issue, in a 1991 case from
Virginia, was, however, somewhat equivocal. While the court ruled
by a 5-4 vote that there was no right to post-conviction counsel,
the fifth vote was provided by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who
noted that the issue had not been presented in its starkest form
because there had not been an inmate in Virginia who had not
managed to find some legal representation on a habeas corpus
petition.
</P>
<P>
   Groups including the American Bar Association and the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., had hoped to use this
case, Gibson vs. Head, No. 99-77, to persuade the court to
re-examine the issue, in light of recent developments including the
elimination by Congress of federal money for state resource centers
that used to provide lawyers for habeas corpus representation. Many
of those centers have closed, the bar association told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Bible Tax
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down an appeal by the state of Pennsylvania of
a decision barring the state from giving a sales tax exemption for
Bibles and religious publications sold by religious groups. The
Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the
selective exemption violated the constitutional separation between
church and state. The case was Pennsylvania vs. Newman, No. 99-154.
</P>
<P>
   Luggage Search
</P>
<P>
   Accepting an appeal from the federal public defender's office in
San Antonio, the court agreed to decide whether a law-enforcement
officer, looking for drugs, who squeezes or otherwise manipulates
the luggage carried by bus passengers is conducting a ``search'' in
the constitutional sense, requiring a warrant or probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Bond vs. United States, No. 98-9349, a border
patrol agent entered a Greyhound bus at a checkpoint in Sierra
Blanca, Texas, and walked down the aisle, feeling the luggage in
the overhead bins. The agent felt a brick-like object in a canvas
bag located over the seat of a passenger, Steven Bond, who
identified the bag as his and permitted the officer to open it. It
contained methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   While the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
ruled that the event was not a ``search,'' on the ground that a bus
passenger does not have a ``reasonable expectation of privacy'' in
carry-on luggage, other courts have reached the opposite
conclusion.

TRUTH BE TOLD, SOX ARE A BUNCH OF CLOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They will not even be the best story in the
neighborhood when they play Wednesday night. You could take the
nearby No. 4 Express and find someone with a tale more intriguing
than any told by the Red Sox. You could walk a couple blocks to the
Bronx County Building and find people with more compelling things
to say. You could find better comedians among the kids who attend
P.S. 156.
</P>
<P>
   But that has never been how the Sox advertised themselves. They
are not in the American League Championship Series because they are
more interesting or talented than anyone else. They will be playing
the first game of a best-of-seven series at Yankee Stadium because
they know what to expect from each other.
</P>
<P>
   You ask how they got to this point. Here's your answer:
</P>
<P>
   They are a bunch of clowns.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat: The Sox, described by many as grim-faced,
grease-under-their-fingernails baseball warriors, are truly a bunch
of baseball clowns. That is their  It is why they keep
hanging around when everyone else expects them to go home. If they
go home, they wouldn't have as much fun teasing people as they do
now. So they stay. And tease each other.
</P>
<P>
   No, they will not be the best story in the Bronx, but they just
may have more fun than anyone else in the area. That certainly is
not a job requirement. You can be dour and still help your team
win. But the performance of this Sox team matches the personalities
of the players. That is, these guys are unusual. They can be
serious and tell you why they believe they can win the World
Series. Then they can find some weakness of yours and talk about
you to your face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is probably Darren Lewis,'' Sox outfielder Butch
Huskey said Tuesday. ``He always has something to say about
somebody. But we all got him back (Monday) night.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Sox beat the Indians, 12-8, Monday night to advance to
the ALCS, Lewis stood at the front of the team bus and gave a
speech. Before he finished, he was reminded of his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see the game?'' Huskey said. ``Did you see the way he
was running the bases out there?''
</P>
<P>
   On a long fly to center, Lewis neglected to tag up and go from
second to third. In the same inning, still on second, Lewis decided
he could simply stroll to third base when a teammate drew a walk _
even though there was no one on first. He zoned out. After
realizing what he had done, he tried to scramble back to second. He
would have been picked off if Indians catcher Sandy Alomar hadn't
thrown the ball into center field. He eventually made it to third.
The hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis heard about that from his teammates. And what about the
speech?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather keep that to ourselves,'' left fielder Troy O'Leary
said with a grin. But Lewis tried to clarify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own little Def Comedy Jam going sometimes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was reminded that there is often some choice language in the
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he said, ``sometimes we have some of that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how they entertain themselves during the season. Some of
their jokes rank as pure family humor. You have to know the quirks
of the person to fully appreciate the putdown.
</P>
<P>
   If more people knew this side of the Sox, there would be yet
another reason to buy into their underdog, Everyman persona. You
know people who are just like these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you,'' Lewis said, ``there isn't one prima donna
in this room. Not one. The term that everybody is using these days
is ``old school.' You hear that a lot on ESPN, but that's us. We
are old school baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have people who care about their contracts or how
many square feet they have in their houses. We just play the game.
Nobody is trying to be pretty. Nobody wants to have their own
dance. In the modern era of pro sports, that's a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget that other part, the part about being clowns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you walked into the Sox clubhouse and asked,
``Where is the Shop-a-Holic?'' someone would quickly tell you when
they last saw Pat Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call him that because he always seems to be walking around
with a Dillard's bag,'' Lewis said of the pitcher. ``We were all in
the clubhouse in Cleveland and Jeff Frye _ who likes to poke fun _
saw Rapp walk by with a bag. He said, ``What are you doing now,
buying Christmas ornaments?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That exchange went on just before Game 5, when most people
probably expected the Sox to be in war mode. They can be serious
when necessary. Their point is that it isn't always necessary.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's favorite targets is the media. Tuesday, Mike
Stanley was asked when the team was ``written off.'' Stanley
replied that he didn't know ``if we have ever been written on.''
Later, Huskey was asked about the alleged curse that has kept
Boston from winning a World Series since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curse?'' Huskey said. ``If you believe that, you believe in
those psychic people talking on the phone. And from what I
understand about Bill Buckner, he shouldn't have even been in the
game he was hurting so bad. Why put a guy in that position?''
</P>
<P>
   Just before it was time to clear the clubhouse, Bret Saberhagen
told a story that was symbolic of the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a 6-foot-7-inch guy going against a 5-4 guy and
the 5-4 guy believes he can take you out, he's the guy you should
be afraid of,'' he said. ``We're guys who really believe we can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   At least you would know what to expect from the 5-4 Sox. They
would box with you for a while. Afterward, they would stand among
themselves and tell a few jokes.

COMMENTARY: DRAGON LADY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The good news for Bill Clinton is that New Yorkers
think he's less of a threat than the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for Bill Clinton is that New Yorkers think he's
more of a threat than the blasphemous elephant dung at the Brooklyn
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In a Fox News poll about the Hillary Rodham Clinton-Rudolph
Giuliani Senate race, voters here were asked ``Which of the
following is the biggest threat to New Yorkers' quality of life?''
Sixty percent chose the West Nile virus; 8 percent chose the
Brooklyn Museum's ``Sensation'' exhibit, and 20 percent were most
alarmed by Bill Clinton's moving into the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 65 percent of those polled felt that Mrs. Clinton's
bid would be more successful if the president did not campaign for
her.
</P>
<P>
   This conjured up an image of Hillary as Cate Blanchett in the
movie ``Elizabeth,'' when the vibrant young woman, feeling she must
desexualize herself to rule, chops off her long hair, covers her
skin with white pancake makeup and assumes the grim visage of the
Virgin Queen.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Hillary Clinton finds herself on a seesaw. The worse
her husband treats her, the more popular she is. The better he
treats her, the worse she'll do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should do her the favor of being bad again.
</P>
<P>
   The president is baggage. And Hillary doesn't need baggage. What
she herself needs is what she herself has been: a lightning rod.
Someone to stand beside her and absorb all the heat and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Todd Lincoln played that role for Abe. Eleanor Roosevelt
for Franklin. Nancy Reagan for Ronnie. Marilyn Quayle for Dan. And
Hillary for Bill.
</P>
<P>
   There was often a sense that it was the wives who wore the
pants, and sometimes called the shots. These women were seen as
being steelier, and sometimes smarter, than their charming, boyish
husbands. They were seen as scarier than their husbands _
enforcers, goaders, disciplinarians, nannies.
</P>
<P>
   Such strong-minded spouses make excellent scapegoats. It was
easy to blame them when something went wrong. They could be neatly
stereotyped as carping harpies who pushed their husbands into
trouble. It let the men stroll blithely along as the women took the
hits, sometimes deserved and sometimes not. The men were seen as
henpecked or oblivious, while their wives were cast as dragon
ladies, whispering and scheming.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan was Marie Antoinette. Marilyn Quayle was Cruella De
Vil. Eleanor Roosevelt was a Bolshevik. Hillary was Lady Macbeth in
a headband.
</P>
<P>
   Writing about his feud with Mrs. Reagan, Donald Regan, the brash
businessman who was fired as President Reagan's chief of staff,
compared Nancy to Livia, the ``clever but ruthless woman who ruled
the Roman Empire ... through the manipulation of her much older
husband, Augustus Caesar,'' and routinely poisoned rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary was cast as the Clinton who cared about money, and
therefore was the force behind Whitewater, the Rose Law Firm
billing scandal, the Castle Grande trailer-park fiasco and the
commodities-trading imbroglio. Clinton foes saw her as the mano
morto behind the travel office and FBI files scandals.
</P>
<P>
   So now that Hillary is out there in the open, running on her
own, the lightning rod needs a lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   The role could go to Susan Thomases, who earned the impressive
titles of ``King Kong kibitzer'' and ``alleged kingpin of the
Hillary network'' during the 1992 campaign, when the New York
lawyer spent a lot of time bullying people, including Al Gore, and
making threats along the lines of ``If you do this, I will kill
you! I will ruin you!''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Observer reports that Ms. Thomases is back, playing
porcupine in the New York campaign. ``Susan Thomases has
effortlessly reverted to her `Primary Colors' role of driving all
levels of Clinton staff to the nearest broom closet for desperate
swigs of Lestoil,'' wrote Tish Durkin.
</P>
<P>
   But while she would surely make an excellent set of brass
knuckles to make Hillary seem gentle by contrast, she might not be
high-profile enough for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton may have to follow in the pumps of Margaret
Thatcher, who boldly absorbed her own lightning when she took the
strict-nanny thing and just went with it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Giuliani has proved that New Yorkers like discipline
_ up to a point.

 &HT;    Bengals reflect on positives of first win
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Carl Pickens' expressionless face was buried in a
magazine and he responded in a disinterested monotone to questions
about the two touchdowns he scored in Cleveland on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But when a writer asked him about his blocking, the 29-year-old
receiver became much more loquacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was sweet, wasn't it,'' he smiled while describing the
hit that allowed tailback Corey Dillon to break off a 38-yard gain
that led to the  first touchdown in the 18-17 victory over
the Browns. ``People don't bring it up very often, but I take a lot
of pride in my blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens holds Bengals career records for touchdown catches (59)
and receptions (492) and is third in yardage (6,307), but he can
also do the grunt work.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job on that play was to secure the back side in case Corey
decided to cut it back,'' Pickens said in describing his role on
Dillon's big run. ``You always want to get your assignment done
because you never know when things are going to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Pickens' persistence, a play that started as a
meltdown didn't become one of those breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Dillon was supposed to run to his right, but the hole never
opened. He cut back to the left, circled behind Pickens' block and
motored to the 1-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   On the next snap, Dillon was thrown for a 4-yard loss, but then
rookie quarterback Akili Smith froze the Cleveland secondary with a
play fake and found Pickens uncovered in the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first TD pass of Smith's career and the first of the
season for Pickens, who missed all of training camp in a contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Smith and Pickens teamed up for the game-winner with five
seconds left, the receiver going high above cornerback Ryan O'Neal
on one of his patented fade routes.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens and Jeff Blake made the fade a staple in their personal
arsenal, but it wasn't their exclusive property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also worked the fade with Boomer Esiason, David Klingler,
Donald Hollas, Neil O'Donnell _ a bunch of quarterbacks,'' Pickens
said. ``I can't remember for sure, but I think I even caught one
from Hootie and the Blowfish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals head into Sunday's home game against Pittsburgh with
a 1-4 record. And despite the confidence boost provided by Smith,
which is expected to contribute to the first sellout of the season,
Pickens is well aware that winning a game by one point in the final
seconds against a winless expansion team is not convincing evidence
of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a game, which we desperately need to do,'' he said.
``Now we've got to take the positives that came out of that game
and build on them. At the same time, we've got to take the
negatives and learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember how good we felt when we walked off the
field. We have to believe that we can do that every week and we
have to work hard enough to make it happen.'' CONTACT Marty
Williams at 225-2252 or e-mail marty_williamscoxohio.com

BILL TO OVERHAUL FINANCIAL SYSTEM FACES VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress moved closer Tuesday to completing
legislation that would overhaul the nation's financial system, the
Clinton administration denounced a new Republican measure
introduced by three top lawmakers and said it would be vetoed by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate have already adopted competing
versions of legislation this year that would tear down the
Depression-era barriers that have restricted banks, securities
firms and insurance companies from expanding into each other's
businesses. Efforts at reconciling the two bills had stalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the logjam was broken when three senior Republicans
said they had reached a compromise on most aspects of the
legislation, including measures that would offer some privacy
protections to consumers and some regulatory relief to smaller
banks, and said their agreement had moved Congress considerably
closer to completing their work on a final bill. A House-Senate
conference committee is scheduled to begin its final work on the
measure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guarantees that we will pass a bill and it will now be up
to the president to decide whether he will sign it,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who heads the Senate Banking Committee. Gramm
joined two House committee chairmen, James Leach and Thomas Bliley
Jr., in announcing the new measure.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, R-Iowa, heads the House Banking Committee, while Bliley,
R-Va., is chairman of the House Commerce Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials quickly tried to pour cold water on the
proposal. The officials said the Republican compromise was a giant
step backward and would be rejected by the White House because it
failed to safeguard community lending or protect the privacy rights
of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They also said there was little hope that the parts of the
legislation objectionable to the White House would be significantly
changed before a vote by a House-Senate conference committee soon,
and that Tuesday's announcement could thus doom prospects of
financial services legislation during the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bill were presented to the president in its current
form, the president would veto the bill,'' Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said. ``The administration is disappointed by the
recommendations on the Financial Modernization bill put forth by
Chairmen Gramm, Leach and Bliley on Tuesday. A flawed process risks
producing flawed legislation. In important respects, the chairmen's
proposal abandons the bipartisan consensus that the House
legislation achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers and other administration officials Tuesday criticized
the legislation for failing to provide privacy protections for
consumers and for heavily diluting the Community Reinvestment Act.
That 1977 law encourages banks and savings associations to make
loans to minorities, farmers, inner-city residents and others who
have historically been denied access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican compromise also left open a long-standing dispute
between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve about which
would have regulatory primacy over many of the nation's banks.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to broker a deal to resolve the issue, Gramm and Leach,
who supports the administration's position on the regulatory issue,
managed to get Summers and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, to
reopen their negotiations concerning the issue Tuesday morning. The
two sides made progress but by the end of the day were still far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the House of Representatives and the Senate
passed competing versions of legislation that would repeal the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration has
expressed a strong preference for the House version, sponsored by
Leach, and had threatened to veto the Senate version, sponsored by
Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   The measure announced Tuesday continues to favor the Federal
Reserve as a top regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Leach said that the provision was ``only a place holder,''
that would be reconsidered during the mark-up later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is more deference to the Treasury, we all
recognize that we will be inviting a veto,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While some Democrats and the Clinton administration criticized
the proposed legislation for weakening provisions of the law that
encourage lending to minorities and the poor, other Democrats said
it represented an important move for Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, Phil Gramm has begun to take a step in the right
direction, but he still has a few more to go before this bill can
become a law,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``It's now quite
clear that the banking bill will be made or broken on the Community
Reinvestment Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats said that the privacy and regulatory issues
remained significant concerns as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican measure eliminates Gramm's proposal to exempt
more than 4,000 smaller banks and savings associations from the
requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. In its place, the
new measure loosens the act's requirements on many more smaller
institutions by replacing annual reviews of their lending records
with reviews once every five years.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also adopts a provision from the House bill that
limits banks and other financial companies from sharing customer
information with marketers and other third parties. But
administration officials said that the new measure also contains
new definitions that significantly weaken that provision.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also does not prevent affiliates of the same
corporation from sharing customer information. So, for example, an
insurer would be able to give confidential customer information to
a bank if the two companies are affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation's privacy provisions raise concerns among
liberal and conservative groups. An alliance of critics, including
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate; Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle
Forum; Nadine Strossen of the American Civil Liberties Union; Sen.
Richard Shelby, R- Ala., and Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., will hold a
news conference on Wednesday.

 &HT;    Ohio Hall of Fame to induce Donahue, Kirk
 &HT;    By Bob Batz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two former Dayton broadcasters _ Phil Donahue and
Steve Kirk _ will be inducted into the Ohio Radio-TV Broadcasters
Hall of Fame in Akron on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue started his radio career in Dayton in 1959 in the news
department at WHIO-AM (1290). Later, after a stint as host of the
popular Conversation Piece show on the station, he moved to
television.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak of popularity, The Phil Donahue Show reached as many
as 25 million households each week. The program, which earned
Donahue the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award for Daytime
Television from the American Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences, went off the air in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, who started his 37-year radio career as a $235-a-month
morning-show host at a station in Bellaire, Ohio, made his Dayton
debut on WING-AM (1410) in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   During his 25 years at WING, Kirk _ who also worked at radio
stations in Cincinnati and Columbus _ was known for his sense of
humor and willingness to make personal appearances. He retired in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Day, a news anchor-reporter at Dayton's WDTN-TV, Channel 2,
is already a member of the Ohio-Radio -TV Broadcasters Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk is thrilled by the honor. ``Just think,'' he said Tuesday
from his home in Ponce Inlet, Fla. ``Me and Phil Donahue in the
Hall of Fame. I never thought it was possible.''

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Oct. 4,
about the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin misstated the
burial site of Leo Baeck, a prominent rabbi. It is in London, not
Berlin.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Sept. 12,
about the investment banker Roger C. Altman and his role as adviser
to CBS in its merger with Viacom misstated the background of Robert
A. Altman, for whom the investment banker is occasionally mistaken.
Robert Altman was formerly the president of First American
Bankshares, a company controlled by the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. He was not the chairman of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce.

</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Sunday, Aug. 22,

operations in Ukraine referred incorrectly to the formation and
ownership of the company. It was founded by two brothers, David and
Simon Reuben. Lev and Mikhail Cherny, two brothers from Uzbekistan,
had no involvement in the company's formation. While Lev Cherny is
a joint venture partner, Mikhail Cherny has no connection with the
company. The article also misstated the date of Trans-World Group's
founding. It was in 1977, not the late 1980's.

BANK OF NEW YORK EXECUTIVE RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-BANKS) 
(DW) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of two executives suspended in August at the Bank
of New York, resigned Tuesday and said that the bank had unfairly
abandoned her in the federal investigation of possible money
laundering at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior vice
president who ran the Eastern European division of the bank, said
in a letter to the chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas A.
Renyi, that ``not once during this investigation, with all the
media it has had, has the bank seen fit to publicly or privately
defend me and let it be known that there is not one negative thing
to say about me.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the bank declined to comment except to say that
the bank had a copy of the letter and that ``we acknowledge the
resignation and wish her well.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement authorities here and abroad have been examining
the suspicious movement of $7.5 billion from Russia through a
handful of accounts at the bank since 1996. Although much of that
money was apparently related to schemes to avoid taxes and duties,
investigators have said they believe that a significant part of the
funds may have derived from illicit activities in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky, who is living in London with her husband and
also has a home in New York, has not been charged with wrongdoing
by any law-enforcement agency. Last week, a federal grand jury
indictment was unsealed in Manhattan that charged three others, a
former Bank of New York executive, Lucy Edwards; her husband, Peter
Berlin, and a business associate, Aleksey Volkov, with running an
illegal wire-transfer business in New York through three companies,
including Benex International Co. and Becs International LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, who worked for Ms. Kagalovsky at the bank, was
suspended by the bank on Aug. 18, after press inquiries about the
federal investigation. The bank dismissed Ms. Edwards shortly after
her suspension for what the bank called ``gross misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have focused on Ms. Kagalovsky not only because
she supervised Ms. Edwards, but also because she played a leading
role in securing business for the bank in Russia. Many bank
customers in Russia were large banks that collapsed in the wake of
the financial crisis there last year. The Russian banks have been
criticized for freewheeling ways. One, Bank Menatep, was overseen
by Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, the bank's
former vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said beyond innuendo
surrounding the Kagalovskys' relationship, investigators have no
grounds to be suspicious of his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to hide,'' Arkin said in a telephone interview
Tuesday. ``She's a very reliable and trustworthy woman. She should
not have had her life impacted this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Arkin added, the Benex and Becs accounts under
scrutiny were not opened in Ms. Kagalovsky's division and were not
under her supervision. The accounts, according to the indictment,
were controlled by Ms. Edwards and Berlin. But the bank declined to
say who supervised the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   People with knowledge of the investigation said the Bank of New
York was not preparing to discharge Ms. Kagalovsky. Arkin said
there were no legal reasons behind her decision to resign. He said
the decision was based on the desire to move on professionally and
leave a bank that refused to support her.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Ms. Kagalovsky said she has been ``living in
professional limbo'' and ``subjected to painful baseless rumor
arising out of the federal investigation.'' She said the bank's
abandonment of her had left her to ``swing in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and the FBI declined to
comment on Ms. Kagalovsky's resignation. The bank has not been
charged with wrongdoing and has been cooperating with the inquiry.

   RUSSIA: ZHIRINOVSKY TO TRY AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said he might form
a new party to get back on the ballot for the December
parliamentary election. The Central Election Commission
disqualified Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party from the vote,
saying senior officials had failed to declare all of their
property. Zhirinvosky said he might submit a new list of
candidates, forge a new bloc or perhaps even create a new party.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: MANDELSON ON THE JOB
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson spent his first full day as Northern Ireland
secretary meeting in Belfast with the leaders of the Ulster
Unionists, the largest Protestant party, and Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA. Mandelson, Prime Minister Tony Blair's
closest confidant who is returning to government 10 months after
being forced out in a financial scandal, was accompanied by Mo

   Farmers in Plymouth blocked French trucks from bringing produce
into England to protest France's refusal to comply with the
European Union's Aug. 1 decision to lift the ban on imports of
British beef. France says its own food safety experts doubt the
European Commission's finding that British beef is fully free of
the mad cow disease that prompted the 1996 ban.

   The police arrested six people in three counties in connection
with what they said was an operation to smuggle arms from the
United States to the Irish Republican Army. The IRA is in the third
year of a cease-fire and says it has not sanctioned the import of
any weapons.

   ITALY: ANDREOTTI DENIES MAFIA MEETING
</P>
<P>
   Acquitted last month of charges he conspired with the Mafia in a
1979 murder, former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 80, dismissed
a Palermo prosecutor's claim that in 1987 he met and kissed
Salvatore (The Beast) Riina, a convicted Mafia boss. ``If I as
prime minister really went to a home of a person under house arrest
to meet with a man known to be a Mafia chief on the run,''
Andreotti told the jurors, ``then this court should not only
condemn me but lock me up in a psychiatric prison.''

   Fifty imprisoned Marxist guerrillas ended a three-week hunger

FANS IN SEARCH OF TICKETS COME UP EMPTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anthony D'Antonio, 39, of Danvers, Mass., took the day
off from work to stake out the ticket office at Fenway Park
Tuesday. He commandeered a folding chair and settled in on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   D'Antonio pledged to wait all day to buy a ticket for the
playoff series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem: No tickets were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll feel sorry for me,'' said the car salesman.
``I'm telling you they will sell tickets. It's just one of those
waiting games.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans are accustomed to maintaining hope in the face of
constant heartbreak. And Tuesday, Red Sox management has to contend
with the angry beast it created.
</P>
<P>
   Not one single, lonely ticket changed hands at the box office at
Fenway Tuesday. All post-season tickets had been sold by telephone
by Oct. 2, according to a team spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   A few insistent fans promised to sit and wait all day at Fenway,
in the belief that the same loyal faith that the Red Sox rewarded
with their improbable victory against the Cleveland Indians might
be rewarded again with a showering of tickets from the gods of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, about 200 fans, a team spokesman estimated,
waited in line outside Fenway for tickets that didn't exist. Some
had camped out all night, only to be turned away by police around
9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, of course, are still available to those who can pay a
steep price. By Tuesday afternoon, bidding on the online auction
site eBay (www.ebay.com) had soared to $4,000 for four box seats
for game three on Saturday, the first Red Sox home game of the
American League Championship Series and the prized Roger
Clemens-Pedro Martinez pitching matchup. Another pair of tickets
sold for $950.
</P>
<P>
   Those who could not afford to pay such inflated prices were
outside Fenway Park with nothing do but wait, hope and _ in some
cases _ vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a chess game with them,'' said 47-year-old Richard
Frost as he stood in the stairway outside the ticket office. Frost
intended to maintain his vigil for at least an hour or two. ``I'm
here, and now it's their move. They've got tickets. They sell 'em
when they want to sell 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many, Frost angrily accused the Red Sox of ignoring the
average fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to make friends with the neighbors around here
and get on good terms with us, why don't they sell the tickets to
us?'' Frost said. ``They're playing hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Bresciani, Red Sox vice president of public affairs,
defended the practice of selling tickets over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best and fairest way to accommodate our fans,''
he said. ``Otherwise you're going to have people mobbing our ticket
office, and it doesn't give a fair chance to our fans in New
Hampshire and Maine. They are Red Sox fans, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has sold thousands upon thousands of tickets to
individual fans, Bresciani said, filling up all of the aged
ballpark's 33,800 seats. About 65 percent of tickets go to season
ticket holders, Bresciani added, while others are reserved for
corporate sponsors and the other Major League teams.
</P>
<P>
   The face value for the playoff tickets is $35 for bleacher
seats, $50 for the grandstands and $65 for box seats, Bresciani
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the law of supply and demand meant that those who had
tickets could sell them for a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket brokers were asking for $1,500 to $2,000 for lower box
seats and $500 for grandstand seats, according to Jamie Moore, a
concierge at the Four Seasons Hotel. He fielded dozens of call
through the day from out-of-towners looking for a room and a set of
tickets, but many balked at the ticket prices Moore told them
brokers were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The powerbrokers will pay anything to impress a client,''
Moore said. ``But if the real people have any sense they're going
to wait a few days until everyone gets a feel for the market.''
</P>
<P>
   While Red Sox fever has swept Boston, ticket brokers say they
still have a tough time purchasing tickets and then reselling them
for a profit. Some had no tickets to offer at all; others had only
a handful because they refused to buy from season ticket holders
for hundreds or thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not getting involved in it. I'm fed up. It's ridiculous,''
fumed Tony, a broker who goes by ``The Ticket Guy,'' but refused to
give his last name. ``Go to a bar, watch the game on a nice
big-screen TV, and have a nice dinner, and don't pay anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some fans say they will take his advice, others are still
willing to open up their wallets. Michael Conlon, a security
company executive from Winthrop, Mass., who walked away from Fenway
disappointed Tuesday, said he would shell out a few hundred bucks
for a ticket. After all, he spent $750 a piece for tickets to the
All-Star Game played at Fenway this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get in here somehow,'' Conlon said, pointing to the
ballpark. ``The whole thing is historic. Being a baseball fan for
30 years, this is an amazing event. ''

 &HT;    Samsung, Dell sign deal on screens
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Seeking to avoid future shortages of screens
that have slowed sales of notebook computers this year, Dell
Computer Corp. has signed a five-year, $8.5 billion agreement with
Samsung Electronics Ltd. for millions of displays beginning next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also said Tuesday it will invest $200 million in Samsung
bonds, providing the world's leading maker of LCD screens with
additional capital to expand its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these agreements make us a preferred partner
of Samsung's and will provide us with a massive stream of LCDs
based on leading-edge display technology,'' Dell Chief Executive
Michael Dell said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of liquid-crystal display screens stems from the
economic crisis that swept over most of Asia beginning in early
1998. Companies in Japan and South Korea, which supply more than 90
percent of screens, cut spending on new plants by 35 percent, said
Ross Young, president of DisplaySearch, an Austin company that
monitors the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dell and other PC makers have experienced heightened
demand for notebook computers, and their customers were forced to
wait weeks for some models. DisplaySearch forecasts that LCD
companies will supply only 86 percent of the 16.3 million projected
demand this year for thin-film transistor screens.
</P>
<P>
   Those high-quality displays, often referred to by the initials
TFT, have a transistor for each of the thousands of tiny elements
that control the illumination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook for the TFT-LCD market can't be better,'' said
Shim Yong Jae, an electronics analyst at SG Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell's investment reconfirms the industry trend, which will
benefit leading LCD suppliers such as Samsung.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said Asian LCD makers increased their investments in their
plants by 40 percent this year, but production won't significantly
increase until late in 2000. DisplaySearch expects there will be an
oversupply by the second quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spokesman T.R. Reid said the contract with Samsung commits
the company to buying a much higher number of LCDs than Dell buys
now. ``We have very robust growth forecasts for our notebooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell's revenue from notebook sales grew 49 percent in the second
quarter, more than twice the rate of the PC industry. As part of
its more aggressive pursuit of consumer business, Dell recently
began offering notebooks in blue and gray casings.
</P>
<P>
   Dell doesn't provide details of its agreements with contractors.
But Young of DisplaySearch estimates Samsung will supply about 60
percent of Dell's notebook LCDs this year. Samsung, which has a
memory-chip plant in Austin, also supplies Dell with memory,
monitors and CD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   The convertible Samsung bonds, which have a maturity of 39
months, yield annual interest of 5 percent. Dell can exchange the
bonds into common shares or depositary receipts at $216.22 per
share _ a 28 percent premium to Tuesday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Apple Computer Inc. agreed to invest $100
million in Samsung for a guaranteed supply of LCDs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain, whose size, strength and intimidation made him
probably the most dominant player in basketball history, was found
dead on Tuesday in his home in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Black, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Lakers,
Chamberlain's last team, the authorities were called to the home
shortly after noon Pacific time and found the body. Jim Wells, a
Fire Department spokesman, said there were indications that
Chamberlain had suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was hospitalized in 1992 because of an irregular
heart beat, and his agent and friend, Sy Goldberg, said Chamberlain
was on medication. He had always stayed in good physical condition
and recently ran in the Honolulu Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   At 7- feet 1 inch and 275 pounds, Chamberlain was an awesome
offensive force, and while he scored many points with gentle
finger-roll shots, he also became the game's first monster dunker.
Before he came along, basketball had such big centers as
6-foot-10-inch George Mikan and 7-foot Bob Kurland. But Chamberlain
was bigger and stronger, with a more fearsome inside game, so
dominant that the National Basketball Association widened the
free-throw lane to force him farther from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He started an era of dominant centers that included Bill Russell
of the Boston Celtics, his antagonist in so many playoff and
championship series, and continued with the 7-foot-2-inch Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, and today with the 7-1, 315-pound Shaquille O'Neal of
the Lakers. They, like Chamberlain, were dominant not just because
of their height, but because they combined strength with agility
and the ability to play above the rim. Indeed, the title of
Chamberlain's 1991 autobiography reflected his legacy _ ``A View
From Above.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so spectacular that he had two nicknames _ ``Wilt the
Stilt,'' which he disliked, and ``The Big Dipper.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 seasons in the NBA, starting in 1959 wiadelphia and
ending in 1973 with the Lakers, he played 1,045 regular-season and
160 playoff games. He scored 31,419 points, the NBA career record
until Abdul-Jabbar broke it, and grabbed 23,924 rebounds, still the
league record. He averaged 30.1 points and 22 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   His teams reached the playoffs 13 times, but only two won
championships _ the Philadelphia 76ers in 1967 and the Lakers in
1972. Four of his teams lost in playoff finals and six others in
conference finals. In three of those championship finals, Russell
and the Celtics won the seventh and final game by 1 or 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous game came on March 2, 1962, when Philadelphia,
then known as the Warriors, played the New York Knicks in Hershey,
Pa. Helped by giddy teammates, he scored 100 points, still the
one-game record. What made it more stunning was that Chamberlain,
one of the poorest free-throw shooters the sport had known, sank 28
of 32 that night.
</P>
<P>
   He led the league in scoring seven consecutive seasons (1960-66)
and in rebounding 11 times in 14 seasons. He was voted the league's
most valuable player as a rookie in 1960 and again in 1966, 1967
and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a giant of a man in every sense of the word,'' the
National Basketball commissioner, David Stern, said in a statement
on Tuesday. ``The shadow of accomplishment he cast over our game is
unlikely ever to be matched.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Koppett, the basketball historian, called Chamberlain
``clearly the most dominating player who ever played basketball,
maybe not the best, but the most dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell was probably the most influential player,''
Koppett said, ``but one on one, Wilt overwhelmed him like anybody
else. There has been nothing like Wilt since.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain seemed almost irritated over the fuss made over his
100-point game at the expense of other accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hot that night,'' he said. ``They were feeding me and it
was just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA records he liked best were his season records of 50.4
points a game in the 1961-62 season, 48.5 minutes a game the same
season and 27.2 rebounds a game in 1960-61. He also holds the
single-game record for rebounds, 55, set against Boston in 1960.
Russell used to joke that he ``saw every one of those 55
rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Kareem full credit for breaking my all-time scoring
record,'' Chamberlain said in an interview in 1994. ``It's a record
of longevity, not a flash in the pan. The important records are the
ones that take an athlete many games or years to amass. Anyone can
have a great game, but having 1,000 good games has more
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those records were more than having one lucky night. When I
was at Kansas, Walt Wesley was averaging 4 points a game, but one
night as a pro, for the Cincinnati Royals, he scored 50-something
points. Kareem was in the 50s only once in his career, so does Walt
Wesley equal Kareem? I saw Bo Jackson run 94 and 97 yards for
touchdowns in one game, and no one else ever did that, but does
that mean he's better than Jim Brown or O.J. Simpson or Walter
Payton?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more records to shoot at now, and records become a
bigger deal. Some records are manufactured out of thin air. When I
was playing, who knew of double doubles and triple doubles? They
had no significance, no meaning. I had triple doubles every night,
and they didn't even keep track of blocked shots then.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Records aside, Chamberlain is forever linked with Russell. It
was Chamberlain, the extrovert, against Russell, the introvert;
Chamberlain, the bull, against Russell, the smoothie. As Jeremy
Larner wrote in Life magazine in 1967:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt has played the role of offended nobility, self-conscious
up and down and off the court, consumed by aristocratic agonies
whenever any agent, force, power, referee or teammate queers the
act. In contrast to Russell, who with his grim visage and tense,
spare physique, never makes a move that isn't purposive,
Chamberlain blossoms with excessive gestures and dysfunctional
contortions, sitting up atop himself almost apologetically as he
powers for point after point.''
</P>
<P>
   Their rivalry through the 1960s and '70s captivated fans and
helped build the NBA into the attraction it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Chamberlain powered for point after point only when
his team owner and coach wanted that. Part of his greatness was
that he could do almost anything needed.
</P>
<P>
   When he started playing pro basketball, the 24-second clock
(under the rule that requires a team to shoot within 24 seconds of
gaining possession) had been introduced only five years earlier.
The public was fascinated by scorers. So when Chamberlain entered
the NBA, Eddie Gottlieb, who owned the Philadelphia Warriors,
wanted to maximize that appeal. If others could score 30 points a
game, Gotlieb wanted Chamberlain to score 40 or 50 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain obliged, but once he had averaged 50 points a game
for an entire season, the thrill was gone. The team wanted him to
pass more, and he soon became the league leader in assists. The
team wanted him to play defense more, and he became even more of a
terror. Whatever the team needed, he did it, and better than almost
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born on Aug. 21, 1936, in
Philadelphia. He didn't begin playing basketball until he was in
the seventh grade. He grew 4 inches in three months when he was 15,
and was 6-11 when he entered Overbrook High School in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After leading Overbrook to three public school championships and
two all-city titles, Chamberlain became one of the most recruited
plyers ever with over 200 colleges interested.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the University of Kansas and Coach Phog Allen, now in
the Hall of Fame. In his first game against the Kansas varsity _
freshmen weren't allowed to compete against other teams then _ he
scored 50 points before a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd of more
than 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, he led the 1957 Jayhawks to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament finals, where Kansas
lost to unbeaten North Carolina in triple overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Disgusted by being smothered by zone defenses, Chamberlain left
Kansas after his junior year and joined the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, extremely agile for his size, ran cross-country in
high school and was an outstanding high jumper and shot-putter at
Kansas. His passion besides basketball was volleyball, and wanted
to try to qualify for the Olympic volleyball team but was unable to
because professionals were not eligible for the Games then.

ARMY PLANS MAJOR OVERHAUL TO ALLOW FASTER RESPONSE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Army will undergo its most significant overhaul in decades,
aimed at allowing it to respond far more quickly to to short-term
crises worldwide, the Army's senior leaders announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation will begin immediately with two brigades at
Fort Lewis south of Seattle, and eventually extend to the entire
Army.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are aimed at getting combat units in place in days,
not the weeks or even months that have been the rule in recent
years. And fewer support units will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki discussed the broad
outlines of the plan yesterday at a meeting of defense industry and
service officials in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Many details were unavailable yesterday, including whether the
reorganization will involve fewer or more troops than the two Fort
Lewis brigades currently have, or the overall cost to redesign them
into what one official called a ``lethal medium'' force.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the Fort Lewis brigades to be converted
within 12 months. They will abandon the heavy equipment such as
tanks and infantry fighting vehicles the Army has used for decades
in favor of lighter ``wheeled'' equipment that can be rushed to the
battlefield more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just five months after the Army was unable
to deploy an Apache attack helicopter force from Italy to Macedonia
in time to play a role in the NATO strikes against Serbia. And a
decade ago, it took several months for the Army to move each of its
heavy divisions from the United States to Saudi Arabia in Operation
Desert Shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to transform the Army, all components, into a
standard design ... that allow(s) us to put a combat-capable
brigade anywhere in the world in 96 hours once we have received
`execute liftoff,' a division on the ground in five days,''
Shinseki told the Association of the U.S. Army Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also envisions using advanced computer networks and
secure communications to significantly reduce the number of support
troops and the amount of logistical supplies that will be sent into
battle zones aboard the Air Force's new C-17 airlift fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' said John Grady, communications director for
the Army association, when asked about the plan. ``This can really
be a revolution in the way soldiers can fight wars.'' Grady called
the plan ``one of biggest changes to the Army in the last 50
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said Fort Lewis will become ``the
vanguard of our new military strategy of fast-deployable troops''
under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Army has organized its combat forces as
``heavy'' or ``light'' divisions and brigades, with the heavy units
organized around battalions of 70-ton M1A1 Abrams tanks or M2
Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and artillery units. Light units
consist of foot soldiers trained for basic infantry operations,
using non-armored ``Humvee'' vehicles or troop-carrying helicopters
to maneuver on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy units are too bulky to deploy to overseas emergencies
rapidly, and light units lack the protective vehicles and firepower
that can enable them to protect themselves in sustained combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely excited about this opportunity,'' said I
Corps spokeswoman Lt. Col. Melanie Reeder at Fort Lewis. ``It is a
great initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said he picked the base because its ``infrastructure,
maneuver space and gunnery ranges will accommodate such a
transformation.'' I Corps commander Lt. Gen. James T. Hill will
preside over the restructuring of the two brigades.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lewis currently has both a heavy and a light brigade. The
3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division is an armored unit with 3,700
soldiers including two tank battalions and one mechanized infantry
battalion. The 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division, is a light
infantry unit with 2,600 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Both units, beginning with the 3rd Brigade, will begin
conversion into a new combat identity centered on an as-yet
undefined ``wheeled'' combat vehicle that provides armored
protection and cannon firepower for troops but is 50-70 percent
lighter and easier to fly to distant battlefields, Shinseki said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has no such vehicle in its inventory, but the Marine
Corps has fielded a light armored vehicle for the past decade.
Officials said they did not konw if the Army intends to buy that
version or press for a different version.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki told the Washington audience he does not intend to take
years to develop the new combat vehicle. ``It is our intent to have
an initial set of prototype vehicles beginning to arrive at Fort
Lewis this fiscal year,'' the general said.
</P>
<P>
   At a later news conference with Army Secretary Louis Caldera,
Shinseki said it was too early to spell out what kinds of
equipment, including armor, will be done away with. ``Everything's
on the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question he posed to industry is, `What can you provide
off the shelf fairly quickly that meets our requirements for
protection, mobility and lethality?''' explained a senior Army
official, speaking on grounds of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials were adamant that the initiative is not an
experiment or technology test. ``These are operational units that
will be deployed,'' the senior official said.

ARMY IS RESTRUCTURING WITH BRIGADES FOR RAPID RESPONSE

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a first step in what could ultimately be the
most significant restructuring of the Army's combat divisions since
the Vietnam War, the Army on Tuesday announced that it would create
two new lighter, more mobile brigades able to deploy anywhere in
the world within 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism that the Army had moved slowly to adjust
to the post-Cold War crises most likely to confront the nation, the
Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric Shinseki, outlined what he said
would be ``a major transformation'' of the Army over the next
decade, beginning with the new brigades.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said the Army would reduce the large support units that
accompany combat brigades when they deploy. He also said the Army
would reconsider the weapons systems it buys, paying greater
attention to those that are lighter but still lethal.
</P>
<P>
   With advances in technology and tactics, he added, the heavy
weapons now at the heart of the Army's structure, like the the
Abrams M1-A1 tank, could become obsolete. They would be replaced by
wheeled vehicles that could be moved overseas in greater numbers
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is on the table,'' Shinseki said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement was a significant reversal for the Army,
which only last year considered but then rejected changes in the
structure of its forces. The issue was revived this year after the
NATO air war against Yugoslavia, when the Army took more than a
month to deploy a squadron of Apache helicopters to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the changing world in which we live today, we've got to be
able to get to the fight faster,'' said Army Secretary Louis
Caldera on Tuesday. Caldera appeared with Shinseki before the
Association of the U.S. Army, a booster organization, here in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of the proposal remain unresolved, including the
exact size and shape of the new brigades, which will be based at
Fort Lewis, Wash. Shinseki and other Army officials said those
details would be ironed out in the weeks ahead as the service
prepares its budget for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he stopped short of realigning the Army's 10 combat
divisions, as some experts have called for, Shinseki said the
Army's distinction between ``heavy'' armored divisions and
``light'' infantry or airborne divisions would soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If technology provides the answers we think, then what we have
traditionally described as light and heavy will begin to merge,''
the general said. ``I think you will see the entire transformation
will go toward capabilities that give those divisional formations
the lethality that the heavy forces have and the agility of the
lighter forces.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Of all the armed services, the Army probably has arguably had
the most difficult time transforming itself to reflect the
unpredictable world in the post-Cold War era. To its critics, the
Army has moved too slowly to change a force that, although smaller,
still looks much as it did when the United States was prepared to
slug it out with the Warsaw Pact on the plains of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Krepinevich, the executive director of the Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, in Washington, said Tuesday's
announcements showed the Army understood the challenges it faces.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the changes stopped short of addressing the real
problem, which he said is the ability to put large forces into
combat in remote areas without the support bases it has relied upon
in past conflicts. In the Persian Gulf war, the United States had
six months to build up a force in Saudi Arabia before driving Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like the Army is talking the talk, but it is taking
baby steps on the walk,'' Krepinevich said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two new brigades are designed to be ``medium'' forces _
lighter than the heavy armored units but still operating with
armored vehicles, unlike infantry or airborne units. They are
expected to have about 3,000 soldiers each and will be converted
from existing units now at Fort Lewis: the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd
Infantry Division and the 1st Brigade of the 25th Infantry
Division.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rather than having 70-ton Abrams tanks, the brigades will be
equipped with lighter armored vehicles, no more than 20 tons each.
To speed the creation of the units, Shinseki said, the Army will
buy existing vehicles now available, such as those used by the
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army has considered creating medium divisions in the
past, it has not significantly altered the structure of its
division since 1965, when it created the light airborne divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said the brigades would serve as a model in the years
ahead for restructuring the rest of the Army, which now has six
heavy and four light divisions, along the lines of the plan he
outlined Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Army being called on to send troops across the globe,
he said that all divisions would have to become more mobile, able
to travel aboard cargo aircraft like the C-17, which carry only a
tank at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's goal, he said, will be to deploy a full division with
15,000 soldiers within five days, and five divisions within a
month. ``That is a stretch from our current capability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said that to accomplish that the Army had to reconsider
the weapons that it has designed for the future, shifting attention
to those that are more mobile.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not specify any in particular, Army officials
have said that one of the Army's biggest programs _ the $11.5
billion effort to build a self-propelled howitzer called the
Crusader _ could be dramatically scaled back or cut altogether.

VALENTIN TAKES IT ALL IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He knows how it works. Once upon a time, he was the
Flavor of the Month, the way Wilton Veras was not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take much to go from Flavor of the Month to
Resident Poison Pill. Have one season perceived to be far below
your established standard (even if, on closer examination, it isn't
really so bad), then have another year in which you play hurt and
really do play poorly, and management introduces a fresh young face
into your spot and your own fans register a 10 on the Boo-O-Meter
when you're introduced prior to the first home game of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's got to hurt, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually very easy to take,'' maintains John Valentin,
one of the many Red Sox heroes during the epic weekend dispatch of
the Indians in the American League Division Series. ``Because it's
baseball. Everybody wants to see the old guy out and the new guy
in.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, ``everybody'' really did mean just about everybody
except the one man whose opinion really mattered. Jimy Williams
wasn't about to turn third base over to the young whippersnapper
when the playoffs came, not when he had at his disposal a man who
had played in big games and done great things and who wasn't quite
ready to pick up that first Social Security check.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, Valentin had a key ally in Williams. Fans and, yes, media
(we know who we are) were quite prepared to bail on Valentin, whose
ailing knee had rendered him almost useless at times during the
long, long season. We might have been more sympathetic were it not
for the generally exemplary play of young Veras, who knocked out
key hits during the team's September surge and who played third
base as if to the manor born. It was very tempting to say, ``Hey,
let the kid play.''
</P>
<P>
   And the kid might have come up big, too, as Valentin is happy to
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young player with a lot of talent,'' Valentin says.
``He's got a chance to be a good player some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day. But not now. These are money games. Veteran cool is
more reliable than youthful exuberance. John Valentin may still be
hurting. He may have a lot less mobility than the kid. He may never
be the player he was in 1995, when he both scored and knocked in
100-plus runs from the No. 2 spot in the order. But this past
weekend he demonstrated what veteran class is and why we should all
be very careful what we wish for, as he bashed three home runs and
two doubles and knocked in 12 runs during those three glorious Red
Sox triumphs over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was gratifying for me,'' he says. ``But the big
thing is what it meant to the team to be able to come from 0-2
against a great team like the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin accepts any praise he gets with wry amusement. He has
sampled the capriciousness of modern American baseball life, and it
has left its scars on his psyche. Not many players of his stature
came from so far back in the pack. A walk-on at Seton Hall who
batted ninth? A .216 hitter in Double A? These are not the normal
items found on the resume of an accomplished major leaguer. He is
justifiably proud of his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   He still looks into the mirror and sees a shortstop. Is that so
bad? He's not stupid. He knows how good Nomar Garciaparra is. But
he had always defined himself as a shortstop, and when he was
moved, to second base and later to third, he chose to believe it
was because he was capable of helping the team at either of these
alien positions, not because he was a poor shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't that bad a second baseman, and he often plays a very
nice third base (but please, John, do get those throws up). He is a
gamer. He feels unappreciated by the public, however, even though
he won't come out and say it. It is, for some reason, very chic to
be a John Valentin basher.
</P>
<P>
   Forget this year, OK? Consider the 1998 season, when he led the
team in runs and knocked out his customary 40 doubles. That's not
bad. But if you were to ask the first 100 Red Sox fans you meet if
he had a good or bad offensive year, about 90 would shout, ``Bad!''
</P>
<P>
   So he has developed a necessarily thick skin. The way he figures
it, let the fans and the press say what they want. All he can do is
show up and hope the manager writes his name on the lineup card. As
long as he has respect inside the locker room and in the
all-important manager's office, he can survive.
</P>
<P>
   He thought speculation that Williams might bypass him in favor
of the kid was ludicrous, and he has been proven correct. He knew a
veteran manager wanted a veteran presence in the lineup, and now he
has the satisfaction of having turned in a great clutch performance
when his team needed it most.
</P>
<P>
   And when the day really does come that Veras elbows him out of
the lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox are no different than anyone else,'' he says
``Changes are made. I'm sure when that time comes here I'll have no
trouble getting someone else to accept my services.''
</P>
<P>
   Romantic? No. Eminently pragmatic? Yes. He's a veteran. This is
what they're all about.

WHITE HOUSE FEARS FURTHER DESTABILIZATION IN PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PAKISTAN-COUP, PAKISTAN-MUSHARRAF, PAKISTAN-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration urged the Pakistani
military to restore democratic government as quickly as possible,
but at the same time officials acknowledged that Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's rule had been increasingly corrupt and autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The overthrow of Sharif was the latest in a series of turbulent
events on the subcontinent that have left the administration
fearful that Islamic militancy will strengthen in Pakistan, a poor
and heavily populated country that last year tested nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they did not believe that the
control of Pakistan's nuclear capability was significantly affected
by the military takeover. Under Sharif, the Pakistani army managed
the nuclear sites and devices and maintained final authority over
them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has custodial control over nuclear weapons,'' a
senior administration official said. ``We have been assured by
Pakistani civilian authorities in the past that they have control
over their release. How this is playing out with the military
government we will have to see. We see this as a political crisis,
not one concerning the control or use of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall picture of Pakistan slipping toward chaos as it
faced a hostile neighbor, India, which also tested nuclear weapons
last year, helped make the subcontinent one of the most precarious
regions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need is a chaotic Pakistan where you have
democracy put on the back shelf, the economy in a shambles and we
get a Talibanization of Pakistan,'' said a senior U.S. official.
Islamic fundamentalism has become more prevalent in the Pakistani
army since the military was cut off from U.S. government assistance
in the early 1990s, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said that after a televised address Tuesday
night by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, proclaiming army rule, it remained
unclear what steps he would take next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the earliest possible restoration of democracy
in Pakistan. We hope Gen. Musharraf will set forth clear plans for
the restoration of a civilian government in Pakistan,'' the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, officials said, that Musharraf might follow the
pattern of the last two military takeovers in Pakistan and appoint
a government of civilian technocrats to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a possible coup in Pakistan had been surfacing since
Sharif, under pressure in July from President Clinton, urged
Musharraf to withdraw his forces from the Indian-held side of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the forces from beyond Pakistan's side of the
cease-fire line in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir has
been cited by the White House as one of Clinton's foreign policy
successes this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the retreat of the army was unpopular on the streets of
Pakistan and in the military. Sharif reacted by cracking down on
opposition parties, the courts and the press, as well as
downgrading the status of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the prime minister,
came to Washington to meet with administration officials to follow
up on the July meeting. In the process, he warned of the worsening
domestic crisis, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, opposition leaders began to tell American officials
the same things. The State Department then issued a public
statement warning Pakistan not to undertake any
``extraconstitutional'' measures.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the Pakistani chief of intelligence, Lt.
Gen. Mohammed Ziauddin, visited Washington in late September and
warned the CIA director, George Tenet, and others that tensions
between Sharif and Musharraf were coming to a head, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The imminence of a coup appeared to abate slightly when Sharif
formally extended Musharraf's tenure into 2001, but revived again,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the administration warned Sharif against
continuing his ``undermining of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf became the second chief of the army to be dismissed by
the prime minister within a year, a situation that the army
interpreted as a threat to its traditional role.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister handpicked Musharraf, a commando-trained,
headstrong officer with less education than his predecessor, Gen.
Jehangir Karamat, who was fired last October after making
unfavorable public comments about the prime minister's style of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cut military aid to the Pakistani army in the
early 1990s after President Bush could no longer certify to
Congress that Pakistan was not in possession of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Pakistani army has been a stabilizing
influence but has become more vulnerable to Islamic influences in
recent years. This was especially so as the tradition of
better-educated men joining the military faded, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, as the economy has weakened, army officers
have collected electric bill payments and completed other menial
tasks to try and keep the country running, said Michael Krepon, the
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies arms
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army does not want to run the country but the army wants
to be the main repository of power,'' Krepon said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were increasing possibilities of the army's
fracturing, Krepon said. ``There are eight or nine core commanders
in Pakistan. The army has one of two choices: They could rally
behind a guy who is a loose cannon like Musharraf or they could
divide,'' Krepon said.
</P>
<P>
   If the army divided, then the question of command and control
over the nuclear devices would come to the fore, he said.

CON ED IS SAID TO BE BUYING NORTHEAST FOR $3.29 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Northeast points)  (Eds: This story was added to the New York Times business front
page)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consolidated Edison Inc. agreed Tuesday night to buy
Northeast Utilities for $3.29 billion in cash and stock, according
to people close to the talks, in a deal that could eventually bring
cheaper power to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which the boards of both companies
approved Tuesday, Con Edison, which is based in Manhattan, will pay
$25 a share in cash and stock for the outstanding shares of
Northeast, which is based in Berlin, Conn. Another $1 a share will
be paid if units 2 and 3 of Northeast's Millstone nuclear plant in
Connecticut are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northeast Utilities rose 12.5 cents Tuesday, to
$21.25, while Con Edison fell 75 cents, to $36.4375. Based on
Northeast's closing price, the deal represents a 17.6 percent
premium.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the biggest move by Con Edison so far to protect its
base of three million customers, who are being courted by outsiders
to buy power at lower rates as New York deregulates its utility
market. Con Edison will raise its customer base to 4.7 million and
extend its reach as far north as New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a move to become more competitive. Northeast has been
aggressively preparing for deregulation in Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Though Northeast had to spin off
its power plants as part of the deregulation, it has bought plants
and built up a source of cheap power, which Con Edison could sell
to its customers, possibly lowering their rates eventually.
Northeast has also built up an organization to market that power
throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the deal said the two utilities expected
savings of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in the next 10 years.
Whether there will be layoffs has yet to be determined, the people
said.

LITTLE KNOWN POWER BROKER IN YELTSIN'S CIRCLE EMERGES IN BANKING
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-BANKS-RESIGN) 
(DW) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN and NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The money laundering scandal at the Bank of New York,
at first dismissed by Russian bankers and politicians as an
overblown sensation manufactured in America, has now made its way
into the middle of Russia's own highly charged political scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, a new figure has emerged from the shadows,
touted by one side in a bitter power struggle here as the latest
Rasputin figure to hold sway in the Kremlin. His name is Alexander
Mamut, 39, a lawyer and banker who by his own admission is a friend
and adviser to the inner circle around President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a week, the soft-spoken and boyish-looking Mamut
has gone from being a little-known financier to being labeled as
the Kremlin's latest all-purpose power-broker, whom the Russian
media has linked to a corporation charged with operating an illegal
money transfer business through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The most graphic allegations were broadcast Sunday night in a
television program that linked Mamut to Sobinbank, a Moscow bank
recently raided by the police as part of the investigation here
into several Bank of New York accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sobinbank is just one unit of the laundering system,'' said
the reporter for the popular ``Itogi'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its founder is Alexander Mamut,'' the reporter went on. ``He
is a man of marked individuality in every respect. He is well
acquainted with people from the president's close circle.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week in the boardroom of MDM Bank, also
mentioned in the Itogi report, Mamut, who two months ago was made
chairman of the MDM supervisory board, denied any knowledge of the
illegal money transfers.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not deny that he has Kremlin connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am acquainted with these people,'' he said when asked
if he knew Tatyana Dyachenko, one of Yeltsin's daughters, and
several top Kremlin administration officials. ``And this
acquaintance has been used to incriminate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamut's career is typical of many young and aggressive
entrepreneurs who emerged in the early 1990s. He came from a
well-respected Moscow family and was educated at prestigious
universities along with several top bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Mamut went into law and parlayed that into the banking business,
opening his own bank, the Corporation for Project Financing, which
he describes as a small asset-management company.
</P>
<P>
   How his banking career developed, and how it landed him in the
center of an investigation, is still an open question.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of recent reports in publications and TV stations
that are now firmly in the anti-Yeltsin camp, Mamut has been
painted as the mastermind behind schemes to take billions out of
Russia, acting under cover provided by his political connections.
Some of the most virulent charges against him have appeared on a
Web site, gazeta.ru, that specializes in investigative reporting,
with a anti-Kremlin slant.
</P>
<P>
   While still chairman of his first bank, now all but legally
bankrupt after Russia's financial crash in August 1998, he went on
to become a member of the board of Sobinbank in an arrangement that
he says came about because of shared clients. He left Sobinbank
last August, when he joined MDM, which had enjoyed a reputation as
a well-managed privately held bank until it too was tarred by its
business relationship with Sobinbank and Flamingo Bank, another
bank raided recently by Russian police.
</P>
<P>
   Mamut is not the first Kremlin adviser to be labeled as the link
between the family, the name for the tight circle that revolves
around Ms. Dyachenko, the president's younger daughter and closest
confidante, and a group of favored Russian businesses. Before him
there was Roman Abramovich, the major shareholder of the Russian
oil company Sibneft, and before him, Boris Berezovsky, a Russian
financier with outsized political ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   These have become magnets for all sorts of allegations.
Depending on which newspaper or magazine is recounting them, the
charges range from staging secret takeovers of major Russian
companies to acting as the asset managers for the family's
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports are true, according to people who have been
involved in deals involving family-connected businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Mamut, the sources of the charges against him
are part of a ``merciless information war'' he says has been
whipped up by Media-MOST, an information empire now allied with
Yeltsin's opponents. ``One of the methods of this power struggle is
to discredit the existing power, by discrediting and slinging mud
at specific people who are close to power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is a second line of attack,'' he said, ``which is
the Bank of New York scandal. If you can tie the Bank of New York,
in the highly nervous situation that exists abroad and here in
connection with the discrediting of certain people, then you have a
shocking version of the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, Mamut was introduced into the Kremlin circle
in the 1995 or 1996. He said he got to know Valentin Yumashev
before Yumashev, who began his career as a journalist, became
Yeltsin's chief of staff, and that he met Abramovich and Berezovsky
when the Corporation for Project Financing handled the ruble
accounts for Sibneft, in which Berezovsky also reportedly has
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Mamut has become an unofficial unpaid adviser to
Alexander Voloshin, now chief-of-staff, whom he says he meets with
once a month to discuss banking and legal issues. But mostly, he
describes his Kremlin relations as friendship rather business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are typical friendly relations,'' he said, describing how
he was one of several dozen people, including Ms. Dyachenko, who
filled up an Aeroflot flight late last year to go skiing in
Austria. ``I don't want to describe them in detail or fully because
the context created around me and around these relations is quite
tendentious.''
</P>
<P>
   According to one political consultant familiar with the way the
Kremlin works, Mamut is being too modest. His role is described as
a crucial bridge between the Kremlin and Russia's business and
political elite, all the more useful because it is not official.
Nor, he said, can it be denied that such connections are useful to
building private business networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone like Mamut meets with you, and tells you to do
something, you do it, because you know who stands behind him,''
said the consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city now stricken with pre-election fever, it is
increasingly difficult to separate myth from reality. ``In the two
years I worked in the Kremlin, I never heard of or saw Mamut,''
said Aleksei Volin, a former Kremlin media strategist who now heads
a government news agency. ``I'm already used to the papers every
few months trotting out yet another person whom they say runs the
Kremlin or is close to the family. I think it is terribly
exaggerated.''

IN SHIFT, PHILIP MORRIS ACKNOWLEDGES EVIDENCE THAT SMOKING CAUSES
DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to insert new sentence before 3rd-from-last graf)   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. is acknowledging that scientific evidence
shows that smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases,
after decades of disputing the findings of the U.S. surgeon general
and other medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette
maker, has moved closer to prevailing scientific opinions about the
health risks of smoking, as it has faced increasing pressure from
smoking-related lawsuits, regulators and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on a new Internet site it is unveiling Wednesday as part of
a $100 million corporate image campaign, the company unequivocally
states there is an ``overwhelming medical and scientific consensus
that cigarette smoking causes'' diseases including lung cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that smoking ``is addictive as that term is most
commonly used today.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' move is part of a trend among tobacco producers
to try to put health-related issues behind them, after agreeing in
the last two years to pay $246 billion to settle lawsuits brought
by states seeking to recover their Medicaid costs for treating ill
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   By making more disclosures about smoking risks, producers also
want to make it harder for those who start smoking now to sue by
claiming they were unaware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. created a Web site with
information on health issues last year, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. is in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-smoking advocates who were read the new statements
by Philip Morris said they were a marked shift for the company,
particularly in the area of smoking and health. Previously, the
company had contended, for example, that smoking was a ``risk
factor'' or a ``causal factor'' in diseases like lung cancer, not
that it caused the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a profound change,'' said Dr. David Kessler, the former
head of the Food and Drug Administration, who launched a federal
effort to regulate tobacco, in response to the company's
statements. ``It really sets a new stage for regulation and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
an advocacy group in Washington, agreed but added that Philip
Morris still had not taken the final step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acknowledgments seem to be an abandonment once and for all
of the campaign of sowing doubts in the minds of consumers,'' said
Myers. ``But it falls a critical step short because it doesn't say
whether Philip Morris agrees with these conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Philip Morris chairman Geoffrey Bible testified
before a Senate committee that the company acknowledged that
substantial evidence supported the ``judgment that smoking plays a
causal role'' in diseases like lung cancer. Bible also testified
that the company recognized that ``under some definitions,
cigarette smoking is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bible declined Tuesday to be interviewed. But responding to
Myers' comments, Steven Parrish, a senior vice president at Philip
Morris, said that Philip Morris was ``not going to dispute that
smoking causes cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the company would still require any
plaintiff in a lawsuit to prove that their disease was caused by
smoking rather than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish added that the change in Philip Morris' position was not
the result of any new scientific findings. He said it had come
because the company had decided to take a less combative and
defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Philip Morris had not changed its stance earlier, he
said ``that is all water under the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company's new Internet site (www.philipmorris.com) is one
part of the Philip Morris campaign intended to reshape its
corporate image. Company officials said they will spend some $100
million annually on the effort, which will include television
advertisements emphasizing the company's charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, Philip Morris will also downplay its
role as a cigarette producer. For example, while the company Web
site will contain the logos of two of its major divisions, Kraft
Foods and Miller Brewing, it does not show the distinctive logo of
the Philip Morris tobacco division or the red-and-white chevron of
its leading brand, Marlboro.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parrish also said that another major goal of the campaign would
be to redirect the often-acrimonious debate about smoking into a
constructive one. ``This is a serious and good faith effort on our
part to try to engage in a dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco revised its Internet site
to reflect its stance on smoking and health issues. On it the
company states it ``believes that it is appropriate for the public
health community to conclude and warn the public that cigarette
smoking causes certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Payne, an official of R.J. Reynolds, said that producer
was also creating an Internet site that will speak ``more directly
and candidly'' about the issues of smoking and health. Payne said
he believed the industry effort followed a recently settled round
of lawsuits between cigarette makers and state attorneys general
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In those lawsuits, the states argued that cigarette makers
should reimburse them for the cost of smoking-related health care
costs because they had misled the public by vigorously disputing
government findings about smoking and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new phase from a manufacturer's standpoint of how
you talk about the issues surrounding cigarettes,'' said Payne.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an earlier agreement between tobacco companies and
state officials that collapsed in Congress last year, cigarette
companies would have agreed not to have disputed public health
findings about links between smoking and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco producers, however, still face numerous legal problems.
In September, the federal government filed a major lawsuit that
charges cigarette makers with fraud and seeks to recover billions
in health care expenses. Two smokers also recently won separate
multimillion dollar judgment against Philip Morris, though the
company has appealed the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, said he believed
that the recent steps by Philip Morris were important in that they
might give cigarette makers an opportunity to act on decisions they
might have made decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry could have gone down this road in 1964
but decided instead to engage in a campaign of fraud and deception
that it is now paying for,'' he said.

SOME IDEAS ON FIRST-BALL TOSSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is as if the hardball god decided to save the best
for last and ring out the century in ultimate theatrical fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox and
Yankees _ rivals of biblical proportion _ will play as many as
seven games for the right to represent the American League in the
final World Series of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox-Yankees. It's up there with Harvard-Yale, Coke-Pepsi,
Kennedy-Nixon, Army-Navy, Macy's-Gimbel's, and Ford-Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both teams no doubt are scurrying to secure
potential first-game-ball tossers for this cataclysmic, apocalyptic
series. Helen Hunter, the widow of ex-Yankee great Catfish Hunter,
does the honors Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some unsolicited suggestions for the next six games:
</P>
<P>
   --Ted Williams _ It's a shame Joe DiMaggio didn't live to see
this series. It would have been wonderful to see the two greatest
living ballplayers, bookend stars of the game's signature
franchises, standing on the mound together for a game of catch. The
Great DiMaggio is gone, but Ted is working on 91 days' rest since
his All-Star appearance at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   --Julia Ruth Stevens _ The Babe's daughter claims he wished no
ill on the Boston franchise when Harry Frazee sold him to New York
(``Daddy would never have done that!''). She has allegiances to
both the Yankees and Red Sox. Give her the damn ball.
</P>
<P>
   --Max Frazee _ The great-grandson of the man who sold Ruth to
the Yankees in 1919, Max is an artist who specializes in depictions
of serial killers. He was living in TriBeca when the Sox last made
it to the World Series against the Mets in 1986. The Sox honored
him when they attempted to lift some alleged curse at Fenway six
years ago. Mighty Max should be found for a first-ball toss.
</P>
<P>
   --Don Zimmer _ Get over it, Sox fans. Zim takes too much heat
for what happened in 1978. OK, maybe he could have used Bill Lee
instead of Bobby Sprowl against the Yanks, but he didn't throw the
meatball to Bucky Dent. He's wearing pinstripes now and some Sox
fans took it as an omen when Zim took a foul ball off the noggin in
Game 1 of the Division Series against Texas. Only Zim could come
back and say, ``110,000 ears in this ballpark, and that line drive
had to find mine.''
</P>
<P>
   --Stephen King _ He deserves it. It's been a tough year for the
horror man/Sox season ticket-holder. He cursed Boston's bullpen
when he wrote, ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' then suffered
serious injuries when he was struck by a van while walking on a
road in Maine. He proved his mettle in 1978 when he was a college
professor and canceled classes after the playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   --Mike Torrez _ Last seen running in the corridors of Shea
Stadium screaming, ``I'm off the hook,'' after Bill Buckner's
error, it's time for Torrez to reappear. He pitched for both the
Sox and Yankees and in 1989 flew to Delray Beach, Fla., and tossed
another meatball to help Dent christen the Little Fenway Park at
his baseball school.
</P>
<P>
   --Roger Clemens _ Whoops. Never mind. He's going to throw some
unceremonial first pitches Saturday in Game 3 in Boston. And he'd
better bring those headphones he used to tune out Butch Hobson. Sox
fans hooted the Rocket at the All-Star Game in July. Beating a
Yankee Clemens at Fenway in the playoffs would be better than sex
or chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   --Bill Parcells _ Believe it or not, even though he is a Jersey
Guy, the Tuna is a Sox fan. He could inspire a lot of emotion in
either ballpark, especially Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   --Sparky Lyle _ Pitched for both teams. Did little in Boston.
Won a Cy Young with the '77 Yankees. Maybe Danny Cater could join
him for a double first-ball toss.
</P>
<P>
   --Wade Boggs _ He could ride his horse to the mound, flash his
Yankee championship ring, and tell us how much he hates Boston.
</P>
<P>

   LVMH IN DEAL WITH PRADA TO TAKE CONTROL OF FENDI
</P>
<P>
   The luxury-goods company LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of
France has forged an unusual alliance with the Italian fashion
house Prada to take control of Fendi, ending a months-long battle
for the Rome design house. Under the agreement, LVMH and Prada paid
an undisclosed amount for a 51 percent stake. Advisers said that
the two buyers paid about $520 million, which values the company
around $1 billion. The sale hands control of Fendi to Bernard
Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, and the Prada chairman, Patrizio
Bertelli, but leaves the general management in the hands of the
five Fendi sisters.

   THE SERIES SCORECARD FOR STOCKS
</P>
<P>
   In the fervor created by the success of New York's two baseball
teams this year, it is worth examining the history of the interplay
between World Series teams and stocks. The historical answers are
clear. The New York Yankees are good for stocks, but the Boston Red
Sox are better. The Atlanta Braves are also good, but a New York
Mets appearance in the World Series would be a bad omen.

TED WILLIAMS HAS A SPLENDID OPINION OF THIS TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is the greatest living ballplayer, perhaps the
best hitter of all time, and certainly the signature player in the
99-year history of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   No one suffered more at the hands of the New York Yankees than
Ted Williams, who played for the Sox from 1939-60 and watched the
Yankees go to the World Series 16 times (winning 12) while he went
once.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of New England, the godfather of Red Sox Nation is
beginning to wonder whether this might be the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't bet against the Red Sox right now,'' Williams said
Tuesday from his home in Hernando, Fla. ``I just think this might
be the year of all years the way things are developing. Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching the Red Sox. I tell you what, here
I am, an old guy, and I can't wait to see 'em go. Baseball has just
got everybody hooked right by the throat right now.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 81, threw out the first ball at the All-Star Game at
Fenway Park this summer and was in Boston on Monday. He had to
return to Florida Monday night, but caught part of the Sox-Indians
game on television. He's fired up at the prospect of a seven-game
series between the Sox and Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a monumental thing, I'll tell you,'' he said. ``The
Red Sox deserve a hell of a lot of credit. Their manager and
general manager have worked together like two peas in a pod and I
just don't think we've ever had a better 1-2 combination. That
manager has had a hell of a year. I've been on his bandwagon all
the time. He is a great baseball man. I'm not related to him, but
it doesn't sound bad to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams and Joe DiMaggio were the biggest names in
baseball, the Red Sox and Yankees engaged in one of the best
pennant races in history, a battle that was chronicled in David
Halberstam's ``Summer of '49'' The Sox went to New York for the
final two games of the season, needing only one victory to win the
pennant. Boston lost both games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '49 we had a hell of a team, but so did they,'' said
Williams. ``Those are still games that a lot of people keep talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only tell you every time we played the Yankees, they
were tough. They always seemed to have a lot of guys. They'd get a
new guy in the lineup and the guy would be outstanding or a Hall of
Famer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I saw Yogi Berra walk up to home plate for the
first time at Fenway Park. They said, `Now catching for the New
York Yankees, Yogi Berra.' And I saw him walking up there and I
thought, `Who are they trying to (expletive) with this guy?' And he
goes down as one of the greatest catchers. That was the Yankees for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't seen a lot of the '99 Sox, but likes what he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know any of 'em coming in,'' said Williams. ``Then I
get a chance to see 'em and I say, `Hey this guy is a pretty good
player.' We've had a couple of players that snuck away, but we've
come up with some great pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra is a particular Williams favorite. The AL
batting champ made a visit to Hernando last spring and talked
hitting with the Splinter. Williams had a sore elbow (hit by a
pitch) when he hit only .200 in the 1946 World Series. He
appreciates what Garciaparra (sore wrist after being hit by a
pitch) is doing under trying conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Nomar is doing it,'' said Williams. ``He
wants to play so damn bad and he's so damn good. He's just
tremendous. And that little guy at third base (John Valentin), I
like. He's good. I love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the hardball world, he is impressed by Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly a nice guy,'' said Williams. ``I talked to him
at the All-Star Game. I'd never seen him pitch, but as I walked in
there and saw him throw a couple of balls, I thought, `Boy, can
this guy throw the ball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What about it, Ted? Could you have hit Pedro?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could have hit him or not,'' the Kid said
humbly. ``If I faced him I wouldn't try to pull him until I had a
chance. Like with any tough pitcher, one thing any good hitter has
got to do is don't help him! But he is so close all the time with a
tough pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled. He could have hit Pedro. And he could hit any
Yankee they throw out there.

RAYTHEON FURTHER REDUCES FORECAST OF PROFIT, AND SHARES FALL 43
PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after warning investors that earnings would be
lower than expected, Raytheon Co. reduced its forecasts again
Tuesday, sending its shares plunging 43 percent after a delayed
opening on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The military contractor, which is based in Lexington, Mass.,
said sales would grow 3 percent this year and next, half its
earlier forecast. It also said that profit margins at its Raytheon
Systems Corp. unit, which accounts for about three-quarters of its
revenue, would be about 12 percent instead of the expected 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Burnham, Raytheon's chairman and chief executive,
cited delayed orders and tougher competition abroad for the
setback. He also said that Raytheon's aggressive acquisition
strategy might have stretched the company's management team beyond
its limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a shift in environment for every senior manager
in the company,'' Burnham said, ``and as a result their sense of
history has been distorted. When these companies were brought
together, they were restructured around products. That created an
opportunity to lose perspective on what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it now expects this year's profit to range from
$2.70 to $2.80 a share, excluding special charges, compared with
analysts' previous forecasts of $3.56 a share. Earnings, with
pretax charges of $638 million for restructuring and project
problems this year, will be between $1.40 and $1.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Profit in 2000 will be $2.10 to $2.25 a share, it said, down
from estimates of $3.91, and Raytheon will take pretax charges next
year of $30 million to eliminate about 2,000 jobs, close plants and
write down investments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company had profit from operations of $1.14
billion, or $3.34 a share, on sales of $19.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts who participated in a conference
call with Raytheon executives Tuesday afternoon were less than
sympathetic to the company's explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are shocked,'' said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with
S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co. ``The estimate has come down a huge amount, and
it's very hard sitting on the outside to sort out how much of this
is lack of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's troubles are particularly worrisome because the
company had been widely viewed as one of the best-managed concerns
in the armaments industry.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who has a reputation as a cost-cutter, took the helm
last December, and the company's Tomahawk cruise missiles played a
leading role in the war in the Balkans this summer. In July,
Raytheon's class B stock price touched a 52-week high of $76.5625.
</P>
<P>
   But after an intense period of mergers and of comparatively easy
cost-cutting through consolidation, aerospace companies are facing
a more and more volatile business environment, with fewer places to
hide the reality of sagging profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me this is disappointing but not unexpected,'' said Jon
Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an aerospace
mergers-and-acquisitions company based in Los Angeles. ``When you
take away the benefits of consolidation, this is really the nature
of the rough-and-tumble business.''
</P>
<P>
   The class B shares of Raytheon fell to $24.25 Tuesday, dropping
$18.75 late in the day, after the delayed opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a real credibility problem,'' said Charles
Gabriel, senior vice president at Prudential Securities. ``They
need to regain confidence from management that these are not
permanent problems. But frankly, I think people are going to take
another look at the stock,'' he added, ``and think of it as a
buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has been cutting its expenses and had 11,300 jobs and
said it expected to cut 15,400 positions by the end of the year,
which would leave its total work force at 115,000. The company also
said it had reduced plant space by 4.5 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon has suffered because such customers as Egypt and Taiwan
have delayed purchases of the Patriot missile. The sale to Taiwan,
for example, may not be booked until 2001, the company said during
the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Competing systems will hurt sales of the Patriot missile, it
added, citing Russia and France as countries whose munitions makers
were becoming more active in the markets Raytheon serves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Burnham emphasized that the company's core programs were
on track. He denied a report that the Tomahawk missiles and several
other fixed-price contracts with the Pentagon were running over
cost. A Pentagon spokesman told reporters that Raytheon is not
considered ``a troubled contractor.''

 &HT;    Popular Potter books get green light in Georgia while S.C. takes
up debate
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (l) Lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Jim Galloway and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A metro Atlanta school system has given a green light
to Harry Potter, student wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Principal Jerry Locke of A.L. Burruss Elementary
School asked a fifth-grade teacher to stop reading one of the
Potter books to her class until he could review it.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's read the book and thinks it's just fine, a Marietta
school official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harry Potter books are now being read to two classes at
Burruss. And as it turns out, a Harry Potter book has been in the
school library since spring _ the principal simply didn't know
about it, said Kelly Henson, associate superintendent for the
7,228-student Marietta schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no ban. There is no ban,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   The highly popular Harry Potter book series by British author
J.K. Rowling outlines the education of a broomstick-riding student
at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Burruss' Locke declined to comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for him, Henson said the Marietta schools have not
received any complaints about the Potter books. But, at a September
meeting, Marietta elementary principals were cautioned that the
book could provoke the concerns of parents who object to the
literary themes of magic and witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   That warning, and the fact that Harry Potter made the cover of
Time magazine, prompted Locke, the Burruss principal to scrutinize
the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``When new material comes into the school, any good principal is
going to review it,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
   While a flap over Harry Potter may have ended in metro Atlanta,
another has begun in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books have a serious tone of death, hate, lack of respect
and sheer evil,'' said Elizabeth Mounce of Columbia, who asked that
state's Board of Education to remove the books from school
libraries. Protesters who identified themselves as ``concerned
Christian parents'' told the board the books promote violence and
interest in the occult.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina protest is the fourth serious challenge to
the book series in the past two weeks, according to the American
Library Association's office for intellectual freedom in Chicago.
The other challenges have come in New York, Michigan and Minnesota
_ the incident in Marietta isn't counted. Three Potter books have
been printed. New York-based Scholastic Inc. has published 5
million hardback copies of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone,'' ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and last
month's release, ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The books are not about witchcraft,'' said Judy Corman, senior
vice president for Scholastic. ``(They are) about the power of the
imagination.''

 &HT;    Campbell a second deep threat
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His fractured jaw has been wired for about four weeks.
But when Kelly Campbell saw that the North Carolina secondary was
lined up close and daring Georgia Tech to throw long, he couldn't
keep his mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Through clenched teeth, the receiver went to the sideline and
pleaded with offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen and receivers
coach Stan Hixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the coaches, `We need to go deep on these boys and get
into the end zone,' '' Campbell said. ``(North Carolina) wanted to
play man-press (coverage), so I said, `Let's go deep.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friedgen and Hixon listened, and soon the Tar Heels were burned.
Tech was on its way to a 31-24 overtime win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gained a lot of respect for Kelly Campbell,'' head coach
George O'Leary said of the sophomore from Mays High whose jaw was
fractured when he was slugged in the Florida State loss Sept. 11.
``He puts the (defensive) focus on the whole field and not just on
Dez (White)'s side.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell leads Tech with 26 catches for 473 yards and four
touchdowns. White has 19 for 477 and three touchdowns, and backup
flanker Kerry Watkins has 11 for 173 yards and three scores.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, who says he was timed in 4.29 seconds in the 40-yard
dash in high school, torched the Tar Heels on a 47-yard scoring
pass in the second quarter. He ran a hitch-and-go pattern up the
right sideline and caught the toss from quarterback Joe Hamilton
that helped move Tech within 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   On Tech's first play of the second half, Campbell again got
behind the secondary and hauled in a 59-yard pass that helped put
Tech ahead 14-13. He wasn't finished. On the tying drive, Campbell
caught passes of 32 and 35 yards to set up Luke Manget's field
goal. In all, he had seven catches for 203 yards. It was no
coincidence Campbell's performance came the week after White
scorched Maryland for 215 yards on five catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate that Kelly has been coming on,'' Hixon
said. ``It's been a blessing to our offense because we were
throwing to Dez so much, on third downs (opponents) were sending
the safety over to his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they can't double(-team) but one of them. But which one?
The Florida State game was a coming out for Kelly, and Saturday
showed it wasn't a fluke. Kelly can flat-out run past people.''
</P>
<P>
   White credits Hixon, in his fifth season coaching the receivers,
for developing him, Campbell and Watkins. ``He really pushes in
practice,'' White said. ``And there is a healthy competition going
on between all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as defenses continue to dare the Jackets to go deep,
that competition should pay dividends on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invite the man-press coverage,'' Hixon said. ``We're
thinking touchdown. Press us with no deep help _ please. That's the
attitude we have.''

</P>
<P>
   ``There are truckloads of soldiers here,'' one woman reported
smilingly into her mobile phone. ``Why don't you come and see for
yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Some who gathered here clearly were more riveted, for Tuesday at
least, by the spectacle of Sharif's overthrow than the political
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not concerned with what happens to the prime minister or
who comes next,'' said a housewife who gave her name as Asma. ``We
had dinner and a friend phoned my husband about all this. So we
thought we should watch it and we came here.''
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old girl called Samina pulled her mother by the hand
toward a wireless set with a long antenna being used by one of the
soldiers. ``What a strange phone!'' she said to the man in uniform.
He gently asked her girl to step back.
</P>
<P>
   The troops did not push the onlookers away but prevented them
from crossing a certain point. They were harsher, though, to the
swarm of reporters who were staking out the place where Sharif was
being held in ``protective custody.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Sharif supporters also arrived at the scene but stood
silently. They were soon surrounded by a group of people who began
shouting pro-military slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not hail the army? What's wrong with it?'' asked one of
the men who cheered the military, Qadeer Ahmed. ``What has this
government done for us? Have they given us jobs?''
</P>
<P>
   However, a doctor who gave his name as Iftikhar Ali disagreed,
calling the military takeover a blow to democracy. ``How long will
the army continue to destroy civilian governments?'' he asked.

NO HIDING WILT'S GREATNESS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They tell me Wilt Chamberlain is dead.
</P>
<P>
   But I know he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Immortals live forever.
</P>
<P>
   And I figured this would be Wilt Chamberlain's destiny since,
after all, this was a man who performed such superhuman
accomplishments as scoring 100 points in a single NBA game,
averaging 50.4 points in a season and establishing so many other
similarly celestial marks that will remain unchallenged into
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the American athletic landscape of the 20th century, no
figure dominated his sport with the statistical thoroughness that
Wilton Norman Chamberlain did when he was stuffing basketballs,
grabbing rebounds and blocking shots during his 14 seasons of
distinction in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not sure there ever has been an athlete who inspired as
much awe off the arena of play as on it as the 7-1, 275-pound
Chamberlain, who spent almost his entire existence having to endure
the oohs and aahs and stares of the autograph-seeking masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I hide?'' Wilt Chamberlain once complained to me. ``I
can't go anywhere _ the gas station, the grocery store,
restaurants, the doctor's office _ without people coming up and
bothering me. But I've learned to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He came out of Overbrook High in Philadelphia in 1955 as the
most publicized prep basketball player in the history of this
country, and it's a badly kept secret that he received an immense
sum to attend the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure any player in the NBA was making more money than
I was at Kansas,'' he once admitted to me.
</P>
<P>
   He would play two seasons for the Jayhawks, but would leave
school after his team was beaten by North Carolina in triple
overtime in the NCAA title game in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He would tour a year with the Harlem Globetrotters, and then
would begin his mythic stay in the NBA in 1959 when he joined the
Philadelphia Warriors, who would shift to San Francisco in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He would return to Philadelphia a couple of years later, and
soon the 76ers would become such an NBA power that they dethroned
the mighty Boston Celtics in 1967 during a record-breaking, 68-win
season.
</P>
<P>
   He was a complex, sensitive man given to severe mood swings when
he was a player, lapsing into a boorish silence one day and then
becoming a fun-loving chatterbox the next.
</P>
<P>
   He could be rude and uncaring, but he also could be kind and
giving as he was one evening when he gave the San Pedro
restaurateur, Lou Trani, his NBA Rookie of the Year trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly defensive about the constant media criticism
he received about his teams always finishing behind the Celtics and
their nonpareil center, Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could incite Chamberlain's anger more than this subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put Bob Cousy, Bill Sharman, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, Tommy
Heinsohn, Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek on my teams and let
Russell have the guys I had to play with,'' Chamberlain often said.
``Then I would have been the one sipping the champagne at the end
of every season.''
</P>
<P>
   For 21 years, from 1968 until 1989 when we had a serious falling
out, Wilt Chamberlain probably was my closest pal in athletics, a
person I had dinner with countless times.
</P>
<P>
   I covered him during his seasons with the Lakers as a young
reporter for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, meeting him for the
first time on a team flight to Philadelphia when he recruited me to
be the fourth member of a card game called hearts. The other
participants were Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't exactly strike up an immediate friendship, especially
after I led off a subsequent story describing Chamberlain's work
thusly: ``Wilt Chamberlain was the tallest spectator at the Forum
last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's first year in Los Angeles was an eventful one,
with his season-long feud with the Lakers' coach, Bill van Breda
Kolff, being one of the highlights.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a disappointing ending for Chamberlain, who would be
kept humiliatingly on the bench by van Breda Kolff in the closing
minutes of Game 7 against the Celtics and his eternal nemesis,
Russell, playing his final contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would lose that championship match by a point, and
Chamberlain never forgave van Breda Kolff for the slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have won that game had van Bred Kolff put me back in,''
insisted Chamberlain. ``Van Breda Kolff got our team beat just to
get back at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Breda Kolff soon would be fired by the then Laker owner,
Jack Kent Cooke, but it would be four more seasons before
Chamberlain would win his second NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971-72 Lakers are considered by sporting pundits as one of
the great teams in NBA history they won a record 33 straight that
still stands and it was
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's rebounding and shot-blocking that were the vital
factors.
</P>
<P>
   It came out later in a highly fictionalized autobiography that
Wilt Chamberlain was a lady killer with thousands of conquests, but
the Chamberlain I knew was not particularly smooth with the
opposite sex, and I never saw him besieged by females.
</P>
<P>
   There were several occasions when the Lakers were on the road,
and Chamberlain and I would have dinner together on off days.
</P>
<P>
   He was given to hyperbolic rhetoric, and there was nothing that
Uncle Wiltie, that was the sobriquet I gave him, couldn't do better
than anyone else score points, grab rebounds, lift weights, fight,
high jump, run, score on women, play volleyball, etc.
</P>
<P>
   He lived alone in his Bel Air mansion that he had built in the
early 1970s, and was a physical fitness fanatic who exercised
almost every day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He remained an active bachelor throughout his 63 years who
savored traveling around the world, and he never came close to
getting married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure there is something wrong with an institution in which
more than 50 percent who try it get divorced,'' he once told me
during an interview I did with him for Inside Sports Magazine.
``And out of the other 50 percent, I'm willing to bet 40 percent of
those people want to get divorced. The odds just aren't good.''
</P>
<P>
   I think of Wilt Chamberlain, and I can recall chauffeuring him
around in a rental car in Atlanta and remembering the reaction of a
startled cabbie at a stop light when he saw Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that you Wilt?'' the cabbie asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's Bill Russell,'' cracked Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Wilt Chamberlain, and think of all the telephone
conversations we had about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and how he got so
mad at me for detailing the contents from one of them in a column
for which he never forgave me.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Wilt Chamberlain, and I can recall the evening he
scored 66 points against the Phoenix Suns and the evening he
grabbed 44 rebounds against Russell's Celtics and the evening he
blocked 23 shots against the San Francisco Warriors and that
magical evening when he led the Lakers to their first world
championship in Los Angeles with a stirring performance against the
New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get any better than this,'' he would say to me in a
rare display of emotion later in the Forum press lounge.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Wilt Chamberlain, and I can remember all the sorrows
and laughs and dazzling feats dispensed by a man who literally was
a giant of this nation's athletics.

WHITE HOUSE FEARS FURTHER DESTABILIZATION IN PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change spelling of Musharraf's first name in 7th graf,
from Pervez to Pervaiz.)  (With PAKISTAN-COUP, PAKISTAN-MUSHARRAF, PAKISTAN-SCENE) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration urged the Pakistani
military to restore democratic government as quickly as possible,
but at the same time officials acknowledged that Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif's rule had been increasingly corrupt and autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   The overthrow of Sharif was the latest in a series of turbulent
events on the subcontinent that have left the administration
fearful that Islamic militancy will strengthen in Pakistan, a poor
and heavily populated country that last year tested nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they did not believe that the
control of Pakistan's nuclear capability was significantly affected
by the military takeover. Under Sharif, the Pakistani army managed
the nuclear sites and devices and maintained final authority over
them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military has custodial control over nuclear weapons,'' a
senior administration official said. ``We have been assured by
Pakistani civilian authorities in the past that they have control
over their release. How this is playing out with the military
government we will have to see. We see this as a political crisis,
not one concerning the control or use of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall picture of Pakistan slipping toward chaos as it
faced a hostile neighbor, India, which also tested nuclear weapons
last year, helped make the subcontinent one of the most precarious
regions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need is a chaotic Pakistan where you have
democracy put on the back shelf, the economy in a shambles and we
get a Talibanization of Pakistan,'' said a senior U.S. official.
Islamic fundamentalism has become more prevalent in the Pakistani
army since the military was cut off from U.S. government assistance
in the early 1990s, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said that after a televised address Tuesday
night by Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, proclaiming army rule, it remained
unclear what steps he would take next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see the earliest possible restoration of democracy
in Pakistan. We hope Gen. Musharraf will set forth clear plans for
the restoration of a civilian government in Pakistan,'' the State
Department spokesman, James Rubin, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible, officials said, that Musharraf might follow the
pattern of the last two military takeovers in Pakistan and appoint
a government of civilian technocrats to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a possible coup in Pakistan had been surfacing since
Sharif, under pressure in July from President Clinton, urged
Musharraf to withdraw his forces from the Indian-held side of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the forces from beyond Pakistan's side of the
cease-fire line in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir has
been cited by the White House as one of Clinton's foreign policy
successes this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the retreat of the army was unpopular on the streets of
Pakistan and in the military. Sharif reacted by cracking down on
opposition parties, the courts and the press, as well as
downgrading the status of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the prime minister,
came to Washington to meet with administration officials to follow
up on the July meeting. In the process, he warned of the worsening
domestic crisis, a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, opposition leaders began to tell American officials
the same things. The State Department then issued a public
statement warning Pakistan not to undertake any
``extraconstitutional'' measures.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the Pakistani chief of intelligence, Lt.
Gen. Mohammed Ziauddin, visited Washington in late September and
warned the CIA director, George Tenet, and others that tensions
between Sharif and Musharraf were coming to a head, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The imminence of a coup appeared to abate slightly when Sharif
formally extended Musharraf's tenure into 2001, but revived again,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the administration warned Sharif against
continuing his ``undermining of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf became the second chief of the army to be dismissed by
the prime minister within a year, a situation that the army
interpreted as a threat to its traditional role.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister handpicked Musharraf, a commando-trained,
headstrong officer with less education than his predecessor, Gen.
Jehangir Karamat, who was fired last October after making
unfavorable public comments about the prime minister's style of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cut military aid to the Pakistani army in the
early 1990s after President Bush could no longer certify to
Congress that Pakistan was not in possession of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Pakistani army has been a stabilizing
influence but has become more vulnerable to Islamic influences in
recent years. This was especially so as the tradition of
better-educated men joining the military faded, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, as the economy has weakened, army officers
have collected electric bill payments and completed other menial
tasks to try and keep the country running, said Michael Krepon, the
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies arms
control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army does not want to run the country but the army wants
to be the main repository of power,'' Krepon said.
</P>
<P>
   But there were increasing possibilities of the army's
fracturing, Krepon said. ``There are eight or nine core commanders
in Pakistan. The army has one of two choices: They could rally
behind a guy who is a loose cannon like Musharraf or they could
divide,'' Krepon said.
</P>
<P>
   If the army divided, then the question of command and control
over the nuclear devices would come to the fore, he said.

CREDIT LYONNAIS PAYS $4 MILLION FINE TO AVOID CHARGES IN MGM CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The French bank Credit Lyonnais has paid $4
million to the U.S. government to avoid criminal charges stemming
from its role in backing the Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti's
takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Justice Department said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was announced at the same time that federal
prosecutors here unsealed a 94-page indictment against Parretti and
his former partner, Florio Fiorini, accusing them of numerous
instances of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It was because of the indictment that Parretti, who has been a
fugitive from sentencing in another case for nearly three years,
was arrested Monday in Orvieto, Italy. Fiorini was arrested Tuesday
outside Rome and both men are being held for extradition to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Credit Lyonnais had maintained in legal proceedings
that it had been swindled by Parretti and Fiorini, who took over
MGM in 1990 and were then accused of nearly driving the studio to
financial ruin, forcing the bank to absorb losses of as much as $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the settlement, the bank admitted that it had not
exercised adequate oversight, that there was ``substantial
evidence'' that at least one former bank official engaged in
intentional wrongdoing, and that three bank officials accepted
bribes from Parretti and Fiorini. According to the indictment of
the two men, bank officers were given shares in a company,
vacations to Bora-Bora, flights on Parretti's Gulfstream IV and art
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank always said they were victimized, their employees
were cheated or deceived,'' Jeffrey B. Isaacs, the assistant U.S.
attorney in charge of the case, said Tuesday. ``When we looked at
some of the transactions, it didn't really make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Lyonnais said in the settlement that it ``regrets and
accepts responsibility for any consequences in the United States
that this conduct and lack of supervision may have caused.'' The
bank's lawyers at White &AMP; Case, a New York law firm, did not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement states that criminal charges were not being
brought because Credit Lyonnais was cooperating with the
investigation and because the bank had spent $2 billion to bail out
MGM and reimburse shareholders and creditors of the studio and of
the Pathe Communications Corp., another company Parretti had
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached in June and the payment made then,
but was kept secret so as not to tip off Parretti, 57, and Fiorini,
58. Similarly, the indictment of the two men was returned by a
federal grand jury last November, but kept under seal while
documents were prepared to secure the arrest and extradition of the
two men.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition requests are being hand-carried to Italy this
week, although it could take up to a year to determine if the two
men will be brought to the United States for trial, prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges Parretti and Fiorini with securities
fraud, conspiracy, filing false reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, falsifying corporate records of Pathe and MGM,
and making false statements to auditors. The indictment charges
Parretti alone with international money laundering and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Internal Revenue Service took several years and used evidence from
10 countries. It stands to provide the most complete account of the
actions by Parretti and Fiorini to get control of Cannon Group _ a
publicly traded independent film producer that was renamed Pathe
Communications _ and subsequently of MGM, which Parretti bought for
$1.3 billion from the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, who eventually
bought it back from Credit Lyonnais. Parretti and Fiorini are
accused of falsely claiming that there was sufficient equity in the
MGM acquisition deal so that MGM and Pathe could maintain normal
operations. But, the indictment states that there was virtually no
equity, that the two men had secretly pledged Pathe and MGM assets
to Credit Lyonnais and that more than $1.1 billion of the money to
buy MGM came from secret loans by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says that Parretti engaged in a scheme to
loot MGM by diverting more than $15 million in corporate funds and
the European rights to MGM's ``roaring lion'' logo to an Italian
company he and his wife controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Another charge is that Pathe sold movie theaters it owned in
Britain and the Netherlands at an inflated price to a shell company
secretly controlled by Parretti and Fiorini. This improved Pathe's
financial condition and helped the Dutch subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais deceive Dutch banking regulators by shifting bad debt to
what appeared to be a new borrower.
</P>
<P>
   Parretti is involved in numerous legal entanglements. In October
1996, he was convicted in a Delaware court of perjury and tampering
with evidence in a civil lawsuit brought against him by Credit
Lyonnais. But in January 1997, he fled the United States and was a
fugitive until his arrest Monday. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four generations of New Englanders have suspected the
Boston Red Sox exist merely to lure and then torture them. In these
final days of the 20th century it seems wholly appropriate that the
Red Sox would meet their hated rivals, the New York Yankees, for
the American League championship.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two possible outcomes, courtesy of the baseball
gods: The Red Sox _ clear underdogs in this four-of-seven-game
series, their pitching staff tattered from a playoff series with
Cleveland _ will prevail and overcome the Curse of the Bambino. Or
the Yankees will win, again, and the hearts of Red Sox fans will be
ripped out, again.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez will face Kent Mercker, a journeyman
left-hander chosen only because Boston's other starters are
unavailable, Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of a
playoff that promises to stir memories and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intense,'' said David Cone. ``It's kind of eerie when you
think about it. It's 1999, and the Yankees and Red Sox are meeting
for the first time in the postseason. It's an opportunity Red Sox
fans have been waiting for since Babe Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bambino, as Ruth was known, was property of the Red Sox
until 1920, when he was sold to the Yankees, and in the interim,
the Yankees have won 24 championships, the Red Sox none, despite
numerous near-misses that are landmarks in time.
</P>
<P>
   Envy and arrogance have fueled the rivalry over the years, and
although Don Zimmer _ formerly the Red Sox manager and currently
the bench coach for the Yankees _ believes the teams don't despise
each other as they did in the past, most spoke excitedly about the
possibility of performing in the eye of such a charged atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be two weeks of sheer nuthouse around here,'' said
Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Said Zimmer: ``The whole thing is going to be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill worked out Tuesday and expects to be in the lineup,
but he is sometimes breathless because of his broken rib. So the
Yankees are expected to add another outfielder, Shane Spencer, to
their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre juggled the pitching rotation he used in the sweep of
Texas last week. Cone, who did not pitch against the Rangers, will
start in Game 2 (and Game 6, if necessary), and Roger Clemens will
pitch Game 3 (and Game 7), with Andy Pettitte slated for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, is not prepared to schedule
his rotation for the final three games of the series; he struggled
to identify a starter for Game 1. The Red Sox eliminated Cleveland,
12-8, on Monday, and with his hair slick with champagne, Williams
told reporters afterward not to bother asking how he might align
his pitchers against the Yankees. He didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Like the movie character Indiana Jones, Williams has improvised
his way through one crisis after another. This is his immediate
dilemma: He used starters Bret Saberhagen and Pedro Martinez in the
final game of the Cleveland series, and Ramon Martinez, coming back
from shoulder surgery, needs more rest. So Williams will improvise.
Mercker, a left-hander who started Game 4 against the Indians, will
open Game 1 for the Indians, but Mercker may simply be the first
pawn.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees attack Mercker with their usual lineup against
left-handers, then Chili Davis will serve as the designated hitter,
and either Chad Curtis or Spencer will play the outfield. Williams
might then replace Mercker quickly _ perhaps as soon as the first
or second inning, when the right-handed hitters at the bottom of
the Yankees' lineup are due to bat _ with a right-handed reliever,
such as Derek Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams tries this strategy and the game is close, Torre
would face a quandry: Should he counter by inserting the
left-handed hitters Ricky Ledee and Darryl Strawberry and possibly
leave himself open to unfavorable match-ups late in the game?
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees might hammer Mercker, beat up on the relievers
who follow and Williams' relief corps could be taxed for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is gambling legal in this state?'' Williams asked. ``We just
kind of make it simple, play one game, see what we can do here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have played that way all season, gamely hanging on
with a lineup of little known players, in spite of injuries. Brian
Daubach, No. 3 hitter for the Red Sox, was a long-time minor
leaguer with just 15 at-bats in the majors before this season. John
Valentin, who has been with Boston longer than any player, is
hobbling on a bad leg.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary, their No. 5 hitter, was a castoff of the Milwaukee
Brewers. Pedro Martinez, certain to be the AL Cy Young Award
winner, has stiffness in his back. Tom Gordon, once a dominant
reliever, may need reconstructive surgery on his elbow. Nomar
Garciaparra, Boston's best player, still is bothered by a sore
wrist that forced him to miss Game 3 of the division series.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled from Boston to Cleveland early Monday morning and
checked in at their hotel at 4 a.m., beat the Indians Monday night
and then arrived here early this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not tired,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused. He declared again, ``We are not tired,'' seemingly a
statement of will.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``You don't get tired when you are in postseason
play. Maybe they can't line up their pitchers the way they would
normally like to, but they are on such a high right now. They have
ridden this thing. They will be tired when it is over for them,
whether it is this week, next week, the week after. But right now,
they will do it on fumes if they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Indians and the Texas Rangers, the defunct playoff
qualifiers, it is apparent the Red Sox do not fear the Yankees.
Boston won 8 of 12 games between the teams during the regular
season, including a three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium from Sept.
10-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the Boston Red Sox have given us all we
can handle this year,'' said Torre. ``They are an aggressive-type
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, Mike Stanton, Zimmer and the others chatted about the
history of the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox. Ted
Williams against Joe DiMaggio, the Boston collapse of 1949, Bucky
Dent winning the playoff game of 1978 for the Yankees with a home
run into the screen above the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be war, Zimmer said, mentioning how Carlton Fisk
hated Thurman Munson, the Yankees detested Bill Lee. It's not quite
the same for the players, Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But for fans of the Yankees and Red Sox, this is the most
serious business, as Zimmer understands. He told a story about his
13-year-old granddaughter, Whitney Mollica, who lives in Windham,
N.H. She finished a soccer game Sunday, and teammates _ knowing of
her ancestral roots _ surrounded her and screamed, ``Now bring on
the Yankees!''

CHIP PRICES CAUSES DROP IN INTEL'S THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Intel Corp. posted third-quarter earnings
Tuesday that fell a few cents short of analysts' estimates because
of falling prices for microprocessors and narrower profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel executives said that sales growth had been on target
in the period.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 25, net income for Intel fell 6.4
percent, to $1.46 billion, or 42 cents a diluted share, compared
with $1.56 billion, or 44 cents a share, in the period a year
earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $7.33 billion from $6.73
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results reflect one-time charges of $333 million for
purchased research and development, $121 million of amortization of
goodwill and other costs related to acquisitions. For the first
time, Intel broke out the goodwill _ the difference between the
price paid for a company and the value of its assets _ which was
previously included in the cost of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Without the one-time charges, Intel earned $1.9 billion, or 55
cents a diluted share, up 20.3 percent from $1.58 billion, or 45
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the results to falling prices for chips,
delays in new products and supply constraints caused by the
earthquake in Taiwan last month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Intel to earn 57 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. The
so-called whisper number was 60 cents, according to
Earningswhispers.com.
</P>
<P>
   First Call had advised analysts not to include the goodwill in
their estimates, but some did so anyway, leading to some confusion
over whether Intel missed estimates by 2 cents or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my reference point, they missed the number by 4 cents,
not 2, but that's less important than the outlook, which at this
point is extremely guarded,'' said Drew Peck, an analyst with SG
Cowen. He said he thought Intel was being intentionally vague about
its prospects for the fourth quarter because it still does not know
the extent of the effect of the Taiwan earthquake on PC shipments.
``They may be the first major casualty of Taiwan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Intel reported its results, its shares rose 18.75 cents,
to $76.6875. In after-hours trading, they fell as low as $71.
</P>
<P>
   In July, when Intel reported its second-quarter results, Intel
executives predicted that gross margins would be up in the third
quarter. They fell instead, which Andy D. Bryant, Intel's chief
financial officer, attributed to lower average selling prices, a
reduction in the value of existing inventory, and an increase in
start-up costs associated with new products. ``We underestimated
the effect of the delay in manufacturing on 0.18 micron,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's fastest Pentium III processors are currently
manufactured in a process under which each circuit is 0.25 micron
in width; going to 0.18 micron will help reduce processor sizes,
allowing more chips per wafer, which reduces cost, while also
allowing the production of faster chips.
</P>
<P>
   Competition at the high end of its product line heated up for
Intel during the quarter as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. introduced
its Athlon chip at speeds up to 700 megahertz. The fastest Pentium
III currently available is 600 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   Since Advanced Micro also has yet to move to 0.18 micron, with
its inherent speed advantage, it could continue to maintain the
highest speed processor on the market. IBM and Compaq Computer have
both introduced PCs using the Athlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that at the high end of Intel's product line, the
execution has not been as good as it could be, and as it should
be,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. The net result, he said, has been to reduce the proportion
of higher-end, higher-profit products in Intel's revenue mix, which
pushed down total sales and profit margins, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it expected revenue for the fourth quarter to rise
from the third quarter and that gross profit margin should increase
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain on track for a seasonally strong second half,'' Paul
Otellini executive vice president and general manager of Intel's
architecture business group, said in a conference call with
analysts. ``At this point we believe our supply of materials from
Taiwan is not affected, and our customers have not asked us to do
anything different as a result of the quake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Intel acquired four companies: the Dialogic
Corp., Level One Communications, Softcom Microsystems Inc. and the
Netboost Corp. These deals were valued at more than $3 billion
combined and were intended to strengthen Intel's networking and
communications product offerings. Intel also introduced Intel
Online Services Inc., which will operate corporate computer systems
over the World Wide Web. &QL;

UNION LEADERS SEE GRIM NEWS IN LABOR STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of blithely ignoring the decline of
organized labor, the AFL-CIO is force-feeding union leaders a heavy
dose of bad news _ that job growth is fastest in industries where
unions are weakest while job losses are greatest in industries
where unions are strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The news came in a study commissioned by the AFL-CIO as a
wake-up call to union leaders across the nation to organize or see
the labor movement continue its decades-long decline.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was made public last week and is being
discussed at the AFL-CIO convention here this week, also shows that
the fastest-growing metropolitan areas, like Atlanta, Dallas,
Houston, Miami and Phoenix, tended to have the lowest percentage of
workers in unions. And the slowest-growing metropolitan areas,
including Chicago and New York, which has 13 percent of the
nation's union members, tended to have the highest percentage of
workers in unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In overall terms, the economy is moving against us,'' said
David Chu, the labor federation's director of strategic research
and the official who was in charge of the study.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, following the lead of its 68 member unions, the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations took little interest in organizing. But distressed
about labor's declining numbers and clout, AFL-CIO president John
Sweeney has made it take a more forceful role, goading and cajoling
the member unions to get more serious about organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has said he is worried that as the percentage of workers
in unions has plunged to 13.9 percent today, from 35 percent four
decades ago, labor's bargaining clout has atrophied, making it
easier for employers to hold down wages not just for unionized
workers, but for nonunion ones too.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that between 1984 and 1997, the 30
fastest-growing sectors of the economy, including hotels,
child-care, finance, retail trade and airlines, added 26 million
new jobs, but only one in 20 of workers in those industries joined
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that in eight industries with the greatest
job loss, including steel and auto, four-fifths of the 2.1 million
jobs lost belonged to union members. Those jobs were often lost
because of competition from imports and because managers moved
operations overseas to take advantage of lower-cost labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're somewhat a victim of our own success,'' Chu said.
``Heavily organized industries have high wages and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sweeney's calls for more organizing, only a few unions _
most notably the Service Employees International Union and the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union _ have aggressively
increased their spending on organizing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the communication workers' union has begun an
uphill fight to organize workers at Microsoft and IBM, while the
auto workers' union is stepping up efforts to organize auto parts
plants. And with the apparel industry continuing to shed jobs
because of imports, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees is making a big push to unionize the industrial
laundry industry, having organized 9,000 laundry workers last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major growth industry, and it can't move off shore,''
said Bruce Raynor, secretary-treasurer of the needletrades union.

GORE CAMP PLANS TO ENLIST LABOR AND BLACKS TO COMBAT BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having all but won the endorsement of one of the
most active armies of foot soldiers in politics, Vice President Al
Gore's campaign is relying on organized labor's grass-roots support
in crucial states like Iowa, New York and California to beat back
the candidacy of former Sen. Bill Bradley in the Democratic
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials say they then hope that in the South they can
win the votes of blacks, who make up 40 percent of the Democratic
electorate there, and go on with little trouble to claim the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This double-barreled approach is the big-picture strategy of the
Gore campaign to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign views the labor endorsement as the first
primary because the AFL-CIO, which is meeting here this week, is
expected to send 80 committed delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in August. That is nearly as many as Iowa and New
Hampshire combined and would bring Gore's total committed
delegates, including mayors, governors and members of Congress, to
more than 500 of the 1,000 or so he will need to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lags far behind in the delegate count, and officials
said it was this ``electability'' factor that seemed persuasive in
getting the unions to endorse and endorse now, rather than wait.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no guarantee that things will work as
planned. The endorsement, which is expected Wednesday, does not
guarantee that the rank and file will enlist, and it will be up to
Gore to inspire them. And while the Gore camp is plotting its nuts
and bolts strategy, Bradley is closing the gap in the polls,
largely by capturing the national imagination in a way that Gore
has yet to do. The latest CNN/Time poll over the weekend put
Bradley within 12 points of the vice president. Six weeks ago the
same poll had them 33 points apart.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated Gore endorsement provides the structure for
labor to swing into high gear in places where it has recently
proved its muscle, particularly in saving the candidacies of Gov.
Gray Davis in California and Gov. Tom Vilsack in Iowa. Labor also
has a huge constituency in New York, one of the states where
Bradley, a former star basketball player for the New York Knicks,
has an edge in the polls. The Gore camp expects labor to help turn
the tide there.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is starting to express some confidence that it
is winning over important Democratic constituents. The only area
where Gore strategists see Bradley firmly ahead is among male
sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley needs to stop us big time in some component of the
Democratic family, and I don't see where that is,'' said Gore
campaign chairman Tony Coelho. .
</P>
<P>
   The states where labor is strong are also the states that figure
early in the political calendar. Iowa, scheduled to vote Jan. 31,
is first. It is a strong labor state where Gore is ahead. New
Hampshire, where Bradley leads, comes next. Labor has less
influence there, and while the Gore campaign is making an intense
effort to win, the state is not crucial to its success. On March 7
come the big states with important labor strongholds _ California,
Ohio and New York. If organized labor turns out for Gore, he could
virtually sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore faces a wild card in California, where independents and
Republicans can cross over and vote in the Democratic primary. This
could allow Bradley to win the popular vote, even if the Democratic
delegates still go to Gore. The effect of such an unusual turn of
events would be to give Bradley a psychological advantage that he
could use to slow a Gore roll at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the expected labor endorsement will not be unanimous.
The teamsters and the United Auto Workers plan to vote against
endorsing Gore. The unions are upset with Gore's embrace of free
trade, and although it differs little from Bradley's, they hope
that by withholding their support, they can extract concessions
from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore does not wrap up the nomination after California, the
campaign moves South, where Gore is relying on black voters to
sweep him to victory. Gore has a strong following among blacks for
two reasons: President Clinton is a hero in the black community,
and so is Gore's late father, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not lost on black voters that Gore has appointed a
black woman, Donna Brazile, as his campaign manager, the first ever
in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp believes it has been helped by Bradley's effort to
court homosexuals by supporting the reopening of the Civil Rights
Act to add protections for gay men and women. Prominent blacks are
alarmed by this, saying it would give conservatives in Congress a
chance to roll back hard-fought rights for all, and Gore operatives
are trying to feed those fears.
</P>
<P>
   But how can Gore rely so heavily on labor if the federation's
endorsement was in doubt as recently as last week? His aides, and
union officials, say Gore ran into problems chiefly because he had
not properly courted the leaders. They said, for instance, that
although the vice president's office was working regularly with
unions on labor issues, his staff did not make a political
connection between the issues and Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore wasn't calling on the leaders,'' said Gerry Shea, a
senior assistant to AFL-CIO president John Sweeney. ``He assumed it
had been done through the issues people.'' Gore tried to make up
for his inattentiveness by meeting with several leaders here
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows he needs to work the AFL-CIO members better than he
worked the leaders. His first test comes later Wednesday, when he
flies to Seattle to meet with aerospace workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sending Gore into union shops, his campaign is relying on
the telephone banks and organization drives that characterized
labor's commitment in the 1998 Congressional elections. The AFL-CIO
diverted the $35 million it had spent in 1996 on television
advertisements and put it instead into local organizing.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said the federation
planned to organize a Gore tree by identifying a Gore supporter in
each union in each state, then in each affiliate, at each work site
and on each shift. He said organizers believe that this
worker-to-worker contact is the best way to get reliable
information to members. In 1998, he said, 76 percent of union
members who received union literature voted for the endorsed
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But one problem that may emerge for Gore is that the AFL-CIO
intends to focus its efforts on contrasting Gore with the
Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, not with
Bradley. Rosenthal said this stance would test the theory that the
union could mobilize for Gore without going negative on Bradley. As
another political operative said of avoiding squabbles in
primaries: ``Don't bury the body too deep; you may need to dig it
up again.''  &QL;

ATLANTA'S KEVIN MILLWOOD IS READY FOR GAME 2  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Millwood has been better in the post-season than
he was during the regular season for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   After tossing a one-hitter in a complete game against the
Houston Astros in the division series last week, Millwood is hoping
for a similar performance against the Mets on Wednesday night in
Game 2 of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   On a staff that includes three former Cy Young Award winners,
Millwood emerged as Atlanta's most consistent pitcher this year
with an 18-7 mark and a 2.68 earned run average. In two starts
against the Mets this season, Millwood is 1-0 with a 1.20 er..
</P>
<P>
   Is Millwood confident he can beat the Mets in Game 2?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've pitched against these guys a couple of times this year,
and I've had some pretty good success,'' the 24-year-old
right-hander from North Carolina said. ``I'm going to do what I've
done in those other two games. Until they make me change, I'm going
to stick with my same game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton and John Olerud were the only two Mets who
managed more than two hits against Millwood this season. Edgardo
Alfonzo was 1 for 14. Mike Piazza was 2 for 16.
</P>
<P>
   While Atlanta's other three starters have been around longer and
have won Cy Young Awards, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz
have all had periods when they struggled this year, either because
of injury or inconsistency. But Millwood, who reached the majors in
1997 and was 17-8 for the Braves last year, never had an extended
period of difficulty, and many believe that he is now Atlanta's
ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me this year has been consistency,''
Millwood said. `I haven't mixed in those bad starts between two or
three good ones. I've learned just by sitting back and watching
other guys do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the whole season, I guess I would be the most consistent
right now,'' said Millwood, who will oppose the Mets' Kenny Rogers.
``That makes me feel good when people say that. It's nice to be
noticed. I'm not one to go out and beg for a lot of press, but it's
always nice when people say those things about you, when you're on
a staff like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have considered me to be the so-called ace,
but I don't see it that way. We don't really have an ace on this
staff. We've had three or four guys that would be considered an ace
on just about any other staff. And we're lucky enough to have them
all on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked which Met has given him the most trouble this year,
Millwood singled out Olerud, who was 3 for 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sits back with a short swing, and he can hit a line drive
anywhere,'' Millwood said. ``He can hit a home run anywhere. You
try to keep him off balance, but it seems every swing he takes,
he's got good balance and he's hitting the ball hard somewhere. You
want to try to stay away from a guy like that in crucial
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Astros last week, and in one of the most dominant
pitching performances of the post-season, Millwood seldom
encountered crucial situations. He doesn't expect to top that
performance against the Mets. But if he pitches nearly that well,
it will probably be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't possibly try to throw a one-hitter again,'' Millwood
said. ``That's kind of insane. I'm going to pitch the same way I've
pitched all year and try to win. If I give up 10 hits and we win,
that's still a good start. This time of year, I don't think it's
how effective you are; it's whether you win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Millwood has done a lot more winning than losing.
He sees no reason the post-season should be any different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll probably get a little nervous,'' Millwood said.
``But you guys will never know.'' &QL;

   ASHKELON, Israel _ In their temporary apartment here, Zeida
Quintero and Irolando Carpio watched Tuesday, for the hundredth
time, a videotape of their marathon going-away party in Cuba. He
smoked a hand-rolled cigar, she sipped a bittersweet Cuban coffee.
Outside their window, the sea sparklede palms swayed, so
evocative of home.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparison stopped there. Husband and wife, both
dry-eyed, enjoyed the salsa music and taped memories, but evinced
little nostalgia for what they left behind. And they evinced it in
remarkably fluent Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year since their extended family of nine left
Cuba. But until Monday, Ms. Quintero and Carpio _ and 400 other
Cuban immigrants _ were an Israeli state secret. Few knew that
Cubans have been trickling into Ben-Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv
since 1995, from Havana by way of Paris. Few knew that they have
been living in the immigration center here, among Ethiopians,
Chechens and Yemenis, in other centers and in their own new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli censors banned those few who did learn of the Cubans'
existence from publishing or broadcasting the information. No one
ever mentioned the Cubans' presence on the floor of the Israeli
Parliament. But on Sunday, the government lifted the ban after The
Sunday Telegraph in London disclosed the hidden immigration
program.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy was a major component of a highly unusual deal that the
Jewish Agency for Israel struck with Fidel Castro, the Cuban
leader, using the Canadians as intermediaries. In an agreement
signed in 1994, Castro, whose country has no formal diplomatic
relations with Israel, agreed to grant exit to any member of Cuba's
dwindling Jewish population who wanted to move to Israel. His only
condition was that the program maintain the lowest possible
profile, both in Cuba and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with that agreement, Jewish Agency officials declined
to confirm Tuesday even the existence of the Cubans in Israel,
despite the censors' lifting of restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban immigrants themselves went out of their way to
take advantage of the press disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Now that their situation could be openly discussed, they said,
they could make public a demand. They wanted, as Carpio put it,
``to be treated like Ethiopians'' in terms of Israeli aid to
immigrants. They wanted Israel to recognize that they had forfeited
all their possessions _ ``down to the drinking glasses,'' Carpio
said _ to the Cuban government. They had arrived with nothing but a
few battered suitcases and 48 pounds of clothes per family. They
want to receive an ``immigration basket'' of money and services,
they said, just like the Ethiopians and, to a less generous extent,
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they're complaining,'' commented Avraham Burg, the
Speaker of the Parliament. ``That means they've really become
Israelis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintero is not complaining, especially not after the
Immigration Minister, Yuli Tamir, proposed late Tuesday that the
Cubans get the help they are asking for.
</P>
<P>
   Fingering her Star of David necklace, Ms. Quintero said she felt
embarrassed that Israel's first glimpse of the Cuban community
showed not their appreciation but their pent-up frustrations. She
also regretted that Israelis might have got what she called a false
impression that most of the Cubans see Israel as a way station to
Miami or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Television cameras could not help but focus Tuesday on one Cuban
immigrant, Ester Mechulam, since she greeted them at the gate to
the center. ``Brooklyn, Brooklyn,'' she was saying. ``I dream of
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ms. Quintero said she and her husband considered
themselves ``die-hard Zionist Jews,'' even though, like everyone
else, they left primarily because the opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have well-established family in New York, in New Jersey,''
she said. ``We don't want to join them. We want them to join us
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli experts believe that 1,300 Jews remain in Cuba. Fifteen
more Cubans are expected to arrive next week _ assuming Castro does
not freeze the program because it has gone public _ and 200 have
completed the paperwork to leave. Over the last four years, 10
immigrants have chosen to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The small Jewish community in Santa Clara, Cuba, had dwindled to
eight families, including Ms. Quintero's. Now there are just seven.
The old synagogue houses a government museum, an ode to the
revolution that makes no mention of the building's history.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quintero said she originally came from a town in Matanzas
Province where everyone was Jewish. Inside their homes, they held
Jewish weddings and celebrated Passover. Outside, like everyone
else in Cuba, they practiced no religion. Neither did they ever
encounter anti-Semitism, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Castro began easing restrictions on religious activities,
the Jewish families in Santa Clara began holding community-wide
Sabbath dinners, rotating from one home to the next. International
Jewish organizations sent ``guides'' to teach them prayers and
rituals, Ms. Quintero said.
</P>
<P>
   No posters or fliers or radio commercials told the Jews of Cuba
that they were free to leave for Israel. The information traveled
by word of mouth, ``from Jew to Jew,'' said Edwin Sanchez Perez,
24, who came from Havana and wears a gold hoop earring in each ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one and a half years I awaited a visa,'' he said. ``Here
in Israel I don't go to synagogue. It's not my thing. But in Cuba,
during that year and a half, if I hadn't gone to synagogue I
wouldn't have been allowed to leave. Not that the Cuban government
cared. It was the Jewish community leaders who gave the thumbs up
or thumbs down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Israeli Tourism Ministry, Ms. Quintero
requested brochures. Somehow, they gave her family the wrong
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Israel was purely religious,'' said her husband,
Carpio. ``Also that it was very poor. Then we got here and saw that
it was a tremendous economic superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a miracle,'' he said. ``In the desert, they grow here
mangos sweeter than tropical Cuba's.''

RAYTHEON STOCK DROPS ON WARNING OF LOWER SALES, PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. stock dropped 44 percent Tuesday after it warned
that sales and profits will be far below expectations this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
   After trading was halted most of the day while the company
discussed its problems with analysts and reporters, the stock fell
18 3/4 to close at 24 1/4. In July, the stock hit a high of
74-15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said it plans to eliminate about 2,380 jobs,
including 140 from its Lexington, Mass., headquarters and 200
elsewhere in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The layoffs are in
addition to the thousands of positions the company has shed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Burnham, Raytheon's chief executive, said the company's
condition ``fills me with anger, embarrassment and guilt.'' He said
he hoped the company's candor about its difficulties would help
Raytheon ``re-establish credibility'' with investors.
</P>
<P>
   Among its immediate woes, Raytheon said it expects no new orders
this year for its Patriot ground-to-air missile and said it will
have to write off other munitions inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also tried to address bigger questions surrounding the
company, which has released a stream of warnings about its outlook
in recent months. In general, Burnham said, the company has moved
too quickly to integrate defense units it acquired from Texas
Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronics Corp. two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we tried to do too much too fast, given the
size of the task, our state of readiness, and the depth and
maturity of the management team,'' Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also backed off his much-vaunted goal of growing revenue
by 6 to 8 percent a year and profits by 10 to 12 percent a year,
and set more modest expectations for 1999 and 2000. In addition,
Burnham said the company would take pretax charges of $638 million
this year, up from a charge of as much as $450 million the company
said last month that it planned to take during its third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company's update was aimed at investors worried by
Raytheon's statements last month, and Burnham pledged the company
would continue to grow 1 or 2 percent faster than the overall
defense market.
</P>
<P>
   But the update calmed few shareholders, who among other things
were spooked by Raytheon's forecast that profit margins will
probably fall from 15 percent to 12 percent next year at Raytheon
Systems Co., the defense contracting unit that accounts for
three-quarters of Raytheon's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much uglier,'' said Bill Fiala, an analyst at
Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``What makes this so serious is that the
problems that were disclosed today were in areas that are the bread
and butter of Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``US defense contracts are what make Raytheon tick and dropping
the ball in that area is a serious issue,'' Fiala said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I., said
he was troubled by continual shifts in guidance Raytheon has given.
``The credibility has gone to near-zero, and its going to be a long
time before it is back,'' said Nisbet. He compared Raytheon's
problems to those at Lockheed Martin Corp., whose stock has also
fallen this year after it issues earnings warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Of the job cuts announced Tuesday, Raytheon said it would cut
the bulk of positions _ 1,850 _ from plants in California, New
York, and Texas. About 150 positions will come from its Engineers &AMP;
Constructors unit, mainly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon had previously indicated it would cut jobs at its
headquarters. Of the other 200 layoffs pending in Massachusetts and
New Hampshire, Raytheon spokesman David Polk said the company
couldn't be more specific about the locations of positions to be
cut. The company also wasn't able to say how many positions were
new cuts and how many related to previous layoff efforts under way
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has made no decision about the fate of a
microelectronics plant in Quincy, which employs about 450 and for
which the company is considering a sale or closure, Polk said.
</P>
<P>
   In all Raytheon will spend $92 million on severance packages,
and another $55 million for facility closures, none of which will
occur in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for several hours on their conference call Tuesday,
Burnham and chief financial officer Frank Caine ran through a
litany of issues facing Raytheon, the country's third-largest
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Of great concern to investors is the success of Raytheon's
Patriot missile, which it markets heavily to countries like Greece,
Taiwan, and South Korea in packages worth around $1 billion and up.
Raytheon had hinted it was close to another major deal, but said it
expects no major Patriot orders before next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, increased competition from Russian and French suppliers
means it expects slimmer profit margins on Patriot than it once
expected, Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said the single largest portion of the charge it will
take, $320 million, relates to various operating shortcomings at
Raytheon Systems Co. and at Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors,
which builds power plants and other big infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that amount, $105 million, relates to two military
programs the company said it couldn't identify pending further
negotiations with the Pentagon. In addition, Raytheon said it will
have to write off certain inventories of its AMRAM and Sparrow
air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said $25 million of the charge relates to work in
a joint venture with Boeing Co. for business jets. On work for that
contract, ``Our performance has not been good and created a $25
million embarrassment/overrun for us,'' Caine said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said it now estimates 1999 revenue of about $20
billion, about $600 million less than previously forecast, and that
revenue in 2000 won't grow by more than 3 percent, down from its
earlier growth estimate of 6 to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company now estimates it will earn $2.70 to $2.80 per share
before charges, compared with analyst estimates of about $3.56 per
share. For next year Raytheon estimates earnings of $2.10 to $2.25,
compared to Wall Street estimates of about $3.91 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Also, revenue suffered because the company couldn't hire enough
software engineers, Burnham said, falling 1,000 short of its goal
of hiring 6,000 workers with such skills this year.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also said about $35 million in charges relate to
Raytheon's involvement in the troubled Iridium satellite-phone
network, led by Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon had planned to detail its bad news at analyst
conferences scheduled for Wednesday, but the company scrubbed those
meetings and moved up its schedule because of an article published
in The Wall Street Journal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources, the story said the company had been
criticized by Pentagon procurement officials for lagging work on
contracts including those for the Tomahawk cruise missile, RC-135
aircraft and Javelin shoulder-fired missile.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham and Caine denied the central elements of that article,
however, saying work on all three programs is proceeding on or
ahead of schedule. A Pentagon spokesman said the agency retains its
confidence in the company, and a Navy spokeswoman for the Tomahawk
program said work is proceeding on schedule and under budget.
Officials for the other programs couldn't be reached to comment
late Tuesday.

CZECH BANKING TROUBLES FURTHER SQUEEZE A WEAK ECONOMY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hungary, Poland, Germany, Austria)   By LADKA BAUEROVA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ Jiri Hovorka is angry. At 26, he runs a moderately
successful car-rental business. But he is unable to expand his
fleet of 14 vehicles, a move that would allow him to increase his
profit and hire more employees. No bank in the Czech Republic will
give him a loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started back in 1992, it was a piece of cake,'' he
says. ``All the banks asked for was a copy of the papers for my
three cars as collateral. But today, if you are a small business,
getting a loan is next to impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Hovorka's operation, thousands of small and medium-sized
Czech businesses have a shortage of cash and nowhere to raise
money. The stock market offers little hope because volume is anemic
and there is little investor interest in new stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are keeping their vaults shut. The bankers have been
burned before. The Czech central bank estimates that nonperforming
loans, worth $9 billion, constitute 30 percent of all loans
outstanding. Private financial analysts think that could be as high
as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the share of nonperforming loans in the Czech
banking system comes close to 30 percent, or even exceeds this
figure, the sector can in no way assume its place among developed
European and world economies,'' said Petr Zahradnik, an economist
at Conseq Finance, a Czech investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bad loans carried by banks in this country rank them below
banks in Poland and Hungary, where bad loans make up less than 20
percent of loans outstanding. Czech banks are also behind in the
privatization that has helped transform banking systems in other
East European nations. The Czech state is still the major
shareholder in the two largest banks, Komercni Banka and Ceska
Sporitelna. Polish and Hungarian banks, by contrast, are already
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bad loans in the Czech Republic date from the time
of post-Communist transformation in the early 90s engineered by
Vaclav Klaus, who was then prime minister. His voucher
privatization system enabled ordinary Czechs to buy shares in
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the banks established their own investment funds, which
started buying back the shares. As a result, the largely
state-owned banks acquired control over a large part of the economy
and continued to provide loans to the unprofitable enterprises they
controlled, in essence shoring up inefficient companies that had
not been much changed since Communist times.
</P>
<P>
   The privatization plan also limited the influx of foreign
capital, through its reliance on domestic entrepreneurs. Only a few
companies, like the car maker Skoda, now part of Volkswagen of
Germany, were sold directly to a foreign investor. Although the
Czech Republic has been in recession for five consecutive quarters,
Skoda has been consistently profitable and remains the most
successful company in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Czech economy is not entirely a story of bad news.
Incomes are higher here than in Poland or Hungary, even if growth
is lower.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a majority of the main industrial enterprises,
led by bank-appointed managers, have been sinking deeper into a
financial slump. The banks have shut off the tap for small and
midsize businesses, further hurting the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The current Czech government, led by the Social Democratic Party
for a little more than a year, has declared its intention to
privatize Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka by mid-2000. ``The
government's approach to foreign investors has changed,'' Finance
Minister Pavel Mertlik said in a recent interview. ``We know that
without direct foreign investment, we couldn't solve the economic
problems of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the potential investors, including Erste Bank of Austria for
Ceska Sporitelna and Deutsche Bank for Komercni, may not be willing
to invest money unless the state assumes responsibility for the bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Komercni Banka is the largest bank in Eastern Europe by assets,
and whoever buys it will have control over a quarter of the Czech
economy, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound like a great incentive for a buyer, regardless of
the risks. But some economists are skeptical. ``I think it is
unrealistic to expect that the banks could be sold at real
profit,'' said Evzen Kocenda of the Prague-based Center for
Economic Research and Graduate Education. ``I think they should be
sold as they are now, without a government bailout, which would
have to be shouldered by the taxpayers.''

 &HT;    Learning pet-food business, creating new products are
priorities, CEO says
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. wants to grow sales by
sharing existing technology throughout the company to create new
products, P&AMP;G's top executive told shareholders Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this, researchers are brainstorming new products _
everything from dog shampoos to pharmaceutical products to help
aging pets' joints _ to augment the Iams Co.'s pet food line,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just ideas,'' said Durk Jager, president, chairman and chief
executive of P&AMP;G. ``But all of them are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jager made his comments during the company's annual meeting
Tuesday in Cincinnati. The consumer-products giant purchased
Vandalia, Ohio-based Iams in August for $2.3 billion, P&AMP;G's largest
acquisition ever. The acquisition became effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have discussed new products, Iams' immediate
task has been to help P&AMP;G executives learn the pet food business,
Iams spokesman Bryan Brown said. Executives also are concentrating
largely on growing Iams' international market share, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear focus is on nutrition and that's where we're placing
the priority,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry estimates, Iams controls about 27 percent
of the global premium pet food market, second only to
Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s Hill's Pet Nutrition, which controls about
33 percent. Ralston Purina has about 15 percent, while other
manufacturers share the remaining 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite industry speculation that P&AMP;G will expand Iams'
distribution beyond veterinarian offices and pet stores to
mass-market retailers, Iams' short-term focus remains on
distributing the company's products through traditional channels,
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Iams Chairman and Chief Executive Clayton Mathile and new Iams
President Jeff Ansell just completed a 30-day international tour in
which Mathile introduced Ansell to employees and distributors,
Brown said. The pair still have some North American locations to
visit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mathile, who walked onto the Aronoff Center for the Arts stage
with Gunnar, a 9-year-old golden retriever, to address
shareholders, promised P&AMP;G executives a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was unsure how much longer Mathile will stay with
the company he grew from a small organization to an $800 million
international organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really Clay's call to set that timetable,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Jager told shareholders the company plans to focus more on
e-commerce, citing reflect.com, the company's new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G reported $38 billion in sales for 1999, Jager said. The
company's earnings will reflect the benefits of its reorganizations
within three years, he said.

   &UR; BLACKGOO &LR;  _ Growing grapes may seem a bucolic way to make a
living or spend retirement but then you probably haven't heard
about Black Goo. Unlike the Phylloxera root louse and Pierce's
Disease, this scourge has not made the headlines but it is raising
as much fear in some fields as the black plague once did in cities.
Also called Vine Decline, the disease is tied to several types of
fungi and the spores seem to be everywhere _ in the air, soil and
water. Even more alarming, the spores have shown up in rootstock
from commercial nurseries and some of the 60 acres used for
grapevine research and propagation at the University of California

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Long-struggling Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offered a
sunny outlook after posting its first profitable quarter in three
years, well above Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous milestone for the new MGM,'' proclaimed
Alex Yemenidjian, installed as chairman and chief executive officer
by owner Kirk Kerkorian in April. ``We have set the stage for
sustained improvement with further revenue enhancements and
diversification planned for the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM executives, in a conference call with analysts and reporters
Tuesday, disclosed plans to double the number of films it will
release over the next few years until it's producing 10 to 15
annually. Yemenidjian said he will soon announce TV deals, which
could create MGM-branded cable and satellite channels, with the
goal of taking advantage of the massive MGM library of 5,000 movie
titles.
</P>
<P>
   MGM also said it plans an extensive release schedule of titles
in the burgeoning DVD format with 70 by year's end and another 130
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's third-quarter earnings rose to $10.3 million, or 7
cents a share, compared with a loss of $40.3 million, or 61 cents a
share, in the 1998 period and far ahead of analysts' consensus
forecast of a loss of 19 cents a share. Revenue rose 15.3 percent
to $299.3 million, and cash flow totalled $40.2 million compared
with negative cash flow of $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   MGM said the improved results stemmed from cost-cutting moves
that will save $40 million annually, better-than-expected box
office from its three movies (``Stigmata,'' ``The Thomas Crown
Affair'' and ``Tea With Mussolini'') and revenue gains from its TV
division, including sales of ``The Outer Limits'' and
``Poltergeist: The Legacy'' to the Sci-Fi Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The executives also termed initial ratings for MGM's ``National
Enquirer'' series have been ``encouraging.'' Industry trackers
expect MGM to produce strong results next month from ``The World Is
Not Enough,'' the 19th James Bond film, while ``Flawless,'' a
Robert DeNiro drama-comedy due Nov. 24, may have potential.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of 1999, MGM lost $546.1 million with
most of that from charges for restructuring and cost-cutting. ``We
recognize that it's incumbent for us to prove that quarterly
profits are a habit, not an aberration,'' Yemenidjian said.
</P>
<P>
   MGM's stock edged up 6.25 cents to $22.1875 after touching a
1999 high of $24 earlier in the session. The stock, which had been
held down by short sellers, gained 48 percent last week after MGM
canceled a $750 million external stock offering due to the
depressed price and substituted a $720 million internal offering.
</P>
<P>
   Yemenidjian said the funds from the offering would be used to
finance an ``aggressive but disciplined'' growth strategy.
Kerkorian, who owns 90 percent of MGM, has pledged to buy any
shares not bought by other investors.

 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON  
 GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON  &HT;     Welfare-to-Work Grads Also Bring Tax Benefits 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Q: I have a small business and am interested in hiring an
entry-level employee from a welfare-to-work program but wonder how
well graduates of such training courses do and how long they stay
at their new jobs.
<P>
   &QL; 
A: There's some new evidence of how well these new workers do that
you might find encouraging. San Francisco Works, the
welfare-to-work training program sponsored by the United Way of the
Bay Area, Committee on Jobs and the SF Chamber of Commerce, has
just released a survey that shows the great majority of businesses
that hired its graduates are happy.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 1998, SFWorks has graduated 219 former welfare
recipients from its job skills training program, placed 156 (or 71
percent) in jobs and reports that 133 still hold their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, SFWorks released the results of a survey conducted
for it this past summer by BTW Consultants. It shows:
</P>
<P>
   _83 percent of the 45 businesses that responded said they were
either very satisfied or satisfied with the program. None was
dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   _93 percent of the respondents said they would refer other
businesses to SFWorks and many already have.
</P>
<P>
   _70 percent of SFWorks graduates who were hired performed
satisfactorily and 76 percent of business respondents said they are
interested in hiring more graduates.
</P>
<P>
   _35 percent of businesses said recruiting SFWorks graduates cost
less than recruiting other entry-level employees, 27 percent said
it cost about the same and 19 percent said it cost more.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Gustavson, an owner of San Francisco Reservations, said he
is pleased with the program. One SFWorks graduate left after a
short time but another has been with the company for more than a
year and continues to do well at the hotel reservation call center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the social benefits and satisfaction of helping
individuals make the transition from public assistance to work,
Gustavson notes that there are some nifty tax benefits. He said
businesses that participate in the program can deduct up to half of
salaries from their federal business tax bills.
</P>
<P>

Search Engine Search
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have had a Web site for the past three years and would like to
be accessible through more search engines. How do I go about
offering my information to these search engines and how do I
contact them?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Getting known in the right Internet circles isn't so easy, as
you have no doubt found out.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kent, the Colorado co-author of ``Poor Richard's Internet
Marketing and Promotions'' (Top Floor Publishing, $29.95), suggests
using a good software program or one of the many Web-based
submission services.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that there are more than 1,500 search sites (also
called engines) where people can find information about other Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   With a few of the most popular ones, like Yahoo (www.yahoo.com/
info/suggest), Kent said real people actually check all submissions
so you can't automatically list your own URL (universal resource
locator). But you can automatically list your site on most search
engines using either online resources or software programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of running software programs on your
computer is that you can submit to search sites as many times as
you want without incurring additional charges. You also can submit
multiple URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Kent likes Tucows (www.tucows.com) which stands for The Ultimate
Collection Of Winsock Software. He also mentioned the highly rated
AdWeb software which for as little as $60 lets you automatically
submit your site to 1,500 search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Online submission services include Submit It!
(www.submitit.com), and Register-It! (www.register-it.com) and
WorldSubmit (www.worldsubmit.com).
</P>
<P>
   The latter service lets users automatically submit their
profiles to 1,550 search sites one time for $49 or six different
times for $90. Kent and other experts recommend resubmitting your
Web site frequently since search engines often clear out their
files. This can drive up the costs of using online submission
services and if you have a new profile you want to submit, like for
a new product, you also will have to pay additional listing fees.

 &HT;    WITH DEAL ELUSIVE, TEST BAN TREATY FACES FATAL VOTE
 &HT;    Corrects Smith party designation in graf 16.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shadowed by a military coup in the world's newest
nuclear power, President Clinton and his Democratic allies sought
in vain Tuesday for a deal that would prevent Senate rejection of
an international ban on testing atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans vowed to kill the test ban treaty outright on
Wednesday unless its backers pledge in writing to abandon the
accord until after Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that the White House does not feel
comfortable
</P>
<P>
   with,'' responded White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``I think
it sends the message that, no matter what happens in the world, we
have given up our leadership position in nonproliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lockhart spoke at the White House, military officials in
Islamabad announced that they had overthrown the democratically
elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was
reportedly placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's coup in Pakistan, which joined the nuclear club 17
months ago, provided an ominous backdrop to several hours of Senate
debate over the fate of the test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to be voting down the treaty on the day that
there's a coup in Pakistan?'' asked Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the
ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``This
is high-stakes poker here.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the treaty about 20 votes short of the support needed
for ratification in the Senate, the body's Republican leadership
made it clear that one way or another, the treaty would be laid to
rest on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when all the sand drains out of this glass,'' said John
Czwartacki, press spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm perfectly comfortable having a vote,'' Lott told
reporters. ``This treaty is fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became the first national leader to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would outlaw test explosions
of nuclear bombs, in 1996. The next year he sent the treaty to the
Senate, asking that it be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The pact has been signed by 154 nations, but will not take
effect unless the United States and 43 other nuclear-capable
countries ratify it. So far, roughly half of them have done so.
</P>
<P>
   A ratification vote in the Senate had been expected as early as
Tuesday, but it was put off and scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification requires a two-thirds majority vote in the
100-member Senate, but fewer than 50 Senators are thought to favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is opposed chiefly by Republicans, who contend it
would hamstring U.S. weapons development efforts, undermine the
American nuclear deterrent, and would be susceptible to cheating by
rogue states with nuclear ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not in the best interest of our nation to ratify this
treaty,'' said Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world would be a more unstable ... not a more stable
place,'' said Sen. Bob Smith, I-N.H., ``if this treaty were to be
ratified.''
</P>
<P>
   With the treaty facing certain defeat, disheartened Democrats
pleaded with Republicans to defer a vote on the accord, in the hope
of keeping it alive for possible ratification next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of the treaty have won, for now, so why push for
a vote?'' asked Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Can't we find a
way to avoid just good old-fashioned gridlock?''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties were trying to agree on a way to put off
the vote. As of late Tuesday, though, no deal had been struck,
according to Lott's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several drafts going back and forth,'' said
Czwartacki. ``The key is finding the airtight language that
guarantees it (the treaty) not come up in this Congress. ... hat's
what's proving elusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had proposed language that would allow the treaty to
be revived in the current Congress if there were extenuating
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hole big enough to drive a truck through,'' objected
Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the treaty's foes opposed any such deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had plenty of time to study the treaty,'' Smith said.
``We're here to vote, that's what we're here for.''

ONLINE PRESENTATIONS BOOM AS COLLEGES COMPETE FOR THE TOP
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NICK GOLDIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colleges and universities are racing to provide applicants with
virtual tours of their campuses, setting up online presentations
that mirror actual campus visits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 colleges, compared with about 200 just two years
ago, now maintain Web sites that let prospective students view
slide shows, roll video clips of college life and glimpse
picturesque quadrangles captured live by cameras strategically
placed on campus.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, they are also acknowledging that a strong presence
on the Internet is vital to winning the hearts of the most
qualified students.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Princeton University's site, for example, see video
and audio snippets that simulate the real tour. One of the most
ambitious sites, for Washington State University in Pullman, allows
computer users to navigate an interactive map, view live shots of
the campus, browse a photo library of campus scenes and watch video
presentations on topics like financial aid, career services and
fraternity and sorority life.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell University maintains a virtual slide show and a live
view of the campus center.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual tours are becoming the first step for many students in
narrowing the list of possible destinations, though admissions
officers doubt they will replace the traditional visit, which can
include a tour, an overnight stay in a dormitory, a sample lecture
and discussions with current students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is continue a student's interest in
the institution with the ultimate goal of getting them to visit,''
said Brian Davis, the associate director of undergraduate
admissions at the University of California at Los Angeles. The UCLA
Web site provides a 360-degree panorama of campus scenes.
</P>
<P>
   High school students say that online presentations help them
work through the college selection process, providing information
on everything from school traditions to meal plans. It is
especially useful for those who cannot easily or economically visit
the campus, or to refresh prospective students' memories after they
return home from sometimes numbing multiple visits.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Raiffe, a Miami senior who was in New York last month
for a round of campus tours, conceded that while nothing beat a
personal visit for getting the feel of a school, ``what they showed
me wasn't that much more than I could have gotten from the Net.''
He plans to turn to the Internet this fall for information on the
remaining colleges on his list.
</P>
<P>
   But Molly Darnieder, the director of campus information and
visitor relations at Cornell, believes that Web sites leave a void.
``The little nuances about each school that you can't pick up from
a Web site can be really important,'' Ms. Darnieder said.
</P>
<P>
   Students are using these online research tools the way they once
used paper guides and school rankings, said Chris Carson, the
president of campustours.com, a site with almost a thousand links
to multimedia presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venerable printed view book that all of us received when
we applied to college is slowly going out of style,'' Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some admissions officials caution that virtual tours are not
always representative of what an institution has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students might lose sight of the fact that these are marketing
tools, and schools will show them what the schools want,'' said Bob
Laird, the director of undergraduate admissions at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Berkeley's Web site, Laird joked, will not hear,
``We'd like to show you our poorest faculty lecturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, visitors would not hear that on an actual campus
tour, either.

 &HT;    Friday's Freedom Fund Banquet to mark NAACP's 90-year legacy
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ More than 1,100 people will gather Friday at the
Dayton Convention Center to celebrate the legacy of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, ``90 Years of
Making Democracy Work.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the theme of the 48th annual Freedom Fund Banquet, held
by the Dayton chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Russell-McCloud, an attorney who heads her own
Atlanta-based motivational speaker training firm, is the scheduled
keynote speaker. Russell-McCloud is a former senior managing
attorney for the Federal Communication Commission and past national
president of The Links Inc., a black women's volunteer service
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The banquet is much more than people gathering for a meal and to
hear a dynamic speaker, said Dayton chapter president Jessie
Gooding.
   ``We want to let the community know that we're celebrating 90
years of history. And I think that (the Dayton chapter) has made a
great contribution to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the national NAACP has spent much energy this year
strengthening national leadership and bolstering membership in its
2,200 local chapters across the country, the 84-year-old Dayton
chapter continues to focus on discrimination and employment issues
closer to home and the criminal justice system, Gooding said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in business. We're still continuing to work to
improve conditions of race relations, and economic status for
minorities,'' Gooding said.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom Fund banquet is the NAACP Dayton chapter's major
fund-raiser. Proceeds help cover operational expenses and
scholarships.

 _ SF CHRON  
 CrossWorlds' Controversial CEO to Quit Post  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Katrina Garnett, the founder of CrossWorlds Software who posed
seductively in a slinky, low-cut cocktail dress for a national
advertising campaign, has learned a hard lesson. Namely, sex
doesn't sell software _ especially software that costs about
$850,000 a pop.
<P>
   Garnett, 37, resigned yesterday as CrossWorlds chief executive
and president. She was replaced by Alfred Amoroso, 49, who last
served as general manager of IBM's Asia Pacific Global Services,
where he managed 25,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett will become chairman, a new position, at the Burlingame
company, which employs 210.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe she voluntarily removed herself from the
company's day-to-day operations but that the decision might have
been hastened by concerned board members and investors, who have
watched nervously as CrossWorlds burned through about $60 million
since Garnett founded it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced yesterday that it has raised an
additional $25 million in financing. Investors include Soros
Private Equity Partners, SAP AG, Venrock Associates _ where
Garnett's husband Terry Garnett is a partner _ as well as the
Garnett family trust.
</P>
<P>
   David Dobrin, an analyst at software advisory firm Benchmarking
Partners, speculates that the new round of financing may have come
with the stipulation that Garnett become less involved in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a venture capitalist investing millions, I wouldn't
want to see Katrina blow it all with a single magazine ad featuring
herself in a little black dress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CrossWorlds competes in the so-called enterprise application
integration (EAI) market. It makes the stuff that allows companies
to connect their disparate software systems. For example, a
customer can use the CrossWorlds product to link its financial
management system from SAP with its sales-force automation system
from Siebel.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998, the company had only about 30 customers and
sales of $9.5 million. CrossWorlds competes against the likes of
Tibco Software, New Era of Networks and TSI International, firms
that are beginning to turn a profit and seem to have more traction
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The EAI market reached $450 million in 1998 and is growing at
roughly 50 percent a year, according to AMR Research.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrin said CrossWorlds has a strong product but that potential
customers have stayed clear because it is overly complex. ``While
other EAI companies are just putting in the pipes, CrossWorlds is
trying to build the entire house and everything that comes with
it,'' he said. ``People don't want all those high-end features.''
The average CrossWorlds sale is about $850,000, on the high end of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was a perception in the software industry
that Garnett was spending too much time marketing her company and
speaking with journalists rather than going out and actually
selling the product.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-born Garnett last appeared on the cover of
Forbes' May 31 issue clad in a high-collared black vinyl jacket and
clutching a red arrow, snapped in two. &UR;  &LR; The magazine profiled the
company's struggle to survive the ``slings and arrows'' that
followed its high-profile, controversial ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts noted that Garnett, who declined to comment for
this article, gave birth to her third child earlier this year and
has been noticeably absent from the office ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A CrossWorlds spokesman acknowledged that ``family was a
contributing factor'' in Garnett's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Her resignation as CEO of CrossWorlds may pave the way for an
initial public offering later this year or early next year. ``I
think the board realized they needed a leader who had a more stable
appearance who would be more impressive to Wall Street,'' said
Kimberly Knickle, an analyst with AMR Research.
</P>
<P>
   Amoroso, who is traveling in Japan, could not be reached for
comment. He is expected to take the helm at CrossWorlds in early
November.

 Breadmaker Rises Up to Swallow Oh-La-La Coffee Chain  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco's struggling Oh-La-La coffee chain has been purchased
by Bay Bread of South San Francisco.
<P>
   Bay Bread co-owner Pascal Rigo said yesterday that his company
bought the assets of Oh-La-La in a bankruptcy-related sale on
September 27 for slightly less than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-La-La, one of San Francisco's first coffee-bar chains, has
had a bumpy past. The company, which currently operates nine cafes
in San Francisco, had been run since December 1996 by Good Food
Fast of Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County), which now is in the
process of liquidating. Oh-La-La's prior owner was Java Centrale of
Sacramento, which purchased Oh-La-La in 1995 in a
bankruptcy-related auction. Java Centrale is now defunct, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rigo, a native of France, said he intends to differentiate
Oh-La-La from the rest of the coffee-bar pack by returning to its
Gallic roots. It will serve large madeleines instead of muffins,
brioche with gravlax, and small sandwiches with salad. Both coffee
and food will be organic.
</P>
<P>
   Rigo, whose company is primarily a wholesaler of organic breads
and pastries, said he intends to remodel the stores and add
``hearth'' ovens so customers can see the bread baking. Bay Bread
currently operates in-store bakeries with such ovens for
Andronico's, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigo plans to sell goods made by Bay Bread in the Oh-La-La
stores. Bay Bread operates a grain mill in Utah, a large bakery in
South San Francisco and a commissary and retail outlet,
Boulangerie, on Pine Street in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rigo said the success of Boulangerie has whetted the company's
appetite to undertake more retail.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Bread's sales this year, excluding Oh-La-La, are expected to
hit $12 million, Rigo said. Oh-La-La's sales came in at $3 million
last year. Rigo said he hopes to boost them to $4.5 million in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The chain was founded in 1982 by Philippe Laik, a Frenchman who
intended to take his concept nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   European-style coffee bars were just beginning to catch on at
the time, and the market was wide open. Starbucks was a small
Seattle company still owned by Jerry Baldwin, now the chairman of
Peet's Coffee and Tea of Emeryville, and Pasqua _ a San Francisco
coffee-bar chain recently purchased by Starbucks _ wasn't founded
until the following year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the company was at its peak with about 25
locations and $5.5 million in annual sales, its then-chief
executive Howard Berkowitz told The Chronicle that he intended to
expand to 53 company-operated stores, 1,100 franchise stores and
$100 million in sales by 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-La-La opened a couple of stores in New York and Los Angeles
but never became a major player.
</P>
<P>
   It filed for bankruptcy-court protection for the first time in
November 1994, at which time it had assets of $2.1 million and
liabilities of $6.1 million. Java Centrale bought it the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   The French concept could succeed if it is implemented well and
store locations are good ones, said Andrew Barish, a retail analyst
with Banc Boston Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably require a higher-end demographic and a little
higher education levels to be able to appreciate some of the French
items,'' Barish said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Bread currently is in merger discussions with a large French
bakery, Rigo said. An announcement is expected in a few weeks. &LR;

 &HT;    Technology test in breast cancer fight announced
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An experimental treatment for breast
cancer that uses microwaves to zap tumors could make today's gold
standard of cancer treatment _ surgery, radiation and drugs _ look
as primitive as poking holes in the skull to relieve headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Hospital's Center for Breast Care in West Palm Beach
announced Tuesday it is recruiting up to 10 women to take part in
the nation's first test of a new technology that pinpoints
microwaves to kill breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Applying technology used in the Gulf War to jam enemy radar and
home in on missiles, doctors will heat breast tissue with
microwaves, the same energy used to cook TV dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been known that heat kills tumors,'' said Kurt O'Neill, a
spokesman for Celsion Corp., the Columbia, Md., company licensed to
market the technology. ``The problem in the past has been getting
heat to the tumor only _ and not healthy cells.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 1 trial also will be conducted at Harbor UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are looking for women who are already planning a
mastectomy. At the end of the trial, doctors must remove the breast
to determine whether the tumor is dead and the surrounding breast
tissue is unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial succeeds, however, microwave treatment would
eliminate the need for painful and disfiguring breast surgery, said
Dr. Robert Gardner, medical director at Columbia's breast center.
He said he is looking for ``10 angels'' to volunteer for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Women facing a mastectomy and diagnosed with a single invasive
breast tumor 3 centimeters or less in diameter are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects would be paid $75 at each visit to cover travel and
other expenses, and would not be charged for any medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   While welcoming any treatment that avoids surgery, the American
Cancer Society refused to label Celsion's treatment a breakthrough.
``There are many things that look very promising in animals that
fail to be successful in humans,'' said Debbie Saslow, the
society's director of breast and cervical cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And even if successful, it could be many years before the
treatment is available to all, Saslow said. Assuming its trials and
federal permits proceed smoothly, Celsion said it hopes to market
the system in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, scientists could not kill cancerous cells without
harming healthy ones, limiting the use of microwaves to skin
tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, invented by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, focuses microwaves in a way never tried before. It
takes advantage of a basic law of physics: When two waves get
perfectly in sync, their energies combine, becoming stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment also is being used in a trial at Montefiore
Hospital in New York to unblock prostate glands in men.
</P>
<P>
   In animal trials last year at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston and at Oxford University in England, Celsion's treatment
system killed breast tumors in more than 90 percent of cases,
Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Some animals had side effects of skin redness and a few
developed blisters, but no damage to surrounding tissue and nothing
approaching the harsh side effects, such as extreme fatigue and
nausea, of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to hold the clinical trial at Mass General fell through.
Gardner learned about it from colleagues there and asked Celsion to
send him information. O'Neill said a member of Celsion's medical
advisory board thought highly of Gardner, leading it to consider
his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who are very enthused ... and very respected,''
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was enthusiastic at a news conference Tuesday. ``This
has never been done before,'' he said. ``This has the potential to
replace surgery and be a phenomenal breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding surgery could save lives: Gardner estimated as many as
one-fourth of women who undergo a mastectomy die in spite of, or
possibly as a result of, the aggressive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   More than 176,000 Americans, nearly all of them women, will be
diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 43,700 will die, the
Cancer Society estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding two months of radiation therapy would mean fewer
patients left with swollen or hard breasts, Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   And it could save money too: Surgery, radiation treatments and
hospital stays cost about $20,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Parsons, a Boynton Beach woman who survived the removal of
both her breasts in 1996, said it would be fantastic if she could
have avoided surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physical pain can be dealt with, but it causes emotional
scars that last indefinitely,'' Parsons said. ``Losing a breast is
very much (losing) a part of being a woman.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WILT the Stilt.
</P>
<P>
   He came before Hakeem the Dream, Chet the Jet, Earl the Pearl
and Clyde the Glide.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Dipper.
</P>
<P>
   Before Air Jordan, the Human Highlight Film and Chocolate
Thunder, he was the reason to never take your eyes off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Before Dr. J, Pistol Pete and Magic, he was the reason to come
to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Before Larry, Michael and Kobe, he needed only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Iceman, he invented cool.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Norman Chamberlain. As it said on the dust cover of his
first autobiography: ``Just like any other 7-foot black millionaire
who lives next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the debate will begin. It says here he was the greatest
player ever, and when the M.J. bunch comes around to offer its
rebuttal, just remember this:
</P>
<P>
   Every referee in the NBA was magically transformed into a blind
man with a cane each time Jordan would commit a walking violation
while driving to the hoop. They ignored one of the most fundamental
rules of the game for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the NBA legislated multiple rule changes
designed specifically to stop Wilt. They widened the lane to move
him farther away from the basket. When he began to shoot free
throws by taking off from the foul line on a standing long jump,
they outlawed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Could he dominate today? Listen to Shaquille O'Neal, who wears a
Superman tattoo on his biceps, cry about the officiating. See how
Wilt just overwhelmed the game.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the numbers you already know, the 100 points in a
single game on March 2, 1962, or a 50.4 scoring average for the
1961-62 season. Remember that he once played every single minute _
including overtime _ of every single game for an entire season and
that he never fouled out of a game in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Russell camp will make its case with the usual evidence
of Russell's 11 championship rings to only two for Wilt. But
Russell's Celtics _ with the exception of the 1967 Philadelphia
76ers _ were consistently loaded with far more talent than the
various collections of Warriors, Sixers and Lakers that backed up
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   So much was made of the Wilt-vs.-Russell rivalry down through
the years. The talk of how Russell loved to rub his face in it. The
story of the time Wilt demanded a raise from the Warriors to
$100,000 per season so that he could be paid more than Russell,
only to find out later that Russell's deal with the Celtics called
for him to make one dollar more.
</P>
<P>
   But what never came out until years after they both retired was
how Russell, a loner from the West Coast who felt isolated in
Boston, ate so many Thanksgiving dinners at the Chamberlain house
in Philadelphia with Wilt's entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was always such an easy and conspicuous target, a
flamboyant black man who arrived on the scene to dominate what was
still a very white game in the conservative 1950s. He was easy for
opponents to dislike, simply because he was bigger than everybody
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cheers for Goliath,'' Wilt said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a giant on the court who was exceptionally fast and
extremely agile, yet powerfully strong. Wilt once broke up a fight
between teammate Al Attles and some of the New York Knicks by
reaching out with one long arm and picking Attles clear off the
floor by the waistband of his uniform shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that ever happened to the NBA is that God made
Wilt a nice man,'' said the late Jack McMahon, an All-Star for the
old Rochester Royals. ``He coulda killed us all with his left
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   He fancied himself as something of a Renaissance man, hanging
out with everybody from movie stars to jockeys to race car drivers
to politicians. A high jumper, shot putter and cross country runner
at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and a Harlem Globetrotter
for one year after college, he said he wanted to try Formula One
racing and pro tennis, and he signed to get into the ring with
then-heavyweight champ Muhammad Ali in a fight that never came off.
He became the head coach of the San Diego Conquistadors of the old
ABA, then would miss practice.
</P>
<P>
   He'd play 48 minutes in a basketball game, use one towel to wipe
off the sweat and then put on his fancy clothes and hit the town.
No shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies want to get the essence of the real me,'' Wilt
said.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in his second book, he claimed to have made love
to 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   Big talk. Big man. Larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt the Stilt. The original.

MAGNIFICENT SEVEN GET IT DONE FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They haven't mended a tattered national
reputation. They don't deserve a nickname, and they aren't being
compared to counterparts at Florida State or Penn State. But UCLA's
defensive line and linebackers _ the ``front seven'' in football
lingo _ are quietly becoming an immovable force.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Bruins pressured Stanford's quarterbacks
and held tailback Kerry Carter to 31 yards. Then they dominated
Arizona's State's offensive line and contained Oregon tailback
Reuben Droughns. (The Ducks had just one touchdown drive longer
than 44 yards.) In each game, UCLA's breakdowns originated in the
secondary, with poor coverage and missed tackles. The front seven
has done its job.
</P>
<P>
   Junior end Kenyon Coleman is rapidly becoming one of the best in
the Pacific-10 _ so good the Bruins are worried he'll bolt for the
NFL. Tackles Ken Kocher and Pete Holland are making plays they
didn't make a year ago. Reserves Santi Hall, Anthony Fletcher and
Sean Phillips contribute consistently. Linebacker Robert Thomas is
a rising star.
</P>
<P>
   Maturity and experience are partly responsible for the
improvement: Fletcher, Kocher and Thomas were true freshmen last
year. But coach Bob Toledo credits first-year assistants John
Pearce (ends) and Jethro Franklin (tackles) for much of the
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it wasn't unusual to see the linemen resting on one
knee, listening to former coach Terry Tumey explain nuances and
schemes. This year, there's less talk and more action. Franklin and
Pearce have implemented a grueling practice regimen designed to
toughen the players mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them after practice, and they look like they've been in
a war,'' Toledo said. ``They're dirty and sweaty. They're working.
They aren't taking any Sno-Cone breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The practices are sometimes tougher than the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself last year and this year, and I'm a totally
different player,'' Kocher said. ``A lot of it is (Franklin's)
coaching. He's making us work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Need some lift?: Bruins kicker Chris Griffith leads the Pac-10
with 1.67 field goals per game and is third in accuracy (10 of 13).
But he had two field goals blocked by Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do a better job protecting,'' Toledo said, ``and
he's got to get the ball up a little quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Bear leg: One of Cal's best players is junior Nick Harris,
who averages 46.9 yards per punt (fourth in the nation) and has
dropped six punts inside the opponent's 20 this season.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that struggles moving the ball _ Cal is last in the
league in offense _ Harris' leg provides a boost in field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our defensive game plan,'' Bears coach Tom
Holmoe said. ``There are many times we'll punt at the 35 and he'll
put it inside the 10. He's fantastic.''

 Growth Spurt Propels Weisel Partners Into Top S.F.
Investment  Bank 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Thomas Weisel Partners, a startup that didn't exist a year ago, is
poised to become San Francisco's largest independent investment
bank.
<P>
   Since opening for business in January, the firm has completed 51
public or private stock offerings and six merger deals, worth a
total of more than $13.5 billion. Weisel Partners recorded $80
million in revenue for the six months ended in September and
expects to post revenue of $150 million for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   That performance will put Weisel Partners in first place among
local independent investment banks when Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group,
currently the largest, completes its recently announced sale to New
York's Chase Manhattan Corp. in several months.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, the city's big three independent
firms - H&AMP;Q, Robertson Stephens and Montgomery Securities, now
known as Banc of America Securities - all sold out to traditional
banks.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Weisel Partners is in 21st place among
investment banks nationwide in public stock offerings, behind
Robertson Stephens, Banc of America and H&AMP;Q, but ahead of Volpe
Brown Whelan, San Francisco's second-ranking independent investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Weisel, 58, the onetime one-time  &LR; bicycle-racing champion
who founded Weisel Partners, was Montgomery's chief executive when
the  &LR; North Carolina's NationsBank, now Bank of America, bought the
firm in 1997. He quit a year ago after following  &LR; a dispute with
bank executives over control of Montgomery, bringing dozens of
employees of his old firm to his new venture.
</P>
<P>
   During the last nine months, Weisel Partners has built its
headquarters at the foot of Montgomery Street, grown to 66 partners
and 384 total employees, and opened offices in New York, Boston and
London.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising capital and providing merger advice, the
firm is a stock broker for institutional clients and manager of a
private investment fund that is approaching $1 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts described Weisel Partners' blazing start as phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to believe they're only 9 nine  &LR; months old.
They have a record older and larger firms would envy,'' said
Michael Flanagan, an independent securities industry analyst based
in the Philadelphia area.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said he was especially impressed by Weisel Partners'
ability to win the coveted lead-manager assignment in six stock
offerings during the third quarter, including the $50 million IPO
of VitaminShoppe.com, an online supplier of nutritional
supplements, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The lead managers in stock offerings oversee the sales process
and collect higher fees than firms that serve as co-managers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Flanagan warned, Weisel Partners will have to work hard
to maintain its entrepreneurial edge as it settles into the middle
ranks of U.S. investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a mid-sized investment bank is not the ideal niche for
an independent company,'' he said. ``Loss of nimbleness is a
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Weisel said his firm's fast start has been due
to its focus on fast-growing areas of the economy, such as
Internet-based commerce and electronic information services aimed
at businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Capital-raising activity ``has been concentrated in areas where
we've built up our competence, where people are going to make money
over the next 10 years,`` Weisel said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Weisel said, the sale of so many firms, including
Montgomery, put lots of top-caliber on the job market. On Monday,
for example, the firm announced it had hired Bill Shutzer, former
president of the boutique investment bank Furman Selz, as senior
partner in its New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel Partners officials said the firm will keep its sharp
focus and rein in growth once it reaches about 500 employees.

 Intel Earnings Fall Short of Expectations  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the second consecutive quarter, Intel's financial results have
fallen slightly below Wall Street's inflated expectations.
<P>
   The chip-making giant reported net income of $1.9 billion (55
cents per share) for its fiscal third quarter, excluding the costs
of several recent acquisitions. Those figures represented increases
of 21 and 22 percent, respectively, from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter ended September 25 was $7.3 billion, up
9 percent from last year's third-quarter total of $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By most standards, that sounds like healthy growth, but Wall
Street had expected better. Analysts surveyed by First Call
/Thomson Financial had predicted net income of 57 cents a share,
and the ``whisper numbers'' _ unofficial predictions offered to
major clients and often leaked on the Internet _ were 59, 60 or
even 61 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Intel's stock had climbed in anticipation of a
strong report, closing yesterday, before the announcement, at
$76.69. Once the official numbers were released, the stock plunged
$5.69 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mark Edelstone of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said he
didn't expect the sell-off to continue for long. ``I think we've
already seen most of the reaction, and quite frankly, it's an
overreaction,'' he said. ``People tend to shoot first and ask
questions later, but as they get their questions answered, they'll
think better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's revenues actually were up slightly more than expected,
Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant said in a post-announcement
conference call; the problem was that its gross profit margin,
which had been expected to rise, dipped slightly, from 59.4 to 58.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Paul Otellini, executive vice president and general
manager of the Intel architecture business group, offered several
explanations for that decline. First, the company's Celeron chip
continued to gain ground at the low end of the PC market, where
margins tend to be smaller than in the high-performance segment.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, sales of high-end, high-margin chips were somewhat
below expectations, the execs acknowledged, mainly because the
transition to a new production process, in which chip features
measure only .18 micron compared with .25 micron in the previous
process, has taken slightly longer than expected. That transition
also has involved some extra costs, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, now is shipping the new chips to PC-makers, who
are expected to announce desktop models, servers and notebooks
including them on October 25.
</P>
<P>
   The actual costs of producing chips in the new process are lower
than expected, Intel said. For the third quarter, that forced the
company to reduce the value of its existing inventory, which
further cut into earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But for the fourth quarter and beyond, the lower-than-expected
costs of the new production process should bolster Intel's
fortunes. Bryant and Otellini forecast ``strong seasonal demand''
for all products in the traditionally strong fourth quarter, and
they predicted that gross margins would climb by ``a couple of
points.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is just a one-time hit,'' Morgan Stanley's
Edelstone said. ``The good news is that going forward, the whole
cost structure will be lower. And what investors care about is the
outlook, not what's in the rearview mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Intel announced plans to collaborate with Nokia, the
Finnish company that has recently risen to No.1 in the cellular
phone manufacturing market, to build television set-top boxes that
combine features of the Internet with broadcast TV. The new set-top
box will run on an Intel chip, probably a Celeron. The first fruits
of the new alliance are slated to reach the market in the second
half of next year, Intel said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; There seem to be almost as many grapevine diseases and pests as
grape varieties. Here is a sampling of some of the nastiest,
according to University of California at Davis plant pathologist
Doug Gubler:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Powdery mildew  &LR; _ The fungus colonizes leaves, fruit and green
stems thus depriving the plant of moisture and nutrients. Without
use of fungicides, the disease would devastate much of the
California crop.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Phylloxera root louse  &LR; _ This microscopic insect has infected about
a quarter of grape vines planted in clay coastal soils and has
required replacement with resistant rootstocks. Vines planted in
the sandy Central Valley don't seem susceptible to the louse, which
slowly consumes the roots and causes death.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Eutypa Dieback  &LR; _ This fungal disease, formerly called Dead Arm,
attacks pruning wounds. It invades the vascular tissue, creating
cankers that clog water-conducting vessels and could affect half of
California's grape acreage. New materials are being tested to treat
pruning wounds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Pierce's Disease  &LR; _ Just as mosquitoes deliver malaria to humans, a
little insect known as the sharpshooter infects grape vines with
the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa when they probe the leaves. The
plants try to wall off the bacteria and end up choking off their
own water and nutrient supply. As a sign of the severity of the
disease, especially in Riverside County's Temecula Valley, the
University of California appointed an emergency task force last
week to tackle the disease. It also afflicts other plants from
almond trees to Oleander bushes planted along freeway median
strips. There is no effective control.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Botrytis or bunch rot  &LR; _ This fungal disease causes rot when it is
especially wet during bloom or at harvest. It affects about
three-quarters of California vineyards, but leaf removal and
fungicides can be used to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Viruses  &LR; _ Fanleaf and Leafroll viruses have been a leading cause
of premature vine death, but UC Davis ensures that new vines sold
by commercial nurseries are free of these diseases.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Vine Decline (Black Goo)  &LR; _ Several species of Phaeoacromonium and
Cylindrocarpon fungi cause this disease or contribute to it. The
fungi cause clogging of the water- and nutrient-bearing tissue,
stunting growth or even killing the plant. No effective treatment.

 Spread of Unstoppable Fungi Creates Rift in Wine Country  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A fearsome fungus nicknamed ``Black Goo'' is spreading through the
wine country, destroying vineyards and relationships.
<P>
   Also called Vine Decline, the disease is linked to several types
of fungi and the spores seem to be everywhere _ in the air, soil
and water. Even more alarming, the spores have shown up in
rootstock from commercial nurseries and some of the 60 acres used
for grapevine research and propagation at the University of
California at Davis, the nation's leading viticulture center.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, whose cause is not clearly understood, is creating
a rift in the normally genteel North Coast wine region. Growers who
have it blame the nurseries for selling them infected rootstock.
Some nurseries blame the growers, saying the disease only afflicts
plants that haven't been tended properly.
</P>
<P>
   There's not even a consensus on the severity of the problem.
Some growers and consultants say the nurseries and even UC Davis
are trying to hush it up to avoid lawsuits, panic and falling land
prices. They charge that UC Davis was slow to divulge a decade ago
that its favored AXR-1 rootstock was susceptible to Phylloxera, and
that history is repeating itself.
</P>
<P>
   Vines infected by the Black Goo fungi Phaeoacremonium and
Cylindrocarpon can appear normal for months or years. When the
fungi start growing, however, they can kill the vines or just make
them sickly underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms are many and varied: stunted growth, dark gummy
ooze (black goo) instead of clear sap inside the wood, grooved and
asymmetrical trunks, graft unions that fail to callus over, leaves
that prematurely turn yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Many big nurseries, growers and scientists say the fungi in
question have been around for decades. But for years, the disease
was undiagnosed. Now, it seems to be spreading more rapidly as
growers rip out vines infected with the widespread Phylloxera root
louse and replant them with new vines that may be infected with the
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Dondero, a Sonoma dermatologist who planted 16 acres
outside Santa Rosa with vines purchased from Sonoma Grapevines in
May 1997, is one of the victims of Black Goo. He has watched his
Pinot Noir and other varieties sicken and exhibit the classic signs
of Black Goo disease _ slow growth, stunted vines and dark
splotches on cross-sectioned wood.
</P>
<P>
   Dondero tore out some vines and sent them to laboratories for
analysis, and some of the cultures turned up positive for
Phaeoacremonium and Cylindrocarpon. In late August, Dondero sued
Sonoma Grapevines, charging that the well-known nursery
misrepresented its products and sold him vines that it knew were
diseased.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Sonoma Grapevines countersued Dondero for slander.
``He is claiming we knowingly sent out diseased material,'' said
President Rich Kunde. ``I consider that a personal attack. If we
were lying to all our customers, we wouldn't be in business for 28
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some major growers, nurseries and scientists argue that the
Black Goo scare is being fomented by growers who are trying to get
others to pay for their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that Vine Decline, as they prefer to call it, only
becomes a serious problem if vines are already weak or stressed
because they have been handled, planted, fed or watered improperly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's like disease in humans,'' said Kunde. ``We're
exposed to lots of things every day, but when you get run down or
stressed, you can get the flu and the person next to you doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonoma Grapevines chief viticulturist Chris Lindelof said
customers return less than 1 percent of rootstock because of
disease. Kunde insisted that he has sent thousands of cuttings to
UC Davis and not one has tested positive for Black Goo fungi.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gubler, head of the plant pathology department at UC Davis,
estimates that Vine Decline has hit less than 10,000 of
California's 900,000 or so vineyard acres. That's barely 1 percent
of the state total, and well down the list of grapevine diseases.
Right now, that's not enough to affect grape supplies or wine
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Gubler acknowledged, ``It is a big problem for those who
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he ranks Vine Decline as the No.1 policy issue for
California's booming wine-grape industry. ``People are blaming the
university and nurseries for (unwittingly) spreading the disease,
and it's a political nightmare,'' Gubler said.
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard consultant Michael Porter of Forestville, said he has
tested vines from a number of nurseries and found the fungus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a major problem,'' he said. ``Some little growers have
lost their shirts, and then they are told by the nurseries, `You
screwed up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Porter figures that one reason nurseries are insisting there's
no big problem or it's the customer's fault is that ``saying you
have a problem is like asking an attorney to sue you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even growers who have diagnosed the disease and sent cuttings to
labs to be tested are often mum about the problem. After all, if
the value of an acre of prime vineyard land infected with
Phylloxera drops to $40,000 from $70,000, what might happen to
vineyards that are home to an unpredictable fungus that may sleep
in vines and the soil?
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some growers are speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Retired obstetrician Bob Ziegler tends 19 acres of wine grapes
near Healdsburg, and in 1994, he began replanting vines ridden with
Phylloxera with new ones. Several years later, he discovered that
many of the new vines are infested with the Black Goo fungi. UC
Davis lab tests have come back positive, and Ziegler has replanted
4 acres and is watching much of the rest limp along. He also said
he is considering filing suit against Sonoma Grapevines, which
supplied the vines, and figures his losses, including lost
production, top $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lerner, who planted 13 acres of new vineyards in the
Russian River Valley with 13,000 vines from a Bakersfield (Kern
County) nursery in June, has watched hundreds die and many of the
rest grow at a puny pace. The canes of many of his new Chardonnay
and Pinot Noir vines are stunted, and he just got news that three
of the four vines he sent to UC Davis for testing came back
positive for Phaeoacremonium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do,'' said Lerner, 52, a former builder
who invested in the land with a few friends. ``The nursery agreed
to replace the dead vines, but the new vines might carry the same
pathogens, so what's the point?''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Bewley, owner of the 40-acre Alder Springs Vineyard in
Mendocino County, began planting vines six years ago and was
surprised that so many died after a year or two. The former
president of California Coolers figures that about 25 percent of
his vineyards are infected. ``I believe I got Black Goo from all
four nurseries I bought from,'' he said. ``This is a big problem.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Francis Winery partner Joe Martin said, ``Most people are in
denial. They don't want to admit they have a problem.'' He said
some of his own 30 acres is infected with Black Goo, and he worries
that a lot more acreage will go into decline when it should be
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the growing worries about Black Goo worldwide, an
international conference was held 12 days ago in Siena, Italy, to
discuss the problem. About 120 scientists from 20 wine-growing
countries around the world attended the two-day workshop on
organisms that cause Black Goo and related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now being recognized as a problem that previously was
attributed to other causes,'' said Lucie Morton, a Virginia vine
consultant who has been sounding the Black Goo alarm for several
years and just returned from the Italian conference.
</P>
<P>
   Nurseries often will replace vines that die after planting. But
that hardly covers the grower's full costs. Phylloxera-resistant
rootstock grafted to a varietal grape vine like Cabernet Sauvignon
or Chardonnay might cost about $3.25 each. For an acre planted with
1,000 vines, the total would be $3,250.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars per
acre to prepare the soil, put in drip irrigation and trellises and
care for the vines until they bear fruit in commercial quantities
after two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gubler of UC Davis notes that Phaeoacremonium and
Cylindrocarpon fungi have been around for more than 60 years and
are not a new problem, fighting the diseases has become a high
priority. UC has assigned two post-doctorate researchers to the
Vine Decline puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The American Vineyard Foundation, which represents grape
growers, also is taking action. It recently allocated $50,000 to
research the fungi associated with Black Goo, and a new survey of
members shows that vine decline has jumped to the top third of
grower concerns from the bottom third in the previous survey
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some big growers downplay the problem, perhaps because they are
more selective in accepting rootstock or they get preferential
treatment from nurseries. Kendall-Jackson, the big Santa Rosa grape
grower and winemaker, produces its own root stock and grafts.
Daniel Roberts, K-J's director of wine-growing research, said he
has seen Black Goo only in vines purchased from other nurseries
that were thin and weak to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Beckstoffer, who owns about 1,600 acres of North Coast
vineyards, said vine decline is popping up as a problem and
recommended carefully studying vines at nurseries before and after
they are grafted and prior to delivery. He also tests soil quality
by sending seven-foot core samples of earth from new vineyards for
lab analysis before planting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a bib overall and high-buckle boot business,''
said Beckstoffer. ``It's highly technical, and we have Ph.D.s
running it.''

CUTS DON`T FLY WITH TRAVEL AGENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Rhonda Maroney, a travel agent for 16 years, says
five of the world's largest airlines are ``crazy'' for recently
deciding to slash commissions by 3 percent on tickets booked
through agents.
</P>
<P>
   Maroney, the owner of Help Me Rhonda Travel in Chatsworth, said
the cut from 8 percent to 5 percent will force her to begin
charging an added fee for each ticket sold to replace the lost
income.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can live on 8 percent, but not 5 percent or lower,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Help Me Rhonda Travel and thousands of travel agencies
nationwide will now have to figure out how to make money other
ways, either through more fees tacked onto their bills, mergers
with larger agencies, or -- barring that -- going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The commission cuts announced late Monday by Northwest Airlines,
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Delta Air Lines follow similar cuts
announced last week by United Airlines and American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say it will save them millions of dollars annually,
presumably savings that will be passed along to customers
eventually. But travel agents say the airlines are being greedy,
and that the cuts eventually could lead to higher fares since
customers won't have agents shopping for the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision isn't about the consumer,'' said James Ashurst,
a spokesman with American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria,
Va. ``This is about the billions of dollars the airlines will make
because consumers will pay too much for airline tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   By cutting commissions, ``the airlines want to push, especially
the small travel agent out of businesss,'' said Susan Dushane, an
agent with Travel by Greta in susburban Northridge and president of
the Southern California Chapter of the American Society of Travel
Agents.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Northwest Airlines said tickets purchased by
travel agents in the United States for travel to and from any U.S.
destination will earn a 5 percent base commission rate with a
maximum payment of $50 for each round-trip ticket and $25 for each
one-way trip.
</P>
<P>
   International trips will earn agents a 5 percent base commission
rate with a maximum payment of $100 for each round-trip ticket or
$50 for each one-way trip, the Minneapolis-based airline said.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines estimates a 3 percent cut in commission will
save the company about $150 million a year in commission costs, the
airline said in a statement. The company refused to say if the
savings in commissions would be passed along to its customers in
the form of lower ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Price, an agent with World Corporate Travel, said the
change in commission rates will dramatically cut into the company's
profits. At 8 percent, the agency would make $32 on a $400 ticket;
now, with the new rate structure, the agency receives $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent of our profit is cut, but our overhead including
rent and salaries isn't,'' said Price.
</P>
<P>
   To save their businesses, agents have started to institute added
fees for writing or rewriting tickets, booking hotels or rental
cars and processing refunds.
</P>
<P>
   To help offset the loss of revenue from airline tickets, many
travel agencies are looking to corporations for business. Groups
and corporations will always need travel agents to help them book
their company weekends, said Price.
</P>
<P>
   Another lucrative market is the cruise industry, where
commissions remain 15 percent. Unlike the airline industry, agents
are able to negotiate contracts with cruise lines that result in a
higher commission for agents, added Maroney.

CSUN'S AMERSON FALLS TO SECOND STRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A shoulder injury cost Aaron Arnold at least two
games. Lackluster effort cost Drew Amerson his starting job.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal State Northridge coaches, after seeing Amerson drop too
many passes in Saturday's 48-27 loss at Montana, dropped him to
second string Tuesday and promoted Ryan Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   Amerson is second on the team in receptions, with 31, and
receiving yards, 420.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew didn't show up to play,'' CSUN interim head coach Jeff
Kearin said. ``He needs to understand that. Ryan Beckwith has
practiced hard all year. I've got no problems starting Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith has just five catches for 61 yards and one touchdown
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin also is confident with freshman Joe Gilliam taking
Arnold's place in the lineup. Arnold, who is out of this week's
game against Sacramento State with an injured right shoulder, leads
the Matadors with 38 catches.
</P>
<P>
   As with Beckwith, Gilliam doesn't have a lot of game experience.
He has seven catches for 71 yards and scored his first collegiate
touchdown against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gilliam) has done everything right at practice,'' Kearin
said. ``He reminds you of an Aaron Arnold as a freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, replacing Arnold is going to be tough for CSUN, which is
2-3 and 1-2 in the Big Sky. Arnold is CSUN's leader in all-purpose
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to replace 150 yards of offense,'' Kearin said.
``There's a whole package of stuff that we haven't used.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in there: Senior cornerback Mel Miller, who didn't start
the past two games, is back in the lineup, replacing Karalus Doyle.
Doyle has a team-high three interceptions but Miller in considered
the Matadors' best man-to-man defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking: Jaumal Bradley is still losing weight and wasn't able
to participate in all his drills in Tuesday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a senior tailback who leads the Matadors with 314
yards, is down to 193 pounds; is normal playing weight is 215.
Bradley was knocked out of two games with tonsillitis and a viral
infection.

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS TO OFFER AOL HOOKUP
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Universal Studios, targeting vacationers who
can't do without e-mail, has announced an extensive cross-marketing
deal with America Online to install AOL kiosks at its theme park in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give Universal a high-profile presence on AOL, the
world's leading online service with 18 million members. Should the
computer terminals prove popular, more AOL kiosks could be
installed at Universal Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is becoming an integral part of people's lives, so we're
betting that they're not going to be able to resist using the
kiosks when they're on vacation,'' said AOL spokeswoman Kathie
Lentz on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Universal recently launched a test program of five kiosks with
terminals at its four-month-old Islands of Adventure theme park in
Orlando, Fla. The terminals are designed to give existing AOL
customers a simple way to receive and send electronic mail, along
with giving potential customers a chance to browse through AOL's
services.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals will also have direct links to
universalstudios.com and uescape.com, which offer information about
its theme parks and travel packages. The deal also calls for AOL to
include a direct keyword link to Universal's sites and provide
cross-promotion of Universal at all of AOL's services, including
CompuServe, Digital City and Netscape Netcenter.

BROWNBACK TAKES HARD STANCE AGAINST SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- CONTRIBUTION BAN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking ranks with most of his Senate Republican
colleagues, Sam Brownback of Kansas said Tuesday he supported a
bill to ban unlimited, so-called ``soft money'' contributions to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said the bill championed by Republican Sen. John
McCain of Arizona and Democrat Russ Feingold of Wisconsin was
necessary to keep big money from influencing elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken frequently in the state during campaign
appearances about the need to do something about soft money,''
Brownback told reporters. ``That's what this bill is about. This is
the best chance we have to more forward.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold have long criticized laws that allow
corporations or individuals to give unlimited amounts of money to
political parties, which in turn can use it to support candidates
who otherwise cannot take more than $1,000 from any one source.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions to political parties are called soft money, while
donations directly to candidates are termed ``hard money.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft money ``holds the potential for the appearance of or the
actual abuse on both sides of the political aisle,'' Brownback
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year and again a month ago the House passed a ban on soft
money. It died in a Senate filibuster a year ago and needs 60 votes
to overcome a potential filibuster this year.
</P>
<P>
   With Brownback's endorsement, eight Senate Republicans, all more
moderate than the Kansan, now support some form of the
McCain-Feingold bill. Assuming all 45 Senate Democrats backed the
bill, it would still fall short of breaking a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said he was unsure whether more Republicans would
follow his lead. ``I'm hearing a number of others who are looking
at it,'' he said. ``I don't have any vote totals on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain welcomed Brownback's backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important,'' McCain said. ``Sam is a leader here in
the Senate, and he represents the heartland of America. It's a very
significant move on his part and, I might add, a courageous one.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback also spoke well of McCain, saying he has ``sterling
character.'' But Brownback said he was not yet endorsing McCain or
any other Republican candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Brownback opposed the McCain-Feingold bill, largely
because it would have placed limits on when independent groups and
organizations could run issue ads that would indirectly benefit or
hurt a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said regulating those ads would restrict free speech.
McCain and Feingold removed that provision from the bill. If it is
resurrected, Brownback will oppose it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groups that seek to advertise a point of view should not and I
believe cannot constitutionally be limited from their participation
in the political system,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback came under some political fire in his 1996 Senate race
for getting political help from Triad Management Services. The GOP
consulting firm spent $1 million on Kansas issue ads, including
$410,000 in advertising that criticized Brownback's opponent,
Democrat Jill Docking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition Triad had been linked to donations totaling $37,500
from Brownback's in-laws _ Topeka media millionaires John and Ruth
Stauffer _ to eight political action committees that then donated a
total of $36,000 to Brownback's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said Tuesday that his support for the soft-money ban
was in ``no way'' an effort to make amends. In fact, the Triad fund
raising and spending would not be prohibited under the revised
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kansas Democrats generally applauded Brownback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific,'' Docking said. ``I know he's not
always been consistent on the issue of campaign finance. When he
originally started in Congress he wanted to be defined as a
reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Paul Feleciano, a Wichita Democrat who lost to
Brownback last year, also cheered the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken some giant steps forward in the right direction,''
he said. ``The people of this country want true reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice chairwoman of the Kansas Democratic Party remained
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done this switcheroo before,'' Micheline Burger said.
``If he's sincere, I'd say that's great. I'm glad he's on board.
It's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, state Sen. Karin Brownlee of Olathe, said she
still had questions about the constitutionality of the
McCain-Feingold law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit surprised and hope he's heard from the people
of Kansas that this is what they support,'' Brownlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback contended that he had supported limits on soft money
since 1996 as long as issue ads were not affected. He said he would
be more comfortable with limits because a ban may be struck down as
unconstitutional. But he will support the outright ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think this is the best chance we have of dealing with
the soft money issue,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans besides Brownback who have come out for some
form of the McCain-Feingold bill are Susan Collins and Olympia
Snowe of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Jim Jeffords of
Vermont, Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a bill broader than the McCain-Feingold legislation
passed the Republican-controlled House on a 252-177 margin.

KANSAS EDUCATION OFFICIAL TO REVISE SCIENCE STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
 STANDARDS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas' new science standards are in Andy Tompkins' lap now.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education on Tuesday directed Tompkins, the
education commissioner, to revise parts of the new standards that
were taken directly from national science organizations' documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just get it done,'' said board member Scott Hill of Abilene,
one of the board's three members who removed the emphasis on
evolution from an earlier version of the standards written by a
committee of science teachers and professors.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are guidelines for what Kansas students should
know and be tested on. They omit much of evolution, including the
theory that living creatures share common ancestors and have
changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins said after the board's two-day meeting at De Soto High
School that he intended to ask his staff to reword the more than
100 passages taken from the national documents. He will ask a
copyright attorney to review the changes, he said, and the
standards probably will not go back to the board until December.
</P>
<P>
   The rewrite is necessary because three national science
organizations, citing the Kansas school board's August vote to
downplay evolution, last month refused the state's request to use
the copyright material.
</P>
<P>
   The three organizations _ the National Research Council, the
National Science Teachers Association and the American Association
for the Advancement of Science _ said the Kansas standards did not
``embrace the vision and content'' of the groups' national
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairwoman Linda Holloway said at a break in the meeting
that she was eager for the board to get past this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get the standards out to districts,'' Holloway
said.
</P>
<P>
   State science tests to be given in spring 2001 will be based on
the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hill's motion to give the rewrite to Tompkins passed
7-3, with moderates Janet Waugh, Val DeFever and Sonny Rundell
voting against it. A related motion that Waugh put forth failed by
the same margin.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh, of Kansas City, Kan., suggested that the board avoid a
rewrite by accepting the earlier standards written by a 27-member
committee of science teachers and professors. The board could then
add a statement saying that local districts could decide whether to
teach evolution, and the state still could leave evolution off its
tests, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh, one of four moderates who voted in August against
downplaying evolution, said she was concerned with the costs
associated with yet another rewrite. In light of Gov. Bill Graves'
recommendation to trim about $22 million from state education
money, Waugh said spending more would not be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real problem with wasting taxpayers' dollars,'' Waugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Biles, the board's attorney, told the board he estimated
that hiring a copyright attorney would cost about $3,000. The most
difficult part of the job _ comparing the national documents with
the state standards _ has been completed, Biles said. The board has
paid Kansas City copyright attorney Richard Stitt almost $800 to
date, Biles said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Williamson of Olathe, a member of the science writing
committee, watched Tuesday as the board ceded the rewrite job to
Tompkins. In discussions Tompkins had said he might ask some
writing committee members to help with the revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said after the meeting that she wanted no part of the
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would support our commissioner, but I certainly cannot help
him with this task,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reaction to the science standards continues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week faculty at Southwestern College in Winfield, Kan.,
passed a resolution asking the state board to reconsider its
decision to downplay evolution. The school, which is affiliated
with the United Methodist Church, is among the first church-related
schools in the state to speak out on the issue.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Hours after Pakistan's prime minister fired
the powerful army chief on Tuesday afternoon, the army struck back
with a swift, apparently bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   Troops surrounded the prime minister's home, closed all the
major airports and shut down the state-run television and radio
stations for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:50 a.m. on Wednesday, the army chief, Gen. Pervaiz
Musharraf, addressing the nation on state television in a tone of
patriotic earnestness, said the military had ousted Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif and his government to stop any further politicization
or destabilization of the military. The general offered no
timetable for elections, nor did he say whether he would rule
personally or whether the army would install a caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
   He was apparently referring to Sharif's efforts to strengthen
his hold over the courts and the military, and to his success at
pushing through a constitutional amendment that had ended a
president's power to dismiss an elected prime minister _ a vestige
of military rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my advice,'' said the general, neatly attired in a
camouflage uniform and wire-rimmed glasses, ``they tried to
interfere with the armed forces, the last remaining viable
institution in which all of you take so much pride and look up to
at all times for stability, unity and integrity of our beloved
country.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, where generals have ruled for almost half its 52
years as an independent nation, Sharif's sudden, unexplained
decision to fire the army chief was risky and came only a year
after he had replaced another army chief who had sought a greater
role for the army in running the country.
</P>
<P>
   There was virtually no public protest against the coup and some
processions celebrated Sharif's demise, including one near
Parliament House in Islamabad. Sharif, whose party won a landslide
victory in February, 1997, had become increasingly unpopular in
recent months because of the country's deteriorating economy and
out-of-control sectarian violence, as well as Sharif's handling of
a crisis with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The military takeover is likely to have serious international
repercussions for economically troubled Pakistan, which is
desperately in need of assistance from international lenders. A
State Department spokesman said that if a coup was confirmed, the
United States would call for the earliest possible restoration of
democracy and would not carry on ``business as usual'' with
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India, too, voiced ``grave concern'' about the coup and placed
its military on high alert along the border it shares with
Pakistan. The deepening political crisis in Pakistan raises new
questions about the prospects for restarting peace talks between
Pakistan and India. These two new nuclear powers, bitter
antagonists who have fought three wars, edged close to a fourth
conflict this summer over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Sharif and the military had soured over his
handling of that conflict with India. India fought intensely for
over two months this summer to drive out infiltrators who had
crossed from Pakistan to occupy Indian-held portions of Kashmir,
the Himalayan territory both Pakistan and India want for their own.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with President Clinton in July, Sharif had called
for the withdrawal of forces that Western analysts now believe were
mainly Pakistani soldiers. Army leaders, including Musharraf saw
the withdrawal as a capitulation to American pressure, the
surrender of a rare military victory over India and a humiliation
of the army, according to analysts and reports in the Pakistani
press.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing of the coup was curious. Only two weeks ago,
apparently attempting to quash rumors about a clash between the
country's civilian and military leaders, Sharif had publicly stated
that the army chief would complete his tenure. It was not clear
whether something had happened since than that inspired Sharif's
abrupt decision to fire the general while the army chief was in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The drama began to unfold just a few hours after the state news
service reported at about 5 p.m. Tuesday that Musharraf was being
immediately retired.
</P>
<P>
   Troops began moving through Islamabad. They seized the Cabinet
building and climbed over the fence around the television station.
All flights were canceled as the troops took over the major
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said in his speech that as he tried to return to
Pakistan from Sri Lanka, his commercial flight, short of fuel, was
ordered to land outside of Pakistan, endangering the lives of all
the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks be to Allah, this evil design was thwarted through
speedy army action,'' said the general, whose flight landed in
Karachi.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's home was cordoned off and the road to it blocked. He
was reported to be inside. There were also reports that the
information minister, Mushahid Hussain; the foreign minister,
Sartaj Aziz, and the Kashmir affairs minister, Majid Malik, were
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As accounts of the army's takeover of government buildings began
to come in from witnesses, there was confusion about exactly what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to government and army spokesmen in Islamabad
rang unanswered. The television station went dark soon after
announcing that the prime minister had fired the general.
</P>
<P>
   The first official confirmation that the army had taken action
against the government came at 10:15 p.m., when the state
television came back to life and a news reader announced that
Sharif had been dismissed. After midnight, the state television
announced that all banks would be closed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, at almost 3 a.m., the general laid out the
reasons for the coup.
</P>
<P>
   He said the country was in a state of ``turmoil and
uncertainty,'' and the economy in a state of collapse. He accused
Sharif's government of systematically destroying the institutions
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces had taken over as a last resort to restore
stability, he said, and he pleaded with the public to continue to
be calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have done so with all sincerity, loyalty and selfless
devotion to the country,'' he said. ``And the armed forces are
firmly behind me.''

CON ED IS SAID TO BE BUYING NORTHEAST UTILITIES FOR $3.29 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Complete writethru to lengthen and revise)  
(Eds: This story was added to the New York Times front page) 
(ATTN: N.Y., Conn., Northeast points) (bl) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consolidated Edison Inc. on Tuesday night agreed to
buy Northeast Utilities for $3.29 billion in cash and stock,
according to people close to the talks, in a deal that could
eventually bring less-expensive power to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will give Con Edison access to lower-cost
electricity, is the company's biggest move so far to protect its
base of 3 million customers, who are being courted by outside
companies to buy power at lower rates as New York deregulates its
utility market. Con Edison will raise its customer base to 4.7
million and extend its reach as far north as New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also a bid by Con Edison Eto become more competitive
in the fast-paced environment of deregulation, which allows
customers to choose their provider of electricity. Northeast, the
largest utility in New England in terms of customers, has been
aggressively preparing for the new era in Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, which are in various stages of
deregulation. Though Northeast had to spin off its power-generating
plants as part of the deregulation, it has bought plants and built
up a source of cheap power, which Con Edison could sell to its
customers, possibly lowering their rates eventually. Northeast has
also built an organization to market that power throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of the perceived value of nuclear power plants,
the deal values Northeast at a higher price if it sells two units
of its Millstone nuclear plant in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Bryk, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said the transaction could be positive for consumers and
environmentalists because it could result in a fresh evaluation of
the Millstone nuclear complex independent of Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation has thus far moved slowly for residential customers
because the companies that want to market power have not been able
to make much money in the early stages, but competition is expected
to become more fierce with time.
</P>
<P>
   Most residential customers have benefited through rate cuts. For
example, Con Edison agreed to cut its rates 10 percent under its
agreement to deregulate in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As more Con Edison customers are made available to outsiders to
sell them power, consumers will be able to choose from more
alternate suppliers that should offer further cuts in the cost of
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions will not be large, however. The cost of power in
an average residential bill _ about $50 a month _ is only a part of
the total bill, with most charges actually covering the cost of
delivery of the power; those charges will remain regulated. New
Yorkers, however, can expect an aggressive marketing pitch from the
subsidiaries of the merged utility, which are competing with other
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, which the boards of both companies
approved Tuesday, Con Edison, based in Manhattan, will pay $25 a
share in cash and stock for the outstanding shares of Northeast,
based in Berlin, Conn. Another $1 a share will be paid if units 2
and 3 of Millstone are sold.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Millstone has had one of the nation's most troubled histories
for a nuclear plant. Unit 1 of Millstone is to be retired and
decommissioned. The other two units have cost Northeast dearly,
with huge expenses for maintenance and the cost of buying power
when they were not operating. In 1997 and 1998, the utility had
large losses because of its troubles and suspended its dividend for
four years.
</P>
<P>
   The two operating nuclear units have been put up for sale but
are expected to bring low offers. Some analysts said that should
mean that Northeast will sell them at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the sale of the plants is important to Con Edison, which
analysts said did not want to acquire more nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Con Edison is buying a company that is emerging from its
troubles and was planning to reinstate its dividend in December.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northeast Utilities rose 12.5 cents Tuesday, to
$21.25, while Con Edison fell 75 cents, to $36.4375. Based on
Northeast's closing price, the deal represents a 17.6 percent
premium.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the deal said the two utilities expected
savings of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in the next 10 years.
Whether there will be layoffs has yet to be determined, the people
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McGrath, the chairman and chief executive of Con Edison,
will hold those positions in the merged company, while Michael
Morris, the chairman, president and chief executive of Northeast,
will become president, according to people close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath did not have an easy time reaching the agreement. Since
word leaked out last week that talks with Northeast were under way,
Con Edison's stock has been pummeled on concern that a merger with
Northeast would depress Con Edison's strong earnings. Northeast has
had large losses in recent years and had to suspend its dividend
four years ago because of financial pressures caused by problems
with its nuclear plants. But Northeast has put a lot of its
troubles behind it and has seen its earnings recover.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to acquire Northeast is the second step to expand
Con Edison's reach.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Con Edison acquired Orange &AMP; Rockland Utilities for
$1.5 billion, adding to its customer base and expanding its reach
northward. The agreement to buy Northeast, however, puts McGrath
and his company on a national stage to compete with other major
utilities. Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric of California, for example, is
building up its presence in New England by buying up power plants
and setting up a marketing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Under Morris, Northeast has also moved quickly and aggressively
to prepare iself for deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of access to customer throughout the
Northeast,'' said Robert Rubin, a utility analyst with Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Of Con Edison's strategy, he said: ``This no surprise. They are
not doing anything crazy.'' &QL;

LAWMAKERS EXPLORE HANDLING OF SEIZED DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
 MONEY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLON  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Armed with a new state auditor's report, a
legislative committee Tuesday looked for ways to get police in
Missouri to follow state laws when seizing drug money.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearing at Harris-Stowe State College, the debate
sometimes became heated as legislators tried to determine whether
law enforcement had intentionally circumvented state laws in order
to keep the drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also asked Auditor Claire McCaskill about how police
were getting around the laws, which require police to report drug
money they seize to county prosecutors. Under the laws, state
courts then would determine how to distribute the money, normally
sending it to public education.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reported in January that in many cases,
police simply handed the money off to federal agencies, which kept
part and sent the rest, usually 80 percent, back to police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a substantial amount of money that is
loose,'' said Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat. ``We've
got to set up proper guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after a news conference Tuesday morning, McCaskill spoke
at the joint legislative committee hearing, which was attended by
about 50 politicians, educators and law enforcement officials.
Later she presented the audit in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   At the St. Louis hearing, co-chairman Wiggins said the committee
planned to present a report to the legislature based on findings
from research, hearings, the auditor's report and meetings with
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's report said police had been able to circumvent
state laws because of flaws in drug statutes, such as not defining
when money is actually seized.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases police have said that they are not violating state
law, because they are not really seizing property or money.
Instead, they have said that they are only detaining the person and
property until a federal agent can officially seize it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Klarich, a St. Louis County Republican, echoed other
legislators when he said he and his law partners did not understand
how police could come to such a legal conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill and legislators agreed that a seizure legally occurred
when an officer discovered cash or property while detaining someone
suspected of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got $700,000 in the backseat of a car stopped by the
Highway Patrol,'' McCaskill said. ``Does anybody think that (the
driver) can pick up the money and walk away with it? I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McCaskill said adding a simple definition to
Missouri law would stop police from handing off cash to federal
agents whom they had called.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would reduce the ability of the police to say, `I didn't
really seize it _ I waited for (a federal agent) to get there, and
they seized it,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators wanted to know whether police were sending the money
to federal agencies so they could intentionally avoid the state
requirement to send money to education.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said that, no, she believed police were only trying to
take the money away from the ``bad guys'' the best way that they
could.
</P>
<P>
   At that explanation, Republican Sen. Larry Rohrbach, became
indignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone knows they can get $700,000, they know that would
be a significant thing,'' Rohrbach said. ``You know that would be a
significant thing. I know that would be a significant thing.
Everybody knows that would be a significant thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A debate Tuesday over a felony-conviction requirement in
Missouri law probably reflected a debate to come in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri law requires that if someone with property is charged
with a drug crime, they must be convicted of a felony before
property can be confiscated. McCaskill suggested that the law
should have some exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Both Klarich and Rohrbach raised concerns, saying the felony
requirement protected people's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill pointed out that the federal law did not require a
felony conviction. In fact, under federal law, a person must prove
that the property was not involved in a crime _ as opposed to state
law, which requires the state to prove the property was involved in
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill said that unless the federal and the state laws
mirrored each other, the forfeiture issue would never be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fix the discrepancies between the two laws while
protecting due process as much as possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Police Chief Ronald Henderson and his officers also
testified, explaining how they conducted forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said that he was being forced to cut his budget this
year by several million dollars and was decreasing the number of
officers by 200 through attrition. He pointed out that although
forfeiture money could not be used for salaries, it was important
to buy needed equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He told the legislators that his department had paid $1.9
million to schools since 1989. When he was asked, however, he could
not say how much his department had been receiving back from
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In three years from 1996 to 1998, his department received $3.5
million, according to the auditor's report.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Simon, president of the Kansas City Board of Police
Commissioners, and police officials declined to comment, saying
they had not seen the report.

HIGH COURT IS URGED TO UPHOLD `CITIZEN SUIT' TO CURB POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.C., Va., N.Y., Conn.)   (af)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Congress passed the Clean Water Act 27 years
ago, it included a ``citizen suit'' provision authorizing private
individuals to sue polluters and collect fines that would go not to
the successful plaintiffs but directly to the federal Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of growing judicial hostility to such suits, a case
argued before the Supreme Court Tuesday could determine whether
that provision, and similar clauses in other federal environmental
laws, would continue to be of much use.
</P>
<P>
   The case, an appeal by Friends of the Earth and other
environmental groups from a ruling that dismissed their suit
against the operator of a hazardous waste incinerator on a river in
South Carolina, has galvanized the environmental movement as have
few Supreme Court cases in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong argument was highly technical, laced with
references to Supreme Court precedents on jurisdictional issues
like standing and mootness, but the policy debate at the heart of
the case peeked through.
</P>
<P>
   ``What cases do you know,'' Justice Antonin Scalia asked the
environmental groups' lawyer, Bruce J. Terris, that consider it ``a
proper function of the courts to impose a public penalty in private
litigation?''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, perhaps the judiciary's strongest critic of citizen suit
provisions, said such suits usurped the ordinary function of the
executive branch and brought about ``a major alteration of power
between the various branches of government and between the federal
and state governments.''
</P>
<P>
   When Terris replied that in the view of Congress, citizen suits
were not really private lawsuits but served to ``carry out a public
function,'' Scalia cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that Congress has said it,'' he said. ``The
question is whether it's constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   No other members of the court appeared eager to take up Scalia's
effort to turn a discussion on the meaning of a federal statute
into a major constitutional debate over the separation of powers.
Nonetheless, the exchange was a reminder that although the
environmental groups were relieved last spring when the justices
agreed to hear their appeal of what they considered a very damaging
lower court ruling, that relief could prove to be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, which itself has restricted citizen suits in
several recent rulings, could use this case, Friends of the Earth
vs. Laidlaw Environmental Services, No. 98-822, to restrict such
suits further.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , in Richmond, made new
law in this case in two respects. First, it ruled that the suit had
to be dismissed as moot because, although the incinerator was still
discharging excess levels of mercury into the North Tyger River
when the suit was filed, in 1992, the operator acquired new
anti-pollution equipment and stopped the discharges soon
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the appellate court said, since the plaintiffs had not
``prevailed'' in their litigation, they were not entitled to
reimbursement of their lawyers' fees and court costs. The fourth
circuit thus became the only appellate court to reject what has
become known as the catalyst theory, under which environmental and
civil rights plaintiffs who can show that their lawsuit brought
about a change in the defendant's behavior can recover their fees
and costs even if the lawsuit did not result in an official court
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Both aspects of the fourth circuit's ruling are before the
Supreme Court. The plaintiffs are arguing that if a defendant can
avoid all liability by modifying its behavior once a suit is filed,
citizen suits will become economically impractical.
</P>
<P>
   A separate question the court may need to address is whether the
closing of the plant in May, two months after the justices agreed
to hear the case, means there is no longer a live issue for them to
resolve and, if so, whether the fourth circuit decision should
remain on the books.
</P>
<P>
   New York, Connecticut and 12 other states entered the case on
the side of the environmental groups, arguing in a brief that
citizen suits fill gaps in enforcement and ``help states focus
their regulatory aims.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also supports the plaintiffs. Jeffrey
P. Minear, an assistant solicitor general, told the court Tuesday
that the fines imposed in these suits are valuable deterrents
against continued violations.
</P>
<P>
   Donald A. Cockrill, arguing Tuesday for the company, now known
as the Safety-Kleen Corp. and based in Columbia, S.C., said the
$405,000 in penalties the federal district court imposed on his
client ``had no deterrent effect.'' He said that while ``deterrence
to me implies that someone doesn't want to do what's right and you
have to goad them into it,'' the company was already close to
compliance by the time the suit was filed.

BASKETBALL STAR WILT CHAMBERLAIN DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BLAIR KERKHOFF  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Basketball star Wilt Chamberlain, perhaps the most dominant
player of his day, died Tuesday at 63 at his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain played for three years at the University of Kansas,
two on the varsity team, before embarking on a record-setting
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired in 1973 after 14 NBA seasons, he was the game's
career scoring leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shocker for everyone who knew him,'' said Jerry Waugh,
an assistant coach for the Kansas teams that included Chamberlain.
``We thought of him as invincible, a big, strong man who always
took care of himself. This is a very sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers defined Chamberlain's career and life. He was the game's
first 7-foot center with agility, who came along at a time when
organized basketball was mostly segregated.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only player in NBA history to score 100 points in a
game, setting the famous record on March 2, 1962, when his
Philadelphia Warriors defeated the New York Knicks 169-147.
</P>
<P>
   That year Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points. Nobody else in NBA
history averaged as many as 40 points in a season. He won the
scoring title seven straight seasons, beginning with his NBA most
valuable player and rookie of the year season in 1959-60. Only
Michael Jordan has won as many consecutive scoring titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of
the NBA,'' said Red Auerbach, former Boston Celtics coach.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain scored 31,419 points in his career. He held the NBA
record for 55 rebounds in a game. Remarkably, he never fouled out
in 1,205 regular-season or playoff games. He even led the league
once in assists.
</P>
<P>
   After taking Overbrook High School of Philadelphia to three
public-schools championships, titles eluded Chamberlain until later
in his career. His first NBA title came with the Philadelphia 76ers
in 1967. His only other title came with the 1972 Los Angeles
Lakers, a team that won 33 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see
another one like him,'' said former NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big
Dipper.'' At Kansas friends shortened it to ``Dippy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kansas, Chamberlain changed the rules because of his
extraordinary size and power. No longer could players leave the
free-throw line immediately after releasing the ball. Chamberlain
could essentially bank a missed free throw to himself. He was also
responsible for the rule that prohibits offensive goaltending.
Before Chamberlain, it was legal to guide a teammate's shot into
the basket.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA widened the lane to keep Chamberlain farther away from
the basket when rebounding free throws.
</P>
<P>
   His Kansas years were an emotional roller coaster. He selected
the Jayhawks over some 200 other schools. The program was widely
accused of cheating, but NCAA investigators found nothing improper
about the recruiting process. Kansas later received two years of
probation for providing tires for Chamberlain's cars.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's arrival was eventful before he ever got to
Lawrence. He was refused service at a Kansas City restaurant
because he was black. It was not the last time he faced racial
prejudice in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a remarkable guy, as he came at a time when he
couldn't be an ordinary student, or an ordinary person,'' Waugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   He showed his prowess in other sports by winning the high jump
at the Kansas Relays the first time he attempted the event.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, college basketball had never seen anything like
him. As a first-year player when freshman could not play on the
varsity, Chamberlain scored 42 points in leading his team to
victory over the Jayhawk regulars, playing before a packed house.
</P>
<P>
   In his varsity debut, Chamberlain exceeded everybody's wildest
dreams by scoring 52 points and grabbing 31 rebounds in a victory
over Northwestern. The scoring output remains a school record, and
only a 36-rebound effort the next season against Iowa State topped
Chamberlain's debut.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain led the Jayhawks to the NCAA championship game as a
sophomore, but the Jayhawks fell to North Carolina in triple
overtime in one of college basketball's most-storied games.
Chamberlain called it the toughest loss of his career, and it
turned out to be his last tournament loss as a college player.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Kansas for a jersey retirement ceremony in
1998, Chamberlain apologized to the crowd for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago I lost a heartbreaking battle, losing to North
Carolina by one point in triple overtime,'' Chamberlain said. ``It
was a devastating thing for me, because I felt like I let the
university down. I let KU down.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas did not reach the tournament in Chamberlain's junior
year. Tired of defenses ganging up in him, Chamberlain decided to
leave Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Rules at the time prohibited underclassmen from jumping to the
NBA before their class graduated. So Chamberlain played a year with
the Harlem Globetrotters. A year later he signed with the
Philadelphia Warriors. He also played with the franchise when it
transferred to San Francisco. Later he was traded to the 76ers and
then to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain continued to make news after his playing days ended.
He briefly served as a coach for the San Diego Conquistadors of the
American Basketball Association, but his attention turned to other
sports and activities and even controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He played competitive volleyball, racquetball and tennis. He
appeared in a few commercials and movies. But perhaps Chamberlain
became best known for his claim in an autobiography that he slept
with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women I have been most attracted to, the most in love
with, I've pushed away the strongest,'' Chamberlain said in a 1991
interview with the Associated Press. ``There are about five women I
can think of that I could have married. I cared for them a lot, but
not enough to make a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how former friends chose to remember Chamberlain. Al
Correll grew up four blocks from Chamberlain and was three years
younger than his hero. Because of Chamberlain, Correll attended
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1962, I was going back to KU, and I went over to his house
to say goodbye,'' Correll said. ``He asked me if I needed anything,
and I told him I was broke as most college kids are. He said,
`Here's $50.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be another Wilt Chamberlain. We hear
that kind of thing quite a bit, but he did some things that nobody
will ever do again. Nobody will ever score 100 points again; that
will just never be done.''

 &HT;    Maddux silences Mets 4-2 in NLCS opener
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The talking was supposed to finally stop at 8:16 p.m.
Tuesday at Turner Field, but Game 1 of the National League
Championship Series played out like an ongoing argument between the
Mets and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   For every statement the Mets tried to make, the Braves had an
answer, and maybe that's exactly as it should have been in the
reunion of the first NLCS in 1969 between these two.
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case for the better part of the 1999 season,
the Braves got the last word and took Game 1 with a 4-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have beaten the Mets 10 times out of 13 this season,
and 14 of the last 15 games against them at Turner Field. Ever
since the Braves lost Game 1 of the 1991 NLCS to the Pirates and
won the series, the winner of Game 1 has gone on to win each of the
last six NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Mets fans: It wasn't Chipper Jones doing the
``talking.'' It was the soft-spoken Gerald Williams, who had two
hits and drove in the go-ahead run, and the non-controversial Eddie
Perez, who homered to left field for the first breathing room of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux quieted the Mets offense with seven effective
innings, allowing five hits and one run, walking one and striking
out two.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves jumped ahead 1-0 on back-to-back hits to start the
game, then Masato Yoshii retired the meat of the Braves order. The
Braves went ahead 2-1 on a Williams single to left in the fifth
inning. They were headed for more but Roger Cedeno made a
spectacular catch in right field, fully extending to snare a Bret
Boone liner that would have meant at least another run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' heralded infield booted a ball to allow Ryan Klesko to
reach first in the sixth, but came back with a beauty of a double
play on Edgardo Alfonzo's flip to Rey Ordonez for the bare-handed
heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Perez took a 2-1 Pat Mahomes pitch and deposited it in the
left-field bleachers for his first home run of this postseason and
a 3-1 lead. Walt Weiss' RBI single in the eighth made it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had kept Chipper Jones in check by pitching around him
and didn't let Brian Jordan hurt them either. They had finally got
one of their .300 hitters in a groove against a Braves pitcher.
Edgardo Alfonzo, who'd hit .159 off Braves pitching during the
regular season, doubled twice off Maddux and scored a run on a
broken-bat Mike Piazza grounder to tie the score 1-1.

BLACK CLERGY CHASTISE BOND FOR HIS VOTE ON JUDGE'S NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
 CHASTISE SEN. BOND-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for support for his re-election run a year ago, Sen. Kit
Bond of Missouri met over lunch with a group of black clergy in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters traditionally back Democrats, but many were unhappy
with Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon over his role in school
desegregation cases. And the Republican Bond had allies in the
black community because of his support for urban issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among the topics discussed was the languishing nomination to the
federal bench of Judge Ronnie White, the first black person to
serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. It was one of the group's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides differ in their recollection of that talk. Bond said
he pledged only to support White through the nominating process,
not necessarily when it reached the floor of the Senate. His
audience said he offered no qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout in light of the pivotal role Bond played last week
in the Senate's rejection of White could have a far-reaching effect
on his political relationship with black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' said former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel
Cleaver, a Democrat who has been a close political ally of Bond.
``My spirit has been dampened considerably by the killing of Ronnie
White's nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. W. Bartalette Finney Sr., a presiding elder of the
African Methodist Episcopal Church in western Missouri, Was harsher
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dead in the African-American community,'' said Finney,
who has worked with Bond for several years and helped him make
inroads into the black community during his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bond won a third term last fall, and key to his victory was
capturing 33 percent of the state's black vote. That is a
significant accomplishment for most Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been weathering criticism in the last week from
former supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously know a lot of my friends are going to be
disappointed,'' Bond said Tuesday. ``On something like this, when
you have good friends on both sides, it's a very, very tough
decision. I have worked through my career to promote qualified
African-Americans and will continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   White's defeat on a party-line vote in the Senate also could
have political implications for Bond's Missouri colleague,
Republican Sen. John Ashcroft, who orchestrated the opposition to
the judge. Ashcroft contended that White was not an unequivocal
supporter of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft faces a difficult re-election battle of his own next
year against Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver, minister at St. James United Methodist Church in Kansas
City, said he and other black clergy planned to meet this week to
begin developing an ``action plan'' in the aftermath of the White
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Said Finney: ``We're clergy persons. We've had prayer about
this. We've turned it over to God. But we're going to be a God
squad. That means anybody we can tell about this awful, terrible
experience, we're going to do it. Do not trust Christopher Bond on
any issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond called Finney ``a fine man,'' but said it was inappropriate
for Finney to question his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   The episode also touched off a heated debate over what role race
played in the vote. Democrats suggested it was a factor;
Republicans said the vote turned solely on White's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft has been using the crime issue _ and the death penalty,
in particular _ as a weapon in his campaign against Carnahan. He
offered statistics about the number of times that White voted to
reverse death sentences. But Democrats later pointed out the
numbers were not that much different from those of two judges
Ashcroft appointed to the state Supreme Court when he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bond had been supporting White but announced his opposition at
the Republicans' weekly lunch the day of the Senate vote. The
bottom then fell out of the nomination. Without backing from either
of Missouri's two senators, others who had previously endorsed
White withdrew their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are not surprised at Ashcroft,'' Cleaver said.
``People are extremely surprised'' about Bond.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bond probably turned against White as a political favor
for Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it had anything to do with anything other than
Ashcroft pleading with Kit Bond to support him on something he
needed,'' Cleaver said. ``He (Ashcroft) has the contest of his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said he based his vote on the case Ashcroft made about
White's record as a judge. He said White was ``just not
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said that when he met with the black clergy in St. Louis
last fall, he pledged only to get White's stalled nomination out of
committee and onto the Senate floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers remembered it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was put to him very succinctly: `Will you support the
nomination of Judge White?'' recalled the Rev. Sammie E. Jones,
president of the Missionary Baptist State Convention of Missouri.
``That was one of our primary concerns. His answer was, `Yes, I
will.' We put it to bed after that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate conservatives on Tuesday rejected a
compromise by the Republican and Democratic leaders to postpone
action on a treaty banning underground nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders said they would resume talks Wednesday to find
wording acceptable to all senators, since the approval of all 100
would be needed to postpone the vote. Short of that, there are
other parliamentary maneuvers available to the leaders that require
only a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Majority Leader Trent Lott said that if 100 votes
cannot be rounded up for postponement, he is willing to let the
treaty go to a vote. One way or another, top Senate aides said, the
issue was likely to be settled, with the only question being
whether the Senate soundly defeats the treaty or finds a
face-saving way to withdraw it. Both sides acknowledge that the
treaty lacks the two-thirds majority needed to pass.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The situation illustrates the tricky political position
confronting the Lott. He is juggling the demands of 55 diverse
Republicans, many of whom want to delay a treaty vote to avoid a
diplomatic embarrassment and others who want to kill the pact
regardless of the international repercussions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lott took a step toward averting a vote when he
signaled that he would accept assurances from Senate Democrats to
delay action on the treaty until President Clinton leaves office.
Republicans had insisted that Clinton make that pledge, but he has
refused, and there was no sign that he would have any change of
heart on this matter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can be guaranteed that it would be set aside and not
come up in this Congress, then we could accept that,'' Lott told
reporters after a spirited luncheon with other Senate Republicans.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After that, Democratic Minority Leader Thomas Daschle answered
Lott's call, saying in a letter that he would support Clinton's
request to postpone the vote and would agree not to reschedule the
treaty for a vote, absent ``unforeseen changes in the international
situation.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans balked, and Daschle changed the phrase to
``extraordinary circumstances,'' as defined by the two leaders.
Democrats insisted on that provision in the event that Pakistan or
India, for instance, resumed nuclear weapons tests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the wording still did not satisfy hard-liners like Sens. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz., and Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who complained that
Democrats would use the ``loophole'' to seize upon the slightest
global disturbance and wield the treaty as a campaign issue next
year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The objections killed a proposed deal that would have unfolded
on the Senate floor between Lott and Daschle that could have
defused the political and procedural brinkmanship that has engulfed
the treaty since Lott surprised Democrats two weeks ago by
answering their demand to bring it up and called for an early vote.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative deal, Lott proposed sending the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty back to the Foreign Relations
Committee for hearings for the rest of Clinton's presidency, as
long as Daschle agreed not to try to bring it to the floor. Daschle
was to have agreed, barring the ``extraordinary circumstances.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's setback for the treaty, a growing number of
Democrats and Republicans seemed eager to postpone the vote. Sens.
John Warner, R-Va., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., released a
letter Tuesday to their two leaders, endorsing efforts to delay
Senate action on the treaty until the next Congress convenes in
2001. About a dozen senators have signed the letter so far.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright telephoned half a dozen
moderate Republicans, urging them to consider the diplomatic
consequences of allowing the treaty to be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters have warned that a Senate defeat of the accord
would send a dangerous signal to emerging nuclear nations that it
was acceptable to continue testing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, amid reports of a military coup in Pakistan, Lott
scoffed at those concerns and said the unrest in Pakistan would not
have any bearing on the Senate's action.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it have any bearing on this debate?'' Lott said.
``What we're talking about in this treaty is the national security
of our own country. Nothing we do here will have any effect on the
government in Pakistan.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes maneuvering overshadowed the Senate's
second day of debate on the treaty itself. Critics and supporters
mostly read from prepared statements, speaking to a largely empty
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expressed astonishment that Republicans would insist
on voting on a pact that the President requested be withdrawn for
national security reasons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The opponents of the treaty have won, for now,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Why push for this vote if the president
of the United States has asked for delay because of his fears? This
isn't politics. This goes to the heart of our security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But critics argued that the pact would permanently bind the
ability of the United States to perform tests while rogue nations,
and perhaps even China and Russia, might conduct nuclear explosions
that would erode America's atomic deterrent. They have also said
the treaty could not be adequately verified.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The treaty is based on noble, idealistic goals, but it fails
the hard-reality test,'' said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky. ``The U.S.
usually lives up to the agreements it signs. But there is no
guarantee that other nations would follow the letter of the law.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To put the treaty into effect, ratification by 44 nations
believed to have a nuclear capacity is needed. Only 26 countries,
including Britain and France, have done so. China, which has not
ratified the pact and is taking its lead from the United States,
Tuesday urged the Senate to approve it.

 &HT;    Master Maddux handles mighty Mets
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Much to the Mets' chagrin, the Greg Maddux they faced
Tuesday night was nothing like the pitcher shelled two weeks ago in
Shea Stadium. This was the master, who moved back into the
postseason victory column with the Braves' 4-2 victory against New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, now 10-9 after 23 postseason starts and 4-6 in the NLCS,
gave up five hits and one run in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first post-season game since the division series
victory against the Cubs last year. Proving that his New York state
of mind works best in Georgia, he now has a 9-2 record against the
Mets in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who was 19-9 in the regular season, won his fourth game
of the year against the Mets. His only loss to New York was his
last outing on Sept. 29 in Shea Stadium, when he gave up 11 hits
and eight runs (seven earned) in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Maddux retired the first six batters before allowing
Roger Cedeno a double in the third. But after two ground balls,
Perez got Cedeno out on a botched squeeze play with pitcher Masato
Yoshii at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Edgardo Alfonzo doubled and John Olerud, who hit
the grand slam off Maddux in New York, got a single. Maddux had an
0-2 count on Mike Piazza and thought he struck him out on his next
pitch. But it was ruled a ball. Then Piazza hit a broken-bat
grounder to third to drive in Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had a 1-2-3 fifth, then Alfonzo doubled again in the
sixth. He got Olerud to fly out to center and Piazza to ground out
again. After a two-out single by Cedeno in the seventh, Rey Ordonez
hit a line drive straight back to Maddux, who caught it as he was
whirling away.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux got up to pitch in the eighth, but was immediately lifted
for Mike Remlinger when left-hander Matt Franco was announced as
the pinch-hitter. In a double switch, Brian Hunter came in at first
base to replace Howard Battle, who had never played first.
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitcher Kenny Rogers, who will start today, said that when
he tries to learn from good pitchers, ``I always refer to Maddux,''
he said. ``I'm sure everybody _ every big-leaguer or minor-leaguer
has watched him meticulously at times just to try to find out what
he does that makes him so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said that Maddux dominates with movement and location,
``and that's a sign for all the other pitchers that when you get to
a certain level you don't have to throw 95 or 100 (mph) to get
people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, who led the team in bunts this season with 13, had a
sacrifice bunt in the fifth to advance Walt Weiss to third. Weiss
later scored. Mets pitcher Masato Yoshii injured himself fielding
the ball, but stayed in the game.

 &HT;    Williams gets praise from Cox
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before Tuesday night's game, Braves manager Bobby Cox
was asked to rate this year's team among the eight he's taken to
the NLCS. He answered with a big compliment to leadoff hitter
Gerald Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And then Williams went out and made the skipper look like a
genius.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a hand in both of Atlanta's first two runs. He led
off the Braves' first with a single to center off New York starter
Masato Yoshii and scored on Brett Boone's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Williams singled home Walt Weiss, who had opened
the inning with a double and was sacrificed to third by pitcher
Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mets leadoff hitter Rickey Henderson did little to
help his team, going 0-3 his first three times at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' performance in the postseason is not a surprise to
Braves fans. He hit .281 with 14 home runs and 53 RBIs in 73 games
in the leadoff spot. He had a career-high 15-game hitting streak in
late July, early August that was the longest Braves streak of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 games through September-October, Williams is hitting .298
with five homers and 15 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He was 7-18 (.389) in the Division Series against Houston, with
a double, three RBIs, two runs scored and a stolen base. The Mets
should know Gerald Williams: He stole three bases against them July
3 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year's club is a very good base-running club,''
Cox said in a pre-game news conference. ``There's nothing I've done
to make them better baserunners; it's just the fact that we've run
the bases very well this year, stolen a few more bases.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the tribute to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got clutch performances from guys like Gerald Williams
all year long,'' Cox said. ``Once he got in the lineup and stayed
there, I left him in there. He's a much better player than just a
platoon type guy. We don't ever pinch-hit for him anymore. He's
gotten a lot of big hits.''

 &HT;    Mets offense shut down for most part in Game 1
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Mike Piazza doesn't break his bat in the fourth
inning, Chipper Jones not misplay a grounder in the ninth, there is
no guarantee that the Mets even score on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that New York didn't have many opportunities to score,
it's just that when it did, only once did the Mets get a break.
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Maddux breezed through six batters in the first two
innings, Roger Cedeno hit a double to left field and wound up on
third after Gerald Williams' throw missed cut-off man Bret Boone.
Just when it looked like the Mets would make something happen, they
fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez hit a ball that bounded high over his shoulder and
edged foul, but catcher Eddie Perez scooped it up and threw him out
at first. Then it got even uglier. Mets manager Bobby Valentine
called for a squeeze. It might have worked had Masato Yoshii made
contact on his bunt. Instead, Cedeno was tagged out between third
and home, and Yoshii ended the inning with a weak grounder to
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets threatened again in the fourth inning after an Edgardo
Alfonso double and a John Olerud single had runners on first and
third with one out. Mike Piazza's broken bat grounder surprised
Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, who bobbled the ball before
getting Piazza at first. Alfonso scored from third, but that was
all New York could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso doubled again in the sixth, but was he left stranded
when Olerud lined out to Andruw Jones and Piazza grounded out Walt
Weiss to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added their final run in the ninth, when Shawon Dunston
reached on Jones' error, moved to second on a wild pitch and scored
on Todd Pratt's single to left.
</P>
<P>
   The final threat ended when Ordonez grounded out to Jones.

 &HT;    Perez puts it on the line
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Usually, the sight of a grown man running home like a
scared child doesn't insight a standing ovation. But Tuesday night,
it was well deserved for Braves catcher Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had just laid down a sacrifice bunt for Andruw Jones and
to ensure that Jones made it to second, he made a U-turn to make
Mets pitcher Turk Wendell tag him. Fans at the Ted rose to their
feet and began to chant, ``Eddie! Eddie!''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was for that play. But more than anything, it was for
his overall performance in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series.
Perez came through with the play of the game with his glove and
helped pad Greg Maddux's lead with a bases-empty home run in the
sixth. And he called a pretty good game, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Perez crushed a Mets rally by showing some
speed despite his bad knees. With Roger Cedeno on third base with
nobody out, Perez snagged a ball that nearly went foul off the bat
of Rey Ordonez, then he threw out Ordonez. And after Masato Yoshii
failed to meet his end of a squeeze, he chased Cedeno and tagged
him out.
</P>
<P>
   After Edgardo Alfonso and Rey Ordonez turned a breathtaking
double-play, it looked as though New York would enter the seventh
inning down just one run. But Perez changed all that, bursting the
Mets bubble again, when he turned on a 2-1 fastball and sent it
deep into the left-field bleachers. And for the first time, Tuesday
evening, Braves fans expressed their love with chants of ``Eddie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez still would've have been in position to be a NLCS
Game 1 hero, the season-ending knee injury to Javy Lopez
notwithstanding. That's because he is Maddux's personal catcher.
But this entire postseason, he has played every inning, despite
having torn cartilage in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   While Perez is here, he's making the most of the postseason
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And while he does, Braves fans will continue to chant, ``Eddie!
Eddie!''

 &HT;    Game 1 vintage Maddux
 &HT;    By Gary Nuhn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a difficult season for Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   A game that he had reduced to simple repetition over the past
decade _ fast ball, change-up, fast ball, change-up; see the
hitters curse under their breath _ suddenly was as complicated as a
Joy Clark explanation.
</P>
<P>
   His earned run average, 3.57, would have been a lifetime best
for most pitchers in the arm-poor game that passes for major league
baseball these days. But for Maddux, it was his worst since 1987,
his rookie season with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a question of whether this was an aberration or
whether the league's once-confused batters have figured him out as
they might a bus schedule in Tokyo if they put in 11 years of
study.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night in the ballpark known hereabouts as The Ted,
Maddux unfurled one of his vintage performances in Game 1 of the
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching against the New York Big Apple Mets, a team that with
prodding from the New York Big Apple media thinks of itself in
terms of destiny, Maddux buried destiny in a hole behind the
pitching rubber for seven innings and turned a 3-1 lead over to the
usually reliable Braves' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Appleonians were fodder in the regular season, losing 9
of 12 to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mets manager Bobby Valentine, ``I heard (Yankee manager)
Joe Torre say when you get to the postseason, you have to rip up
what happened in the past. I like that statement.''
</P>
<P>
   For one night, however, there was no ripping. This was the same
old same old between the two squads of multi-millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves whipped the Mets 5 of 6 in late September,
seemingly sweeping them out of the playoffs, Atlanta's Chipper
Jones suggested Mets fans become cross-dressers and switch to
Yankee apparel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took this as if Chipper defamed their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   When Braves' reliever John Rocker was overheard saying he hated
the Mets, that became headlines in the Big Apple Tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who never met a controversy he didn't embrace, has
tried to turn Jones and Rocker into Big Apple Public Enemy Nos. 2
and 3 (behind Hillary Clinton).
</P>
<P>
   Said Maddux on the mini-controversy: ``I'm not sure what's being
said. Ever since I had kids, it's no more ESPN. Now we're watching
Franklin and stuff like that. I've kind of missed the gossip that
goes around the game now, and I don't know what either of those two
guys really said.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantas yawned, too. Vast expanses of the outfield upper deck
were empty _ six full sections in right field; one in left _ as
Braves' fans balked at the idea of $45 baseball, playoffs or no
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux clawed out of three tough situations, including a
man-on-third, nobody-out drama in the third.
</P>
<P>
   With the Braves up 3-1 in the eighth, manager Bobby Cox began
micro-managing, lifting Maddux even though he had thrown only 86
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth came down to the Mets' John Olerud vs. John Rocker,
the Braves' rocket-launching lefty who came into the game to the
mellow strains of Twisted Sisters' I Wanna Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker turned Olerud into a twisted sister: He threw a 97-mph
strike one called, 94-mph strike two called and finished the
operation with a 97-mph strike three swinging, if you can call
Olerud's wave a swing.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Steve Phillips, the general manager of the New York
Mets, tested an analogy about his team the other day, suggesting
that the last time the Mets had seen the Braves, they were sliding
down a slippery slope and that now, reinvigorated by their rush
into the National League Championship Series, they were climbing
the mountain wearing spiked boots.
</P>
<P>
   But when Roger Cedeno sprayed white chalk on the green infield
grass in his frantic attempt to get back to third base after Masato
Yoshii failed to squeeze him home in the third inning, it was clear
that the crampons were failing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, in a renewal of the late-season failure to get timely
hits that nearly doomed their bid to make the playoffs, lost their
grip on a closely played game on Tuesday night and lost 4-2 to the
Braves to drop the opener of their four-of-seven league
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   If the third-base line was too oblique a symbol for the Mets'
continuing woes against the Braves, who dominated them in their
regular season series, then the sight of Melvin Mora, standing on
third base while Braves reliever John Rocker zipped fastball after
fastball by John Olerud to end an eighth-inning threat, was more
direct.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who had been sent into a nearly fatal funk by Braves'
pitching just three weeks ago _ Rocker saved all three of those
games _ had provided entertaining theater in getting back to
Atlanta. But from the looks of this game, they hadn't gained much
ground on the decade's premier National League team.
</P>
<P>
   The bad omens were starting to pile up for the Mets before the
first inning was over.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, whom the Mets had somehow managed to hammer for
their only victory in their six games against the Braves in the
last 10 days of the season, had retired the side in the first
inning on just nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The next chilling omen came in the form of Orel Hershiser, the
starter sent to the bullpen for long relief in the playoffs, who
was warming up after Yoshii had faced just three batters.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii has had mixed results against Atlanta this season. He was
0-2, with a 5.94 era against the Braves, but in his last appearance
he hadn't figured in the decision during the Mets' heartbreaking
extra-innings loss to the Braves that most figured had ended the
Mets' season.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Yoshii had none of the control early in the
game that had made him the Mets' most consistent starter since
August. Gerald Williams smacked Yoshii's first pitch of the game up
the middle for a single and stole second. Bret Boone stretched up
to reach a full-count, shoulder-high pitch for a chopper up the
middle that scored Williams to give the Braves a 1-0 lead,
something that looms when Maddux is on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   With Chipper Jones waiting at the plate, the pitching coach,
Dave Wallace, made a hasty trip to the mound and Hershiser got up.
Yoshii walked Jones _ it was not intentional _ but got out of a
worse mess, retiring Brian Jordan, the Braves' hottest hitter, Ryan
Klesko and Andruw Jones to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii seemed to get stronger as the innings rolled on. But in
the top of the third came the strongest signal yet that perhaps the
pixie dust that had glistened on the Mets for the last 10 days had
worn off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno doubled to lead off the inning, the first hit the
Mets got off Maddux. Cedeno's shot went into left field and
Williams, the left fielder, threw the ball in to Boone, the second
baseman and cut-off man. But Boone had to travel 30 feet to even
get close to the ball, which he missed. As the ball rolled away,
Cedeno went to third base on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a fiasco that may go down as one of the significant
lost chances of this series. Rey Ordonez topped a pitch, the ball
rolling along the third-base line. Ordonez stood still watching it.
But the Braves' catcher, Eddie Perez, astutely picked up the ball,
which had remained fair, and threw to first base, getting Ordonez
out without even having to check third to make sure Cedeno was not
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was what came next. On a 2-0 count, Yoshii had received
the sign to bunt, to start a suicide squeeze to bring Cedeno home.
But Yoshii missed the ball entirely and Cedeno was caught in
no-man's land, already more than halfway home. Perez ran him down
and the skid marks Cedeno left, which sprayed the white chalk into
the infield grass, were symbolic of the Mets' perilous mistake.
Yoshii grounded out weakly to Maddux to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, though, Maddux faltered just long enough
to allow a narrow opening for the Mets. Edgardo Alfonzo smashed a
double into left-center with one out and after John Olerud's single
to shallow right failed to score him, Mike Piazza, who had grounded
out to third in his first at-bat since missing two games with a
swollen thumb, grounded to third again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Chipper Jones bobbled the ball, first against his
chest, then off his glove. By the time he had it in his grasp,
Alfonzo was on his way home to tie the score at 1-1 and Jones could
only get Piazza out at first. Maddux walked Robin Ventura next, but
Darryl Hamilton grounded out to Maddux, the third of four innings
Maddux had ended by fielding the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had allowed just one base runner since the first inning,
but in the fifth, he encountered trouble again. Walt Weiss, whom
Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox had put into the lineup at shortstop
because of the defensive skill that may have saved the Braves'
season during the division series against Houston, smacked a
leadoff double into right field.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux bunted back to the mound to move Weiss to third, but
Yoshii came off awkwardly and appeared to turn his left ankle
before throwing Maddux out. The Mets' trainer, Fred Hina, and
Manager Bobby Valentine came out to check on Yoshii, and in his
warm-up pitches, he seemed to hop a little on the left foot. But he
remained in the game to face Williams.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad decision. Jumping on Yoshii's first pitch again,
Williams hit a single to left field. Rickey Henderson overran the
ball, Weiss scored to give the Braves a 2-1 lead and Williams went
to second base.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves again failed to batter the Mets. Cedeno made a
full-extension diving catch of a Boone fly ball for the second out
and, after Chipper Jones was intentionally walked and Yoshii
removed for Pat Mahomes, Jordan flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, apparently bothered by his ankle, had been chased after
he held the Braves to just two runs in four and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' failure to pile up runs might have had more impact
on the game if the Mets could have made something of their at-bats.
But that is a nearly impossible task when Maddux is pitching. He
was 3-1 this season against the Mets (the one loss was the game in
which the Mets scored eight runs in what may have been the worst
inning of Maddux's career) and had a 3.71 earned run average. He
rolled through the Mets on Tuesday night, retiring them in order in
the fifth, allowing just an Alfonzo double in the sixth and a
single to Cedeno in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had added another run in the sixth inning, but again,
they could have done so much more. Klesko, the leadoff batter,
reached base on a rare error by Olerud, who failed to field a
bouncer in front of the plate. But Andruw Jones grounded into a
double play to clear the bases before Perez slammed a solo home run
into the second row of the left field seats to extend the lead to
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   It only felt as if the Braves were beating the Mets worse than
they were, a fitting continuation of the Mets' seasonlong struggle
to inch up to the Braves.

GORE CAMP PLANS TO ENLIST LABOR AND BLACKS TO COMBAT BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to break up 6th graf to insert two new grafs on
recommendation to endorse Gore by AFL-CIO political committee.)   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having all but won the endorsement of one of the
most active armies of foot soldiers in politics, Vice President Al
Gore's campaign is relying on organized labor's grass-roots support
in crucial states like Iowa, New York and California to beat back
the candidacy of former Sen. Bill Bradley in the Democratic
presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials say they then hope that in the South they can
win the votes of blacks, who make up 40 percent of the Democratic
electorate there, and go on with little trouble to claim the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This double-barreled approach is the big-picture strategy of the
Gore campaign to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign views the labor endorsement as the first
primary because the AFL-CIO, which is meeting here this week, is
expected to send 80 committed delegates to the Democratic National
Convention in August. That is nearly as many as Iowa and New
Hampshire combined and would bring Gore's total committed
delegates, including mayors, governors and members of Congress, to
more than 500 of the 1,000 or so he will need to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley lags far behind in the delegate count, and officials
said it was this ``electability'' factor that seemed persuasive in
getting the unions to endorse and endorse now, rather than wait.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no guarantee that things will work as
planned. The endorsement, which is expected Wednesday, does not
guarantee that the rank and file will enlist, and it will be up to
Gore to inspire them.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's political committee decided almost unanimously
Tuesday night to recommend that the convention endorse Gore. Of the
two dozen unions, only the Teamsters union was opposed. The United
Auto Workers abstained.
</P>
<P>
   James Hoffa, the Teamsters president, said he had polled the
union's 600 locals and, he said, they were not ready to make an
endorsement. Hoffa said that did not mean they were opposed to him.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore camp is plotting its nuts and bolts strategy,
Bradley is closing the gap in the polls, largely by capturing the
national imagination in a way that Gore has yet to do. The latest
CNN/Time poll over the weekend put Bradley within 12 points of the
vice president. Six weeks ago the same poll had them 33 points
apart.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated Gore endorsement provides the structure for
labor to swing into high gear in places where it has recently
proved its muscle, particularly in saving the candidacies of Gov.
Gray Davis in California and Gov. Tom Vilsack in Iowa. Labor also
has a huge constituency in New York, one of the states where
Bradley, a former star basketball player for the New York Knicks,
has an edge in the polls. The Gore camp expects labor to help turn
the tide there.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is starting to express some confidence that it
is winning over important Democratic constituents. The only area
where Gore strategists see Bradley firmly ahead is among male
sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley needs to stop us big time in some component of the
Democratic family, and I don't see where that is,'' said Gore
campaign chairman Tony Coelho. .
</P>
<P>
   The states where labor is strong are also the states that figure
early in the political calendar. Iowa, scheduled to vote Jan. 31,
is first. It is a strong labor state where Gore is ahead. New
Hampshire, where Bradley leads, comes next. Labor has less
influence there, and while the Gore campaign is making an intense
effort to win, the state is not crucial to its success. On March 7
come the big states with important labor strongholds _ California,
Ohio and New York. If organized labor turns out for Gore, he could
virtually sew up the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore faces a wild card in California, where independents and
Republicans can cross over and vote in the Democratic primary. This
could allow Bradley to win the popular vote, even if the Democratic
delegates still go to Gore. The effect of such an unusual turn of
events would be to give Bradley a psychological advantage that he
could use to slow a Gore roll at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the expected labor endorsement will not be unanimous.
The teamsters and the United Auto Workers plan to vote against
endorsing Gore. The unions are upset with Gore's embrace of free
trade, and although it differs little from Bradley's, they hope
that by withholding their support, they can extract concessions
from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore does not wrap up the nomination after California, the
campaign moves South, where Gore is relying on black voters to
sweep him to victory. Gore has a strong following among blacks for
two reasons: President Clinton is a hero in the black community,
and so is Gore's late father, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr. of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not lost on black voters that Gore has appointed a
black woman, Donna Brazile, as his campaign manager, the first ever
in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp believes it has been helped by Bradley's effort to
court homosexuals by supporting the reopening of the Civil Rights
Act to add protections for gay men and women. Prominent blacks are
alarmed by this, saying it would give conservatives in Congress a
chance to roll back hard-fought rights for all, and Gore operatives
are trying to feed those fears.
</P>
<P>
   But how can Gore rely so heavily on labor if the federation's
endorsement was in doubt as recently as last week? His aides, and
union officials, say Gore ran into problems chiefly because he had
not properly courted the leaders. They said, for instance, that
although the vice president's office was working regularly with
unions on labor issues, his staff did not make a political
connection between the issues and Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore wasn't calling on the leaders,'' said Gerry Shea, a
senior assistant to AFL-CIO president John Sweeney. ``He assumed it
had been done through the issues people.'' Gore tried to make up
for his inattentiveness by meeting with several leaders here
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knows he needs to work the AFL-CIO members better than he
worked the leaders. His first test comes later Wednesday, when he
flies to Seattle to meet with aerospace workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sending Gore into union shops, his campaign is relying on
the telephone banks and organization drives that characterized
labor's commitment in the 1998 Congressional elections. The AFL-CIO
diverted the $35 million it had spent in 1996 on television
advertisements and put it instead into local organizing.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosenthal said the federation
planned to organize a Gore tree by identifying a Gore supporter in
each union in each state, then in each affiliate, at each work site
and on each shift. He said organizers believe that this
worker-to-worker contact is the best way to get reliable
information to members. In 1998, he said, 76 percent of union
members who received union literature voted for the endorsed
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But one problem that may emerge for Gore is that the AFL-CIO
intends to focus its efforts on contrasting Gore with the
Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, not with
Bradley. Rosenthal said this stance would test the theory that the
union could mobilize for Gore without going negative on Bradley. As
another political operative said of avoiding squabbles in
primaries: ``Don't bury the body too deep; you may need to dig it
up again.''

 &HT;    Heart attack fells one of NBA's most dominant forces at 63
 &HT;    By Ethan J. Skolnick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wilt Chamberlain, so dominant a
basketball player that he once scored 100 points in a single NBA
game, died Tuesday at his Bel-Air home of an apparent heart attack.
He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamberlain's body was found by authorities who were called
to his home shortly after noon Los Angeles time. Mr. Chamberlain,
who spent much time during the past decade at the suburban Boca
Raton restaurant that bears his name, was hospitalized with an
irregular heartbeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost a giant of a man in every sense of the word,'' NBA
Commissioner David Stern said of the player considered by many to
be the greatest of all time. ``The shadow of accomplishment he cast
over our game is unlikely ever to be matched.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper,'' the
outspoken, 7-foot-1 Mr. Chamberlain had a presence wherever he
went, from his birthplace of Philadelphia to Boca Raton, where he
could be spotted this decade playing polo and tennis, commentating
at slam-dunk contests at Florida Atlantic University, and strolling
through the Glades Road restaurant he and business partners opened
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vittoroulis, the general manager and owner of the
restaurant, said today's proceeds will be donated to a charity, and
flowers and a picture of Wilt will be placed outside the front
doors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mr. Chamberlain began sponsoring the annual Rising Star
Shoot-out just down the street at Olympic Heights High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally refreshing for me,'' Mr. Chamberlain said
before the first Shoot-out. ``Totally, totally, totally. I'm
looking forward to getting involved with these kids, talking with
them, maybe getting them some things to think about their future.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Mr. Chamberlain's past had inspired tall tales of all
sorts. His accomplishments and appetites could only be quantified
with enormous numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamberlain played 14 seasons in the NBA, for the
Philadelphia (later the San Francisco) Warriors, the 76ers and the
Lakers, scoring 31,419 points, a record until Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
broke it in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see
another one like him,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamberlain never fouled out in a 1,205 regular-season and
playoff games. He holds the record for career rebounding with
23,924, and for single-game rebounding, with 55 against Boston in
1960. He averaged 30.1 points per game in his career, including a
record 50.4 in the 1961-62 season with Philadelphia. He won the
Rookie of the Year Award in 1959-60, the MVP award four times and
the league's rebounding title 11 times. He even led the league in
assists in 1967-68.
</P>
<P>
   He may not have changed the game, but the NBA did because of
him, widening the lane to try to keep him farther from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man ever had much luck at that _ Bill Russell of the
Boston Celtics. Russell and Mr. Chamberlain staged one of the
longest and most compelling rivalries in modern sports history,
while maintaining a close friendship off the court. Mr. Chamberlain
led his teams into the playoffs 13 times, but won only two NBA
championships, in 1966-67 with the 76ers and in 1971-72 with the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times Russell's Celtics ended Mr. Chamberlain's season,
twice in the championship series and five times in the conference
finals. Three times, a series was decided by a seventh game that
Boston won by either one or two points.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Russ, winning at basketball was everything,'' Mr.
Chamberlain later said of his rival, whom he would invite to his
house for dinner before they faced each other. ``It was a test of
his manhood. I looked at basketball as a game, not a life-and-death
struggle. There are too many other beautiful things in life _ food,
cars, girls, friends, the beach, freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' success did not diminish their respect for Mr.
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt Chamberlain had a great deal to do with the success of
the NBA,'' former Celtics coach Red Auerbach said. ``His dominance,
power, demeanor and the rivalry with Bill Russell says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   If one game said it all, it occurred on March 2, 1962. Mr.
Chamberlain scored 100 points in the Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147
defeat of the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pa. No one has approached
that mark, with David Thompson's 73 points in 1978 coming closest.
Mr. Chamberlain scored at least that many four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 12 years in his armpits, and I always carried that
100-point game on my shoulders,'' said Darrall Imhoff, a 6-foot-10
rookie for the Knicks in 1962. ``After I got my third foul, I said
to one of the officials, Willy Smith, `Why don't you just give him
100 points and we'll all go home?' Well, we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamberlain's first home was in Philadelphia. He was born on
Aug. 21, 1936, and didn't begin playing basketball until the
seventh grade. He grew 4 inches in three months when he was 15, and
was 6-foot-11 when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School.
</P>
<P>
   After leading Overbrook to three public school championships and
two all-city titles, Chamberlain was recruited by more than 200
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the University of Kansas and Hall of Fame coach Phog
Allen. In his first freshman game against the Kansas varsityhe
scored 50 points before a packed Allen Fieldhouse crowd of more
than 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Mr. Chamberlain scored 52 points against
Northwestern in his first game, a total he never surpassed in
college, partly because of zone defenses designed to keep him from
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior, he led the 1957 Jayhawks to the NCAA Tournament
final, where Kansas lost to unbeaten North Carolina in triple
overtime in his final college game. Disgusted by being smothered by
the zone defenses, Mr. Chamberlain left Kansas the next year and
joined the Harlem Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   Extremely agile for his size, Mr. Chamberlain ran cross-country
in high school and was an outstanding high jumper and shot-putter
at Kansas. He had remained active after his NBA career and was
considered an outstanding volleyball player. He also ran the
Honolulu Marathon recently.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Mr. Chamberlain made his first official visit
to Kansas since his college career ended. His jersey was raised to
the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse. ``I've learned in life that you
have to take the bitter with the sweet, and how sweet this is,''
Mr. Chamberlain said then.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed genuinely surprised at how much he was loved by the
rabid Kansas fans after staying away for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago I lost a heartbreaking battle, losing to North
Carolina by one point in triple overtime,'' he told the crowd. ``It
was a devastating thing for me because I felt like I let the
university down, I let KU down.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd interrupted, yelling, ``No, no,'' before resuming
another standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He did not receive such rave reviews in 1991 after releasing his
autobiography, A View From Above, in which he boasted that he had
sex with 20,000 women. The book, which Mr. Chamberlain said had
been written two years earlier, was released shortly after Earvin
``Magic'' Johnson, another of the NBA's greatest players, revealed
he was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women who I have been the most attracted to, the most in
love with, I've pushed away the strongest,'' the lifelong bachelor
said in a 1991 interview. ``There are about five women I can think
of I could have married. I cared for them a lot, but not enough to
make a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chamberlain said later he regretted that readers focused so
much on that one number, and not on other points he made in the
book. Mr. Chamberlain was often critical of modern NBA players, and
openly envious of their salaries. He estimated that he made about
$2.2 million during his professional career, including $425,000 in
his final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put that in perspective, Patrick Ewing makes more in 10
games _ 10 games _ than Wilt Chamberlain made in 14 years of
playing basketball,'' he told the Post in December.
</P>
<P>
   During those 14 years, he played 47,859 minutes, proving to be
as durable as he was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that my legacy should be that I gave credence that you
could be big, bigger than most and still have athletic ability,''
Mr. Chamberlain said in 1996, when he was interviewed as one of the
NBA's 50 greatest players.

U.N. WORKER SLAIN IN KOSOVO WAS RESIDENT OF NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United Nations employee who was killed on his
first day in Kosovo on Monday was a Queens resident who had spent
years working toward a peacekeeping assignment with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin Krumov, 38, who lived in the Flushing section of
Queesn, was beaten and then shot to death as he took an
after-dinner stroll on Mother Teresa Street, the main pedestrian
thoroughfare in the capital Pristina, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Krumov was killed after he spoke Serbo-Croatian to a group of
ethnic Albanian teen-agers, one of whom had apparently asked him
the time in Serbo-Croatian, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crowd of local citizens assaulted him. He was taken by a mob
... and shot dead,'' Lt. Col. Dmitry Kapotsev told The Associated
Press. He said the youths, seeking revenge on Serbs, who they blame
for years of repression, may have assumed he was Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   A black jacket he was wearing, inscribed with the words ``United
States, New York,'' was found nearby, splattered with blood.
</P>
<P>
   He was killed by a single bullet to the head, Kapotsev said.
</P>
<P>
   Krumov was the first international worker from the United
Nations to be killed since it moved into Kosovo in mid-June. The
mission, which followed the 11-week bombing of Yugoslavia and the
departure of Serbian forces, is setting up an interim government in
the province. Krumov was to work on the creation of Kosovo's new
government .
</P>
<P>
   A native of Bulgaria and the son of engineers, Krumov had lived
in New York off and on since 1994, when he got his first position
at the United Nations as an intern, said Marie Okabe, a spokeswoman
for the organization. Besides brief stints in the Slovak Republic
and in the former Soviet Georgia, this was his first long-term
mission with the United Nations, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   His supervisor, Franco Bechi, said Krumov was ecstatic about the
assignment, which was to run until April with the opportunity for
an extension. ``He was looking forward to a long career with the
U.N.,'' said Bechi, who saw Krumov the night before his departure.
``He had a great soul. He was friendly, polite and very
hard-working.''
</P>
<P>
   A former major in the Bulgarian army, Krumov had received a
doctorate in political science from the University of Georgia in
December. He was an expert in Eastern Europe and Balkan affairs and
spoke six languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``His language skills were his assets,'' Bechi said, ``and in
the end, they were his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Damyanoff, 67, a friend and a neighbor, said Krumov was
remarkably idealistic and saw the United Nations as a powerful
force for healing broken nations. ``Most of us start out starry
eyed and become cynical,'' he said. ``But Valentin stayed that way.
He really believed he could change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Vinya Nick, 53, described Krumov as an
open-minded, exuberant man who loved to dance, cook, write poetry
and talk politics. ``Without exaggeration, he was one of the most
cultured people I ever met,'' she said. ``He had an incredible
appetite for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Krumov's openness could also be a weakness, Ms. Nick said.
``He was the kind of person who would talk to anyone,'' she said.
``If only he had been more suspicious.'' She said he had been
zealously studying Albanian during the last few weeks because he
wanted to get closer to the local people. ``He was so tolerant, so
vibrant, a real citizen of the world,'' she said. ``This has all
the elements of a Greek tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   After checking into Pristina's Grand Hotel on Monday and eating
dinner, he joined two newly arrived colleagues for a walk down the
city's liveliest street, which is closed to vehicular traffic at
night. It was thronged with young people taking in the evening air
when he was approached by the group of teen-agers, the authorities
said. Soon after he responded in Serbo-Croatian, police said, he
was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   A suspect escaped on foot, apparently helped by other residents
crowding the street, they said. The two other employees were not
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   A Polish police officer who did not want to be identified told
The Associated Press that he never spoke his own language because
it could be mistaken for Serbian: both are Slavic languages and can
sound similar to those unfamiliar with Polish. Albanians themselves
have reported threats when speaking Serbo-Croatian with visitors
from Bosnia or Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before Krumov left for the airport in New York, Ms.
Nick said she lectured him on the phone about his naivete. ``Be
vigilant, be careful, and remember, sometimes it's better not to
say anything,'' she recalled telling him.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations will fly his body to Bulgaria Wednesday,
where he will be buried by his family.
