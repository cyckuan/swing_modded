<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Four terrorists involved in
seven bomb blasts in different parts of Punjab province in eastern
Pakistan have been arrested, said Senior Minister of Punjab Malik
Mushtaq Ahmed Awan today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters in Lahore, the metropolis of Punjab,
the provincial minister said that as many as 57 innocent citizens
were killed and more than 120 others injured in the seven blasts
committed by these saboteurs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the police had collected solid proof that they
were working for "enemies", said reports of the official
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the arrested would be interrogated by
joint interrogation teams.

terrorists' activities.

<P>
Earlier, the government also announced the arrest of some other
people, who were allegedly involved in different bomb blasts.

</P>
<P>
The index moved up from 186.33 to 186.98 with 1990-91 as base.
</P>
<P>
The upward movement is mainly due to rise in the prices of

prices after studying prices of 46 essential items in 12 major
urban centers.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Contacts Under Way for Meeting with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, in a sign of compromise, said today contacts
are under way to set up a meeting between him and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks during an inspection tour to a
Jerusalem school which opened today for the new semester. However,
he stressed that such a meeting would depend on "developments".
</P>
<P>
"I said that the meeting between me and Mr. Arafat will take
place based on developments, not based on a calendar date," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Those developments are taking place as we speak. I can not
tell you that it will materialize by such, such a date. But we are
in contact with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in order
to arrive at certain understandings that will facilitate this
meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Netanyahu indicated himself that a
meeting with Arafat would take place soon. Such a meeting is
expected to ease the current tension between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Recently, pressure mounted from both domestic and outside on
the hardline leader to meet with Arafat, whom he charged
with "harboring terrorism" and vowed never to talk with.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, President Ezer Weizman took a surprise step
by announcing that he would hold a meeting with Arafat if
Netanyahu refused to do so. Some members from the Netanyahu's own
ruling Likud party also joined the calls by the opposition parties
for such a meeting, warning any delay would lead to deterioration
of Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
On last Wednesday, Arafat outpoured his anger with Netanyahu's
arrogance and provocative policies on settlements and
Jerusalem. He called a general strike in the Palestinian
self-rule areas Thursday and a massive protest prayer at the
Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem on Friday, arousing fears of renewed
anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, Netanyahu has softened his opposition to a
meeting with Arafat. He also sent several senior envoys to
conduct dialogues with the PNA in a bid to calm down the
situation. Israel also informed the PNA that bilateral peace
talks would resume formally in a week.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports disclosed today that the two sides have
been conducting secret talks under the mediation of several
Norwegian, UN and U.S. diplomats, and are close to reaching
understandings on several issues.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, during his first official visit
to Egypt today, also confirmed the reports of secret contacts,
saying breakthroughs were expected very soon, even today.
</P>
<P>
In another development, PNA representative in east Jerusalem
Faisal Husseini told a news conference in the Orient House that,
if the Israeli-Palestinian deadlock continues, the PNA will
declare soon the establishment of a Palestinian state with east
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new hardline government has made clear that it
opposed an independent Palestinian state, and would crash any
efforts to divide Jerusalem, which it claimed as its only
eternal capital.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Education improving in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Rapid economic growth has
helped local ethnic education in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, which has 52 minority ethnic groups with a total of 4.89
million people.
</P>
<P>
Most of them live in compact community in the northwest part of
Sichuan, in 10 pastoral and 38 half-pastoral counties.
</P>
<P>
The pastoral area had an output value of 1.9 billion yuan in
1995 and herdsmen started to pay more attention to educational
development and home improvements after having gotten rid of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The pastoral counties have set up 6,440 learning centers,
including five colleges, 48 secondary technical schools, 297
middle schools, and 6,056 primary schools.
</P>
<P>
There are now a total of 650,000 students studying in these
schools, and the province has provided education for more than
12,000 skilled persons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, adult education has improved. Local education
departments have held illiteracy-elimination classes, and a
variety of technology training programs, and set up more than
2,000 radio and television stations.

<HEADLINE> ANC Urged To Review Position on Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) --South Africa's provincial
and national leaders, at a meeting at weekend, urged the African
National Congress (ANC) to review its policy on the death penalty
as a possible way of addressing increasing crime and lawlessness
in the country, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The call has been made at a two-day ANC summit on peace,
stability and security held in Cape Town at the weekend attended
by senior national and provincial leaders.
</P>
<P>
The conference recommended that the ANC's national working
committee should as a matter of urgency review the question of
the death penalty and the ANC position on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the conferece, Justice
Minister Dullah Omar said: ''It is the view of the summit that
the ANC, as a leading democratic force representing the will of
the people, should not be afraid to reassess its position on the
death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
The ANC is currently opposed to the death penalty as an
appropriate sentence for serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
Omar said, however, the delegates to the conference are not
saying that they are in favour of the death penalty, but that the
ANC's highest policy-making structure, the National Executive
Committee, should revise the matter.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was abolished by South Africa's
constitutional court last June with the strong objection from
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Since the abolishment of the death penalty, the ANC-led
government has been under increasing pressure to reintroduce the
capital punishment to save the society from lawlessness and
anarchy as a result of rampant crime.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Attack Pseudoscience (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resurgence of superstitious activities runs contradictory
to China's policies of reinvigorating the country through science
and technology," said Sun Xiaoli, professor of Science and Society
Research Center under Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The battle against pseudoscience is a big issue in the
country, she said at a seminar held at the Social Science
Bookstore here. Nearly 30 scientists attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We must rise against superstitious and stupid practices
observed in the feudal system," said a leading official with the
China Association for Science and Technology (CAST).
</P>
<P>
He called on natural scientists, social scientists and the
media to join hands in fighting superstitious activities and
pseudoscience.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, superstitious activities, such as
fortune-telling and witchcraft, have re-appeared in China,
disguised as "pseudoscience." Superstitious books again glutted
street-corner book stands. Many fortune-tellers used computers to
cheat clients out of money.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Attack Pseudoscience (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past two years, Chinese scientists and journalists
have strengthened their attacks on the swindlers by publishing a
series of articles and reports which say that most of these
"superpowers" are nothing but tricks disguised as pseudoscience.
</P>
<P>
China's latest offensive against pseudoscience is found in the
recently-published book, "Exposure to Pseudoscience," a 400-page
collection of articles written by leading Chinese scientists, such
as Zhu Guangya and Zhou Guangzhao, as well as journalists from the
prestigious "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
Xian Dingchang, a nuclear physicist, said that pseudoscience
is a twin of science. Many swindlers have used the latest
inventions to engage in pseudoscience activities, which now are
more difficult to see through than in the ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Zou Chenglu, an academician with the China Academy of
Sciences, said that there is some quackery in science; some has
been exposed, but some has not.
</P>
<P>
To launch fresh attacks on pseudoscience, China will conduct
seminars on fake practices, set up a special committee under the
CAST to study the trend, and motivate the media to participate in
the anti-pseudoscience campaign.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Optimistic about Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy expressed here today his optimism over the
Middle East peace process, especially Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing many difficulties, but we can overcome them," he
said after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "I
believe tangible progress will be achieved within the coming few
days."
</P>
<P>
Levy, who arrived here earlier today on his first visit to
Egypt since taking office in June, said that the Israeli and
Palestinian sides are expected to reach an agreement soon on
arrangements for a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had rejected to meet Arafat but later said that he
could have a meeting with Arafat after Mubarak warned last month
that he may cancel a regional economic summit due to be held in
Cairo if Israel does not move faster in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy told reporters that Israeli and Palestinian officials
were holding secret negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said that he believed the negotiations could lead to an
agreement between the Israeli government and the Palestinian
Authority. But he did not say who was representing the two sides
in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, however, said at a joint
press conference with Levy that "talk alone is not enough" to
bring about real progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that all Palestinian-Israeli agreements should be
implemented in order to push forward the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Apparently trying to soothe the Arabs' anger over Israel's
hardline policy on Arab-Israeli peace talks, Levy said that
Israel wants to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We have no wish or no will to be in a standstill in
the talks," Levy said. "Both we and the Palestinians have an
interest in advancing the (peace) process." the visiting foreign
minister spoke in Hebrew at the news conference with his
words being mostly translated into Arabic by an Israeli
official.
</P>
<P>
Levy, whose brief visit came amid escalated tension between
Israel and Palestinians, told reporters that Israel would not
confiscate Palestinian lands and build new settlements though the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements do not ban the building of
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel did not violate the Oslo agreements
signed between Israel and the Palestinians as regards to the
issue of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to emphasize that in the Oslo agreements there is
no banning of settlements, in an unequivocal way," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we do not confiscate land and we do not
build new settlements," he added.
</P>
<P>
Levy's statements apparently ran contrary to Palestinians'
allegations that Israel has broken the Palestinian-Israeli
agreements by allowing expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, in somewhat a challenging tone to Levy's remarks,
described the building of settlements as a very serious
mistake and a hard blow on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israel would not confiscate more
Palestinian lands as Levy promised.
</P>
<P>
"I want to take note of what the (Israeli foreign)
minister just said, that is, Israel is not going to
confiscate any more land...if so, this constitutes a distinct
progress along the peace route," Moussa said in English.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who attended the meeting between Mubarak and Levy,
reiterated Egypt's stand that the success of the Middle East
and North Africa Economic Summit is linked to progress in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the conference, Moussa said, "our position
continues as expressed by President Mubarak a week ago in
Alexandria."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to Mubarak's threat to cancel
the summit if there is still no progress in the peace
march.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that it would be unimaginable to talk about
regional economic cooperation if the peace process is hindered.
</P>
<P>
Tension has mounted between the Palestinians and Israel as
Arafat warned that Palestinians could be pushed toward another
bloody revolt if Israel does not move faster to make peace.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's NGO Urges Civil Servants To End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Affirmative Action Group
(AAG), an influential non-governmental organisation in Zimbabwe,
today demanded the country's civil servants to stop strike for
the national interests.
</P>
<P>
AAG President Phillip Chiyangwa said though the civil servants
who demand salary increment had a genuine case, their strike
which has been lasting for two weeks had resulted in the
breakdown of the government machine.
</P>
<P>
About 160,000 civil servants nationwide in Zimbabwe began
their strike two weeks ago demanding up to 60 percent of salary
increment, but the government so far only agreed to increase
their payment for 20 percent, resulting in the breakdown of their
negotiation to end the massive strike.
</P>
<P>
Chiyangwa also deplored the government's handling of the
strike which is due to enter its third week on Monday. To get out
of the awkward situation, the government has declared all striking
workers fired.
</P>
<P>
"The AAG urges striking civil servants to immediately suspend
their action and resume their work as the costs and burdens of
the strike are being disproportionately borne by our black
people," said Chiyangwa.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental group is now trying to mediate the
negotiation between the government and the striking civil
servants.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Devaluation of Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Central Bank chief
today denied devaluation of the country's national currency rial
despite U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Nourbakhsh noted that the rates remain the same as
announced at the beginning of the current Iranian year (started
March 20 1996).
</P>
<P>
He stated that the foreign exchange situation of the country
brooks no need to increase the rates.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that sufficient hard currency needed for different
sectors, including industry, investment and purchase of essential
 goods, have been provided.
</P>
<P>
However, the exchange rate of U.S. dollar has increased a
little bit -- about 2.5 percent -- in the black market. There
are three kinds of exchange rates for one dollar. One dollar is
against 1,750 rials in official rate, against 3,000 rials at the
export and import rate and 4,200 rials in black market.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's foreign trade is conducted through
Iran's banking system and letters of credits guaranteed by
Iranian banks are acceptable to foreign customers, Nourbakhsh
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that five-year credits to Iran provided by foreign
sources in the last year has been replaced by 8.5-year credits
in the current year.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the statistics published by the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) indicate that Iran's foreign
exchange reserve has increased, which serves as an evidence of
Iran's reputable status in the world.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the impact of the U.S. anti-Iran move on the
economic trend, Nourbakhsh stated that Iran is facing a positive
reaction at international markets and the U.S. policies have not
affected the economic situation of the country.

donation from an animal welfare lobby, the largest single cash
gift from an outside body in its 90-year history.
</P>
<P>
The Political Animal Lobby (PAL), the British arm of the
American-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, said it had
made the donation partly because the Labor Party, favored to win
power at the next general election, was more open than the ruling
Conservatives to a ban on fox hunting, according to local mass
media.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, leader of the Labor Party, reaffirmed today that he
would allow members of parliament a free vote on whether to ban
fox hunting -- a move the Conservatives have thwarted -- but said
his party's policy would not be swayed by the donation.
</P>
<P>
PAL, founded in 1990, has made large contributions in the past
to all of Britain's leading political parties.
</P>
<P>
The PAL cash donation would significantly boost Labor's
election war chest and help it match the Tories' well-funded
advertising drive, the Labor Party spokesman said.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani is to start Monday a six-nation African
tour, which will take him to Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Official news agency IRNA reported today that a high ranking
politico-economic delegation will accompany the Iranian president
during his upcoming tour.
</P>
<P>
The report said that it is the first time for President
Rafsanjani to make such tour to African states since the "triumph
of the 1979 Islamic Revolution".
</P>
<P>
It claimed "great political significance" of the six-nation
tour by Rafsanjani in a bid to expand its relations with African
countries, particularly "at a time when the United States tries
to isolate Iran politically and punish it economically".
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani is expected to exchange views with leaders of the
six African states on issues of mutual interest and on regional
and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Among the main topics to be discussed by Rafsanjani and his
African counterparts are ways of expanding economic cooperation
and implementing agreements that have been reached between Iran
and those countries.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Election Proceeds Quietly in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 1 (Xinhua) -- In a tensely quiet atmosphere,
about half of 288,000 qualified voters in the Lebanese capital
today went to 832 polling stations to choose 19 members in the
third of a five-phase general election that will produce a
half-Christian-and-half-Moslem parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army and security forces had taken strict
security measures across the capital since Saturday
afternoon. Light tanks and armored personal carriers were
patrolling the main streets, and check points were set up at
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance of every polling station, armed policemen were
overseeing a crowd of youngsters, who were employed by various
candidates to bolster their publicity to gain more votes.
</P>
<P>
Several fist fights were reported between supporters of rival
candidates, which were interrupted by police's intervention. About
40 people were detained, according to security sources.
</P>
<P>
Rafik al-Hariri, the Sunni prime minister, is one of the 92
candidates in Beirut competing for a seat in the parliament, which
has a total of 128 seats.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the multi-billionaire Hariri,
52, rising from the southern Lebanese port city of Saida, to
participate in the general election as both a candidate and
voter registered in the constituency of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Four coalitions comprising 43 candidates headed respectively by
Hariri, former Premier Salim Al-Hoss and incumbent Deputies Adnan
Traboulsi and Najah Wakim, and 49 independents, were in a high
profile for winning.
</P>
<P>
Some rigging was reported in today's election. Esam Naman, a
Druze candidate in the "Salvation and Change" coalition led by
Al-Hoss, today accused a "certain winning candidate" of paying
100 to 120 U.S. dollars for every one who voted in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Tammam Salam, the most remarkable figure among the
independents, called on the Beirut voters to choose those
candidates "whom you are familiar with."
</P>
<P>
Election officials estimated the polling rate at slightly over
50 percent, similar to that in the first phase of the election in
Mount Lebanon on August 18 and in the second phase in North
Lebanon on August 25.
</P>
<P>
After casting his vote in a polling station in Ras
Beirut, Hariri stressed that the election in Beirut was going
on "well and without problems," believing that the election
would be "successful and honest."
</P>
<P>
Praising voters' enthusiasm in the polling, the prime
minister said that "the future of the country, and the future of
the capital for the next four years will be decided today."
</P>
<P>
"Candidate Rafik Hariri wants the people to give him their
confidence," Hariri stated.
</P>
<P>
At stake in today's election are six seats reserved for
Sunni Moslems, two for Shiite Moslems, one for the Druze,
one for Maronites, two for Greek Orthodox Christians, one for
Greek Catholic Christians, three for Armenian Orthodoxes, one
for Armenian Catholics, one for Evangelicals and one for
Christian minorities.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory in the
first phase of the election in the predominantly Christian
governorate of Mount Lebanon on August 18 by winning 32 out of 35
seats and among the winners are 12 members of a coalition led by
Walid Jumblatt, a minister in Hariri's government.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of the elections in North Lebanon, most of
the traditional leaders lost in the competition for the 28 seats
in the parliament, and almost all the winners, including 12 new
faces, are friends of Syria, the most influential foreign power
broker in this country.
</P>
<P>
Due to a failure of the main Shiite rival organizations, the
pro-Syrian Amal Movement and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, fierce
competitions are expected in the fourth and fifth phases of the
elections in south Lebanon on September 8 and in the Beqaa on
September 15.

<HEADLINE> Special Christian Prayers Held for Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Special prayers were held
for peace here today by Patriarchs and heads of various Christian
sects in protest against an Israeli government decision to expand
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken in response to Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat's call for a special prayer for
Jerusalem and peace.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO Executive Committee, and
the Jerusalem members of the PA and Palestinian Council (PC)
participated in the prayers that was held in St. Jacob
Church in the city.
</P>
<P>
Husseini told worshipers that the response of Palestinians in
this special prayer reflects their desire for peace. He demanded
that the Israeli government stop its violations of the Oslo
Accords and lose no time in fully implementing the signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
After the prayers, a joint communique of various Christian
sects was issued. It requested the Israeli government to review
its policy, lift the blockade on Jerusalem, stop settlement
activities in the Palestinian territories, put an end to acts of
demolishing Palestinian houses in the city, and revive and
stimulate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the sacred city for the three
religions -- Jewish, Islamic and Christian -- should not be
open for one and closed for the other two. It is the heart of the
Palestinian land. The issue of Jewish settlements has been
always the main obstacle to peace, the communique concluded.

"The ANC is saying the gloves are off. It is waging a war
against crime," said Thandi Modise, member of the ANC's highest
policy-making body, the National Executive Committee.

being too soft on the waves of violent crime that is engulfing
South Africa.

Meanwhile, in an interview with local media today, President
Mandela admitted for the first time that crime is going rampant
in South Africa, referring to gang-fighting in the provinces of

LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone and Nigeria are
making efforts to rekindle old bilateral cooperation agreements
in the education, culture, economic, scientific and technical
fields, Sierra Leonean High Commissioner to Nigeria Joe Biell
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The envoy did not detail what is going on between the
governments of the two countries in rekindling the old
agreements, but said ''We shall be guided by the aims and
objectives of the Economic Community of West African States and
the need to promote integration.''
</P>

Biell said that Sierra Leone and Nigeria have enjoyed
century-long cordial relations. ''While Nigeria was assisting
Sierra Leone in many fields, Sierra Leone has always played its
part, providing middle level personnel for Nigeria's educational
and administrative cadres during the colonial period,'' he told
the News Agency of Nigeria.

A lot of Sierra Leoneans served in Nigeria as clerks,
teachers, druggists and dispensers and a lot of nigerians,

<HEADLINE> UK Statistics Show New Evidence on Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) --More than half Britain's
unemployed find jobs then lose them again within 40 weeks and have
to start reclaiming benefit, according to Labor Market Trends by
the Government.
</P>
<P>
In total, 494,000 of Britain's unemployed had found a new job
but lost it within a year.
</P>
<P>
A new computer analysis by the Department of Employment has
provided some of the strongest evidence yet of the degree of job
insecurity in Britain, and dramatically demonstrates the problems
the jobless face in breaking into permanent employment.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that 11 percent start reclaiming
unemployment benefit within four weeks, 30 percent within 13
weeks, 43.6 percent within 26 weeks, and 52 percent within 39
weeks. Fifty-eight percent are reclaiming within a year and 67
percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
The figure, updated to January this year, also show that men
lose their jobs much more quickly than women.
</P>
<P>
Labor market researchers claim that one obvious explanation
for the speed with which the unemployed move in and out of
unemployment is that there has been a growth in the number of
temporary jobs.
</P>
<P>
There are around 1.5 million workers on temporary contracts,
both full-time and part-time, or 7 percent of the total
workforce, up from 5 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Labor's chief employment spokesman Ian Mccartney described the
figure as a sign of a "revolving-door jobs market in which
employers can now hire and fire at will".

LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Lack of fund may stall the
eradication of guinea worm in Nigeria, the National Coordinator
of the country's Guinea Worm Eradication Program, Kamorudeen

More money is needed as the program entered its last and most

Only 6,786 cases of guinea worm were reported in the first
half of this year across the country, compared with 10,826 cases
registered in the same period last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Research: Grapefruit Juice Can Be Lethal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- British Health officials warn
patients taking a range of common drugs that they could die if
they drink a glass of grapefruit juice on top of their
medication.
</P>
<P>
New research suggests that the fruit juice can spark a
potentially fatal chemical reaction with many powerful medicines,
including those used to combat allergies, heart complaints and
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
A statement released here today by Britain's Medicine Controls
Agency said it accepted that grapefruit juice could alter the way
some drugs are absorbed by the body.
</P>
<P>
The new study, by American scientists, suggests that a single
glass of the juice could trigger a massive overdose.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph today quoted Dr Barbara Ameer, a
pharmacology consultant, as saying that 13 drugs found to be
affected by the juice.
</P>
<P>
They include the anti-histamine terfenadine - known in Britain
as Triludan - and cyclosporin, used to combat organ rejection.
Some oestrogen compounds used to treat menopausal symptoms and the
sleeping pill Halcion.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ameer said that the cause of the reaction remained unclear.
Orange juice seemed to have no effect at all, and grapefruit juice
could also act to lower the potency of some drugs.

OTTAWA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- A match tossed out carelessly
by a resident at a nursing home is believed to have caused a fire

Montreal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Five women and two men from the Villa St-Genevieve home died in

A temporary morgue was set up in the ground floor to identify

<P>
Police said the woman who was breaking the rules and smoking at
the home and dropped the match was herself taken to hospital with
serious leg burns.
</P>
<P>
Another resident also checked into hospital with unknown

<HEADLINE> French Green Party Moves towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The French Green Party is
planning to set up an alliance with the two major leftist forces
-- the Socialist Party and the Communist Party -- to win
representation in the National Assembly in the 1998 legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party first secretary Lionel Jospin, Communist Party
national secretary Robert Hue and the spokeswoman of the ecologist
movement Dominique Voynet sat side by side in public for the first
time last Friday in the "Summer Days" forum the Green Party held
in Sanguinet, southern France.
</P>
<P>
All three were presidential candidates in the presidential
election last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Green Party admitted that it is not easy to obtain
an overall consensus of views on social, political and economic
issues with the Socialists, who the Green Party has asked to
abandon the political guidelines it held when in power in the
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Voynet said that the road will be difficult, but there is no
other way than allying with the forces to obtain stronger
parliamentary representation.
</P>
<P>
Jospin and Hue have also expressed their will to cooperate with
the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Jospin recognized that the call for ecological protection in
agricultural development is well-founded, and he recalled his
party's opposition to a canal project in the Rhin-Rhone and to the
renewal of the Superphenix nuclear center.
</P>
<P>
Hue said that the leftists "absolutely need to have a
ecological dimension in its fight in order to be leftist."
</P>
<P>
Four working groups have begun to study how to make up the
differences to reach "a clear and loyal program of agreement."
</P>
<P>
Out of 577 seats in the French National Assembly, the socialist
holds 56 seats and the communists 23, while the Greens have none.

JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today urged the
IFP youth wing to be mobilized to fight against the current wave
of violent crimes in the country in their preparation for the
1999 general election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an Inkatha Freedom Party Youth Brigade (IFPYB)
annual general conference in Kwazulu/Natal Province, Buthelezi
said the resolutions adopted by the conference had clearly
defined the political work which the IFPYB had to undertake to
prepare for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The IFPYB said, in one of its resolutions, that it had noted
the alarming spate of drug and alcohol abuse in society rapidly
spreading to affect the youth ''in this unacceptable practice
which invariably breeds criminality''.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the increasing crime in the country, Buthelezi
warned that South Africa is " on the edge of becoming a safe
haven for criminals and drug cartels from all over the world."
</P>
<P>
Unless an uncompromising and tough stand is taken against
crime, South Africans are in danger of destroying their lives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at its provincial congress in Durban today,ANC
Youth League in Kwazulu/Natal also called for a meeting with the
IFPYB to work together and explore further avenues to curb crimes
and bring peace to the province.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Kohl Express Firm Determination to Realize EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today expressed their firm
determination to realize the European Monetary Union (EMU) by
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference given after an informal meeting in Bonn,
the two leaders also promised support to the cattle farmers of
Europe, who are heavily hit by the "mad cow" crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans and French will have the same rendez-vous (with
EMU), at the same moment and on the same conditions," local media
quoted Chirac as saying.
</P>
<P>
The EMU is one of the principal terms of the Maastricht Treaty
on the establishment of a single European market.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly determined to apply and realize the criteria of
Maastricht without conditions, and attain them altogether on the
expected date," said the French president.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and Germany share the identical view on
economic and monetary union of Europe, and that the two countries
will cooperate in their fight against unemployment through
"convergence of economic policies."
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that Kohl and he agreed that the two countries
need a "common budgetary vision" and need to decrease their
taxes. "We are happy about the efforts of our central banks to
lower interest rates. We hope the dollar will rise in value," he
said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kohl ruled out the possibility of postponing the
selection of the candidates for joining the unified European money
-- the euro -- from 1997 to 1998.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Official Criticizes US Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's top legislator today
criticized U.S. threats of military action against Iraq following
entry of Iraqi forces into the northern city of Irbil, describing
it as a reckless and irrational act which lacks any moral or
legal justification.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of seeking hegenomy by attempting to
interfere in Iraq's domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
In exclusive statements to the Xinhua correspondent, the
speaker of the Arab and Foreign Relations Committee of Iraq's
National Assembly (parliament), Saadoun Hammady, reminded that
Iraq is an independent state and a member of the United Nations,
whose charter forbids countries from meddling in other's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in his office, the legislator said over the past five
years, the Kurdish area of northern Iraq had been scene of fierce
fighting between rival armed Kurdish factions in which 4,000
people died during 1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery had been used against civilian population,
state property had been stolen and Turkey and Iran had interfered
militarily in the north, endangering Iraq's territorial integrity
and safety, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Hammady said that of late a major faction in the Kurdish north
has sought assistance from the central government and eventually
Iraqi forces entered Irbil to offer help.
</P>
<P>
Now that the mission has accomplished, these forces started to
pull out at orders of the Iraqi leadership, he added.
</P>
<P>
The top lawmaker explained that U.N. Security Council
resolutions do not ban presence of Iraqi troops on the national
soil, either in the north, south or central.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the U.S. will become the aggressor if it uses
force against Iraq, hinting it is a probability under the present
U.S. presidential campaign between President Bill Clinton and his
contender Senator Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his statements to Xinhua, Hammady underlined that
the only remaining option is a return to a national peaceful
settlement, away from attachment to foreign or alien parties
which are plotting against the country's unity.
</P>
<P>
"Let the U.S. lift its guardianship over the Kurds and remove
the 'no fly' zone from northern Iraq," he urged.
</P>
<P>
In its biggest offensive in five years, Iraq sent tanks,
troops and helicopters Saturday to capture Irbil, the largest
city controlled by the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it launched the attack because the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK) had been "cooperating" with Iran. The
state-run Iraqi News Agency said the PUK's rival the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) supported the mission.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish area in northern Iraq has been policed by U.S.-led
forces since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, a 3.5-million-member ethnic minority in Iraq, are
seeking independence from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Western countries set up a safe area in northern Iraq,
including a ban on Iraqi military flights, after the KDP and PUK
joined forces in a 1991 rebellion. The two groups turned on each
other after the enclave was established.

<HEADLINE> National Archives System Takes Shape in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A national system for archive
work has taken shape in China, which has a tradition of preserving
archives, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country there are 3,662 archives with some one
million employees, together with more than 2,600 administrative
organs in charge of archives affairs, said Liu Guoneng,
vice-director of the China State Archives Bureau and vice-head of
the Central Archives. He was speaking at a press conference for
the 13th International Congress on Archives which opened today.
</P>
<P>
China has set up a special education program to train personnel
on archive management. Forty-six percent of employees in the
archives graduated from colleges or universities, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, China implemented its Law on Archives. Amendments were
added to the law by China's highest legislature in last July.
</P>
<P>
China also publishes the "China Archives Journal" newspaper,
the only one of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
China has established contacts with more than 30 countries for
personnel visits and exchanges of archives.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive system of archive undertakings and abundant
resources of archive information have become a guarantee for
China's information business, and the exploitation of archive
resources has brought about considerable benefits, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- French woman astronaut Claudie
Andre-Deshays today returned to earth after spending 16 days in
space on the Russian orbiter ``Mir''.
</P>
<P>
Andre-Deshays and her two Russian colleagues, Yuri Onufrienko
and Yuri Ussachev descended from the capsule of the ``Soyuz-TM23''
space shuttle at 09:42 Paris time at a landing steppe 100
kilometers from Tselinograd in northeast Kasakhstan.
</P>
<P>
``It is very beautiful. It is marvelous and everything went on
well,'' said Andre-Deshays after walking out of the capsule,
followed by the two Russian astronauts who have spent 195 days in
space.
</P>
<P>
Andre-Deshays, sent by the French Space Agency, conducted a
series of experiments on medical, biological, physical and
technological subjects prepared by 40 French laboratories and
companies on the Russian space station 400 kilometers high.
</P>
<P>
She and her two Russian partners began the return flight at
03:00 a.m.. ``Soyuz-TM23'' space shuttle carrying them made two
revolutions around the earth before separating with the ``Mir'' at
06:20.
</P>
<P>
At an altitude of 140 kilometers above earth, ``Soyuz-TM23''
threw away two compartments -- the motor and the ``life module''
and kept only the capsule to continue its journey.
</P>
<P>
When piercing the atmosphere of the earth in four minutes, all
radio communications between the shuttle and the outside were cut.
Communications resumed after the parachutes were opened at an
altitude of eight-10 kilometers above earth.
</P>
<P>
After the last brake was made by Onufrienko with the help of a
retro-rocket one meter above the land, the shuttle landed softly on
earth.
</P>
<P>
The three astronauts were dispatched to the City of Starts in
Moscow soon after their landing.

PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- France today called on Iraqi

the decision by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdrawal
troops from the Kurdish area in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tennis Ace Stich in Reported Austria Tax Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Austrian national radio said on
Monday that German tennis ace Michael Stich was apparently at
loggerheads with Austria's revenue service over how much income
tax he must pay in his adopted Alpine home.
</P>
<P>
ORF radio said Stich, who has lived in the central Austrian
city of Salzburg since 1992, was contesting the bill from local
tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
The tennis pro's tax file was currently being examined by the
Finance Ministry in Vienna, ORF added.
</P>
<P>
The squabble centers whether Stich qualifies for tax relief
under Austria's so-called "skiers' edict" which exempts athletes,
who compete across the globe but reside in Salzburg, from paying
tax on three-quarters of their income.
</P>
<P>
ORF said the tax authorities and Stich also disagreed over
whether income from advertising or sponsors' contracts fell into
the same category as other income.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition Exposes Misery of Endangered Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The international
photojournalism exhibition held in Perpignan, southern France, is
exposing the misery and hazards faced by millions of children
around the world -- crimes, wars, malnutrition, sex slavery and
child labor.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, opened on August 31 until September 15 and held
annually under the title ``Visa pour Image,''is drawing 2,000
professional photo journalists around the world.
</P>
<P>
Among the photos are a Colombian boy whose eyes have been
stolen for sale, a Mozambican girl whose organs were amputated in
a refugee camp, child laborers in brickyards of Colombia and
India, street children killed in Rio de Janeiro, emaciated
children in Somalia, and ``Miss Baby'' beauty competitor in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Iranian photographer Reza, who works for the National Geographic
magazine and the United Nations International Children's Emergency
Fund (UNICEF), is displaying his war pictures taken from Central
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exhibition is repeating ``a daily statement by
photographers: The first victims of conflicts or misery are always
children.''
</P>
<P>
Franseco Zizola, who won last year's ``Visage d'Or Magazine''
prize at the Perpignan photojournalism event for his pictures on
street children killed by death squads in Brazil, returned this year
with pictures on the same subject.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Laffont, who works for the Sygma photo service, is
showing his pictures on child labor in developing countries. ``Do
you know that these children stop to grow after 12 or 13 years of
age because they have to carry bricks on their heads?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Perpignan exhibition is also displaying the ID photos of
12,000 Rwandan children in refugee camps in eastern Zaire, taken by
the UNICEF which is taking care of those children who fled their
countries all alone.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 27,000 Rwandan children went to the refugee camps
without the company of their adults. UNICEF has so far let 14,000 of
them rejoin their families while 18,000 remain in the camps by
themselves.

Under the Ford China Visiting Engineer/Scientist Program, Ford
will help train up to ten Chinese automotive engineers and
scientists each year for the next five years.

The third is an agreement signed between the Ministry of the
Machine-Building Industry and Ford on training Chinese automobile
technicians.

Vaughn Koshkarian, President of Ford Motor (China) Ltd., said
that Ford has so far implemented wide-ranging cooperation with

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua)-- Following are major news

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration vowed Sunday to punish Saddam
Hussein for Iraq's military thrust into the Kurdish enclave in
Northern Iraq, and the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros
Butros-Ghali, suspended the recent agreement to allow Iraq to sell
oil to raise cash for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
-- As he starts the final leg of what is likely to be his last
campaign, Bob Dole says he has figured it out: "We just need to
keep pounding the message and pounding the message."
</P>
<P>
-- The seemingly simple plan to impose a five-year life-time
limit on welfare benefits will require a computer capability that
may take years to develop.

The Washington Post:

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China shows great concern over
South African Leader Nelson Mandella's recent preaching of "dual
recognition," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said
here today.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Mandella's remarks made at a press
conference on August 26 that his country will continue to support
Taiwan, and that he hopes to improve ties with both Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland, Shen said that if South Africa keeps on
preaching "dual recognition," it will be impossible for South
Africa to normalize its relations with China.
</P>
<P>
"The South African leader went so far as to call Taiwan
a 'country', and preached 'dual recognition'," the spokesman
said. "We are greatly concerned with the practice, since it
violated the universally recognized norms of international law and
relevant resolution of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He said it was known to all that there is only one China in the
world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and the government
of the People's Republic of China is China's sole legal
government. This is the fact the United Nations and most countries
in the world have acknowledged, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the Taiwan question is a major issue of
principle that concerns China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, and that the Chinese government will never accept any
form of "dual recognition."
</P>
<P>
China makes no special demands on South Africa concerning the
development of bilateral ties, and only hopes that South Africa
will follow the position on the Taiwan issue held by the UN and
most countries in the world, he added.

"We are now at the turn of the century," he said, adding that
progress is being made in science and technology throughout the
world every day.
</P>
<P>
This will have a profound impact on archives work, he said,
noting that in the foreseeable future, archives work will play an
even greater role in advancing human civilization, and archives
work and the theory of archives will serve social progress to an
even greater degree.
</P>
<P>
Attending the opening ceremony of the congress were 2,600
delegates from all over the world. This is the first time an
international congress on archives has been held in a developing
country since the International Council on Archives was
established in 1950. The ongoing congress is also the last of its
kind to be held in this century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, Jean-Pierre Wallot, president
of the International Council on Archives, said that the congress
will pave the way for the advance of the archives profession

<HEADLINE> Australian Winter Crop Expected to Hit 13-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia's winter crop
production is expected to reach a 13-year high of 28.7 million
tons, the country's chief commodities forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural Resource Economics
(ABARE) said in its latest Crop Report, to be officially released
Tuesday, that the estimated figure was second only to that for the
1983-84 crop.
</P>
<P>
"The combination of excellent opening rains, relatively high
cereal prices and depressed returns for wool are the main reasons
for the increase in plantings," ABARE executive director Brian
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat production was forecast to rise by 11 percent to 18.8
million tons. Last week, the Australian Wheat Board revised
upwards its estimate for 1996-97 wheat production to 17.8 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said there had been a 7-percent increase in plantings
but yields varied in each state, with production in Queensland
forecast to almost triple to 2.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
ABARE also predicted improved prospects for the 1996-97 summer
crop because of good soil moisture levels and expected rainfall in
parts of Queensland.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civil Servants Want Dismissal Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil servants
today remains adamant that they will not return to work until the
government rescinds its decision to dismiss the bulk of its
161,000 workers who are striking for better salaries.
</P>
<P>
The strike by civil servants, pressing for increments of up to
60 percent, entered its 15th day today with no immediate solution
in sight.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of civil servants in Harare converged at Africa Unity
Square today as early as 8.00 am awaiting feedback from their
leaders, who are now waiting for the cabinet decision on the fate
of the dismissed workers.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Civil Servants Negotiating Committee,
Kudakwashe Sinyoro said, "the strike continues. At the moment
there are no negotiations. We are waiting for cabinet's meeting
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The government, apparently relenting to demands by the
workers, last Wednesday announced a 20 percent salary increase
for the civil servants but did not shift its position regarding
the fate of those fired for defying the government order to
return to work.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Florence
Chitauro said she could not withdraw her directive dismissing the
workers without the consent of cabinet, which normally meets on
Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
Civil service workers' representatives are insisting on the
unconditional return of all workers and that Chitauro's dismissal
directive be revoked before they call off the strike.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's health institutions are the hardest hit by the
strike, joined by nurses and doctors. Most hospitals have to
suspend all operations, save for emergency cases.

<P>
"We look into prospects of changing certain regulations to
attract more foreign investments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia ranks first on the list of the Arab countries in
terms of the published figures of foreign capital attracted into
the region to be involved in their industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment in the region stood at around 51
billion dollars by the end of 1995, according to a recent study
by the Arab Corporation for Investment Guarantee, one of the main
inter-Arab financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Arab states still fail to attract a major share
of foreign capital despite an upswing in most of their economies
and improvements in investment laws.
</P>
<P>
Although the Arab region had attracted 1.7 billion dollars in
foreign investment in 1994 and 1.8 billion dollars in 1995, the
amount did not exceed 1 percent of the private investment
worldwide, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Danish Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here
today that his country is working hard to strengthen its legal
system while attaching importance to its economic reform.
</P>
<P>
However, Western countries should not hope that China will copy
their models, since it has its own style of developing democracy
and law, Li said during his meeting with visiting Danish Foreign
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen here today.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Sino-Danish ties, Li said the two countries have a
long history of friendly contacts, and recent years have witnessed
the overall smooth growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li met with Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen in March last
year in Copenhagen while attending the UN summit meeting of social
development, and talked with Rasmussen in March this year during
the Asia-Europe meeting in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Danish trade ties are expanding, and maintaining
bilateral smooth and healthy political ties between the two
countries will help Danish businesses enter the Chinese market,
and also help establish and develop long-term and stable
Sino-Danish cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that there is no rancor or conflict of interest
between the two countries. On the contrary, he added, they share
common interests in safeguarding the peace and promoting
development in the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the economies of China and Denmark are complementary,
great potential exists for expanding bilateral cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said it is normal for the two countries to
hold different views on some problems, due to their different
national situations, cultures, histories and traditions. As long
as there is no political bias, the two sides can reduce
differences and strengthen cooperation by increasing contacts,
holding equal discussions and enhancing understanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should establish their bilateral ties on the
principles of mutual respect and of seeking common ground while
reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Peterson expressed his hope that the current visit will help
increase mutual understanding of the two countries and spur the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Danish-Chinese and European-Chinese ties
should be developed according to the principle of mutual respect,
and constructive political dialogues should be conducted.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Meeting held in March this year should be the
turning point of relations between Denmark and China, as well as
those between Europe and China, he said, adding that such ties
should be further promoted.

Nur Misuari on the signing of the accord and praised the role of
Indonesia's Ambassador, Sastrohandoyo Wiryono, in the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in Mindanao has been enormously costly to the
Philippines in terms of lives lost, communities damaged and
economic development stalled," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the conclusion of the peace accord and the
establishment of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development will usher in a new era of peace and economic
prosperity," he said.

Jiang pointed out that China and Equatorial Guinea have
continuously conducted economic and trade cooperation of mutual
benefit on an equal footing, which has had good results.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to do what it can to help Equatorial Guinea
with its economic construction and to encourage mutually
beneficial and extensive cooperation between the two countries in
various forms.
</P>
<P>
Obiang showed his gratitude for China's long-standing support
of Equatorial Guinea's development.

Jiang noted that African countries are entitled to choose their
own political system and growth mode in accordance with their
national situation and historical and cultural tradition, and no
country has the right to interfere with that.

Since China and the African countries are all developing
countries, an important part of China's foreign policy is to
strengthen its solidarity and cooperation with the African
countries, Jiang pointed out. China backs the African countries'
struggle against external interference and efforts to defend
national sovereignty, he added.

Obiang said the Equatorial Guinean Government believes that the
independence and sovereignty of developing countries should be
preserved, national affairs of each country should be determined

<P>
MOGADISHU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight prisoners in
one of the Islamic courts detention facilities in North Mogadishu
have been fasting from food for the third day today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time such hunger strike starts in the
detention facilities of the Islamic courts in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Reporters who sneaked through the prison without the consent
of the Islamic court officials revealed that the prisoners are
complaining about the lack of accomodation and food.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners added they get no adequate potable water or even
water to wash themselves and their clothes.
</P>
<P>
They said they are also frustrated in their long wait for
their prosecution. "We don't know when we will be tried as we
even don't know why we're imprisoned in the first place," said
one of the prisoners, Major Abdi Nur Dhuhulow, who has been in
the prison for more than a month without being tried.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners also include the 14-year-old Dahir Hassan Jinow
who has been sentenced to death but waiting until he gets mature
a year later, according to the Islamic religion which recognizes
that a man is mature once he is 15.
</P>
<P>
There's no officially stated time how long the prisoners could
be held without being tried. "This just depends upon the mood of
the judges," complained one of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners told the reporters that they will continue their
hunger strike until something is done about their fate.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Islamic courts officials denied making comments
about the prisoners crises.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- It is not only the aspiration
of the Hong Kong compatriots, but also the common goal of the
central government and the entire Chinese people to implement "one
country, two systems" principle and ensure Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing made this remark here today during a
meeting with a delegation of the Alumni Association of Ji'nan
University and the Overseas Chinese University of Hong Kong, led
by its chairmen Hung Stewart and Wong Yam Yin.
</P>
<P>
As a leading trade, financial, shipping and information center
of the Asian-Pacific region, Li said, Hong Kong has played a very
important role for the reform and opening drive of the interior
areas over the past decade, and its unique status is irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will have a high degree of autonomy; no provinces and
municipalities in the inland areas can interfere with the SAR's
affairs within the range of its high-degree autonomy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China's reform has already made remarkable achievements
thanks to the efforts of all of its people.
</P>
<P>
Although there still exist some problems, these problems can be
solved only by carrying out the reform and opening-up further, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to noted that Hong Kong's economy is related closely
to that of the interior areas, and rapid development in the
interior areas will offer a solid foundation for Hong Kong's
continued prosperity.

general trend, and he hopes that the Hong Kong compatriots will
plunge themselves into the cause of Hong Kong's return.

BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today the Chinese government always regards archives as an
"important undertaking" that preserves China's true historical
features.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 13th International Congress on Archives that

archives as important basis for managing national affairs and
stepping up the country's economic construction."
</P>

China's reform, opening up and socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
According to the leader, China has a history of paying close
attention to archives work.

"This fine tradition has enabled the national culture to be
passed down from generation to generation, and enabled Chinese
civilization to retain tremendous cohesiveness," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said archives are the true records of human social
activities, staircases of progress in human civilization and a
major component of the world's cultural heritage.
</P>

Therefore, protecting and developing archives resources
constitute a common responsibility of governments of all countries
and are the "sacred mission" of archives workers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that regular gathering of archives workers
from across the world serves as "an excellent opportunity" to
advance archives work and develop the theory of archives.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Stresses Importance of Maintaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) newspaper Al-Ittihad stressed today the importance of
maintaining the unity of Iraq and the security and stability in
the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the paper called for restoring peace and
putting an end to the military operations in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The paper described what is taking place in northern Iraq as an
endeavor made by Iraq to "establish its sovereignty over its
territory, to restore the unity of both its native soil and its
people with all their races and nationalities."
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that Iraq's attitude is supported by the
Arab parties that are eager for the territorial integrity,
security and stability of Iraq," Al-Ittihad said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. is actually eager for peace to pervade northern
Iraq, it has to continue mediating between the two rival Kurdish
factions in northern Iraq and to allow the oil-for-food deal to be
executed and to end the suffering of Iraqi people because of the
five-year sanctions, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In its biggest offensive in five years, Iraq sent tanks, troops
and helicopters Saturday to capture Irbil, the main city in the
U.S.-protected Kurdish "safe haven" in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it launched the attack because the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) had been " cooperating " with Iran. The state-run
Iraqi news agency said that the PUK's rival, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, asked for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The attack prompted U.S. President Bill Clinton to put
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf on high alert.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein late Sunday
ordered his troops to withdraw from Irbil.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish area in northern Iraq has been policed by U.S.-led
forces since the end of the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq regards the Kurdish safe haven as a violation of its
sovereignty, but it had refrained from launching a major strike
until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds, with a population of 3.5 million in Iraq, are
seeking independence from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries set up the safe area to protect the Kurds
from Iraqi military after a failed 1991 rebellion in which the KDP
and PUK joined forces. The two factions turned on each other after
the safe haven was set up.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Trade Deficit Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean trade deficit
in August of 2.9 billion U.S. was the highest monthly total on
record.
</P>
<P>
The provisional customs clearance trade figures were released
by the International Trade and Industry Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 9.95 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods
in August, down 6.2 percent from the same month last year. But
imports topped 12.85 billion U.S. dollars, up 11.7 percent,
resulting in the high deficit.
</P>
<P>
The August deficit broke the previous record of 2.73 billion
U.S. dollars recorded in the previous month of July.
</P>
<P>
If the current trend continues, South Korea's trade deficit
this year will approach 20 billion U.S. dollars, surpassing the
government's 18 billion U.S. dollar projection, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the exports for August is the worst since
December 1992 when the rate was nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp drop in August exports mainly
to a 52-percent decline over the previous l2 months in
semiconductor exports amounting to 1.02 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The August increase in imports resulted primarily from an
increase in capital goods imports centered on machinery.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Former French Minister Alain Peyrefitte </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with Alain Peyrefitte, former French minister and president of the
editorial committee of "Le Figaro" newspaper, here today.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li described Peyrefitte as "an old friend of the
Chinese people who has worked hard for years to help improve and
develop Sino-French relations," and expressed his joy to meet him
again in four months.
</P>
<P>
"We were glad to notice the marked improvements and development
of Sino-French relations," Li said, adding the Chinese government
praises President Jacques Chirac's China policy and appreciates
his important contributions to the improvement of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said there are great potential and wide prospects for
bilateral cooperation in all spheres, including political,
economical and diplomatic fields.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries keep expanding their bilateral economic
cooperation in terms of scale and contents, and they have more and
more points in common in dealing with world affairs," he
added. China is willing to see France play a still greater role in
European and world affairs.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Peyrefitte on China's efforts and achievements in
maintaining sustained economic growth and curbing inflation, and
on the key aspects of his country's current economic work.
</P>
<P>
"The development of China will bring benefits not only to the
Chinese people themselves, but will be favorable to the world as a
whole," Li said. It is wrong to regard China's growth as a threat
to other countries, or to consider China's contribution to the
world trivial."
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte cited Premier Li Peng's visit to France four months
ago as a great success both politically and economically. He said
the Chirac government attaches importance to developing its ties
with east Asia, and particularly China, and holds that
France-China relations will become increasingly important at the
time when the 21st century is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
He said France explicitly regards the Taiwan issue as China's
internal affair, in which it will never interfere. As for the
issue of human rights, the former minister said that, as
reaffirmed by President Chirac, France holds that each country can
have its own points of view, and the correct approach is to go in
for positive dialogue rather than confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He agreed to Li's principle of "seeking common points while
shelving differences."
</P>
<P>
Peyrefitte was here for the "21st Century Forum" to be held
September 4-6 at the sponsorship of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairman Meets Danish Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met
here this afternoon with visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels
Helveg Petersen to discuss issues concerning the exchanges and
cooperation between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Tian gave an account of the NPC's organizational structure and
its work, saying that the group is busy formulating the framework
of the socialist market economy, which should be complete by the
end of this century.
</P>
<P>
He said the Eighth NPC has examined and approved more than 80
economic laws and is expected to agree to another 50 laws at the
beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tian said China is not a country without laws to go by, but
rather one with a gradually developing and sound legal system.
</P>
<P>
Overall, China is implementing laws well, but problems still
exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The main task that we are confronted with is to put laws into
action, and to let every Chinese citizen know and abide by laws,
in order to turn China onto an orbit with a high degree of
democracy and legal system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian said it will not be easy to realize this goal, and a great
deal of work needs to be done in order to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
"But we believe that it is bound to be achieved under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian said he hopes that both China and Denmark will draw on
each other's experiences and help each other to make up for
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
Petersen expressed his appreciation for China's achievements in
building a legal system, and said that Denmark is willing to
strengthen its exchanges and cooperation with China in this
regard.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong and Shanghai

the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
</P>
<P>

Customers will, with effect from today, be able to use their
HongkongBank electronic banking and credit cards that are issued
in Hong Kong to withdraw Renminbi and check account balance at

Customers can withdraw a maximum of RMB 3,000 yuan with each
transaction, up to a maximum daily equivalent of 10,000 HK
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Langley, HongkongBank customers will have access
to 30 ATMs in Guangzhou. That will be increased to about 200
within the next six months and will also cover the nearby cities
of Zengcheng, Huadu, Panyu and Conghua.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Rules for Russian Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian banks which wish to
enter the Chinese market must have reliable credit records, a
global banking system and strict and scientific management,
Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press at the Chinese Embassy,
Li, who arrived here on Friday for an official visit, proposed
that coordination could be first established between large banks
with good credit records who could guarantee the flow of business
funds.
</P>
<P>
China would allow foreign banks to enter its market
step-by-step, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also the chairman of the Chinese State Commission
for Economic Restructuring, said the reform of state-owned
enterprises was a crucial part of China's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
He explained that China was restructuring state businesses
through improving the internal management mechanism and external
environment, as well as resolving problems left over from the past.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, formerly the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs,
Li said that China was qualified for the organization but it could
not accept some western countries' demands which did not apply to
China's conditions.
</P>
<P>
On China's trade with Russia, Li stressed that the target
volume of 20 billion U.S. dollars by the end of the century, as
set by the leaders of the two countries, was not only possible but
also necessary.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that large businesses of the two countries should
step up their progress in understanding each other, and in finding
ways for various kinds of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the two sides to strengthen legislation on
investment.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Li has met with Russian Economic Minister
Yevgeny Yasin, Finance Minister Alexander Livshits and Central
Bank Governor Sergei Dubinin.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing to Further Curb Automobile Exhaust Fumes Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing City in southwest
China's Sichuan Province is to drive pollution-causing vehicles
off the roads.
</P>
<P>
The city has issued a regulation which bans motor vehicles with
excessive exhaust fume emission from using the highways.
</P>
<P>
It is a fresh effort made by China's only big industrial city
which depends on motor vehicles as means of communications and
does not have the usual large bicycle flows on its streets.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, effective from September 10, stipulates that
drivers will be punished and their licenses be withdrawn if they
violate the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous Chongqing City has been facing serious problems
from exhaust fumes with the rapid growth in the number of its cars
and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1995 the number of vehicles in the city
increased from 100,000 to 180,000, while the city's road network
only increased by 5.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The crowded and extended use of motor vehicles has created a
one-meter high exhaust fume belt along major highways in the city,
which has greatly affected the health of local people.
</P>
<P>
In the move to curb tailgate pollution, the new regulation says
each motor vehicle must pass an exhaust emission check before it
can receive a certificate to run on the city's highways.
</P>
<P>
The regulation further stipulates that new motor vehicles
produced in the city must meet the requirement of exhaust emission
levels before it is sold.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing produced 190,000 motor vehicles and 2.4 million
motorcycles last year. Its motorcycle output accounted for one
third of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Sends Peace Mission to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has sent a peace
mission to Sudan to make peace between the two neighboring
countries, the local newspaper Monitor reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Citing an informed diplomatic source, the report said that
Martin Aliker, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs in charge of
international affairs of Uganda, and Babatunde Thomas, Resident
Representative of the United Nations Development Program, left
for Khartoum, capital of Sudan, over the weekend to broker a peace
deal for normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified government official said that "the minister is
on a special mission."
</P>
<P>
A top officer of the External Security Organization under the
Defense Ministry told the newspaper that "by Friday we were
waiting for a response from Khartoum whether they will accept our
team or not."
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, the Minister of State for Defense, said in
parliament last week: "Uganda remains fully committed to peace
and good neighborliness and appreciates initiatives so far
conducted in Tripoli, Libya and in Malawi in a bid to normalize
relations between Uganda and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed the Ministry of Defense Affairs is presently in the
process of taking up the matter to a wider diplomatic circle," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malawian President Bakili Muluzi mediated between Sudan and
Uganda without success because Sudan could not meet conditions
from Uganda, said Rebecca Kadaga, the State Minister for Foreign
Affairs in charge of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But she could neither confirm nor deny the report about the
peace mission to Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts Made by Tibet and Swiss Train Rural Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has once again redoubled
its efforts to train a new contingent of barefoot doctors - with
help from the International Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
And the Swiss-based Red Cross is even buying horses - or
bicycles - so that the new generation of health providers do not
have to go barefoot.
</P>
<P>
About 500 people, mainly from poor rural areas where medical
help is scarce, have been trained to provide health care for
people in their isolated villages.
</P>
<P>
China's Tibet Red Cross and the International Red Cross drew up
the plan to create an army of "rural charitable staff members" to
improve medical service for local women and children, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross paid its first visit in 1988 to Xigaze, a city
west of Tibet's capital, Lhasa, at the invitation of the late
tenth Panchen Lama and the China Red Cross. Since then it has
offered aid of about eight million yuan to the area.
</P>
<P>
Most of the trainees were from remote areas, where medical
services are poor, and which lacked both money and well-trained
doctors, a local red cross official said.
</P>
<P>
After training, trainees are required to return to their home
villages and work for local people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross paid for the trainees' uniforms,
medicines, medical equipment, and horses or bikes for those
working in areas with less developed traffic.
</P>
<P>
The trainees are expected to work as "bare-foot doctors", who
were prevalent in China's countryside in the late 1960s and the
1970s, according to Canmuqoi, a woman principal of the District
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
Many of the original barefoot doctors have retired, or changed
their jobs. As a result, medical services became poorer in the
region's farming and stock breeding areas.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials often investigated the work of its staff
members to make sure that their medical work improved, the local
Red Cross official said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Zeindl and Anne Cronin, the fourth group of resident
representatives of the Xigaze Office of the Red Cross arrived in
Tibet last year. The couple expressed satisfaction with the work
of the members of the Xigaze Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
"We are volunteers, and we love Tibet and Tibetan people,"
Zeindl said.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, it is no easy to spread medical and health services

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Close to Arranging Netanyahu- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestinian
officials are intensifying contacts today on arranging a meeting
between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat held intensive talks
with Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Dore Gold in Tel Aviv at the
residence of Terje Larsen, Norwegian mediator for the Middle East
peace talks and U.N. coordinator for the territories.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, together with his wife and Norwegian diplomat Mona
Juul, has facilitated the 1993 Oslo accords between Israel and
Palestinians and a recent series of secret talks to break the
deadlock of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the two sides have bridged some gaps
in arranging the Netanyahu-Arafat meeting. Netanyahu has been
briefed on the latest contacts and has discussed the matter with
his Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Erekat has flied to Gaza to report to Arafat on the
latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted Palestinian officials as saying that the
two sides were expected to announce the meeting "in coming
hours." But Netanyahu's media adviser Shai Bazak said no date
has been set.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian representative in east
Jerusalem, said that, while the meeting between Netanyahu and
Arafat was preferable to take place this week, the Palestinian
side would not pay any price for it.
</P>
<P>
He added the two leaders must discuss the implementation of
the signed agreements during the meeting, rather than provide
only a photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-Arafat meeting is expected to help ease the
rising tension between the two sides over last week after Arafat
called for large-scale protests against Israel's hardline
policies on settlements and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu gave a clear signal that he would
meet with Arafat soon, reversing an earlier strong stand. But he
said such a meeting would only be based on developments and not
on any date.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Gross Foreign Debt Surpasses 85 Billion U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's gross foreign
debt had amounted to 85.83 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
March this year, up 6.85 billion U.S. dollars from the end of
last year, the Finance and Economy said here today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the foreign debt increase to the
swelling current account deficit and increased foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Considering the current account deficit of 11.66 billion U.S.
dollars at the end of July, the gross foreign debt is expected to
break through the 100-billion-U.S.-dollar mark within this year,
according to a ministry official.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's gross foreign debt fell from 46.76 billion U.S.
dollars in 1985 to 29.37 billion U.S. dollars in 1989 thanks to
brisk exports in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, it turned around for a reverse, increasing to 31.7
billion U.S. dollars in 1990, to 42.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1992
and further to 56.85 billion U.S. dollars in 1994 to exceed the
70-billion-U.S.-dollar mark in July last year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's net foreign debt, or the gross foreign debt minus
the nation's overseas assets, totaled 21.58 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of March, surpassing the 20-billion-U.S.-dollar level
for the first time since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Overseas assets reached an all-time high of 64.24 billion U.S.
dollars in March, mainly thanks to increased investment abroad.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange holdings of the Bank of Korea, South Korea's
the central bank, amounted to 36.56 billion U.S. dollars at the end
of June, up 3.11 billion U.s. dollars from three months before.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- According to documents obtained from the European Union,
Brussels succeeded between 1990 and 1995 in hiding the risk of
"mad cow" disease in order to avoid panic among the consumers and
paralysis of the European beef market.
</P>
<P>
-- If Saddam Hussein was a "strategic illiterate" when he
invaded Kuwait several years ago, this time he could have coolly
calculated before crossing the line into the exclusion zone, set
up by the Western allies, in northern Iraq. Saddam Hussein had
three pretexts to launch the offensive: inter-Kurdish fighting,
Iranian intervention, and the threat of Kurdish forces to the
security of oil export route.
</P>
<P>
-- Saddam Hussein could have offered Bill Clinton "an October
surprise" to show the military muscle to the United States just
before the presidential election on November 5. He could also
have taken advantage of the timing of the presidential election to
invade the exclusion zone, where the situation is extremely
complicated that makes Clinton hesitate to risk American lives to
make an intervention.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Saddam Hussein has launched a new war. Iraqi forces have
widened their operation after taking last Saturday Irbil, the main
city of northern Iraq which had escaped the control of Baghdad
since 1991. Iraqi Defense Ministry said Sunday evening that Saddam
Hussein has "given order to bring our forces back to their
previous positions."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry said Sunday that "on judicial bases,
the U.N. Security Council resolutions don't ban the military
presence of Iraqi forces in the provinces of northern Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
-- More than 12,000 Frenchmen and Frenchwomen commit suicide
each year, 4,000 higher than the yearly deaths from
traffic accidents. Of the people who killed themselves, young
people aged between 25 and 34 account for 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
More Frenchwomen have attempted to commit suicide than men, but
their rate of success in killing themselves is lower than that of
men, with one success in 160 attempts compared with one in 22
among men.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Kowloon Railway Boosts Confidence in 1997: HK Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sunday's inaugural
service of Beijing-Kowloon Railway hit the headlines in the local
press in Hong Kong today, which said that the 2,500-km
thoroughfare will enhance economic and trade links between Hong
Kong and the vast hinterland in China.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said that as China's biggest railroad project of the
 century, the Beijing-Kowloon railway will create more investment
opportunities in China for Hong Kong businessmen and help to make
a more prosperous Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tin Tin Daily said that the railroad will strengthen Hong
Kong's role as an entreport, boost the tourism industry, and make
more convenient the supply of food from the mainland to the
territory.
</P>
<P>
As the second railway trunk line linking the north and south,
the Beijing-Kowloon railroad runs across 98 cities and towns in
nine provinces in China. The other line is between Beijing and
Guangzhou, the capital city of southern Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Some people in industrial and business circles sang highly of
the significance of the railroad in their articles carried on
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Eddy S.H. Li, president of China and Hong Kong Economic and
Trade Association, said that the opening of railway shows the
importance the Chinese government has attached to the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland, and at the same time boost Hong Kong
people's confidence in the handover next year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Government Plans to Spur Export of Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
is planning to give substantial support to some export items
including coffee, the country's largest foreign exchange earner,
according to a report by the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report Sunday quoted Fantaye Biftu, Trade and Finance
Subsection Head at the Prime Minister's Office, as saying that
export items receiving government support this fiscal year are
coffee, meat, textile, leather and leather products, as well as
fruits, vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Tantaye disclosed that the Ethiopian government will shortly
announce its foreign trade support package.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will bolster quality control and
extension services for growers with a view to maintain the supply
of coffee and huge sum of hard currency it earns the country.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government has also designed the country's
foreign trade strategy which is aimed at diversifying export
items and set up a team headed by the prime minsiter to oversee
its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia exported 102,000 tons of coffee in the last fiscal
year, the highest exported volume in its trade history. However,
it earned only 279.5 million US Dollars from the export, lower
than the 300.9 million it received for exporting 78,420 tons of
coffee in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia plans to export 108,000 tons of coffee this fiscal
year, 6,000 tons more than that of last fiscal year. The decline
of coffee price in the international market forces the coffee
exporting countries including ethiopia to diversify their export
items. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Chengde, one of China's
holiday attractions in Hebei Province, is to boost its tourism
industry by improving urban ecological conditions, and readjusting
its economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Chengde is a summer resort built 200 kilometers from Beijing by
the imperial family in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). It attracts
two million Chinese and overseas tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The city became a World Heritage site in 1994, and has enjoyed
priority in development by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
According to vice-mayor Chang Xing, the city will carry out
projects, such as expanding the central heating system and
planting more trees, lawns and flowers, to reduce air pollution
and protect historic relics.
</P>
<P>
At present the city's central heating system covers 1.6 million
square meters of urban area.
</P>
<P>
It is building a thermal power plant, with a loan of 55 million
US dollars from the Asian Development Bank, to supply all urban
homes with cooking gas by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan the city's green coverage rate will be expanded
by three to five percentage points by the end of this century, up
from the present 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the pollution problem, Chengde will concentrate on
changing its industrial structure," the vice-mayor said.
</P>
<P>
It plans to develop electronics and food-processing industries,
while transforming heavy industry.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Denies Interference in Somalia's Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today refuted an allegation that
Malaysia aggravated the conflict in Somalia, saying that his
government never interfered in the internal affairs of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Somalia is their problem.... We have
nothing to do with that and why should we meddle in their
affairs," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could not spare the time to involve itself in any
activity that could be construed as interference or aggravating
the situation in Somalia, he added.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a news report from Mogadishu that two
Somalian faction leaders, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Ali, had
accused Malaysia of aggravating the country's conflict.
</P>
<P>
The two faction leaders claimed they had information that
Malaysia planned to set up a bank and a communication facility in
areas controlled by their rival Hussein Aidid who took over power
from his late father Mohamed Farah Aidid in early August.
</P>
<P>
The two Somalian leaders were reported to have condemned in a
joint statement what they described as Malaysia's "deceptive and
disruptive" actions in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that Malaysia's private company representatives
might have gone to Somalia to explore business and investment
opportunities there, noting that what the private sector was doing
was its own business.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia in fact wants good cooperation with Somalia and it is
Malaysia's policy not to interfere in the internal affairs of
other countries, which include Somalia, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Mobile Phone Number Stealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Postal authorities and
security departments have joined forces in a battle against a
growing problem of mobile phone theft.
</P>
<P>
The clampdown has so far led to 37 people being sent to prison
in China for being involved in the mobile phone crimewave.
</P>
<P>
Officials declared war on the problem because criminals were
profiteering by stealing mobile phone numbers from their owners.
</P>
<P>
In China, a growing number of outlaws are making and selling
fake mobile phone sets with numbers stolen from their legal
holders. This has brought huge losses to both users and
telecommunication enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The crack-down started in June 1995, when a national conference
was held to discuss ways of curbing the crime which has increased
rapidly in recent years, according to the Beijing-based People's
Posts and Telecommunications News.
</P>
<P>
Special offices jointly run by local postal and security
departments have been set up in 20 provinces and 85 cities, while
some provinces and cities have installed mobile phone monitoring
systems.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. By the end of June this year, 1,871
cases were discovered across the country, 2,202 criminals arrested
and 163 underground "mobile phone workshops" were closed. So far,
37 people have been sentenced to imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Girl with Giant Tongue Accepts Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese teenage girl with a
giant tongue has received surgery, and is looking forward to
leading a normal life, the overseas edition of People's Daily
reports today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yuxue, aged 16, of the Bouyei nationality from Furong
village in Pingtang county in southwest China's Guizhou Province,
was born with her tongue extending out of her mouth. The tongue
became bigger and bigger as she grew up.
</P>
<P>
By this year her tongue extended out of her mouth about 13
centimeters, and measured 7.5 centimeters in width and four
centimeters in thickness. This made it difficult for her to talk
or eat meals, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper said Liu lives in a poverty-stricken
area, and her parents could not afford a surgery for her.
</P>
<P>
Having heard about Liu's sufferings, a machinery factory in
Nanyang city, in central China's Henan Province, donated 30,000
yuan to pay for Liu's medical care, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Liu underwent successful surgery in a local military
hospital. The factory promised they will help Liu find a job after
her recovery.

are numerous opportunities in that region for joint-venture
projects in infrastructure development, highways, oil and gas,
tourism related industries, primary commodities and agro-based
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the last six years, there was a significant

"As countries of the South, we can complement each other and
tap our abundant resources. Malaysia and Latin American countries
can become partners in progress," he said.

<P>
Malaysia has signed trade and investment agreements as well as
bilateral payment arrangement agreements with Latin American
countries.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Capital Urged to Crack Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The residents here have
urged government bodies concerned to crack down what are commonly
known as pornographic and violent "video-houses" which are
"leading the youth to sink in depravity".
</P>
<P>
According to a report here today, the residents said more and
more children are becoming victims of ill-fate because of the
pornographic and violent video-houses that are operating
underground to avoid legal action.
</P>
<P>
They said offensive and immoral video films are being shown in
the shanty houses located within easy reach of children.
</P>
<P>
"These so-called video houses present many dangers for our
children. They show them films which could lead to a constant
indulgence in bad habits," a teacher was quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
The teacher stressed the need to build more healthy
recreational centers for the youth so that they keep away from
"such deplorable places".
</P>
<P>
Many residents said issuing a decree to ban the importation of
films which contravene the moral values of the society could be a
solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Most of the residents agreed on the need to coordinate
government and individual efforts to curb the problems being
caused by the pornographic and violent "video-houses", the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Troops Withdraw from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government
announced this morning that its troops have withdrawn from the
northern Iraqi city of Irbil, the scene of a fierce battle on the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein chaired Sunday night a cabinet
meeting, at which Defense Minister Sultan Hashim Ahmed said that
he was instructed by the president to bring back the Iraqi troops
in northern Iraq to their former positions after they have
successfully accomplished their mission, the Baghdad Television
said.
</P>
<P>
Hashim Ahmed also reviewed the tasks undertaken by some units
of the Iraqi armed forces in northern Iraq, including the help
they extended to Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP), at his own request.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi troops Saturday shelled the positions of the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan (PUK) around Irbil and later captured the city,
20 kilometers inside the safe haven carved out by the U.S.-led
forces to protect the Kurds from the government forces attacks in
1991.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government said that the military attacks were
launched against the PUK, "because it had been cooperating
recently with Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iraq accused Iran of backing the PUK, but Tehran has denied
the charges.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton cut his election campaign to direct
a message to the Iraqi president over Irbil crisis, according to
the Voice of America (VOA).
</P>
<P>
the VOA quoted Clinton as saying that he has already placed the
American troops in the Middle East in full alert and
reinforcements will be sent to them.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the U.S. will do its best in cooperation
with other countries that share with it its concerns regarding the
situation in northern Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Importers in Zanzibar
will continue paying the old, preferential customs duty rate for
essential items.
</P>
<P>
A Zanzibar government spokesman said the importers would be
paying the 1995/96 tax rate of 15 percent, instead of the new
rate of 30 percent announced by the Tanzania Revenue Authority
(TRA) in June, this year.
</P>
<P>
The essential items include rice, wheat flour, sugar, edible
oils as well as textiles and garments. The goods could be
re-exported to the mainland without any restrictions and without
paying additional duties, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a meeting between the union and Isles
authorities at the Zanzibar State House yesterday. It was
attended by Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, Bank of Tanzania
Governor Idris Rashidi and TRA Commissioner General Melkizedeck
Sanare.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the agreement should be honoured by both
parts of the country as it is intended to strengthen the country
and ease the flow of trade between the mainland and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar businessmen unhappy with the TRA rate have lately
been boycotting consumer goods imports to the Isles.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Set up Job Center for Foreign Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A governmental job center
aimed at dealing with jobless foreign nationals in Kuwait would
be set up soon in the country, which depends mainly on foreign
labor in its economic activities.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the English-language daily
Kuwait Times, which was published today, Undersecretary for Social
Affairs and Labor Abdilrahman al-Mazroui said the job center would
link companies or individuals needing expatriate labor.
</P>
<P>
The decision is aimed at unearthing the jobless among the
expatriates living here and follows the singular objective of
seeking out solutions for those who have legal work permits but
are jobless, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the role of this job center will be to
re-install the skilled jobless foreign laborers in order to meet
the temporary demand."
</P>
<P>
This is considered as part of the efforts by the government to
solve the problems faced by the jobless and surplus foreign
labor in Kuwait, which represent a huge number.
</P>
<P>
From September last year, some 60 sponsors have not provided
jobs to thousands of workers whose residence remains valid,
forcing them to turn to vending, begging, or car washing.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Ahmed al-Klaib
recently underlined the need to reduce the presence of
non-working foreign nationals in Kuwait via the creation of a job
service center.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the phenomenon would cause unfavorable impacts
on the Kuwaiti society if it is not overcome properly.
</P>
<P>
The rampant labor traffic by some unlawful sponsors in the
country has added seriousness to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 1 million workers of 132 nationalities in
Kuwait, 600,000 of them are currently employed in the private
sector while the rest work in the public sector.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Alliance Wins Most Parliamentary Seats in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri
and his allies won most of the 19 parliamentary seats allocated
for Beirut in the third of the five-phase general elections in
Lebanon, election officials told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics made by the Interior Ministry election
committee until the midday, 14 candidates in Hariri's 17-member
"Beirut's Decision" alliance have emerged as winners in Sunday's
election in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Only three candidates from rival alliances have managed to
wrest slots from the chink of Hariri's strong hand. They are
Salim al-Hoss and Mohammed Yousef Baidoun of the "Salvation and
Change" alliance led by Hoss and Najah Wakim of the "People's
List" alliance.
</P>
<P>
Two remaining seats have been obtained by independent
candidates, Tammam Salam, son of former Sunni Premier and founder
of the Republic Saeb Salam, and Ghassan Matar, a Maronite.
</P>
<P>
The result will be officially announced by Interior Minister
Michel al-Murr this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hariri, the other 13 winning candidates in his
alliance are: Salim Diab, Bahaeddin Itani, Adnan Arakji, Hussein
Yatim, Khaled Saeb, Michel Pharoan, Bichara Mirhej, Yegya
Jerejain, Khatchik Babekian, Hagop Demirjain, Aghob Jokhadrian,
Abraham Dede Yam and Jamil Chamas.
</P>
<P>
All the Islamic fundamentalist candidates, both of the Sunni
Al-Ahbash and the Shiite Hezbollah, were defeated in Sunday's
election.
</P>
<P>
This was the second defeat of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, after it lost a parliamentary seat in the first
round of election in Mount Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The turnout throughout Beirut was put at around 31 percent,
the lowest in the three rounds of election which have been held,
with the first in Mount Lebanon on August 18 and the second in
northern Lebanon on August 25.
</P>
<P>
The predominantly Moslem western sector of Beirut appeared to
be reluctant to go to the polls and the predominantly Christian
sector was even less enthusiastic, the Beirut conservative daily
An-Nahar said this morning.
</P>
<P>
The independent newspaper attributed the low turnout to the
resentment of Moslems on divisions and intense rivalries among
Moslem candidates and the disappointment by Christians on the
outcome of the election in Mount Lebanon where most Christian
opposition candidates were defeated.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the multi-billionaire Hariri, 52,
rising from the south Lebanese port city of Saida, to participate
in the general elections as both a candidate and voter in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
After the victory in the general elections, Hariri will have a
dual-capacity of a deputy in the house and the prime minister of
the government.

<HEADLINE> Japanese RTC to Take over Debts of Failed Credit Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Resolution and Collection
Bank, the Japanese version of the U.S. Resolution Trust
Corp.(RTC), was formed today to take over debts of failed credit
unions, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. RTC, set up in 1989, is a governmental organization
responsible for disposing of real estate and other property of
financial groups.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC was founded on the basis of the reorganized
Tokyo Kyodou Bank, which was established in January 1995 with an
aim to clear up the bankrupt Tokyo Kyowa Credit Association and
Anzen Credit Bank, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Kyodou Bank suffered a cumulative loss of 34.1
billion yen (341 million U.S. dollars) in its annual account
settlement on March 31, since most of loans taken over from Tokyo
Kyowa and Anzen became nonperforming due to the fall in land
values.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC bank now holds 40 billion yen (400 million
dollars) of capital, which is expected to rise to 160 billion yen
(1.6 billion dollars) on September 25 when Deposit Insurance
Corp., a security body for depositors, invests 120 billion yen
(1.2 billion dollars) in.
</P>
<P>
Then the staff of the new bank will also increase from
currently 170 to more than 200.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo-based bank has decided to open an office in Osaka,
which will be in charge of the transfer of healthy and recoverable
loans from the failed Osaka-headquartered Kizu Credit Union to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese RTC is also planning to take over and recover bad
loans of three other failed credit unions in western Japan.

<HEADLINE> Home Brands Dominant in Chinese Beer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Beer produced by solely
domestically owned breweries are dominating the Chinese market,
despite the ambitious efforts made by Sino-foreign joint ventures
to sell foreign brands locally.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that home brands make up 98 percent of
the domestic market share, according to "China Industrial and
Commercial Times".
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's beer output totaled 15.46 million tons,
while 60 Sino-overseas joint venture breweries in the country
turned out 300,000 tons, merely two percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese entrepreneurs from the beer industry said that
competition from foreign brands have a positive effect on the
industry, as Chinese breweries have had to pay greater attention
to upgrading their technology and quality.

<HEADLINE> Capital Account Incomes Attributed to Rising Reserves: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The continuing rapid increase
in China's foreign exchange reserves is largely attributed to
growing income in the capital account, said Zhou Xiaochuan,
director-general of the State Administration of Exchange Control
(SAEC).
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China had foreign exchange reserves
valued at 86.6 billion US dollars at the end of June, up from 21.2
billion US dollars at the end of 1993 and from 73.6 billion US
dollars at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China will make greater efforts to perfect
supervision over the capital account, which includes direct
investment, international loans and security trading.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will include improving the foreign exchange buying and
selling system, and drawing a clearer line between transactions
under the capital account and the current account, which includes
trade, labor and tourism as well as normal short-term banking and
credit facilities, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that foreign exchange under the capital account
must not be mixed with that under the current account, and never
be allowed to flow into and out of China without approval from
SAEC.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to enhance the management and control
on the size of China's foreign debt, presently 110 billion US
dollars, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The statistical and supervisory system for foreign debt will
also be updated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou revealed that in response to an accelerated pace of the
yuan's move toward convertibility under the current account, China
will gradually establish a trading market for transactions between
the local currency, the renminbi yuan, and foreign currencies.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Official Visits World Heritage Sites In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Importance should be attached
to environmental, social and cultural factors during economic
expansion to achieve a sustainable development, according to a
United Nations official.
</P>
<P>
Bernd von Droste, Director of UNESCO's World Heritage Center,
said in an interview with Xinhua that although tourism is a good
way of promoting World Heritage sites among the public, unchecked
expansion of the industry for short-term economic gains will
endanger the preservation of the sites, causing harm to both
heritage and economic development.
</P>
<P>
He called for the promotion of a tourism industry that is
environmental sustainable, socially acceptable, and culturally
sensitive.
</P>
<P>
Von Droste is currently on a visit to World Heritage sites in
China at the invitation of the Chinese National Commission for
UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
He has visited the Forbidden City in Beijing, Peking Man site
at Zhoukoudian on the outskirts of the Chinese capital of Beijing,
and the Mountain Resorts in Chengde of north China's Hebei
province near Beijing. His itinerary will also take him to Mount
Huangshan in east China's Anhui province and the city of Suzhou in
east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO director expressed his approval of the local
authorities' and people's efforts in preserving the Mountain
Resort in Chengde -- the summer residence of imperial families in
the Qing Dynasty about 200 kilometers northeast of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An expert on forestry, von Droste also give suggestions on the
improvement of air quality, construction of new scenery, and
vegetation coverage on surrounding hills.
</P>
<P>
The UN official added that he "expects that there will be more
new sites in China that will become World Heritages."... Since
"China is a vast country with the longest historical record, and
comprises of many different cultures, as well as different
environmental and ecological situations."
</P>
<P>
China signed the World Heritage Convention in 1985, and 14
natural and cultural sites, including the Great Wall, the
terracotta warriors in the mausoleum of the first emperor (259-210
B.C.)of Qin Dynasty (221-206 B.C.), and the Mogao grottoes in
Dunhuang have been established as World Heritage Sites.
</P>
<P>
China has submitted a tentative list, including 58 sites such
as the Temple of Heaven in Beijing and the gardens in Suzhou, to
the World Heritage center to appraise during the next five to ten
years as possible future World Heritage Sites.

ISLAMABAD, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports to Asian
countries and regions in 1995-96 amounted to 120.2 billion rupees
(3.4 billion US dollars), showing an increase of 20 percent over

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Rules out Amendment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Parliament speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq-Nouri has ruled out any amendment to the constitution
to enable President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to run for the third
term.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the local press today carried the statement by the
hardline speaker, who told local reporters that there will be no
amendment to the constitution to enable Rafsanjani to run for the
presidency again.
</P>
<P>
"Such an amendment will not be in the interest of the Islamic
system," he said, referring to the recent call by Rafsanjani's
supporters for a nationwide referendum on amending the
constitution in a bid to seek a third term of presidency for
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The law in Iran does not allow a third consecutive term in
office by Rafsanjani who is now serving his second term in
the office. His presidency will expire by July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri said such an amendment will implicitly mean that
there is no other efficient person than President Rafsanjani in
Iran to shoulder the task and this will be a catastrophe for the
country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "the constitution of the Islamic Republic
should not be amended under any pretext as it will make the
constitution weak and shaky."
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that even the president himself has
explicitly announced his opposition to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
As to the likelihood of his nomination for the next
presidential elections, the speaker said he does not intend to
run for president unless he finds it indispensable.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I feel that it is obligatory for me to run for
president, I will do so as any other Iranian should do," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jumhuri Islami said in its editorial
Sunday that President Rafsanjani can not be re-elected to the
office because of explicit constitutional provisions in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Jumhuri Islami is the mouthpiece of the hardliners headed by
Parliament Speaker Nateq-Nouri and has indirect support from
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Construction projects, including those with total investment of

but with serious construction problems, are to be the subject of
strict investigations conducted by authorities in the city.
</P>
<P>
The investigations will pay special attention to the
construction of luxury hotels in the city.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as the construction industry has prospered
from the booming real estate businesses in the city, profiteering
and corruption in the process of bidding and construction have
been rampant.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges Japan to Repent Its Aggression History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan should never seek to
become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council before it
reckons with its history of aggression during World War Two, the
Rodong Sinmun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
said in a commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Japan is now trying hard to be a big political power and
realize its dreams of expansion abroad by avoiding repenting its
invasion overseas, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary came just before the opening of the U.N. General
Assembly and after the recent visits by Japan's prime minister and
foreign minister to Latin America and the Mid-East.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Japan has been working hard to solicit
support from these regions by offering economic assistance, though
a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council is not a thing that
can be bought by money.
</P>
<P>
Japan committed horrible crimes against mankind 50 years ago,
but even today it still refuses to atone, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the Japanese prime minister, cabinet ministers
and lawmakers have, one on another's heels, paid homage to the
Yasukuni Shrine that honors class-A war criminals.
</P>
<P>
All this shows that Japan should honestly reflect on its
invasion history and really improve its world image before it
could possibly be a permanent member in the Security Council,
the commentary added.

JERUSALEM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police and the
Customs Service narcotics unit have cracked a cocaine smuggling
ring, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ring was composed of three Israelis and two
Venezuelans. The Israelis, Gil Atzmon, 36, Meir Shubat, 34, and

then returned to Israel and, after a short stay, traveled to
Bogota, Columbia where he recruited the Venezuelans to smuggle
cocaine to Israel in false-bottomed suitcases.
</P>
<P>
Atzmon, aware that police might be following him and
monitoring his phone conversations, took steps to cover his
tracks. On August 22, he allegedly returned from another visit
to Columbia, where he purchased a quantity of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Atzmon and his followers arrived at the
Ben-Gurion Airport and they were seen talking to each other in
the arriving lounge. Then, one of them was seen greeting an
alleged Venezuelan courier, who had landed from France.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan took a cab, with Atzmon following behind. At a
Tel Aviv hotel, they were met by Dar and Shubat, who loaded two
suitcases containing six kilograms of cocaine into the car. The
four were then arrested.
</P>
<P>
Police were informed that another six kilograms of cocaine were
 due to arrive with another Venezuelan courier, and a publication
ban was put on the whole case. On August 31, police and customs
officers arrested the alleged courier, who was found in possession
of the drug, with a street value of one million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Iron and Steel Company on Way to Greater Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Anshan Iron and Steel Company
(Angang), the largest in China, is forging forward on the road to
success.
</P>
<P>
With its annual steel output leading the country by reaching
8.6 million tons, the company, in northeast China's Liaoning
Province, plans to pour 21 billion yuan into technological
improvement program.
</P>
<P>
The spending over the coming five years are aimed at giving
Angang a new look with higher-quality products.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1915, Angang experienced a large-scale
transformation in 1950's, emerging as China's largest iron and
steel producer, employing some 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1950's, the giant has turned out 18 percent of
the country's steel, which is 240 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But backward technology put Angang behind, with converter steel
less than one-third of its total steel output, and its continuous
casting rate lower than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Baogang, China's second largest and most advance iron and steel
company, scored more than three billion yuan in profits in 1995,
ten times that of the Angang's earnings, though its was output
lower than Angang's.
</P>
<P>
The costly technological improvement will target higher
projects, said Liu Jie, 52, Angang's general manager.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to replacing obsolete open-hearth
furnaces with rotary-hearth furnaces, and lifing continuous
casting rates.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, Angang is scheduled to upgrade its
continuous casting rate from the current 30 percent to more than
70 percent, and enable 60 percent of its products to catch up with
international counterparts, compared with the current seven percent.
</P>
<P>
With annual steel output expected to see a slight increase to
reach 8.8 million tons in the coming five years, Angang is hoping
to lift its annual profits by three billion yuan or so after the
five-year transformation, to become a world-class and competitive
iron and steel conglomerate.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Growth Slows Down in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- India's Industrial growth,
which moved into double-digit (12 percent) in 1995-96 from 9.4
percent in the previous year, seems to be slowing down, judging
from the preliminary data released for the first quarter
(April-June) of the fiscal year of 1996-97, the National Herald
said today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate, based on production performance of 24 major
industries which make up 50 percent of the total weight in the
index of industrial production, declined to 5.1 percent from 13.6
percent in the corresponding quarter of 1996-96.
</P>
<P>
In April-June 1996, growth in six infrastructural industries at
4.7 percent was almost one-third of the 12.5 percent recorded in
the corresponding quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the other 18 major industries, growth slowed significantly
in fertilizers, metals (aluminum and copper), steels ingots, as
well as the automobile sector.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were sharp declines in crude petroleum and
electricity while coal, cement and salable steel did better.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Organization, which released the data,
did not explain the slowdown in the industrial growth.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Advanced System of Petroleum Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China has become a giant in
oil sciences, technology research, as well as in production, said
a senior official at the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
According to Li Tianxiang, chairman of the Science and
Technology Committee of CNPC, China has made a series of important
achievements, including the development of an important theory of
China's continental petroleum geology through decades of
research. These run parallel to an influential international
theory on hydrocarbon formation of marine geological
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Using the theory, China has succeeded in ascertaining 27 large
oilfields, each with deposits above 100 million tons, including
such well-known oilfields as Daqing in northeast and Renqiu in
north China.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with exploration and practice, China has
finally developed layer-by-layer oil extraction technology,
stabilizing oil reserves with injected water, and using the
polymer-drive extraction method, which are all up to advanced
levels in the world.
</P>
<P>
Other major Chinese oilfields in the Bohai bay ares, such as
Shengli, Liaohe, Zhongyuan, Huabei, and Dagang have developed
rolling exploration technology, which has increased oil
exploration in the area.
</P>
<P>
So far the bay areas of the Bohai Sea have been found to have
proven oil deposits of 7.28 billion tons and annual crude output
of 61 million tons, making it the second largest oil and gas
production base after Daqing, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In the exploration of complex oil layers, China has come up
with a range of thermodynamic technologies to explore thick oil,
mainly by the use of steam.
</P>
<P>
The country has developed an annual thick oil output of 12
million tons, the fourth largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
A leading official with CNPC pointed out that China has set an
explicit target of proving 2.5 billion to 3 billion tons of oil
reserves by the turn of the century, and having annual oil and gas
output of 150 million tons and 25 billion cu m, respectively, by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To meet the goal, the official stressed that China is launching
eight huge petroleum science and technology projects, and 32
technological developments nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Rejects U.S. Plea on Radio Free Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has rejected the
United States' repeated requests to use its territory and radio
transmitter facilities to broadcast or relay programs of the newly
established Radio Free Asia (RFA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is hoping to soon launch the long-delayed RFA, now
renamed the Asia Pacific Network (APN), aimed at providing news
and information to the peoples of China, as well as the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Those countries view the U.S. radio as another cold war- style
propaganda machine to promote anti-Communist information and
broadcast programs aimed at instigating people inside those
countries.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the Thai Foreign Ministry and Government
House were quoted today by local newspaper the Nation as saying
that Thailand had repeatedly rejected the U.S. requests because
APN could adversely affect relationships with its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Surapong Jayanama, spokesman of the Thai Foreign Ministry,
reaffirmed Thailand's policy not to allow the operation of a
broadcasting service that could interfere in the affairs of a
third country or affect Thai relations with that country.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, U.S. officials have negotiated with
several Southeast Asian countries and members of the former Soviet
republics to transmit news from APN.
</P>
<P>
Along with Guam/Saipan -- which is the U.S. territory --
Bangkok, Macao, Manila, Singapore, Seoul, Chita and Vladivostok
are considered by American engineering technicians as being best
transmitter sites to provide a proper service to the target
countries.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Surplus in Balance of International Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to report
another surplus in its balance sheet for international payments
this year, according to an expert at an authoritative government
department.
</P>
<P>
The year-end current-account surplus is likely to stand at
seven billion US dollars, the expert estimated.
</P>
<P>
He said that the surplus in the capital account will drop
considerably, though the absolute level will be as high as
somewhere between 19-27 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
As there is a surplus in both the current and capital accounts,
the size of China's foreign exchange reserves will continue to
increase, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
The expected situation in the balance of international payments
will affect the domestic commodities market on the two fronts of
supply and demand, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert added, "On the one hand, a net inflow of overseas
capital will further boost the growth in fixed-asset investment.
</P>
<P>
"And on the other hand, a reverse in the growth of imports and
exports since the start of this year will enrich supplies on
domestic markets, thus helping stabilize prices."
</P>
<P>
A surplus in the balance of international payments will have
some impact on domestic interest rate levels and the future
movement of the exchange rate of the local currency, the renminbi
yuan, the expert said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos, Misuari Declare End of War in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) Chairman Nur
Misuari declared here today that with the signing of the historic
agreement between the government and the MNLF, the 24-year-old war
in Mindanao is over.
</P>
<P>
In his key-note speech after the signing of the agreement,
Ramos said: "today we not only witness history, we make it."
</P>
<P>
"Today with the formal signing of this final peace agreement
between the government of the Republic of the Philippines and the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), we bring to a close almost
30 years of conflict at the cost of more than 120,000 Filipino
lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today we launch a new era of peace and development for the
Southern Philippines, and for the Philippines as a whole," Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the peace agreement falls squarely into the
aspiration of total peace and development for all, especially the
millions of the poor and destitute masses in the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also commended Misuari's "statesmanship and moderation"
which he has conducted his end of the discussions throughout the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Misuari said that the agreement
signifies "the end of nearly three decades of the armed struggle
against what we, correctly or incorrectly perceived as 'a colonial
campaign of extinction and genocide' against our innocent and
oppressed people and the integrity of the Bangsamoro homeland and
Islam."
</P>
<P>
"After four solid years of peace process in our tortuous quest
to open a new chapter in the life of our people, in order to put
the cruelty and bitter and nightmarish memory of the war behind
us, that we be able to cast our eyes into the inscrutable future
and follow where destiny may lead us," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Misuari admitted that on the road to peace, difficulties
lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF is determined to do its best to serve the people
through the MNLF-led council for peace and development and the
autonomous region, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, Misuari said, without the government's support, the
council and the autonomous region cannot go very far.
</P>
<P>
Misuari appealed to Ramos and all those concerned to contribute
toward the MNLF's success.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement was signed around 9:25 a.m. (01:25 GMT) by
government chief negotiator Manuel Yan, Misuari, Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Secretary General Hamid Algabid of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the current chairman of the OIC, which has played
an important role in the Mindanao peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, representatives from the 56-member OIC and other 1,500
guests attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Misuari shook hands with Yan,
Alatas and Algabid while exchanging the signed agreement, and then
embraced Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the ceremony, Alatas said that with the
signing of the agreement," an arduous quest for peace that has
lasted more than two decades has come to a splendid close."
</P>
<P>
The agreement, providing for wide-ranging autonomy within the
framework of the Philippine sovereignty and territorial integrity,
embodies a comprehensive and just solution to the conflict
situation in the Southern Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore expect that it will be a durable settlement. We
also believe that it will have a profound and positive impact on
the stability and economic progress of Southeast Asia," Alatas
said.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the real hard work begins after the
signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached and initialed at the fourth round of
peace talks between the two warring parties in the Indonesian
capital of Jakarta last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a MNLF-led Southern Philippines Council
for Peace and Development, a transitory body leading to a new and
broader autonomous region in Mindanao, will be set up, and 7,500
of the 25,000 MNLF fighters will be integrated into the government
army and the national police.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Starts 6-Nation Tour to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today started his six-nation tour to Africa as part of
the efforts to thwart the political isolation and economic
sanction by the United States.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for President Rafsanjani to make such a
tour to six African states, which will include Kenya, Uganda,
Sudan, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa, since he took office
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Nairobi, Kenya, the first leg of his
six-nation trip, President Rafsanjani said that Iran in its
foreign policy gives top priority to the expansion of its ties
with African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of political, economic, cultural, educational
and technical cooperation will be discussed during the visits,"
said the 61-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has gained valuable experience during the eight
years of massive construction efforts launched after the
Iraqi-imposed war and the experience can be transferred to the
African countries to help them gain further self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
Iran intends to establish air links with the African countries
and expand banking cooperation with them, he added.
</P>
<P>
The latest international developments will also be raised in
his talks with leaders of the African countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed hope that the trip will be fruitful
both for Iran and the African continent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the presidential office told Xinhua that
Rafsanjani's visit indicates that Iran attaches importance to its
relations with African countries and will help further boost
and bolster the growing trend of bilateral and multilateral
relations between Iran and African countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit will also consolidate South-South
cooperation and help reactivate the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
</P>
<P>
A high ranking politico-economic delegation is accompanying the
61-year-old president in his visits.

<HEADLINE> Legal Experts in Nepal Urge Child Right Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepali legal experts have
pointed out the weak law enforcement against child rights abuse in
the country, urging the government to take strict anti-child labor
measures.
</P>
<P>
Judges, public prosecutors and lawyers at a workshop held here
last weekend concluded that there is a lack of institutions to
carry out investigations and file cases against child rights
abuse.
</P>
<P>
Participants said the enforcement of the country's 1992 labor
act and children's act was very weak due to the lack of supportive
plans of action, institutional mechanism and proper allocation of
resources.
</P>
<P>
According to them, Nepal sees widespread presence of child
labor in unorganized sectors such as private homes, where children
are often engaged in work with parental consensus, making the
issue more complicated.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed there are more than 40,000 domestic
servants in different parts of the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official census in 1991, about 530,000 Nepali
children aged between 10 and 14 were employed directly or
indirectly in one profession or the other.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop on "law enforcement and child rights
protection," organized by a local university with the help of the
International Labor Organization (ILO), also raised question about
ineffective legal processes against child rights abuse because of
ignorance and poverty.
</P>
<P>
While emphasizing the government's role in protecting child
rights, participants of the workshop ending Sunday called on trade
unions and non-governmental organizations to be mobilized to
monitor the enforcement of children protection laws.

<HEADLINE> India Opposes Biased WTO Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- India strongly opposes the
"arm-twisting" policies of the West, which under the blanket of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) provisions has imposed new
qualitative restrictions on imports from developing countries, The
Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Economists with the India Institute of Foreign Trade cautioned
that the developed countries were employing "phytosanitary"
conditions specified by the WTO to avoid agricultural imports from
the third world.
</P>
<P>
They said India should press WTO to standardize these
conditions in its forthcoming round of discussions in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The "phytosanitary" conditions, pertaining to plant residues in
imported products, include specific treatment or processing of
products, maximum allowable pesticide residues or permissible use
of certain specific additives in food.
</P>
<P>
The Indian economists said that the phytosanitary measures were
becoming major trade issues just because the WTO provisions were
not strong and tilted towards developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The WTO provision on this had not been standardized as
graphical and sanitary conditions among countries were different,
making it difficult to apply uniform requirements to products
originating in different countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Indian exports of marine products and spices have recently
suffered because of disputes over sanitary and phytosanitary
conditions on these products.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace to Boost Economy in S. Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- As the Ramos administration and
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) formally signed the
Mindanao peace agreement today, people are beginning to talk more
about economic development instead of war in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Mindanao has always been known as the country's "land of
promise." It is rich in natural resources such as lumber and oil
as well as lots of beautiful tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The main southern island also plays an important role in the
national economy by accounting for 36 percent of the total
agriculture output, 30 percent of the livestock and poultry
production as well as 36 percent of the fish output in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, decades of war have spoiled the bright promise of the
land although former president Ferdinand Marcos had ploughed
billions of pesos in the area. The bloody conflict has turned the
island into one of the poorest regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is the peace that gave Mindanao a chance to economic
prosperity. In March 1994, while engaged in peace talks with the
MNLF, the Ramos government set up the East ASEAN (the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations) Growth Area with Brunei, Indonesia and
Malaysia. This has boosted the economic development in Mindanao
and nurtured Davao city to make it the third biggest city in the
country.
</P>
<P>
As President Fidel Ramos is bringing the so-called "genuine and
lasting peace" to Mindanao, analysts predict that Mindanao will
become another growth center of the country in the next three or
four years since huge foreign investments are expected to pour
into this area.
</P>
<P>
As the infrastructure facilities in Mindanao were destroyed in
the war, now investors from Japan, South Korea, the United States,
the European Union and the World Bank are financing to build new
roads, seaports, airports and a telephone network on the island.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Japan's Marubeni corporation signed with the Filipino
Telephone Corporation a 280-million-US-dollar contract to build a
400,000-line telephone network in Mindanao. Mindanao Asiana Corp.
and a South Korean company also agreed to spend millions of pesos
for the production of concrete pavement bricks while Singapore is
trying to survey opportunities in the infrastructure sector in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Even local investors are placing Mindanao as a priority venture
area, as demonstrated by the food and beverage conglomerate San
Miguel Corporation's decision to build a brewing facility in
Darong, Davao Del Sur province.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is also paying more attention to
fostering Mindanao's economic partnership with Islamic states
since they hold sway over the MNLF and other Moro rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the initialing of the agreement on August 30 in
Jakarta, Indonesian President Seoharto said the peace pact opens
opportunities for the development of the East ASEAN Growth Area.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country, the Organization of the Islamic
Conference and some Middle East countries have pledged to invest
more in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkian hailed President Ramos for the
success of the peace process in Mindanao and promised to pour more
investments into Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government has released a total of
24.2 million pesos (920,000 million US dollars) to finance some
projects in Mindanao. It also asked the Congress for an
additional budget of 20 billion pesos (763 million dollars) for
the development of the island.
</P>
<P>
MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari said that improving the region's
economy would be his priority agenda when he becomes chairman of
the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development and
governor of the autonomous region for Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said he dreamed of Mindanao as the most "prosperous region
in the world" where people will be "talking about business instead
of war."
</P>
<P>
Misuari said he would like to build factories that will produce
cellular phones not weapons, provide computers to every school and
construct tall buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
As the future of Mindanao is becoming brighter with the signing
of the final peace agreement, most potential investors are still
awaiting the advent of genuine and lasting peace in Mindanao,
taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
That is also the concern shared by the Philippine government
and the MNLF. "To sign the peace pact is one thing, but to
implement it is another," said the government negotiators.

COLOMBO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has commenced a
project to provide street children with permanent shelters for the
night, the Ministry of Social Services announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The project is geared to laying a foundation for these
children's well-being.
</P>
<P>
Although these children are also entitled to social benefits,
most of them do not get the opportunity to enjoy them for reasons
such as ignorance and lack of enthusiasm, the ministry sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added, the government believes that these children
should also be accepted by society and given an opportunity for
education and employment for them to become useful citizens of the
society.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 50,000 street children in the island
country, according to local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Plans Big Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International
(THAI) is planning to purchase 35 new aircraft over the next five
years to replace its old fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Thai carrier will spend 126 billion baht (about 5 billion
US dollars) on the procurement, nearly 90 percent of its budget
for the five-year development plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the carrier will retire 31 old planes,
reduce their plane types from 14 to 6 and engine types from 11 to
6, and halve the pilot groups.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned company is urging the government to remove its
rule which requires barter trade of at least 20 percent of the
cost to clear ways for the procurement.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the Thai government currently
requires all procurements by state agencies to be arranged through
barter trade under which foreign suppliers have to buy Thai goods
worth at least 20-25 percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
Thamnoon Wanglee, president of the carrier, said that barter
trade would not work in this case because there were not many
aircraft makers in the world and they controlled the market.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Import More Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- India is likely to import
50,000 tons of natural rubber by the turn of the century and the
import could go up to 300,000 tons by 2010 if the current
demand-supply gap keeps widening, The Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
With an ever-growing demand, India is already importing rubber
to meet the needs of the domestic rubber-consuming industry and
one major factor for the shortage is the "abysmally low" rate of
replanting and new planting in the rubber plantations, an article
published in the Planter's Chronicle journal said.
</P>
<P>
While rubber production has increased consistently, along with
productivity, during the past three decades from a meager 25,000
tons to 500,000 tons, its consumption has also gone up during the
same period from 48,000 to 520,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
If the enormous jump in demand had to be met, there had to be a
quantum jump in production, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nur Misuari, Rising Star in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- As peace is finally coming to
the Southern Philippines, a man has walked into the limelight of
the Philippines' political stage. He is Nur Misuari, chairman of
the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Misuari has become the country's "man of the moment" since he
has been playing a very important role in bringing peace and
development to the troubled south in recent months.
</P>
<P>
In Davao city on June 23 this year, Misuari accepted a
government offer to lead the proposed Southern Philippines Council
for Peace and Development (SPCPD) to oversee a "special zone of
peace and development" covering 14 provinces and nine cities in
Mindanao and its outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
The move, which was hailed as a breakthrough in the peace
process in the Southern Philippines, surmounted the main obstacles
in three years of negotiations between the government and the MNLF
on a settlement of the 24-year-old Muslim insurgency that has
claimed 120,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Misuari also won President Fidel Ramos' acclaims by filing his
candidacy as a ruling party candidate to run for the governor of
the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in elections
scheduled for September 9 this year. This meant that the MNLF was
putting an end to its armed struggle for the autonomy of Mindanao
and swearing allegiance to the Philippine Constitution.
</P>
<P>
If Misuari wins in the elections in ARMM, he may become the
first person who wears two hats of power in the history of the
country. By doing so, Misuari is walking from the hinterland
jungle to the center of the Philippine politics.
</P>
<P>
Now, he has offered to mediate peace talks between the
government and other rebel groups such as the MORO Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf once the final peace
agreement between his group and the government is signed.
</P>
<P>
A star is certainly on the rise. Vice President Joseph Estrada,
who has his eyes set on the presidency in 1998, even wants the
former rebel chief as his running mate, saying it would be a good
idea to have a Muslim for a vice president.
</P>
<P>
From battlefield to the political stage, Misuari has taken a
significant step in the right direction. Through peace talks, he
has said, he achieved what he could not with armed struggles for
so many years.
</P>
<P>
Born into a family of the Tausug tribe on Kabingaan island, 20
kilometers southeast of Jolo city, Sulu province in the south in
1938, Misuari does not know the exact date of his birth. But his
parents still remember an unusually heavy rain on that day.
</P>
<P>
"We were 11 in the family. After the war broke out in 1974,
there were only five of us left," Misuari said, adding that all
his surviving siblings had been with the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
Misuari took up his elementary and secondary education in Jolo.
In 1960, he began to study political science at the University of
the Philippines. After getting his degree, he went to the college
of law at the university, but left one year later when he was
advised to quit because he had gotten sick.
</P>
<P>
On the night of March 18, 1968, Misuari and several young
Muslim students assembled at Freedom Park in front of the
presidential palace, where they decided to form the MNLF. They
left for Mindanao the following day to start what they called a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Then the newly formed MNLF began to build its forces by getting
arms from supporters from other Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
In January 1974, the MNLF survived a siege by government
troops, who were preparing a large-scale attack, sending at least
24 naval boats, 36 battalions and several aircraft.
</P>
<P>
From then on, the war never stopped, until after former
president Corazon Aquino agreed to a ceasefire in 1987 in
preparation for peace talks to end the Muslim uprising. But it was
under the Ramos administration that the MNLF and the government
began their talks.
</P>
<P>
Asked by local reporters to explain why he wanted to end the
war, Misuari said he and all Filipinos had been tired of war.
</P>
<P>
"Peace has to prevail. No matter how just it is, in the end,
war is still very ugly," said Misuari, adding that there is no
winner but only loser in the war.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Close Down Embassies in E. Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has decided to
close down some of its embassies in Eastern Europe and open up
embassies in Turkey and Thailand, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The government will shut down its embassies in Ukraine,
Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, and lower the status of the embassy
in the Czech Republic to a trade representative's office.
</P>
<P>
It will also replace some of its ambassadors abroad, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The measure was taken to meet the recent changes in the
country's political situation, an official from the Ministry of
External Relations said.
</P>
<P>
He said that when a political force is replaced by another, the
replacement of ambassadors, who are also political officials
representing the nation, is understandable.
</P>
<P>
The close-down of the embassies is related to the country's
financial situation and bilateral relations between Mongolia and
those countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the June 30 general elections for the State Great Hural, the
country's parliament, the Democratic Union Coalition toppled the
Revolutionary People's Party, which had been in power for more
than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj, the leader of Social Democratic
Party, was elected parliamentary speaker and Mendsaihani Enhsaihan
was appointed as new prime minister in mid-July.

<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) today began distributing medicines to
hospitals in Irbil, of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC spokesman said at least 150 people were being treated
at Irbil after Iraqi troops overran the main city in the
Kurdish-dominated area on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government said the attack, the largest since the
1991 Gulf War, was at the request of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) rival to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, two ICRC representatives traveled to
Sulaymaniyah, a PUK stronghold situated 200 kilometers southeast
of Irbil, to try to gain access to prisoners from the three
warring parties, amid fears for their safety, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Backed by some 450 tanks, Iraqi troops and the KDP seized Irbil
from the PUK in fightings on Saturday, which left at least 100
people dead, the United Nations and other sources said.

<HEADLINE> European Consortium to Launch Jumbo Airbus by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Europe's Airbus Industry will
launch a mammoth Airbus double-decker long range jet carrying up
to 700 passengers, according to a published report today.
</P>
<P>
By putting the jumbo passenger aircraft into the sky, the
Airbus consortium, of France, Germany, Britain and Spain, aims to
compete Boeing 474s now dominating the world's major air routes.
</P>
<P>
The Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper quoted Dietrich Russell, the
air transport chief of Deutsche Aerospace (DASA), as saying that
work on the four-engine aircraft will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
As results, the German air industry executive said, a prototype
of the jumbo jet will be ready in 1999, and its commercial version
is expected in 2003.
</P>
<P>
"The date was planned in such a way because many of the
Boeing-747s are now 25 years old and will need to be replaced
then," Russell explained, adding "Airbus will then be the only
manufacturer of a fully new plane of such a size."
</P>
<P>
The official of DASA, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, projected
that 35 percent of the world market by turn of the century will be
dominated by planes capable of carrying more than 350 passengers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Last Cali Drug Cartel Head Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The last ranking
leader of the powerful Cali drug cartel, Helmer Herrera, turned
himself in today after dodging police for years.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, 45, walked into the prosecutor general's office in the
southwest city of Cali today, police said.
</P>
<P>
A national police spokesman confirmed Herrera's surrender after
months of negotiations between his lawyers and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Six other leaders of the world's largest cocaine gang were
captured or surrendered last year.
</P>
<P>
One of the kingpins, Jose Santacruz, escaped from jail in
January after bribing prison guards. He was shot and killed in
March.
</P>
<P>
Herrera, who was charged with being involved in setting up
cocaine distribution networks in New York City and other major
U.S. markets, will face illegal enrichment and drug trafficking
charges.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to have been involved in a 1988 car bomb attack
on a building in Medellin where the family of Medellin drug cartel
leader Pablo Escobar was living, but the family escaped.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, 1990, Medellin hit men killed 19 people at a
farm outside Cali in a failed attempt to kill Herrera.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining its upward trend
for the second successive week, India's annual rate of inflation
gained 0.13 percentage point to touch 5.54 percent for the week
ended on August 17, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate stood at 8.5 percent during the
corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has moved up as much as 0.5 percentage point during
the week under review and the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The rise in inflation can be attributed to higher prices of
commodities such as fish, eggs and groundnut oil.
</P>
<P>
This is the 73rd week in succession that inflation has veered
around single digit level in the country.

<HEADLINE> China-Asia Forum Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- An international forum on
China-Asia opened here today to forge closer relations between
China and the other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Forum chairman Hong Lee Pee said at the opening of the two-day
China-Asia Forum that with the Chinese "open door" policy and
their pragmatic approach, and Asia's booming markets, the hope for
mutual trust and business looks most promising from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The forum with the theme of "Towards Stability and Prosperity
for Asia in the 21st Century" was organized with the objectives of
promoting and enhancing investments in China and Asia, serving as
a wellspring of information on the policies and practices crucial
to business success in China, offering a medium for the exchange
of views with policy makers and business leaders in participating
countries and regions, and promoting economic and cultural
interaction between China and Asian countries, he said.
</P>

He hoped that this forum would let the whole world know that
China and Asia can offer together as a united force and would
promote interaction between China and Asian countries to work hand
in hand towards the greater unity and prosperity of not only Asia

</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen sent a special message to
the forum, which was read out by Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia

relations, cooperation and opportunity are co-existing with
competition and challenge. It is an important task for us to
establish a new type of reasonable international economic
environment."
</P>
<P>
He said that focusing on the topic of stability and prosperity
for Asia in the 21st century, The China-Asia Forum is a very
meaningful conference which he believed would play a positive role
for promoting the mutual understanding and cooperation between
China and the Asian countries including Malaysia.

policies and investment and commercial opportunities in China at

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks More Food Exports to South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants to increase its
food exports to South Korea which bars several products on hygiene
grounds, according to the local newspaper Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Minister-Counselor (commercial) in Seoul Pasit Phumchusri
was quoted as saying that South Korea keeps its imports of food
and primary products from developing countries at a low level and
applies strict screening.
</P>
<P>
South Korea bans Thai fruit and flowers to prevent possible
entry of insects and diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, it imports durians, coconuts, papaya and bananas from
Thailand. Mangos are prohibited, although Thailand has applied
vapor heat treatment to destroy insects and disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
If South Korea eases its sanitary standards it could become a
promising market for Thailand, the minister-counselor said.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the Agriculture Department would promote
Thai products by sending 120 kilograms of fruit to a Thai
restaurant that opened recently in Seoul, Pasit said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans Restrictions on Sugarcane Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's sugarcane output is
expected to be restricted to 60 million tons by the 2001/2002
milling season while the plantation area will be curbed at six
million rai (960,000 hectares), according to the office of Cane
and Sugar Board (CSB) of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions are part of CSB office's efforts to draw up a new
five-year plan for cane and sugar development starting from the
1998-99 milling season, the office was quoted today by the local
newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sugarcane yield will be raised to 12 tons per rai (0.16
hectare) and sugar production efficiency will also be boosted to
reduce production costs in preparation for liberalized global
trade.
</P>
<P>
The sugar output will be limited at 72 million sacks (100 kg
each) by 2002 and the sugar yield will be put at 120 kilograms for
each ton of sugarcane crushed.
</P>
<P>
Thailand ranks the world's second largest sugar exporter, but
its cane and sugar industry has no precise direction and is seen
as a weak point for competitiveness when Thailand is required to
open its market under the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The country's cane and sugar industry has not reached goals in
the past five years since the growth of household and
non-household consumption is still low.
</P>
<P>
It is key for Thailand to work out ways to develop the sugar
market such as by increasing new sugar categories, creating new
sugar products and making use of unwanted products from sugar
refining, the CSB office said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Draft Mekong Development Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will draft a national
strategy to enhance development in the Mekong river basin and the
region, according to Thai Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Viravan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Bangkok Post at the weekend, Amnuay
said related state agencies will meet in mid-September to thrash
out a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand must set its priorities at the national level
to fit in with regional cooperation on the development scheme.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has expressed concern over the "geographical issue"
with Myanmar, Cambodia, China's southern Yunnan province, Laos and
Vietnam, in regard to the greater Mekong sub-region cooperation
scheme, economic cooperation with South Asia, and that under the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although we understand the overall picture (regional)
cooperation, we have yet to draft our own strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without a (national) strategy it does not mean we cannot do
anything, but having it helps mobilize limited resources for
maximum benefit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the content of the strategy, Amnuay said it must
be multi-dimensional, serving both the economic interests, and
covering social, cultural and environmental aspects.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay's statement followed the greater Mekong's sixth economic
conference organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) last week
in Kunming in southern China.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Amnuay called for the six Mekong's riparian
states to strengthen their national bodies so as to facilitate
development at the implementation stage and integrate with the
regional strategy which will be supervised by the ADB.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Sign Memo on Bank Guarantees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand and its
Myanmar counterpart are expected to sign soon a memorandum on bank
guarantees to facilitate trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Foreign Ministry, under the bank
guarantee system, businessmen will need letters of credit for
deals worth more than 20,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Related agreements on customs procedures and immigration will
also be concluded later, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
However, some Thai traders did not believe these documents
would be practical, saying that letters of credit would slow down
trade as current practices allow great flexibility.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that small businesses would not be able
to afford letters of credit from banks in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that Myanmar has been pushing for
Thailand over the past five or six years to introduce bank
guarantees to ensure bilateral trade was carried out properly.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Introduce Plan to Prop Sluggish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks are
joining in a nationwide campaign to prop sluggish exports in the
country by introducing export credit packages.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Bankers Association (TBA), the financing
plan will be mainly targeted at reviving exports of 18 categories
of goods that have been slowing down over the past five or six
year.
</P>
<P>
These commodities include electric wire cable, automobiles and
motorbikes, yarn, plastic ware, garments, shoes, fresh fish,
frozen chicken, frozen shrimp, toys, tableware, floor and wall
tiles, artificial flowers, travel gear, canned fish, and frozen
squid.
</P>
<P>
The TBA will also present the finding of the root causes of
lower exports in each category to the central bank to help the
government work out the most appropriate credit-extension
measures, said Olarn Chaipravat, chairmen of the association.
</P>
<P>
The TBA will propose as well ways toward industrial
restructuring, including moving the bases of those unprofitable
industries elsewhere, said Olarn, who is also president of the
Siam Commercial Bank.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports grew by merely 3.8 percent during the first
seven months of this year, compared with 24 percent in the same
period last year, while the 18 categories of goods saw a 19.6
percent negative growth in the first five months of this year.

<P>
GENEVA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) today began distributing medicines to
hospitals in Irbil, of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC spokesman said at least 150 people were being treated
at Irbil following Iraqi troops' overrun of the main city in the
Kurdish-dominated area on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government said the attack, the largest since the
1991 Gulf War, was at the request of the Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) rival to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, two ICRC representatives traveled to
Sulaymaniyah, a PUK stronghold situated 200 kilometers southeast
of Irbil, to try to gain access to prisoners from the three
warring parties, amid fears for their safety, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Backed by some 450 tanks, Iraqi troops and the KDP seized Irbil
from the PUK in fightings on Saturday, which left at least 100
people dead, the United Nations and other sources said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Continues Search for Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A military task force is
continuing the search for three logging workers still held hostage
in Indonesia's easternmost province Irian Jaya following their
success to free nine of them last Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Their efforts to free the remaining hostages ran into a snag on
account of bad weather on Sunday. The search was made difficult by
thick fog, a report from Timika, Irian Jaya, said today.
</P>
<P>
The task force would not stop their search until the abductors
release the three remaining hostages, the report quoted spokesman
for the Timika Military Post Mahor Frans Johny as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the military's success in freeing the nine
hostages on Friday and Saturday was praised-worthy as there was no
exchange of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The abductors were too busy trying to escape troops closing in
on them, so they abandoned the nine hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 men from a security disturbance group attacked the base
camp of Pt. Kamunda Raya Logging Company on August 14, taking 16
workers hostage after looting the camp.
</P>
<P>
After the abduction, two hostages escaped separately while two
others were released to deliver a letter to the local authorities.

<HEADLINE> Mindanao Peace Accord Signed Amid Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Amid celebrations and peace
rallies across the Philippines, the government and the Muslim Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) formally signed here today a
historic peace accord to end a 24-year-old civil war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement was signed around 9:25 a.m. (01:25 GMT) by
government chief negotiator Manuel Yan, MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari,
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Secretary General Hamid
Algabid of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the current chairman of the OIC, which has played
an important role in the Mindanao peace process.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos, representatives from the 56-member OIC
and other 1,500 guests attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement, Misuari shook hands with Yan,
Alatas and Algabid while exchanging the signed agreement, and then
embraced Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached and initialed at the fourth round of
peace talks between the two warring parties in the Indonesian
capital of Jakarta last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a MNLF-led Southern Philippines Council
for Peace and Development, a transitory body leading to a new and
broader autonomous region in Mindanao, will be set up, and 7,500
of the 25,000 MNLF troops will be integrated into the government
army and the national police.
</P>
<P>
As the government and the MNLF representatives exchanged the
signed agreement, thousands of balloons were released outside the
presidential palace with blowing of horns and ringing of church
bells.
</P>
<P>
While the signing ceremony was being held, a big Mindanao
delegation, composed of Muslims and Christians, staged a peace
rally at the Freedom Park near the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, people celebrated the historic accord, which
is hopefully halt a conflict which caused death to 120,000 people
and suffering to millions of Mindanao residents.
</P>
<P>
All flag-raising ceremonies in both the public and private
sectors nationwide this morning carried the theme "peace accord
for total development."
</P>
<P>
But in the Southern Philippines, protests were also reported.
Some people are reportedly put flags at half-mast in protest
against the establishment of the MNLF-led council.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the Muslim rebel group has been
fighting for autonomy of Mindanao, a place the Muslims considered
as their ancestral home. The war between the government and rebels
has claimed 120,000 lives and caused a loss of 2.78 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord has offered the best hope for peace in
Mindanao, but opposition to the peace deal is very strong in the
region and the rest of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the breakaway group
of the MNLF, has officially rejected the agreement and vowed to
continue its armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-strong MILF is calling for the establishment of a
federal government which would grant autonomy to Muslims in 13
provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippine Congress, a multi-party alliance also claimed
that the establishment of the MNLF-led transitional council is not
the answer for a genuine quest for peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Laban Party-led alliance has announced plans to ask the
courts to stop the enforcement of the agreement until the
government comes up with a modified formula that is acceptable to
all Christians in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Christian residents, who account for 85 percent of the Mindanao
population, are protesting against the peace accord, saying that
the establishment of the MNLF-led council will impose the Muslim
rule on the Christians.
</P>
<P>
Senator minority leader Edgardo Angara said that the agreement
does not contain a provision on how to convince the MNLF rebels
who would not be integrated into the government forces to
surrender their arms.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that with the signing of the peace
accord, peace in Mindanao is in sight, but there are still major
obstacles to a lasting peace in the Southern Philippines.

BELGRADE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Allan Nielsen and Michael
Schjonberg both scored in the final 12 minutes to give Denmark a
2-0 victory over Slovenia Sunday in Ljubljana, Slovenia in a World
Cup qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Nielsen broke the tie in the 78th minute when he latched on to
a header from Jakob Friis-Hansen and belted the ball from close
range.
</P>
<P>
Pushing for an equalizer, the Slovenes left themselves
vulnerable and conceded a second goal in the 89th minute when
Schjonberg, who came in for Michael Laudrup only five minutes
earlier, broke away.
</P>
<P>
Played out in front of only 5,000 spectators in Ljubljana's
Bizigrad stadium, the game had few scoring chances. Slovenia came
nearest in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Saso Udovic squandered the Slovenes' best chance in the 33rd
minute, when running into the penalty area unopposed, he blasted a
well-timed cross from Dzoni Novak over the bar.
</P>
<P>
The loss was the second in as many games for Slovenia, which
lost 2-0 to Greece in the Group One opener in April.

<HEADLINE> First private Orphanage is Cozy Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight orphans are
enjoying a care-free life in China's first private orphanage in
Baishan City, in northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The Yulin Orphanage, covering a floor space of 2,500 square
meters, is being run by Zhu Yulin, an entrepreneur in Baishan
City. Zhu is also a deputy to the Baishan City People's Congress,
the local legislature, and a member of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years he has contributed money and materials
worth 1.5 million yuan to poor areas and poor people. With his
financial help four orphans are now studying in universities, and
another 12 in primary schools.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of Baishan City government he has spent
eight million yuan building the first private orphanage in China.
</P>
<P>
In his orphanage children can receive parental love from Zhu
and fellow workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jingzhi, 10, said that all the children here love their
"new home" very much, and that they love and help each other like
brother and sisters.
</P>
<P>
Zhu sees to it that orphans are taken good care of, study hard
and will be assigned jobs after they turn 18.
</P>
<P>
The forty-eight children were all very weak when they first
arrived at the orphanage. But now they are all healthy under the
care of the teachers. They have regular physical checks-up.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinliang, 13, and Wang Zhongliang, 12, were prone to
illness because they were undernourished. Now they are so strong
that they seldom get ill.
</P>
<P>
Orphans study rudimentary knowledge, as well as special courses
in art, English and computers.
</P>
<P>
With high marks, four children in the orphanage were enrolled
earlier this year by a key middle school in the county.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan goalkeeper
Jose Luis Chilavert scored a spectacular 30-meter free kick to
earn his side a valuable 1-1 draw against Argentina in a World Cup
qualifier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chilavert, who had promised to score a goal prior to the match,
curved a shot around the wall and the ball bounced underneath the
body of Argentine goalkeeper German Burgos.
</P>
<P>
The goal came shortly before halftime and 20 minutes after
Chilavert himself had been beaten by a 25-meter free kick by
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta.
</P>
<P>
Batistuta's goal, rifled into the top right-hand corner with
Chilavert rooted to the spot, made him Argentina's all-time
leading scorer, beating Diego Maradona's record of 34 goals.
</P>
<P>
The result piled on the misery for two-time World Cup winner
Argentina who now has only one victory after four qualifying
games.
</P>
<P>
After beating Bolivia 3-1 at home in April, they then lost 2-0
away to Ecuador and drew 0-0 away against Peru. Argentina placed
third in the standings, behind Colombia at 10 points and Ecuador
at 9.
</P>
<P>
In other match of the regional qualifying tournament, Colombia
beat Chile 4-1, Ecuador outplayed Venezuela 1-0 while Bolivia and
Peru played to a goalless draw.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government, MNLF Sign Mindanao Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) formally signed a peace
agreement in the presidential palace here this morning, offering
the best hope of peace in the war-battered Mindanao, the Southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by government chief negotiator Manuel
Yan, MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas and Secretary General Hamid Algabid of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos, government officials and representatives
from member states of the OIC, which has played an important role
in the Mindanao peace process, together with 1,500 guests attended
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached and initialed at the fourth round of
peace talks between the two warring parties in the Indonesian
capital of Jakarta last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a MNLF-led Southern Philippines Council
for Peace and Development, a transitory body leading to a new and
broader autonomous region in Mindanao, will be set up, and 7,500
of the 25,000 MNLF troops will be integrated into the government
army and the national police.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF-led council will coordinate peace and development in
14 provinces and nine cities in Mindanao. The council will be
composed of a chairman, a vice-chairman and three deputies
representing the Muslims, Christians and other communities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
After three years, the Congress will pass an enabling act
expanding the coverage of the autonomous region in Muslim
Mindanao. The act will be submitted to a plebiscite in the areas
covered by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, the Muslim rebel group has been
fighting for autonomy of Mindanao, a place the Muslims consider as
their ancestral home. The war between the government and MNLF has
claimed 120,000 lives and caused a loss of 2.78 billion US dollars
on the government side.
</P>
<P>
The accord offered the best hope for peace in Mindanao, but
opposition to the peace deal remains very strong in the region and
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The most strong opposition to the deal came from Christians in
Mindanao, where Christians make 85 percent of the Island's 20
million population and almost all of the governors and mayors are
Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Christians accused the government of imposing the actual
rule of the Muslims on them by creating the MNLF-led council. Some
Christians have threatened to form the Unified Christian Command,
a militia group that would reportedly check Muslim "atrocities" if
the council is established.
</P>
<P>
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the breakaway group
of the MNLF, also posed a threat to the implementation of the
peace accord. The MILF has officially rejected the peace deal and
vowed to continue its armed struggle for the establishment of a
federal government which would grant autonomy to Muslims in 13
provinces and nine cities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is recruiting more young Muslims to its ranks. At
present, the MILF's strength is estimated at 22,000 after the
recent defection of 2,000 MNLF troops to it.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Give Health Aid for China's Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) will provide China with technical assistance worth 14
million US dollars for development of primary health care in rural
areas, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that agreements have been reached between WHO
and the Chinese Ministry of Health on cooperative projects in 11
areas including nurse training, safe blood production,
mental-health care and tuberculosis control.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted Dr S.T. Han, WHO director of the Western
Pacific region, as saying that WHO will also provide additional
support for primary health-care activities in the Tibetan
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
WHO has long attached importance to health care for rural areas
in China and will provide more support for the re-establishment of
a rural co-operative medical-care system across the country, said
Dr R.W. Gee, WHO representative to China.
</P>
<P>
A joint experimental rural health project has been launched in
14 pilot counties to help determine the feasibility of
reintroducing a collectively funded medical care system for the
country's 900 million rural people.
</P>
<P>
The results of the four-year trial program, which will be
completed next year, will be used to help other provinces and
regions, and to draft legislation on rural health insurance.
</P>
<P>
"our purpose is to help the Chinese health authorities make
health care accessible and affordable for the whole population,
including the poorest, through a financing mechanism that is both
viable and equitable," said Dr Aviva Ron, a health insurance
specialist from WHO's Division of Intensified Co-operation with
Countries.
</P>
<P>
The final goal is to ensure that collectively funded rural
medical services will be re-established in 50-60 percent of
Chinese counties in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
China experienced a boom in rural cooperative medical services
in the 1970s, with more than 90 percent of the country's villages
had set up such health-care systems by the end of the decade.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mindanao Peace in Sight, Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ramos administration and
the Muslim Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) formally signed
here today a final peace accord to end a 24-year-old civil war in
Mindanao, offering the best hope for peace in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord was initialed at the fourth round of peace
talks between the two warring parties in the Indonesian capital of
Jakarta last Friday after three years of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
Under the Jakarta agreement, a MNLF-led Southern Philippines
Council for Peace and Development will be set up, 7,500 MNLF
fighters will be integrated into the government army and the
national police force, and a special regional security force for
Mindanao will be established.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal, if fully implemented without creating any new
troubles, could bring about stability and prosperity in Mindanao,
political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 24 years, the MNLF has been fighting a guerrilla
war, first for independence, and then for autonomy in Mindanao.
The conflict between the MNLF and government troops have claimed
120,000 lives, and the government has lost 73 billion pesos (2.78
billion U.S. dollars) in the war with the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The two-decade long war has not only affected the development
of the Mindanao region, but also posed a constant threat to peace
and stability in the rest of the country. For years, both the
government and Filipinos have expressed the hope that the war
could end some day.
</P>
<P>
Now the Jakarta agreement has given peace an opportunity in
Mindanao, and peace seems in sight now.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos predicted last Friday that genuine and
lasting peace will finally prevail in Mindanao with the signing of
the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
However, many people here believe that after the signing of the
final accord, the road toward peace still is not so smooth.
According to political analysts here, major obstacles remain to
the genuine peace in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the implementation of the Jakarta deal will not be
an easy job for the Ramos administration, as the accord was forged
amid strong opposition and protests in the Philippines, and the
South in particular.
</P>
<P>
Since the government and the MNLF reached agreement in June on
the establishment of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace
and Development, a key plank of the final accord, the proposed
MNLF-led council has aroused strong opposition from politicians
and Christians in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the MNLF-dominated council will serve as a transitional body
leading to a broader autonomous region in three years, and will
oversee peace and development in 14 province and nine cities in
Mindanao, some congressmen challenged the legality of the council.
 They said the congress had not been consulted at all before and
the creation of the transitory body is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The most strong opposition to the deal came from Christians in
Mindanao, the ancestral home of Muslims and a Christian-dominated
area. Decades of migration by Christian settlers into Mindanao
turned the area a predominately Christian region, where Christians
make up 85 percent of the island's 20 million population and
almost all of governors and mayors are Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Christian residents accused the government of imposing the
actual rule of the Muslims on them by creating the MNLF-led
council. Some Christians have threatened to form the unified
Christian command, a militia group that would reportedly check
Muslim "atrocities" if the council is established.
</P>
<P>
Despite the painstaking efforts by the government to lessen the
fear of the opposition, Christians in the south are continuing
their protests against the deal.
</P>
<P>
Observers here warned that the arming of Christians could spark
a religious war in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts believe that the biggest threat to the
implementation of the peace deal comes from the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), a breakaway rebel group of the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has rejected the peace deal and is recruiting more
young Muslims to its ranks. At present, the MILF's strength is
estimated at 22,000 after the recent defection of 2,000 MNLF
fighters to it. The MNLF has about 25,000 members.
</P>
<P>
The pro-independence MILF has accused the MNLF of betraying the
Muslims by forging the deal with the government, and vowed to
continue its armed struggle for "genuine Muslim autonomy" in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the MILF threat, the Ramos administration said
if the peace plan is not acceptable to the MILF, it will hold
separate talks with the rebel group, which maintains a stronghold
in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Another problem which could cause a new trouble for the
government is how to disarm the MNLF forces. Under the term of
the peace accord, about 7,500 of the 25,000 MNLF fighters will be
integrated into the government army and the national police and
the rest of them will lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
But Philippine Defense Secretary Renato de Villa has warned
that the 17,500 MNLF fighters who will be left out in the cold
will remain a threat to security on the island if the government
does not prepare a viable socio-economic program for them.
Unfortunately, the government has not yet worked out such a
program.
</P>
<P>
As major problems remain unsolved, analysts here are very
cautious about the peace prospect. Some said that with the
signing of the accord, peace in Mindanao is already in sight now,
while others said the final accord has just brought peace closer
to the island.

<HEADLINE> Harvest Program in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The grain output in southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has increased by 1.7
billion kilograms since the introduction of a "Harvest Program" in
1987.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the region's output of oil-bearing plants has
increased by 2.5 billion kg, the output of fruits and plants of
economic value by 270 million kg, and the output of animal
husbandry and aquatic products by 30 million kg.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide program, advocated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, is aimed at reforming agricultural production and
promoting new farming techniques in line with local conditions.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi set up its own "harvest program" in 1994 and pours one
million yuan into it every year. Government officials, technicians
and farmers are well coordinated in the program.
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years more than 30,000 technicians have been
involved in the program, and over eight million farmers have
received training.

<HEADLINE> Komen Breaks Morceli's 3,000 Meters Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Daniel Komen lowered the
world record for 3,000 meters by over four seconds while Wilson
Kipketer missed shattering another mark by one-tenth of a second
Sunday at the Rieti Grand Prix II athletics meet.
</P>
<P>
Komen, who set the two-mile record in July, finished the 3,000
meters race in seven minutes 20.67 seconds, bettering Algerian
Nourredine Morceli's old standard of 7:25.11, set at Monte Carlo
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It's the third time in six years a world record has been set on
this track in Rieti, a small town in the mountains 55 kilometers
northeast of Rome.
</P>
<P>
Morceli, who set records here for the 1,500 in 1992 and the
mile the next year, failed in his bid Sunday to better his own
mark of 3:27.37 in the former, running 3:29.99.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer was much closer to entering the record book, but his
1:41.83 in the 800 meters just failed to erase Sebastian Coe's
15-year-old mark of 1:41.73, set in Florence.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan-born runner, a Danish citizen, was led by
pacesetters through 400 meters in 49.05 seconds and pulled away
from the pack over the final 200. Kipketer's time was the first
under 1:42 since Brazil's Joachim Cruz ran 1:41.77 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
In earlier events, Ines Kravetz of Ukraine, the Olympic
triple-jump champion, won the women's long jump with a leap of
6.99 meters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irina Privalova of Russia captured the women's 100m
in 11.00 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Geri Moen held off Davidosn Ezinwa in the 200m and clocked
20.17 for the victory.
</P>
<P>
Other winners included Torrance Zellner of the United States in
the men's 400m hurdles, Italy's Paolo Dal Soglio in the shot put,
and Cuban Yoelbi Quesada in the triple jump.
</P>
<P>
Several of the big shots in athletics skipped the meet
including shot putters Randy Barnes and John Godina of the United
States, gold and silver medalists at Atlanta, opting to rest for
the IAAF finals at Milan next Saturday.

NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Stefan Edberg outplayed Paul
Haarhuis of the Netherlands 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 to move into the
fourth round of the U.S. Open tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Playing his last Grand Slam tournament before retiring, Edberg
played his strongest match of the hardcourt tourney.
</P>
<P>
The veteran successfully defended his U.S. Open title here in
1992.
</P>
<P>
Edberg, at age 30, has announced he will retire after this
year. Besides his two U.S. Open titles, he also has two Wimbledon
and two Australian Open crowns in his credit.
</P>
<P>
In the women's draw, fourth-seeded Conchita Martinez became the
first player to reach the quarter-final round when she defeated
Sweden's Asa Carlsson 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Martinez is seeking her first title on the hardcourts of the
National Tennis Center and the second Grand Slam championship of
her career. She won Wimbledon two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In her last match, Carlsson had ousted 15th-seeded Gabriela
Sabatini to post her biggest career victory. That didn't help her
much against Martinez, who has never lost to the Swede in four
career meetings.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Fossilized rare dinosaur eggs
have been found in northwest China's mountainous Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local archeologists, the 30 round eggs were
discovered in three-meter-deep arenaceous rocks at a basin near
the Qinling Mountain in southern Shanxi. The site is 100 km away
from the spot where world-famous fossilized dinosaur eggs were
found in Xixia County in central China's Henan Province.
</P>

Archeologists agree that the unusual variety of large, round
eggs, date back to the arenaceous period of the Mesozoic Era, (70
million to 100 million years ago).
</P>
<P>
The largest egg is 130 mm by 153 mm.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Skeptical about Iraqi Troops' Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
skeptical about Iraq's announcement of withdrawal of its troops
from Irbil, and its military forces is still on high alert on
Sunday for possible action in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, accompanying President Bill
Clinton in his campaigning tour in Memphis, Tennessee, told
reporters: "Given the provocations of Iraq, we don't put a lot of
credibility in this. It's not what they say, it's what they do."
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced early on Sunday right after its troops inroaded
the Kurdish city of Irbil, close to the border line of the safe
haven, created by the U.S.-led allies after the Gulf war to r
what, but we will respond and we will respond with consequences to
Saddam Hussein," White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said on
NBC's "Meet the Press" program.
</P>
<P>
Panetta said the administration is consulting with allies and
Iraq's Eastern neighbors on possible responses to Iraq's takeover
of Irbil.
</P>
<P>
An administration official said Gen. John Shalikashvili,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Robert Pelletreau,
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, are headed
to the Middle East for the consultations.
</P>
<P>
20,000 American troops in the Middle East are still on high
alert, which was ordered by President Clinton on Saturday, and the
assembling of the "air expeditionary force" of 30-40 fighter
planes is under way.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials said U.S. military flights to enforce
"no fly" zones both in northern and southern Iraq had doubled over
the weekend. An official travelling with Clinton said there is no
evidence to show that Iraq had violated the "no fly" zone.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher cut short a California
vacation and returned to Washington on Saturday. He was reported
to be consulting U.S. allies in the region about a united
response.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said that Clinton telephoned Saudi Arabian King
Fahd on Sunday to discuss latest world developments.
