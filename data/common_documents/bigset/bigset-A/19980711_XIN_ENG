<HEADLINE> UK Approves Ottawa Convention on Banning Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The House of Commons in Britain
Friday approved a draft legislation, bringing the Ottawa
Convention on banning landmines into British law.
</P>
<P>
Under the new legislation, the British government will impose a
prison sentence of up to 14 years for anyone who uses, develops,
produces, buys, owns or transfers a landmine, or even assists,
encourages or induces any one else to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, one of its important clauses is to offer immunity for
British soldiers who might be involved in future joint overseas
military operations with allied forces that use landmines.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Labor government reportedly said earlier that it had
destroyed about half of its 1 million landmines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) extended 100 million U.S. dollars to support India's
population and development program Friday on the eve of the World
Population Day.
</P>
<P>
The amount, to be utilized for the integrated population and
development projects covering 40 districts in six states, is for a
five-year period (1997-2001), UNFPA representative in New Delhi
Wasim Zaman told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The aid is 30 percent higher than the 70 million U.S. dollars
provided to the populous country during the period of 1991 to
1996.
</P>
<P>
Joint Secretary in the Department of Family Welfare K. S.
Sugathan said at the press conference that 50 percent of the UNFPA
aid is for integrated population and development while the
remaining 50 percent would be used for national projects such as
strengthening logistic system for distribution of essential
medicines and contraceptives and implementing the national policy
for empowerment of women.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA also earmarked 10 million U.S. dollars for
non-governmental organizations and voluntary groups, Zaman said.

<HEADLINE> France, Britain Draft U.N. Resolution on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain are to present a
draft resolution to the U.N. Security Council urging the two sides
in Kosovo to accept a ceasefire appeal from the Contact Group on
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken the initiative with the United Kingdom to
prepare a draft resolution for the Security Council aimed at
implementing the declaration of the Contact Group in Bonn on July
8," said French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Yves
Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will discuss the resolution next week, and
France hoped it would be adopted rapidly, he said.
</P>
<P>
The six-nation Contact Group -- the United States, Britain,
France, Russia, Germany and Italy -- Wednesday called on the
Yugoslav government and Albanian rebels in Kosovo to cease
hostilities immediately and resume dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"It would recall, in a single text, the obligations which fall
upon the two sides -- ceasing actions of hostility to allow the
holding of dialogue, implementing all the commitments made by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Moscow on June 16, asking
Belgrade and Albanians of Kosovo to guarantee the security and
freedom of movement of the international observers working in
Kosovo," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
If the obligations were not respected by either side, the
Western countries would consider other measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any further measures to be taken on Kosovo would need the
authorization of the Security Council, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon to Delay Lockheed Antimissile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon is delaying the
next test in its Theater High Altitude Area Defense System after
spending 3.2 billion U.S. dollars on five unsuccessful tests on a
system designed to shoot down missiles aimed at U.S. troops, the
Wall Street Journal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon also said it was taking a series of steps to
restructure the program and effectively punish the prime
contractor Lockheed Martin Corp., which the Pentagon claims has
poorly managed the program.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Lockheed is expected to pick up a
significant part of the multimillion-dollar costs of any future
tests that fail, said Air Force Lt. General Lester Lyles, head of
the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which oversees the
program.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Lockheed has offered to pay as much as 15
million dollars for each future test flight failure, although the
amount and other specific terms remain open to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Because of the failures and changes in the program, the next
test flight which was originally planned in August may be
conducted this fall.
</P>
<P>
The United States planned to start the deployment of the
antimissile system in 2006 at a cost of 14 billion dollars, but
Lyles indicated the delivery date might be delayed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Sergeant Alleged of Taking Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An Air Force staff sergeant of
the U.S. military allegedly exploited weakness in defense
contracting procedures and paid himself about 1 million U.S.
dollars that was supposed to go to defense contractors, U.S. Air
Force investigation found.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has scheduled a general court-martial next week
for Staff Sergeant Robert L. Miller Jr., who is charged with
funding government money to himself through his girlfriend and
others, the Washington Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Miller is also accused of cheating defense contractors of
interest payments by the government.
</P>
<P>
In twin investigations, the Defense Criminal Investigative
Service and Air Force investigators last year researched checks
deposited in several banks. Investigators charged that Miller had
drawn up several U.S. Treasury checks made out to his civilian
girlfriend. She cashed the checks and sent the money back to
Miller.
</P>
<P>
Miller became chief of the Data Entry branch of the Dayton
Operating Location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service
in 1995. He is accused of revising contractor's invoices to make
it look like his girlfriend or others he knew had done the work
and thus should receive the federal checks. It was unnoticed for
several years.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Housing Starts Down in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Housing construction in Canada fell
in June to its lowest level since September 1996, dragged down
mainly by labor disruptions in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
June is the third consecutive month of decline, 4.6 percent
down from May. A total of 132,700 units were recorded in June
across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's largest city of Toronto, the rate of housing
construction hit its lowest level in five years.
</P>
<P>
If the work stoppages by the construction trades continue, the
July rate will fall even further, reports predicted.
</P>
<P>
A sharp decrease in new houses in the western provinces was
another factor pulling down the national rate.
</P>
<P>
The decline is causing some concern among economists. "The
situation bears some monitoring," one was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The housing market may represent only five percent of gross
domestic product, but it is often a very reliable leading
indicator of overall economic activity," the economist noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S Producer Price Index Declines in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Producer Price Index
(PPI) dipped 0.1 percent in June as a second big monthly jump in
drug costs was offset by continued falling energy prices, the
Labor Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The PPI, which measures inflation pressures before they reach
the consumer, fell for the fourth time this year following gains
of 0.2 percent in both April and May, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The June decline was led by a 1.7 percent drop in energy
prices, the eighth decline in the last nine months. Drug costs,
which had soared a record 10.7 percent in May, were up again in
June, rising 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices of tranquilizers, which had caused the May spike, were
also a major factor in the June increase.
</P>
<P>
The overall 0.1 percent price decline was in line with
economists' expectations. It supported the view that inflation
still poses no threat to a U.S. economy and will allow the Federal
Reserve to keep interest rates steady.
</P>
<P>
The Asian currency crisis has cut into U.S. exports of
manufactured goods and farm products and subjected U.S.
manufacturers to increased competition from lower-priced Asian
goods.
</P>
<P>
Through the first six months of this year, wholesale inflation
has actually been falling at an annual rate of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retail prices were rising at an annual rate of just
1.5 percent. That is even better than the 11-year low of 1.7
percent turned in during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 1.7 percent drop in energy prices in June followed a rare
0.8 percent increase in May that had been triggered by a big rise
in the cost of gasoline. Before May, wholesale energy prices had
fallen for seven straight months.
</P>
<P>
In June, gasoline prices were unchanged but the cost of
residential electricity was down 0.9 percent, residential natural
gas prices fell 2.8 percent and home-heating oil plunged by 8.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Food costs edged up a slight 0.1 percent in June following a
0.3 percent decline in the previous month. While there was a 7
percent surge in pork prices, most food categories showed
declines.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the
so-called core rate of inflation at the wholesale level was up 0.2
percent, matching the gains in April and May.
</P>
<P>
However, the department said that without the second big
monthly jump in drug prices, the core inflation rate would have
been up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices for passenger cars were up 0.3 percent in June following
a 1.7 percent decline in May. Prices of tobacco, which had been
rising sharply in recent months, moved up just 0.1 percent in
June.

<HEADLINE> Car Price Difference Remains High in E.U. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain is the most expensive
place to buy a new car in the European Union where prices can vary
by up to 60 percent for one model, a European Commission report
revealed Friday.
</P>
<P>
A comparison of price differences between neighboring countries
with sufficiently homogeneous market conditions revealed
substantial divergences and found no significant changes since the
previous report last November.
</P>
<P>
The Ford Mondeo, for example, recorded a 58.5 percent
difference between the highest and lowest prices in May among the
15 EU members, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report, the 11th of its type, claimed that 60 of the 74
best-selling models examined by the EU executive arm were dearest
in Britain while the lowest prices for 34 models were found in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Portugal were the cheapest countries for 14 of the
models.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Rating, spokesman for the commission's competition
commissioner, said the report would help potential buyers to
decide where to purchase cars.
</P>
<P>
The difference of car prices was explained by the argument that
list prices in individual member states are determined by general
market conditions and that manufacturers take into account the
taxes linked to car purchases.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, France and Germany which have no sale-linked taxes,
pre-tax prices tend to be set higher by manufacturers, while they
are usually set lower in countries with such taxes, said the
commission officials.
</P>
<P>
Non-resident buyers acquiring a car for immediate re-export do
not have to pay such taxes with the purchase.
</P>
<P>
The report for May listed the smallest difference at 12 percent
for the BMW318i.
</P>
<P>
Six months earlier in a previous commission report, the biggest
difference in car prices was reported at 54.3 percent for the VW
Polo and the smallest difference of 12.5 percent for Audi A4.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt Presents New Budget in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram
Saran Mahat Friday presented to parliament a budget which shows an
increase both in development and regular expenditures for the
1998/99 fiscal year that begins in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Of the 69.693 billion rupees (1.1 billion U.S. dollars) budget
estimate presented to the joint sitting of the bicameral
parliament, 37.741 billion rupees (570 million dollars) are
earmarked for development expenditure and 31.952 billion rupees
(480 million dollars) for regular expenditure, up 25.7 percent and
15.4 percent respectively over those of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
On the sources of the budget, Mahat said that 39.479 billion
rupees (600 million dollars) will be borne from the revenue
resources and 7.772 billion rupees (120 million dollars) will be
met by foreign bilateral and multilateral grant assistance.
</P>
<P>
The deficit of 22.442 billion rupees (340 million dollars) will
be met by foreign bilateral and multilateral loans and internal
loans from the banking and other sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation of deficit budget has been besetting Nepal for
years and the deficit is increasing every year.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said that the government has decided to mobilize
government revenues and increase productivity of government
investment with a view to bringing about changes in public
finances.
</P>
<P>
And the government has also decided to extend public sector
investment, strengthen the financial sectors, increase financial
activities and direct the government efforts toward agriculture,
the rural areas, human development, poverty alleviation,
employment generation and social welfare, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said in May that his biggest challenge ahead was the
budget. And for the minority government led by Girija Prasad
Koirala, the budget is truly crucial for its survival.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), which supported the government when it
came to power in mid-April, Thursday voted against the programs
and policies presented by the government for the coming fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The programs and polices were passed in parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For the passage of the new budget in the 205-seat Lower House
of Parliament, a simple majority of 103 votes is need.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has only 88 seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu Post daily said that the NC has reached
understanding with the CPN-ML that the latter will be inducted
into the government after the passage of the budget.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor Put Under House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mayor of Uganda's capital city of
Kampala Nasser Sebaggala has been put under house arrest by a
federal judge in Boston, the United States, pending trial on bank
fraud charges on a date yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
This decision dashed hopes that Sebaggala would be allowed to
return home before trial.
</P>
<P>
During a detention hearing Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge
Marianne Bowler placed Sebaggala under the custody of Edmund
Narine, a Boston resident, the New Vision daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the mayor will have to remain at Narine's house
until his trial. He can only leave the premises under "emergency
situation."
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was also made to deposit a cash bond of 50,000 U.S.
Dollars and an unsecured bond of 950,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
His defense lawyers said that they plan to appeal the judge's
decision.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kelly, one of the two defense attorneys, told journalists
outside the court that "I am neither satisfied nor pleased with
the verdict... nevertheless, I respect the judge's decision."
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely appeal the judge's decision and we will
ask the district judge to review the conditions and allow Mr.
Sebaggala to return to Kampala and perform his duties as Mayor,"
said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, however, told his Kampala supporters in a call
Thursday that he is innocent and confident that he will return
home any time.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala was arrested on June 13 in New York for allegedly
making false customs declaration and depositing altered checks in
a U.S. bank.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Pledges to Form Economic Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen pledged Friday to form an "economic government"
if the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) wins the election.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, he would peacefully hand over the power
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks after meeting visiting Thai army chief
General Chettha Thanajaro at his Takhmau residence in Kandal, 12
kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Chettha Thanajaro, who will retire at the end of September,
arrived here Friday on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
When asked about what preparations he had made for the upcoming
elections, Hun Sen said he was ready for everything.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, he would ensure the elections were held without
violence. Secondly, he was prepared to solve economic problems,
such as the drought and food shortages that Cambodian people are
facing.
</P>
<P>
As for the elections, he said he had made two preparations. If
the CPP won, he would form an "economic government". If it lost,
he would hand over power peacefully and immediately warmly
congratulate the winning party.
</P>
<P>
"Economic problems will be a top priority, if I become prime
minister of the next government", Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen estimated that the CPP would win about six out of 11
Assembly seats in Kandal where he will compete as CPP's
candidate. But even if the CPP got only one seat, he would not
give up.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he had estimated that the CPP would altogether win
about 45 to 60 percent of the 122 National Assembly seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that as a prime minister, he would do his
best to ensure a free, fair and credible atmosphere for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also disclosed that the investigations on the victims
of last July's events, including the grenade attack before the
National Assembly on March 30 last year had made some
progress. But action would be taken after the election.
</P>
<P>
People would be surprised by the outcome of the investigation
when it was made public, Hun Sen added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Promises to Seek Release of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri said on Friday that his government would make every effort
to seek the release of all Lebanese prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks during a meeting with representatives
of the Lebanese prisoners recently set free by Israel and their
supporters, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would take effective measures
to help the freed reintegrate into the society and provide them
with a decent life.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by the International Committee of the Red Cross,
Israel released 60 Lebanese prisoners and returned the bodies of
40 Lebanese guerrillas last month in exchange for the remains of
an Israeli soldier killed in south Lebanon last year.
</P>
<P>
But Israel is still detaining another 117 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israel allowed 43 Lebanese to visit their
relatives jailed in Khiam prison in south Lebanon for the first
time in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
The prison, established by Israeli army and run by its ally
South Lebanese Army, is used to hold those who join the
anti-Israeli guerrilla group Hezbollah (Party of God) and people
who refuse to collaborate with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese resistance forces, which have
been fighting to oust the Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Construction of Kalabagh Dam Causes Mighty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has set off a vigorous campaign at state-run
electronic media to build up public opinion in favor of a
controversial dam on river Indus which is vehemently opposed by
regional and nationalist parties.
</P>
<P>
"Kalabagh dam will improve Indus Water system and bring
economic prosperity by raising hydro-energy and improving
irrigation system," Shamsul Mulk, chairman of the state-run Water
and Power Development Authority (WABDA), said in a recent debate
on Pakistan Television.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif announced construction of the dam on June
11 as part of the national agenda aimed at making energy-starved
Pakistan a self-reliant nation following the economic sanctions by
some Western countries triggered by Pakistan's detonation of
nuclear devices 17 days after similar blasts by India in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said in a recent televised address to the
nation, "Construction of the Kalabagh dam will dawn a new era of
development by bringing green revolution in the country."
</P>
<P>
The government is of the view that the dam to be built at
Kalabagh in central Punjab province would help cultivate more than
one million acres (404,858 hectares) of land and generate
much-needed 3,600 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's announcement has triggered strong
protests from the opposition and regional parties in three smaller
provinces--Sindh, North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) and
Balochistan.
</P>
<P>
The state legislatures of the three provinces have passed
unanimous resolutions rejecting the project and crippling strike
was observed in Sindh on June 17 to protest the government's
decision to go ahead with the hefty scheme.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition leader and former prime minister, Benazir
Bhutto, described the announcement as ill-timed, saying that "it
is a wrong decision at a wrong time as announcement was made
without taking into confidence the people of all the provinces."
</P>
<P>
The pro-dam lobby, however, argues that construction of
Kalabagh dam would help Pakistan save 2.4 billion U.S. dollars it
spends annually on oil imports the bulk of which is used for the
generation of electricity.
</P>
<P>
"Energy experts suggest the best possible way for the country
to meet its increasing energy demands would be to utilize its
water resources and construct huge water reservoirs not only for
electricity generation but also for irrigation purposes," said an
article in leading English daily The Nation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the dam when built would not only be highly
beneficial to the economy of the country as a whole but would also
bring a lot of prosperity to the people of the three provinces,"
The Nation said editorially.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an article carried by another major English daily
The Dawn said the Sindh and NWFP were convinced that construction
of Kalabagh dam would deprive them of their shares of water from
the river Indus.
</P>
<P>
The NWFP politicians feared that the province would not only
lose a big chunk of age-old villages and towns but large tracts of
fertile lands in Nowshera, Swabi and Mardan districts, rated as
most fertile land, due to submerging by flood waters.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement of the construction of the
controversial dam has also sparked a heated debate in the recent
separate sessions of the National Assembly and Senate of the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Awami National Party (ANP), a major ethnic Pushtoon group
in NWFP which parted ways with the Sharif government early this
year over the renaming of the province, has threatened to start a
mass campaign against the construction of the dam.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to resist the Kalabagh dam tooth and nail," said
Senator Ajmal Khattack, president of ANP.
</P>
<P>
Asfandyar Wali, an ANP deputy in the National Assembly, urged
the government not to start work on the project without evolving
consensus of all the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Even some coalition partners of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (N) have opposed the construction of the dam without
national consensus.
</P>
<P>
Motahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), the dominant political force in
urban Sindh and major component of the provincial coalition
government, has urged Prime Minister Sharif to take smaller
provinces into confidence over the issue.
</P>
<P>
the ruling Balochistan National Party in the southwestern
province has criticized the central government for what it said
ignoring view points of smaller provinces.
</P>
<P>
The government, on its part, says it would try to evolve
national consensus before starting construction work on the highly
explosive project. "We will address the reservation of the smaller
provinces," Sharif said following strong protests by the regional
and nationalist groups.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the dam would be equally beneficial for
the smaller provinces but regretted that a technical issue has
been turned into a political one.

<HEADLINE> No Loans for Japan, South Korea: Blatter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said here on
Friday that the soccer's governing body would not consider giving
loans to Japan and South Korea, co-hosts of 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Blatter also said that World Cup will be opened in Seoul of South
Korea on July 13, 2002 but the final will be held in a Japanese city.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think FIFA would accept such a demand to give a loan for
the organization of the World Cup," he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said FIFA has not received any reports from the two countries
that there have been problems in construction of venues and other
necessary infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, FIFA will send a specialists group this fall to inspect
the preparation for the World Cup, which will in turn report to an
Executive Committee meeting in December.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said in the group phase at the 2002 World Cup, 16 teams
will be competing in Japan while the other in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the two host countries will qualify for the
finals automatically, along with the defending champions.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA has yet to decide how the other 29 teams would qualify for
the finals and especially the allocation of slots among the
continental confederations.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said here Friday the nation has to prepare itself for
sacrifices to meet the impact of sanctions as a price for
Pakistan's security.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a high-level meeting with the heads of
nationalized commercial banks and business leaders at the Prime
Minister House, he said the government would give every facility
to industrialists and exporters in order to revive the country's
industry and expand and enhance exports on a massive scale.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also considered at length the problem of defaulted
loans of banks along with the overdue utility bills of certain
individuals and organizations, according to the Associated Press
of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
It was urged that stern action should be initiated against all
major defaulters by confiscating their properties and putting them
on auction.
</P>
<P>
Buyers of such properties will be given protection from probe
or question relating to sources of their income.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also directed the heads of banks and other financial
institutions to prepare a list of those bankers who were
instrumental in sanctioning such defaulted loans without adequate
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan was asked to prepare bankwise
targets for monthly recoveries of defaulted loans.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said high priority is being accorded to the revival of
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, also attended by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz and
Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources Nisar Ali Khan,
considered a number of proposals in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Improve Aviation Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- African nations should resolve the
need for aviation safety for them to benefit from increased
economic growth, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said aviation was the key to economic development in any
nation as nearly half of all world commerce was conducted by air.
</P>
<P>
He was giving a keynote address at the opening of a regional
meeting on the African safe skies initiative.
</P>
<P>
"To take full advantage of expanding air services and trade,"
Slater said, "African nations must first address safety and
security."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that aviation will play a major role in Africa's
future. It will help grow national economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Slater is on a mission to examine Africa's transportation
challenges and find ways the U.S. might help in the safe skies
initiative launched recently by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The initiative aims to improve aviation safety and security in
Africa in a bid to foster growth in aviation services between the
continent and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The initiative would complement United States' efforts to
conclude "open skies" agreements with key African countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by transport ministers from
Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Slater urged African countries to bring their aviation systems
in line with international civil aviation organization standards.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore told
the meeting his government had a program aimed at strengthening
safety in the department of civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is a bold move that should see our skies
becoming safer," he said, adding: "we look forward to cooperating
with your aviation administration to consolidate the work we have
started."
</P>
<P>
He hoped local airlines would be allowed into the U.S.
airspace since their airlines had been accorded similar status in
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> UN, C'wealth Chiefs Used by Nigerian Military: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Punch, a leading Nigerian paper
Friday said Chief Moshood Abiola, the opposition leader who died
in detention Tuesday, claimed that the military government had
used international figures for its own purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to a front-page story, which bears a by-line as "Our
Reporter", Abiola, the presumable winner of the June 12, 1993
presidential elections, suspected that United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his Commonwealth counterpart
Emeka Anyaoku were working for the current military government to
ask him to renounce his mandate of the self-declared president.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I believe the Federal Military Government 'used' the
two men to fly their kite on 'declaration' which was the main
issue they both said worried the Federal Military Government,"
Abiola said in his own account of the meetings between him and
the two persons last week.
</P>
<P>
The paper said this is Abiola's last but undated letter routed
through his wives to a pro-democracy group.
</P>
<P>
It also carries a full-page of photocopy of Abiola's original
handwriting, along with the full text of the transcript.
</P>
<P>
Annan said before the end of his visit that Abiola had agreed
to renounce his mandate following four years in detention.
</P>
<P>
"What i know is that I would want to get on with my life and I
also suspect that the world has moved on. And I cannot sit here
to be naive enough to make assumption that I'm going to be
president," Annan quoted Abiola as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, giving his own version of his meeting with the two
diplomats, Abiola wrote: "the two of them were working as agents
of the Federal Military Government whether they are paid or not."
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the late businessman politician denied that he
had agreed to renounce his mandate.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing on June 12 has been done 'under table' or at a
'secret meeting'... Giving a private 'declaration' to secure my
own release will make all concerned look cheap," according to the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Abiola also said he did not believe Annan's claims that nobody
in the international community will recognize him on the basis of
a five-year old mandate.
</P>
<P>
Virtually the same thing was discussed between Abiola and
Anyaoku, according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Abiola also warned the unnamed addressee: "Beware how you use
this and other materials with you so as not to put the boys in
trouble" and he asked for a "Publicity Blitz" based on "all the
materials you have."
</P>
<P>
It has been noted that after Annan and Anyaoku's visit, the
reported renouncement by Abiola of his presidential mandate seems
to be a score the military government has gained and would be
helpful in a smooth political transition in the most populous
African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition and Abiola's supporters are suspicious
of the renouncement, which they feel like a loss in the struggle
between the Yoruba people in the southwest and the Hausa people
in the north.
</P>
<P>
Yoruba and Hausa are the two biggest ethnic groups in Nigeria.
Many senior military officers are from the Hausa group.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abiola Tuesday afternoon increased the
suspicion that the military rulers have not treated Abiola well.
</P>
<P>
The supporters who disbelieved the government statement that
Abiola died of "cardiac arrest" took to the streets in major
southwestern cities for demonstration, during which riots have
killed more than 30 people.
</P>
<P>
As tension remains high in the southwest despite an uneasy
calm, the letter is expected to come as an igniter to some
radical opposition members and supporters who have vowed to expel
the northerners from power.

<HEADLINE> 6 ICRC Aid Workers Set Free in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Somali fundamentalist group
Friday announced the release of the six International Commission
of Red Cross (ICRC) aid workers kidnaped in the fifth zone of
Ethiopia on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Islamic fundamentalist group of
Al-Itihad Al-Islam in Ogaden region, Ibrahim Sheikh Omar, said
here that the aid workers were released Friday from their place
of captivity in Nogob region at 14:00 local time.
</P>
<P>
They are still on their way to a designated place where they
would be turned over to Somali elders and intellectuals in the
fifth zone as they put it, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ICRC officials in Ethiopia are notified of the
release Friday and they are coming on the designated spot which
he did not specify for "security reasons".
</P>
<P>
Omar said the aid workers were released despite their guilty
status proven on them during the 15-day investigations.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the ICRC aid workers were found
guilty in conducting businesses out of their duties, including
the transportation of money and fuel to the government workers in
the fifth zone of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the release of the ICRC workers is unconditional and
motivated purely on humanitarian ground.
</P>
<P>
Al-Itihad also said that the ICRC workers were treated well
during their captivity.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the only condition set for the release of
the aid workers was that they should notify of their movements in
the region to the Al-Itihad officials in the fifth zone
beforehand when "their Mujahidins operate against the occupation
forces."
</P>
<P>
Omar has accused Ethiopia of destabilizing the region. He
appealed for a referendum for the people of the fifth zone for
total independence from the rest of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the reports reaching here indicate that the
humanitarian and health situation of the two French nationals
kidnaped by Somali militiamen in the northeastern coast last
month is getting better.
</P>
<P>
According to the elders who paid them a visit in Buro village,
45 km east of the port town of Bossaso, the hostages were allowed
to read books and are relatively well fed.

The elders also said that the French men were offered to make

encouraged them to stop their fasting while the French government
was making diplomatic efforts to secure their release.
</P>
<P>
However, the abductors have now further increased their demand
of the ransom up to 85,000 U.S. Dollars. The kidnaped French men
were tourists on a small yacht on their way to Reunion island
controlled by France near Madagascar.

<HEADLINE> UK to Tighten Rules on Nuclear Exports to India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government Friday
announced additional measures to tighten its rules on the exports
of nuclear-related goods to India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
In a written answer to parliament, British Foreign Office
minister Tony Lloyd said that the Labor government made this
latest decision because both India and Pakistan demonstrated their
lack of commitment to non-proliferation and damaged the stability
of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Under these regrettable circumstances it is right that we
should deny the export of nuclear-related goods to India and
Pakistan where they could assist their nuclear programs," Lloyd
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will also consider export license applications for military
items and other dual-use equipment to either country with
particular vigilance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, the British government discouraged
British nuclear scientists or nuclear personnel from maintaining
contacts with Indians and Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indian and Pakistan people are to be barred from
visiting British nuclear facilities.

<HEADLINE> Tamoxifen Does Not Prevent Breast Cancer, Studies Suggest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British and Italian researchers
said Friday that the anti-oestrogen drug tamoxifen did not appear
to prevent breast cancer in their studies.
</P>
<P>
The findings, published in the British medical journal The
Lancet, suggest that more trials will be needed before tamoxifen
can be routinely recommended for the prevention of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Longer follow-up of these trials will be needed to assess the
impact of tamoxifen on breast-cancer death rates, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
The first trial, led by Dr Trevor Powles from the Royal Marsden
Hospital, of London, the UK, involved 2,494 women with a family
history of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
After a median follow-up of 70 months, researchers reported
that "the overall frequency of breast cancer is the same for women
on tamoxifen or placebo."
</P>
<P>
In the second study, Dr Umberto Veronesi and colleagues from
Milan and Bologna, Italy, randomly assigned 5,408 women who had
hysterectomies and also found "no difference in breast-cancer
frequency between the placebo and tamoxifen."
</P>
<P>
Commented in The Lancet, Professor Kathleen Pritchard from
Toronto, Canada, said that the new results "cast doubt on the
wisdom of the rush, at least in some places, to prescribe
tamoxifen widely for prevention."

CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The Saudi United Bank (SUB) has achieved 78.7
million U.S. dollars in net profits and 241.6 million dollars in
operational profits during the first half of 1998, Kuwait News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the bank said that most of its financial
items have soared tremendously due to the merger of the Saudi
United Commercial Bank and the Saudi Cairo Bank into the Saudi
United Bank in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the growth in the bank's assets during the
first half of this year stood at 20.7 billion dollars compared
with 4.2 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders' rights in the bank have jumped to 1.1 billion
dollars from only 630 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
SUB is the third largest bank in Saudi Arabia with an estimated
capital of 820 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi government would buy 21,000 tonnes of dates
worth 19.7 million dollars from farmers in the current season, the
Arabic-language Al-Hayat daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Minister of Agriculture and Water Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz
Bin Moammar told the daily that the move was aimed at promoting the
agricultural sector, "one of the major pillars of the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's representative at the World Bank Mohamed Kamel
Amr said on Friday that Egypt still needs foreign loans to sustain
economic development despite its efforts to reduce reliance on
them, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is carrying out 14 projects in Egypt's health,
irrigation, agriculture and port sectors, which are among the most
successful funded by the institution in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the projects as "satisfactory and above-satisfactory,"
the Egyptian economist said the bank was ready to finance projects
in Egypt, such as the mammoth Toshka land reclamation project and
other new projects involving the protection of environment and
cultural heritage.

<HEADLINE> UK Reports 1st Outbreak of Mussel Poisoning in 30 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British doctors reported Friday in
The Lancet medical journal the first outbreak of shellfish food
poisoning from mussels harvested in Britain in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to The Lancet, investigators from the UK's Central
Public Health Laboratory said that in June 1997, 49 patients
developed acute nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and
fever within 30 minutes of eating mussels at two London
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms lasted longer than eight hours in most of the
patients. The investigators tested samples of mussels from both
restaurants and found high concentration of a phycotoxin called
okadaic acid.
</P>
<P>
Phycotoxins are produced by small marine organisms. When they
are eaten by shellfish such as mussels, the concentrations are
very high and cause severe stomach problems in humans. Okadaic
acid is one of the most common shellfish toxins.
</P>
<P>
The recent outbreak in London is important, the investigators
said, because it "represents the first incident for 30 years
caused by phycotoxin contamination of UK shellfish and the first
ever incident having okadaic acid as the causative agent."

"What I would like to see is former professional players
becoming professional referees and staying involved with the game

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Visits Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Chief of Staff Ismail
Hakki Karadayi visited the Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus
Friday amid rising tension on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from northern Cyprus said that Karadayi
promised that the Turkish army would guarantee the security of the
Turkish Cypriots living in the north.
</P>
<P>
In statements made upon his arrival, Karadayi said "the Turkish
Cypriots should not be nervous about the recent arms build-up by
the Greek Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
He described as a "provocation" the Cyprus government's
decision last year to purchase the S-300 anti-aircraft missile
system from Russia, adding that necessary measures were being
taken against Cyprus' planned deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his country's willingness to keep peace on the
island, the Turkish general warned that Ankara is closely
monitoring every move taken by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, one of three guarantor powers under the 1960 Treaty of
the establishment of the Cyprus Republic, has kept a
35,000-strong armed forces in northern Cyprus. Other two guarantor
powers are Greece and Britain.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay in the north, Karadayi inspected the
Turkish forces and discussed with Turkish Cypriot leaders counter
measures against the deployment of the missiles by the Greek
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi's visit came amid the rising tension on this eastern
Mediterranean island where a tit-for-tat show of force took place
last month between Greece and Turkey by sending their warplanes on
the opposite sides of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou and Commander of the
Greek Cypriot National Guard Demetris Demou, who are currently
visiting Russia, watched Thursday a test firing of the S-300
missile, which is due to be delivered in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
But the Cyprus government has reportedly proposed a delay in
delivering the missiles until November this year in order to give
more time to allow the international mediators to achieve progress
toward a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has made it clear that it would halt the
deployment of the Russian-made missiles only if progress is made
on formulating a schedule for the island's demilitarization or in
the Cyprus peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has described Karadayi's trip to Cyprus' northern areas
as "illegal," saying will make representations to the United
Nations over the visit.

MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

"We have enough strength to nip any plans to seize power,"
Yeltsin told a number of newly promoted army and police
commanders, the Itar-Tass reported.

services and the local authorities to work together.
</P>

He vowed to improve the funding of the defense and interior and
other law-enforcement ministries.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has the right to save on power departments," Yeltsin
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia should create a professional and highly
mobile army to ensure national security in the 21st century. He
added that the navy would have a special role in the next century
in commanding half of the country's nuclear force.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahamed Salim has
expressed his hope that the conflict in Guinea Bissau be resolved
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Salim reiterated OAU's stance that military intervention is
the last choice to be considered in solving conflicts, the the
Noticias newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief, who arrived here on Wednesday, made the remarks
Thursday evening after his talks with Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Senegal's military intervention in Guinea Bissau,
Salim said that the operation was conducted according to the
bilateral agreement reached between the two countries and at the
invitation of President Joao Vieira of Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
Any solution to the crisis in Guinea Bissau should be based on
the respect for the democratically-elected authority in the
country, the OAU chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he changed views with President Chissano on
conflicts in Africa, especially the conflict in Angola, that
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of his meeting with Chissano, Salim delivered a speech
in the Medical Institute of the University of Eduardo Mondlane,
emphasizing the importance of cultivating the culture promoting
peace.
</P>
<P>
On OAU's efforts in pursuing peace, stability and security in
the continent, he said that lasting peace could be maintained
only with popular participation. Salim will end his visit to
Mozambique on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Activities against Peace in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Ismet
Sezgin said Friday that Turkey opposes any activities undermining
peace and stability in the Balkans, the Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Albanian counterpart Luan Haydaraga here,
Sezgin said that Turkey gave priority to the security of Albania
and Macedonia in the face of a growing crisis in the Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has erupted between the Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian rebels seeking independence in Kosovo since February, in
which hundreds of people have been killed. And there are fears the
conflict could disrupt the Balkans' fragile stability.
</P>
<P>
Haydaraga, who was here to sign an agreement on Turkey's grant
of 5 million U.S. dollars to Albania, said that relations between
Albania and Turkey would set an example in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Turkey regards Albania as a natural ally because of its
predominantly Muslim population.
</P>
<P>
Haydaraga stressed that a planned visit to Albania by Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel Tuesday will further strengthen the
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said
Demirel's two-day visit would focus on enhancing the bilateral
ties and the latest developments of the regional situation,
including the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey continues to actively participate in all efforts to
preserve peace and stability in the region and, in this
framework, gives great value to taking the views of Albania and
other regional countries into account," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> IPE Open Interest Tops Half Million for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Total open interest for all the
International Petroleum Exchange's (IPE) futures and options
contracts reached its highest level ever recorded Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IPE announced that the number of open positions reached
502,645 lots, topping the half million mark.
</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to 432 million barrels of oil (six times
more than daily world oil consumption) and 728 million therms of
natural gas (or 10 times daily UK gas consumption).
</P>
<P>
Open interest represents the number of positions outstanding,
that is, those that have not been canceled out by an equal and
opposite transaction.
</P>
<P>
The increase in open interest follows an exceptionally busy
first half of the year for the IPE. Overall traded volumes are up
about a third on the same period for last year.
</P>
<P>
Last month was the second busiest month ever in the exchange's
17-year history, with volumes averaging 81,025 lots a day.
</P>
<P>
The most active month ever recorded was also this year, when an
average of 83,255 lots a day were traded in March.
</P>
<P>
Richard Ward, executive vice president of the IPE, said, "Our
contracts have enjoyed a tremendous year to date, and we look
forward to achieving even more in the second half."

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- General Barry McCaffrey, a

underscore the need for international cooperation on combating
drugs.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey, who is leaving Saturday for Sweden, will also look
at European drug treatment and prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
During his eight-day tour, McCaffrey will make stops in
Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland and England.

"I'm going to Europe to learn about a common problem and to
also share the kinds of strategies that we're trying to build to

</P>
<P>
"The common thread running throughout this visit is that the
problem is the same... drug consumption and the terrible damage to
humans, to their families, to their economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the two highlights of his trip are a visit to
the headquarters of the United Nations Drug Control Program in
Vienna, Austria, where he will exchange views with U.N. officials
on global drug cooperation, and Lisbon, Portugal, where he will
visit the European Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said he was interested to learn from Swedish
officials how to effectively package drug treatment capabilities
to respond to the requirements of the 4 million chronic addicts in
the United States.

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

"We think both sides have done good work here," McCurry added,
referring to the IMF and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
"It's time, though, in our view, for these negotiations to come

supported President Yeltsin's efforts to wind up these

matters to the Duma," noted the spokesman.

"We also agreed that actions that Russia takes now will be the

Minister of Local Government and Housing Bennie Mwiinga said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government is impressed with the road rehabilitation work

current four lanes from the show-ground fly-over bridge at the
outskirts of the capital city to the Lusaka International Airport
junction about 20 kilometres away, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Great North road will also be upgraded and the emphasis
will be put on the improvement of lighting of the road.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blair Offers Immediate Indirect Talks to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Friday proposed "immediate and indirect contact talks" to try to
resolve the Drumcree stand-off which has brought Northern Ireland
to the brink of chaos.
</P>
<P>
Blair's chief of staff Jonathan Powell wrote Friday afternoon
to both the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic Garvaghy Road
residents' association to name four participants each for the
talks by 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Powell's letter said the basis for the talks would be that the
final outcome would have to be agreed in full, covering all
aspects, before implementation.
</P>
<P>
If both sides accept the proposal, the discussion are scheduled
to take place in Northern Ireland at 9 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the Orange Order, which was denied permission to
march down the Garvaghy Road last Sunday, has refused to negotiate
with the residents' association on the grounds that its leader is
linked to the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Blair had spoken by telephone to Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to
discuss the ways of solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held after five Northern Ireland police officers
were seriously injured in increasingly violent clashes Friday with
Protestants angered at the ban on their annual march through a
flashpoint Catholic area.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) said here Friday that the world's major concern should
not be rapid population growth rates but the millions of people
who are impoverished both materially and spiritually.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA Executive Director Nafis Sadik said in a statement
issued on the eve of the World Population Day that if the
individual reproductive health needs are taken care of, the
global need for slower and more balanced population growth will
take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.165 billion people between the age of 15 and 24
and there are more 60-plus year olds living today than ever
before in the world, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Sadik said the eventual size of the world population will
depend on choices of people over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Young people need information and access to health care if
they are to make proper choices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's World Population Day is "approaching
the world of six billion."
</P>
<P>
The world population now standing at 5.9 billion is expected
to reach six billion in 1999, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Department of
Transportation Friday approved a code-sharing alliance between
Northwest Airlines and Kenya Airways.
</P>
<P>
"With this new alliance, passengers traveling between the U.S.
and Kenya can look forward to better and more convenient
service," U.S. Secretary for Transportation Rodney Slater said
here.
</P>
<P>
Slater was attending a conference of eastern and southern
African countries to discuss U.S. President Bill Clinton's Safe
Skies for Africa Initiative aimed at promoting sustainable
improvements in aviation safety and security on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He said the alliance supports the initiative also designed to
promote expanded aviation services between Africa and the U.S.,
which is considered critical to the world's poorest continent's
integration into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The code-sharing alliance will enable Northwest Airlines to
place its code on flights operated by Kenya Airways between
Amsterdam of the Netherlands, Nairobi and beyond.
</P>
<P>
It is the second code-sharing arrangement between a U.S.
airline and an African airline.

<HEADLINE> Turkeys Says No Bargaining on Cyprus Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey declared Friday that it will
not accept any bargaining on the planned deployment of Russian
missiles by the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a news
conference here that Turkey believed that the deployment of Russian
missiles was "a very dangerous development."
</P>
<P>
He was responding to Greece's suggestion that a no-fly zone be
established over Cyprus in return for the cancellation of the
deployment of the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in the
Creek Cypriots-controlled south.
</P>
<P>
"The solution of this problem is not up to us since we are not
the ones who created it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a statement by Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
that Turkey would also install missiles on the island, Atacanli
reiterated that Turkey was taking all necessary counter measures
against the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview late Thursday evening, Yilmaz
reaffirmed Turkey's determination not to make concessions over
the Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that if the S-300 missiles were deployed in
Cyprus, Turkey would respond by stepping up its military presence
to protect the Turkish Cypriots on the island.
</P>
<P>
"We will take all the necessary measures. If they bring
missiles, we will bring missiles too. If they install the
missiles in the south, we will increase our strength in the
north," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Cyprus signed a deal with Russia to buy the
S-300 missiles, triggering tensions on the small island. Turkey
has vowed to use all means to block the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
response to a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been providing political, economic and military
support to the Turkish Cypriots and is the sole country to
recognize the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which was
unilaterally declared by the Turkish Cypriots in 1983.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey is stationing about 35,000 troops in
northern Cyprus with the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish
Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Orangemen Agrees to Talk with Catholic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland's Protestant
Orangemen taking part in the stand-off with police agreed Friday
evening to participate in talks offered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order has been banned from marching along the
Garvaghy Road in Portadown for fear of derailing last April's Good
Friday peace accord. The stand-off continued since last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday proposed "immediate
and indirect contact talks" to try to resolve the Drumcree
stand-off which has brought Northern Ireland to the brink of
chaos.
</P>
<P>
BBC reported that the Orange Order leaders had been positive to
take part in the meeting to be held in Northern Ireland Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the Orange Order had refused to negotiate with the
residents' association on the grounds that its leader is linked to
the political wing of the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The other side, the Catholic Garvaghy Road residents'
association, which has been opposed to the Orangemen parade, also
responded positively to the talks initiative.
</P>
<P>
Breandan MacCionnaith, leader of the Garvaghy Road residents,
indicated that he was likely to attend the talks, to which he gave
"a cautious welcome".
</P>
<P>
But he told reporters he viewed proximity talks only as a first
step towards face-to-face talks with the Orangemen.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the main Protestant political party,
the Ulster Unionists, and now first minister of the British
province's newly elected assembly, also welcomed talks proposal.
</P>
<P>
"I very much welcome this initiative," he told reporters in
Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Safe Skies Policy Supported by African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States and seven
African countries Friday signed a declaration which calls for the
development and maintenance of safe and efficient transportation
systems under the Safe Skies Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed here by U.S. Secretary of
Transportation Rodney Slater and transport ministers from Angola,
Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe, recognizes
the important role of transportation in the economic and social
well-being of each country.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers favored improving regional transportation
systems through strategic investment in transportation
infrastructure elements," said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that safe air travel and secure
airport facilities are prerequisites for Africa's integration
into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Safe skies are necessary for increasing trade, attracting
investment, encouraging tourism and weaving together an
integrated regional society, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the importance of safe and secure airports to
Africa's development, the ministers expressed their intention to
help marshal the political will and long-term resource commitment
necessary to meet safe skies goals," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, the U.S. would help identify
internal sources of revenue which would make programs
self-funding through air traffic control, landing and airport
service fees.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the U.S. intends to provide short-term technical
advice and financial support in cooperation with regional
institutions, international financial institutions and
international civil aviation organizations," the declaration
said.
</P>
<P>
The Safe Skies Initiative, launched by U.S. President Bill
Clinton during his historic trip to Africa early this year, is
aimed at promoting sustainable improvements in aviation safety
and security in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Israel, Palestinians to Hold Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday urged the Israeli and Palestinians to
take direct talks with each other, saying that this is the way to
solve remaining difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that this impasse can be resolved ... if they
do not talk with each other ... It is essential that the parties
talk with each other," Albright told a news conference before a
meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the United States had been working hard to
refine American peace proposals and to narrow gaps between
Israel and the Palestinians, but "there is a limited amount that
the United States or anyone can do if the parties themselves do
not talk with each other to resolve the remaining difficult
issues."
</P>
<P>
Asked how long the U.S. effort would continue, Albright said:
"I believe that while there are constructive discussions going
on that it is worth continuing the process."
</P>
<P>
But "we are clearly coming to the end of this phase and we
cannot let it go on indefinitely," she warned.
</P>
<P>
This week, the United States has been intensifying its effort
to press Israel and the Palestinians for talks so that the
16-month deadlock could be broken up and the peace process
could be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
Albright herself spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu seven times through telephone to urge him to accept a
U.S. proposal on Israel's further withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
She also met with a Palestinian delegation on Thursday after
talking with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on telephone on
Wednesday.

<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
Friday welcomed the British initiative on ending the impasse over
a banned Protestant march in Northern Ireland, according to press
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed early Friday that
representatives from the pro-British Orange Order and local Roman
Catholic residents hold indirect talks to bridge their
differences.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, a major player in the Northern Ireland peace process,
said in a statement issued in Dublin: "I would urge both the
Garvaghy Road residents and the Orange Order to cooperate fully
with this initiative."
</P>
<P>
"The preservation of peace must be everyone's priority. The
disorder and lawlessness that we have seen this week is very
damaging to the interests of Northern Ireland," Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
The banning of the traditional annual Orange Order march in the
Catholic areas in Belfast has triggered wide-spread violence in
Northern Ireland over the past few days, putting the peace process
in grave danger.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday
said Africa can become a full partner in the global community
through building strong economies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said this in a statement addressed to
southern and eastern African transport ministers attending a
meeting in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are discussing the safe skies initiative
unveiled by Clinton during his six-nation African tour in late
March to promote air safety in Africa so as to foster the growth
of aviation services with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The initiative complements the U.S. efforts to conclude "open
skies" agreements with key African countries.
</P>
<P>
"By building strong economies," Clinton said, "We can ensure
that Africa can become a full partner in the global community of
the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He said in the statement that "by upgrading your airports and
navigation systems, you will improve aviation safety and security
systems."
</P>
<P>
"In turn, this will expand regional and international air
service and promote economic growth and development," the U.S.
president said.
</P>
<P>
The safe skies initiative meeting is being attended by U.S.
Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
Also present are transport ministers from Angola, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and

JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will attend a South Common Market (MERCOSUR)
summit and visit Argentina and Brazil from July 19 to 25, South
African Foreign Ministry said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Mandela would address the heads of state of
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that a foreign head of state has been
invited to address the MERCOSUR summit," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will also hold separate discussions with leaders of
Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
"The MERCOSUR summit meeting will provide an excellent
opportunity for the president to discuss regional issues
affecting southern Africa and MERCOSUR, especially in the context
of growing globalization and the emergence of new regional
trading blocs," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is South Africa's biggest trading partner in Latin
America, with bilateral trade reaching more than 2.75 billion
Rand (550 million U.S. Dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and Argentina stood at 1.6 billion
Rand (320 million U.S. Dollars) in 1997.

</P>
<P>
South Africa is in the process of negotiating a number of
bilateral agreements with Latin American countries, including
Brazil and Argentina, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, the agreements would enable the enhancement of
relations in various fields between South Africa and the region.

<HEADLINE> South African Court Upholds Abortion Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Pretoria High
Court Friday dismissed an application by three Christian groups
to declare the abortion law unconstitutional, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The Christian groups based their case on the argument that the
life of a human being started at conception, that abortion
terminated the life of a human being and that Section 11 of the
South African Constitution applied to an unborn child from the
moment of the child's conception.
</P>
<P>
The defendants including Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma,
however, argued that the fetus was not a bearer of rights in
terms of the constitution, that Section 11 of the constitution
did not preclude the termination of pregnancy in the
circumstances and manner contemplated by the act and that the
right of women to choose to have their pregnancy terminated was
protected under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Judge S.W. Mccreath considered that the fetus is not a legal
persona and that there was no expressed provision in the
constitution affording the fetus legal personality or protection.
</P>
<P>
The ruling immediately sparked mixed reaction in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zuma welcomed the ruling, saying it was a victory for South
African women.
</P>
<P>
"The court ruling will remove uncertainties around the
legality of termination of pregnancy, and help assert women's
right to choose and take decisions affecting their lives," Zuma's
office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government's Gender Equality Commission echoed Zuma's
words that the ruling was a victory for South African women.
</P>
<P>
"This is a particularly courageous judgment which affirms the
constitutional rights of women," head of the commission legal
department Lisle Gerntholtz said.
</P>
<P>
However, Africa Christian Action said that the ruling was a
travesty of justice. If the right of the members of society is
not upheld, then the Bill of Rights is a worthless piece of
paper."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's GDP up 14 Pc in 1997: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Planning
and Finance Tomaz Salomao announced here Friday that the gross
domestic product (GDP) of the country in 1997 grew by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not give the specific sum of the GDP, but it
is estimated at two billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Salomao promised that the
economy of Mozambique this year will "maintain the momentum of
significant recovery and growth."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the momentum of growth in the first
quarter this year was strong compared to the same period last
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister predicted that the GDP will increase by 10
percent in 1998. The target of the GDP growth for 1998 set by
the Mozambican government is 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the construction sector, the
industrial sector, especially the processing industry, and
transportation sector are among the sectors with rapid growth.
The growth rates in construction and transportation are 16
percent and 22.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Salomao noted that the inflation rate was 6.4 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the reform is slow while the heavy
external debt is seriously hindering the recovery and growth of
the economy in the southern African country. And bureaucratism
can be seen clearly in some departments of the government.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government declared in April that the GDP of
the country grew by eight percent last year. Referring to this,
the planning and finance minister said that according to the
latest statistics, the GDP growth rate in 1997 should be 14
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Activities undertaken to
implement Ethiopia's national population policy in the past five
years have made encouraging achievements, the National Population
Office of Ethiopia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued to mark the World Population Day which
falls on July 11, 1998, Head of the National Population Office,
Nigussie Teferra said major undertakings over the implementation
of the policy in the past few years focused on areas of capacity
building and the creation of integrated working mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the unbalanced population growth in the
sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia, has now become a pressing
issue.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office has endorsed a study on the
structural framework undertaken by the National Population Office
with a view to alleviating existing manpower shortage, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Teferra, the United Nations Population Fund has
alloted about 28 million U.S.Dollars for the implementation of
the national population policy in the coming four years, and 80
percent of the fund will go into the implementation of the policy
in regions, mainly to the reproductive health care with a view to
minimising the death toll of mothers and children.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Population Day will be observed under the
theme of ''the day of the six billion people'' as it is envisaged
that the world population which now stood at 5.9 billion will
grow to 6 billion next year.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government

Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) believed to pose
threats to national security."
</P>
<P>
The office of the Ethiopian government spokesperson is quoted
by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying that "the Ethiopian
government has gathered that EPLF has begun functioning through
its ordinary members reorganizing anew its structure in an
attempt threatening national security."
</P>
<P>
"EPLF has organized its members to raise funds, provide
intelligence services, involve in espionage and spread propaganda
to foster its war efforts," office said.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, members of the EPLF who have been rounded up today will
be sent to their country," the office said, adding that "the
measure does not apply to law abiding Eritreans who could lead
their life peacefully as usual."
</P>
<P>
Officials of the EPLF were deported on June 13, according to

<HEADLINE> Dar es Salaam Int'l Trade Fair Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Deputy Minister
of Industry and Commerce, Shamim Khan, said Friday that the 22nd
Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair has been a success.
</P>
<P>
Khan, who closed the fair in the capital city's Saba Saba
grounds in the evening, said the eight-day fair has been
"hectic."
</P>
<P>
She said 320,000 people have visited the fair grounds. And
business visitors are estimated at around 5,000. An entrance
ticket is sold at 700 Shillings (about 1.04 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries represented at the fair increased to 23
countries from 17 countries last year, while the total number of
Tanzanian participants reached 600, compared to 589 last year,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Export orders during the fair worth 1.41 million U.S. Dollars
are recorded, whereas import orders worth 3.2 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sales on the spot have surpassed 1.98 billion
Shillings (about 2.96 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister expressed satisfaction over the success of
the fair, saying "The number of trade inquiries received during
this fair attests to our conviction that the Dar es Salaam
International Fair can be an effective tool for promoting exports
and really serve as a bridge to global trade."
</P>
<P>
Khan said the government will continue to support the
organization in future fairs to make them more successful.
</P>
<P>
She urged members of the business community especially the
private sector to come forward in larger numbers and to play a
more prominent role in the organization and management of
regional trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister's views were shared by K.S. Mwasha, the
Director of Research and Planning of the Board of External Trade
(BET), who said the trade fair is a "very big success."
</P>
<P>
"The exhibitors are happy," he said, adding that some have
expressed willingness to attend next year's fair.
</P>
<P>
The official with the BET, the major organizer, revealed that
an international consumer goods fair will be held in Dar es
Salaam in December this year.
</P>
<P>
The official also highlighted the role of privatization in the
country's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the setting up of more private firms means
more investment and greater job opportunities, which in turn will
increase people's purchasing power and make trade fairs even
booming.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Killed by Ex-Freedom Fighters' Landmine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian resident has
been killed by a landmine abandoned by the former freedom
fighters of the Pan-Africanist Congress of South Africa in a forest
in the Coast Region.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said here Friday that another civilian was
wounded in the incident happened on June 13 in Pongwe Msungula
forest in Bagamoyo District.
</P>
<P>
The area, which was used by the freedom fighters as a camp
during their struggle against the then apartheid regime, has been
restricted and police, in collaboration with the Tanzania
People's Defense Forces (TPDF), have already discovered 73
landmines within two days.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Semiono, whose leg was injured in the blast, was
quoted as saying that he tried to warn his brother Hamisi Said
against playing with an unknown object, but failed.
</P>
<P>
"He opened the lid of the oval object, and there came a sound
which indicated that something dangerous was about to happen,"
Semiono said. "I started running away from him and heard a huge
explosion."
</P>
<P>
Said, 23, was blown up and part of Semiono's right leg was
ripped off by an object.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, Jakaya Kikwete, has toured the Pongwe Msungula
forest and warned the residents not to visit the area until it
was made safe.
</P>
<P>
Local police told the minister that 15 hectares of land have
been cleared of the landmines, but it was difficult to continue
the search for others because of long grass.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Blair's New N. Ireland Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday welcomed a British proposal for indirect talks between
Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland to try to end a
dispute over a banned Protestant march through a Catholic area.
</P>
<P>
"The president is very concerned about the violence that has
occurred there," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The president welcomes and applauds the action today by the
government of the United Kingdom to initiate indirect contact
talks between the Orange Order and the residents of Garvaghy
Road," he said.
</P>
<P>
A six-day impasse over the planned parade in the town of
Portadown has been marked by rioting and attacks on police across
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed
that members of the Protestant Orange Order and Roman Catholic
residents from where the march has been banned nominate four
representatives each to discuss their differences on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that kind of dialogue, if it happens tomorrow,
diminishes the violence and encourages people to see that through
talking they can resolve some of the differences that they do
have," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"That would be an expression of faith in the peace process that
the citizens of Northern Ireland have blessed at the ballot box
and made clear that they want to see as the useful tool for the
decisions that need to be made about their own future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also added that the U.S. will be monitoring those
developments on Saturday as the parties gather to talk.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday reaffirmed that the United States
opposes any visit to Libya under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks came as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak went to
Libya on Thursday to see Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who had
surgery for a broken hip.
</P>
<P>
Albright called Mubarak's visit a "one-time humanitarian"
exception to the U.N. sanctions, which include a ban on travel
to Libya. But she just ruled out any more such kind of visits.
</P>
<P>
"We felt that a one-time humanitarian visit was appropriate
but we are not going to go along with any further visits by
anyone for the purpose of paying courtesy calls on Mr Gadhafi,"
she said at a news conference before a meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Mubarak's call on Gadhafi "lies within the
parameters of Arab traditions and neighborly relations."

<HEADLINE> Texas Education Board to Divest Disney Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Texas Board of Education on
Friday voted to dump its 43 million U.S. dollars in Walt Disney
Co. stock in protest against sex, violence and drugs in movies
produced by the company's Miramax subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a 8-4 vote by the board members
after the American Family Association of Texas, which is involved
in a Disney boycott, sent members a videotape of Miramax film
excerpts that included scenes of murder, drug use, according to
an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Texas became the first state in the country to rid itself of
Disney stock in protest against the content of its films.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Southern Baptist Convention last year voted to
boycott Disney in protesting against the company's practice of
extending health insurance to same-sex partners of employees and
of having "Gay Days" at its amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Jack Christie, a Houston Republican, had said he
hoped a vote to divest "sends a message to Miramax... that the
public in general has had enough of exposing children to the
violence and explicitness in these movies."
</P>
<P>
But Claudia Peters, Disney director of corporate
communications, said that film subsidiaries of Disney that produce
movies for mature audiences are set up under other names and
adhere to the rating system.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Meets with U.S. Supreme Court Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Saturday outlined his vision of justice in Europe to a delegation
of U.S. Supreme Court judges.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said the
meeting was ``very friendly, relaxed and trusting'' and was
focused on the issues of European construction and
European-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told his guests that European countries were committed
to developing and defending what he called the ``social model
proper for Europe'', according to which the government is
responsible for the social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
He said that Europe would become ``a considerable economic,
cultural and political pole'' in the world after the European
Union was enlarged to central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
An enlarged European Union would have 500 million people, a
single market and a single currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that France paid great importance to relations
between Europe and the United States, which were important for
constructing a multipolar world in the 21st century in "harmony,
balance and consensus''.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court delegation comprised four judges: Sandra
Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy and Stephen
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of their visit to France and other European
countries was to compare the judicial systems of the U.S. and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
They will meet with Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and Minister
of Justice Elisabeth Guigou on Monday, and will visit the French
Council of State, the Court de Cassation and the Constitutional
Council, the combination of the three being roughly the equivalent
of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
They will also attend the July 14 French National Day parade on
Champs-Elysee and join the traditional garden party at the Elysee
presidential palace afterwards.

<HEADLINE> Thai Education Ministry Plagued by Corruption Scandals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Corruption scandals have plagued
Thailand's Education Ministry where a number of officials are
facing corruption complaints, according to the Counter Corruption
Commission (CCC).
</P>
<P>
A total of 172 complaints were lodged against education
officials on grounds of corruption and irregularities in 1997, the
commission said in its annual report available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is among the top three ministries plagued by
corruption scandals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The other two ministries are the Interior with 361 complaints,
and the Agriculture with 145 complaints.
</P>
<P>
The commission's graft and corruption claims apparently added
weight to the Office of Auditor-General which reported
irregularities involving budget spending at the Education
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Chumpol Silpa-archa revealed earlier that
several education offices did not have receipts for spending
programs, some issued checks to unidentified creditors and those
who signed procurement projects were not authorized persons.
</P>
<P>
Some agencies failed to submit copies of contracts worth more
than one million baht (25,000 U.S. dollars) to the state auditor
and others also failed to collect delay fines, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
But he said he would leave inquiries to the CCC while asking
for detailed information from agencies concerned to keep suspected
officials in check.
</P>
<P>
He said he has assigned the directors-general to closely
monitor spending of agencies under their supervision and make sure
they observe ministerial regulations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Improving Quality of Amusement Park Rides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's State Bureau of Quality
and Technology Supervision reported today that some 85 percent of
Chinese amusement park rides meet quality standards.
</P>
<P>
This is much better than in 1996, when it found that only
about 42 percent of the rides qualified.
</P>
<P>
Out of 20 ferris wheels manufactured in the cities of Beijing
and Shanghai, and in Shandong, Liaoning, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan,
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, 17 were up to standards.
</P>
<P>
There were 19 companies involved. Four of them did not have the
proper permit and only 50 percent of their products passed.
</P>
<P>
Amusement park rides involve questions of safety and are
strictly controlled by the state, but some companies still produce
low-quality rides without any production permit.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few accidents have happened in amusement parks in
recent years because of rides, resulting in serious injuries
and deaths. This has caused a great deal of concern in the
government, which has decided to tighten controls.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau's study did show however that quality awareness has
greatly improved and that the production permit system has
provided quality guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau has told quality supervision departments across the
country to improve inspections of amusement park rides, and to
stop the production of inferior products.

There are about 2,000 police involved in the drug fight in
Yunnan, which is a major drug conduit to other parts of China from
the Golden Triangle.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, police here have dealt with some 50,000
drug cases and seized more than 70 tons of narcotics, accounting
for 80 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
The new agencies are expected to foil drug deals and to tighten

of Zambia reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum has also withdrawn its services from ZESCO
after the company accrued a four billion Kwacha (two million
Dollars). And the petroleum company has now resorted to selling
the corporation only on a cash basis.
</P>
<P>
Other companies ZESCO owes money include the Zambia Metal
Fabricators with two billion Kwacha (one million Dollars) and the
Zambia Forestry and Forest Industries Company with 1.8 billion
Kwacha (900,000 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted ZESCO Managing Director Robinson Mwansa who
unveiled his company's financial woes Thursday as saying that
ZESCO got into financial trouble eight months ago when ZCCM
stopped settling its electricity bills through Copperbelt Energy
Corporation, a customer of the electricity corporation.
</P>
<P>
Last month, ZCCM owed the energy corporation more than 50
million Dollars and the debt keeps rising due to the country's
mining conglomerate's delayed privatization of the two key mining
units -- Nchanga and Nkana, which has driven ZCCM further into
the quagmire, making it fail to pay its huge electricity bills.
</P>
<P>
Mwansa painted a very grim picture about the company's
financial plight and the looming crisis if no measures are taken
to ensure its continued viability.
</P>
<P>
Mwansa said the situation has become so bad that ZESCO is now
failing to buy important materials such as transformers, diesel,
insolation tapes poles and meters for its operations.
</P>
<P>
He added that ZESCO owes nearly every bank in Zambia some
money through overdrafts and warned that if these banks decide to
withdraw the overdraft facility, his company will fail to pay
salaries.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published on the same day, the paper urged the
government to find a quick solution to this "highly contagious
form of economic pneumonia" that threatens the viability of a
number of companies that rely on the mines for survival.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if the present chain-reaction continues, it
will have dire consequences on the whole economy and render
useless many of the positive economic achievements made so far.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Not Election-oriented: Nepali Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram
Saran Mahat said here Saturday that the budget he presented to
parliament Friday for the 1998/99 fiscal year which begins in
mid-July is not election-oriented.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is the budget should be based on the
realities of the country," Mahat told a press conference organized
by the Federation of Nepalese Journalists.
</P>
<P>
"I have done according to the realities of the nation," he
said. "Sustainable development and national interest are taken
into consideration in the budget."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who came to power in
mid-April, has said that he would announce the date later this
year for general elections in April/May next year.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the economic conditions of the
country are not satisfactory, and the development process has not
found the right path in the past 50 years. "This is due to both
internal and external factors," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia has
indirectly affected Nepal and the country could not move the
economic mobilization in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
"The new budget will bring about economic activities in the
right path," he said, adding that some arrangements have been made
in the new budget to mobilize the revenues effectively and control
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mahat said that the new budget has laid emphasis on economic
discipline of the country, proper use of the resources for
productive sectors and the limitation of overdraft to be taken
from the Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The budget also stresses the implementation of the program of
"Development in Each Village: Employment in Each Family" to solve
the problem of growing unemployment and rural development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the new budget attaches importance as well to
promoting exports, creating investment environment and making
reform in the industries which are not operating well, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that value added tax (VAT) will be fully implemented in
the country from the coming fiscal year. "We have consulted the
business community and the decision was taken on consensus basis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal formally introduced the VAT in November 1997 despite
strong opposition from the business community.
</P>
<P>
Mahat disclosed that Japan, Britain, India, Germany, the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other donor countries and
agencies involved in the development of Nepal are committed to
their contributions to the new budget.
</P>
<P>
Of the government's 69.693 billion rupees (1.1 billion U.S.
dollars) budget estimate, 7.772 billion rupees (120 million
dollars) will be met by foreign bilateral and multilateral grant
assistance.
</P>
<P>
And the deficit of 22.442 billion rupees (340 million dollars)
will be covered by foreign bilateral and multilateral loans and
internal loans from the banking and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will discuss and vote on the budget next week.

<P>
QINGDAO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Development zones in China's
Shandong Province have helped overall economic growth in the
province, Wang Chuntao, director of the provincial Foreign Trade

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They have brought a number of technology-intensive and high

Singapore, and South Korea industrial parks, are up to
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Wang says that 6.84 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign funds
had been committed to the development zones by the end of last
year, and 3 billion dollars of that was in place. The zones have
3,241 projects.
</P>

Large international conglomerates like Siemens, Thyssen,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Daewoo Cement, Hyundai Motors, Chase
Manhattan Bank, and Pittsburg Plate Glass have also invested in

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Tobacco's Price Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- While there has been a marked
improvement in the average price of Zimbabwean tobacco, experts
have predicted the price will not go beyond 1.75 U.S. Dollars per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Herald Saturday reported a total of 106 million kgs
have so far been sold at prices ranging from 1.27 U.S. Dollars a
kg to 1.96 Dollars a kg.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have earned three billion Zimbabwean Dollars (106
million Dollars) from more than half of the flue-cured tobacco
crop reduced this season.
</P>
<P>
Flue-cured tobacco is being sold at 1.71 Dollars a kg in
Brazil and Zimbabwe needs to maintain its prices at almost the
same level, in order to retain the market share it has enjoyed
for years, Brazil and Zimbabwe are two O the main tobacco
producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Market information director of the Zimbabwe Tobacco
Association Pat Davis Friday said although prices had started
firming after weeks of waiting by farmers, they would not reach
last season's levels because of problems in the United States and
the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Last season the crop fetched an average price of 2.4 Dollars a
kg, which would be difficult to beat in view of the problems on
the world market.

Romao Mutisse, Magistrate of southern Mozambique's Moamba
County, said Friday that South Africa might have not permitted
water to flow down two cubic meters per second as mutually agreed
upon to the lower reaches of the Incomati River, drying up the
river bed in the county.
</P>
<P>
Mutisse said the South Africans might be preventing water of
the river from flowing down to Mozambican land as they did in
1993/1994, to the neglect of the water sharing agreement between
the two countries, the Noticias reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate complained that his people have begun to dig for
underground water, but with the rainy season is yet to come by
in November, the effort is far from enough in the county which
began to find even drinking water in short supplies in June, not
to mention the irrigation of crops.

Incomati River which originates from South Africa, flows past

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG May Become African Standing Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
ECOMOG may soon transform into an African standing force for the
resolution of conflicts in the continent, the Daily Times
reported Saturday, quoting ECOMOG chief, Maj.-Gen. Timothy
Shelpidi.
</P>
<P>
When the proposed force comes on stream, it will operate like
those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United
Nations, Shelpidi told a recent sub-regional forum on conflict
management and resolution in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, a military arm of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), is known for its successful
peace-keeping operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest contributor of troops, funding and
logistics to ECOMOG, has proposed to turn it into a continental
standing force.
</P>
<P>
"The composition of such a standing force will comprise
military and paramilitary troops from member states contributing
to such organizations," the Nigerian general stated.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi, however, described differences in language, training
of armed forces, equipment and orientation as some of the
problems that ought to be settled to ensure smooth operation of
the proposed force.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, led to command and kitting problems and delay
in troop deployment.
</P>
<P>
The force commander called for central funding for the peace
keeping force to avoid the current financial problems of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"The case of Liberia, for instance, where some of the
contributing countries to the ECOMOG had to depend on other
countries within and outside the sub-region for sponsorship for
them to participate in the peace keeping activities is not the
best," Shelpidi said.
</P>
<P>
Financial problems also handicapped some countries willingness
to contribute troops to ECOMOG for operations in Sierra Leone, he
pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Industry Minister Steps Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The High Court of Tanzania
has unseated Sengerema Member of Parliament William Shija, who is
also the Minister of Industry and Commerce, after declaring his
1995 general election results in the constituency null and void.
</P>
<P>
Shija has therefore, automatically lost his ministerial post,
becoming a second minister that was forced to step down in two
months in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Reading a nine-hour judgement Friday, Judge Anthony Mrema
declared the elections void because election regulations were
violated, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mrema said Shija, who was then the Mwanza Regional
Commissioner, did not resign his post before he contested in the
Sengerema constituency, a violation of the Election Act.
</P>
<P>
The judge also said that many polling stations were not opened
in time, making 17,489 registered voters fail to vote.
</P>
<P>
In the elections, Shija scooped 19,917 votes against 13,080
votes won by Fortunatus Masha of the opposition United Democratic
Party (UDP).
</P>
<P>
Shija was absent from the court when the judgement was read.
He was represented by his counsel.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Shija follows that of Sebastian Kinyondo, who was
unseated by the High Court as MP for Bukoba rural constituency in
late May. The judgement made Kinyondo lose his position as the
Minister of Labor and Youth Development.
</P>
<P>
Kinyondo was charged with corruption and using abusive
language against others in his 1995 election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Women Have High Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Angolan women enjoy the highest
birth rate among central African countries, with every woman
giving birth to an average of 7.2 children.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Population Fund office in Angola revealed
this to the press here Friday at the eve of the tenth World
Population Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the Population Fund, the main reason for the high
birth rate is early marriage and sex life, low education level on
the part of women as well as traditional family mode of
multitude.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Population Fund show that the birth rate
for an average Zambian woman is 6.4, for Tanzanian woman is 5.5,
whereas in the Democratic Republic of Congo the rate is 6.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the U.N. Population Fund has allocated a total of
15 million U.S. Dollars for Angola during the year 1997 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's World Population Day is "to
establish a healthy and protected society." Starting from
Saturday to next Friday, Angola will launch a series of
activities to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Currently Angola's population stands at nearly 12 million, one
third of which are under 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Due to long years of civil war, the population in the southern
African country is concentrated mainly in cities and their
environs, with very few people dwelling in the countryside. About
one fourth of the total population are residing in the area near
the capital Luanda.

Analysis and Research Group. Wang said CCTV carried three major
events in about two weeks live: President Jiang Zemin's press
conference with President Clinton, Clinton's speech at Beijing
University, and this court case.
</P>
<P>
"These show the world that China's decision makers are more
self-confident, open-minded, and willing to trust people to make
their own judgement," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The trial was in Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court,
presided over by a panel of judges, headed by Judge Sun Jian. It
involved a suit brought by 10 Chinese film studios against 3
companies which were accused of copyright violations in the case
of 27 feature films.
</P>
<P>
The judges delivered their first verdict after four hours of
debate and ordered the 3 defendants to pay 480,000 yuan in
compensation for copyright violations, and told them not to repeat
the offense.

<P>
CCTV also invited two legal scholars on hand to explain to the
audience the legal issues involved and to answer questions over
the phone.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow a live broadcast came when Xiao Yang, the
newly-elected president of the Supreme People's Court, said
recently that the media could cover some trials, but that the media
would be held responsible for getting the facts right. So, the
live broadcast drew a lot of of attention.
</P>
<P>
Law professors and legal scholars said, in telephone
interviews, that the parties involved were able to express their
views well, and that the judges' decision was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
But, according to Gao Mingxuan, vice-president of the China Law
Society and prominent professor of law, what was most significant
was not the case itself, but the significant breakthrough in the
open trials. Although it is provided for in the Chinese
constitution, it has not really been done, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Usually, people who want to attend a hearing need to get a pass
outside the courthouse with their ID card.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiayang, deputy director of People's University's
Communications Research Institute, calls the live broadcast
"inevitable".

Li Bo, one of the defense lawyers, acknowledged that having to

the judges and lawyers, demanded high standards, and said he
thinks that open trials will promote equity and justice.
</P>
<P>
The foreign media also paid close attention to the event and
many foreign journalists were present at the court and talked to
people on the street. Beijing residents also showed great interest
in it.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma Aidi, president of Beijing's No.1 People's
Court, Chinese courts have long tried to reform trial methods to
safeguard justice and build a democratic legal system.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 local television channels have shown trials in the past
or excerpts of trials in cooperating with local courts. Some
were even in live telecasts.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Supreme People's Court promises that the
SPC will repeat today's practice across the country by examining
the experience and will develop rules for live broadcasts of
future court trials.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Raises Panel on New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military government
has set up a special committee to study various views expressed
during a nationwide consultation on the country's transition to
civil rule program and make its recommendations to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The Flag Officer of the Eastern Naval Command, Rear Admiral
Victor Ombu, made this known at the end of a meeting of the
highest ruling body, the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), in
Abuja, the Daily Times said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ombu did not name the members of the committee, but the
newspaper said it comprises mainly PRC members.
</P>
<P>
The committee will make recommendations on the fate of the
country's five political parties, the various transition agencies
and previous elections held under the transition program three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
It will submit a report next week to enable the PRC make its
final decision on the way forward, the report said, adding the
decision will be known in a broadcast by new leader General
Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
According to late leader Sani Abacha's transition program, the
military will return Nigeria to a civilian government on October
1, 1998 after a presidential election on August 1.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was, until his sudden death on June 8, the consensus
presidential candidate of the five parties.
</P>
<P>
Following his death, there have been suggestions that the
parties registered by him should be dissolved, the transition
agencies restructured and all previous elections canceled.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has been calling for the cancellation of the
whole transition program. They want the military to hand over to
Moshood Abiola, the believed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential election, who had been in jail for four years.
</P>
<P>
But that was made impossible by the sudden death of Abiola on
July 7, just as he was discussing his release with Abubakar and a
high-powered U.S. delegation headed by Under Secretary of State,
Thomas Pickering.
</P>
<P>
The military has been strong pressured from both home and
abroad to implement a rapid transition to civil rule, but there
are also suggestions that the transition should not be such a
rush so as to damage the power basis of the coming civilian
government.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin went over the head of the
International Monetary Fund and urged Western leaders to support a
multibillion-dollar package of financial assistance to defend the
Russian currency.
</P>
<P>
-- United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan suggested that
the United Nations might play a role in restoring peace in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas, where the Government has
confronted a rebel band for several years. His comments, at a news
conference, were the first indication that the Mexican Government
might be willing to accept mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria spent the day waiting -- for the independent autopsy
that could determine whether its leading dissident was slain or
simply died, for its military government to reveal how it plans to
return the country to democracy, and for something more like
normal life to resume.
</P>
<P>
-- The vast majority of secret U.S. government evidence used to
charge and detain six Iraqi opposition members as national
security threats was erroneously classified and will be
immediately turned over to the Iraqis' attorneys, the Justice
Department said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Stock Exchange Index Hits New Low This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)
Saturday hit a new low for the year, with the index shedding 31.4
points compared with Wednesday to close at 1,996.8 points, the
first time dropping below the 2,000-point level.
</P>
<P>
The volume, transactions and value all slipped with a total of
21.60 million shares over 715 deals against 29.52 million shares
over 1,016 deals Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of shares changed hands also fell to 5.54 million
Kuwaiti dinars (18.28 million U.S. dollars) from Wednesday's 7.66
million dinars (25.27 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Most analysts believe that a "wait and see" attitude adopted by
major dealers and the drop in oil prices are the main reasons for
the slump.
</P>
<P>
Some economists, however, insist that the Kuwaiti government
shoulder some blame for the slide in the stock market. The
government does not have a precise financial policy, they said.

<HEADLINE> Young People Go on Expedition to Remote Chinese Countryside (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of young people between
the ages of 17 and 25 from 11 different countries began a
ten-week expedition on China's Great Wall today.
</P>
<P>
The group has 31 college students from China and 90 from
Britain, Argentina, Chile, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Oman,
Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The "Inchcape Initiative" gives the young adventurers a chance
to go to remote mountainous areas and villages in Shandong and
Jiangsu Provinces, where they will help local farmers build three
primary schools and four small irrigation dams.
</P>
<P>
They will also camp out at two nature reserves in Jiangsu for
David's deer and red-crowned cranes, which are endangered species,
where they will build an observation tower and animal compounds.
</P>
<P>
The expedition was started by Britain's Raleigh International,
a charitable organization that helps young people understand
themselves better for personal development.
</P>
<P>
Natascha Uberbacher, a Raleigh spokeswoman, says that her
organization has frequently recruited young people worldwide to go
to developing countries to do various challenging community and
environmental projects to help them get more experience and
understand their own potential.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has encouraged the
younger generation to get some experience and improve themselves
through social work, to build themselves up physically and
mentally by working under harsh conditions, and to learn the
virtues of selflessness and dedication.

Raleigh has organized 125 expeditions in 35 countries for
15,000 young people since 1984, Uberbacher says, but this is the
first one in China, where they are working with the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF). Education and environmental
protection are two very important issues in China today, she says.
</P>
<P>
CYDF began the "Hope Project" in 1989 and, over the past eight
years, it has helped over 1.5 million school drop-outs in
poverty-stricken areas return to school. It has also provided
funding for at least 3,600 primary schools in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Gan Dongyu, deputy director of CYDF's International Department,
says that the Raleigh International China Expedition is the first
of its kind in China. The participants will do some concrete and
useful things for small communities, instead of visiting major
cities and just sitting and chatting with each other, he points
out, and this will help them improve practical skills and will
give the foreign youth a good opportunity to understand China.
</P>
<P>
Everyone will prove to be valuable, one young British member of
the team says, and they will be able and glad to do more hard
work.

<HEADLINE> Second Flood Peak on Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River's second flood
peak passed through China's Jiangsu Province this morning as dykes
withstood another onslaught.
</P>
<P>
Water flow reached 53,500 cubic meters per second in Hubei
Province on July 3, then water levels went above the danger line.
</P>
<P>
The situation got worse in Jiangsu Province on July 9. On July
10, the water level at Nanjing reached 9.85 meters, 1.35 meters
above the danger line.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that dykes built in the past few years kept the
flood from doing any greater damage to the province. It has 520 km
of dykes that can handle the types of floods that occur every 50
years and another 235 km of dykes with concrete slopes.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to spend 2.35 billion yuan on dyke repairs
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
During this flood season, the province also mobilized a million
people for the flood-control work, which also helped protect the
dykes.

<HEADLINE> 393 Persons Removed From Cambodian Electoral Register </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 393 persons,
including 157 dead and 23 under-age, have been removed from the
electoral register of Cambodia, in the run-up to the general
election on July 26.
</P>
<P>
The move came after examination of reports received from the
Province Election Committee (PEC) and Commune Election Committee
(CEC) in 21 provinces, Cambodia's National Election Committee
(NEC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the dead and the under-age, 127 were registered more
than once, 78 were not Cambodian citizens, three presented wrong
documents, and five moved house, said HE Samraing Kamsan, advisor
to the NEC chairman.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the first step. The NEC is considering the
removal of around 1,000 further persons from the electoral
register, but no decision has yet been made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Transportation of the 12,500 ballot boxes and election
materials to the 11,699 polling stations was still underway, the
advisor said, adding all would be in place for the PECs by July
20, and by July 24 for the CECs.
</P>
<P>
But the office said the NEC still faced difficulties in
transportation.
</P>
<P>
The NEC had to use trucks, boats, planes, horse-carts, ox-carts
and even elephants to carry the election equipment, especially to
remote provinces, such as Mondolkiri and Rattanakiri, he said.
</P>
<P>
NEC officials also invited journalists to test the indelible
ink offered by India which will identify those who have already
voted on polling day.

<HEADLINE> Fans' Behavior outside "Acceptable": Johansson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The behavior of soccer fans outside the
World Cup stadiums was "acceptable" despite the violences in Marseille
and Lens, FIFA's World Cup Organizing Committee Chairman Lennart
Johansson said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"All of you are aware of the incidents in Marseille and Lens,"
Lennart told a news conference. "But I must say that overall even so
the crowd behavior outside the stadium before and after the matches
are acceptable."
</P>
<P>
French gendarme Daniel Nivel was beaten into a coma by German
hooligans in Lens on June 21, when Germany and Yugoslavia met in a
group game.
</P>
<P>
In Marseille, England and Tunisian fans had clashed on a beach,
resulting arrests and deportation of England fans.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said the tournament was generally a success and his job
as the chairman of the FIFA organizing committee was very easy.
</P>
<P>
"As a chairman I have an easy job. Almost everything went
perfectly," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Johansson said the images of shirt-pulling on the pitch left
him a bad impression.
</P>
<P>
As to the refereeing, Johansson said FIFA was considering using
more modern technology.
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking about the possiblities of using modern technologies
in some specific situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Sepp Blatter has criticized on Friday the failure of
the Disciplinary Committee to use video footage to sanction players'
serious fouls that referees failed to spot on the field.

PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- FIFA will hire specialists to draw up

But Blatter also slammed the national federations who failed to

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan expressed concern at the growing incidence of cancer in
his country, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Out of an estimated 9 million cancer patients in the world, 50
percent are in India," PTI quoted Narayanan as saying in Mumbai
where he inaugurated the silver jubilee celebrations of a hospital
named Jaslok and a research center.
</P>
<P>
Despite specialized knowledge and expertise gained by Indian
medical fraternity over the years, Narayanan said, the number of
cancer patients would rise to 6.5 million in the country by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan, who arrived in the country's financial city this
morning for his first visit since he took over as president just
one year ago, called on the medical fraternity to undertake
extensive research on people's lifestyle and shift their attention
from curative to preventive aspects of illness.
</P>
<P>
Preventive aspect has become even more important than curative
aspect, he said, adding that state-of-the-art equipment is
impressive but there is need to focus on the human factor in
medicine as most diseases emanate from living conditions and diet.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Ban on Imports of Bangladeshi Frozen Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has decided
to withdraw a ban on imports from 11 more Bangladeshi frozen-fish
exporting factories, a report reaching here Saturday said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a meeting of the European Commission,
the executive body of the EU, in Belgium on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the EU ended a ban on seven frozen-fish
processing factories in Bangladesh, nearly half a year after it
was imposed on importing frozen fish from Bangladesh in August
last year for "low quality," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Frozen seafood export, which earned the country 321 million
U.S. dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending June 30, 1997, is
the third major foreign exchange earner of Bangladesh, following
the garments and the knitwear industries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golkar Elects New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister/Secretary of
State Akbar Tanjung was elected as new general chairman of the
country's ruling Golkar (Functional Group) here Saturday
afternoon, replacing outgoing Golkar chairman Harmoko.
</P>
<P>
The election was conducted at the end of a three-day
extraordinary congress of the party. As many as 17 out of 27
Golkar provincial chapters, all of which hold voting rights,
supported Akbar's nomination and 10 others supported former
Defense Minister Edi Sudradjat.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Akbar began his political career in Golkar and
previously served as state minister of youth affairs and sports
and state minister for housing. He was described by the local
press as a favorite choice of President B.J. Habibie.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his election, Akbar said his main
task is to consolidate the organization, with the aim to achieve
success in the future.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Akbar promised to accommodate Golkar cadres who are
forward-looking and highly dedicated, including supporters of
rival Edi Sudradjat, once he is elected the organization's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Election of Golkar's new chairman is the most important item on
the agenda of the congress, which was opened by Habibie on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Habibie said Golkar leader should be chosen by
"those at the bottom" of the organization and not by "those at the
top."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election was the first time that Golkar's chairman
was determined through voting rather than consensus.
</P>
<P>
Golkar was established in 1964 as an amalgamation of seven
organizations which include the armed forces, labor organizations
and cooperative movements. It has been a dominant political
organization in nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
The organization, which won all the seven general elections in
the past, grabbed 325 of the 425 seats up for election in the
House of Representatives in the May general elections last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Golkar has split into several groups since former
President Soeharto stepped down on May 21 this year. Soeharto was
the chairman of the organization's Board of Patrons, which has an
enormous power including the authority to freeze Golkar's
executive board.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said earlier that another item on the agenda
of the Golkar extraordinary congress was discussion on the removal
of the Board of Patrons.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all 27 delegations from the regional
chapters said they would be happy if Golkar is turned into a
political party.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mount Merapi Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Mount Merapi, Indonesia's most
active volcano, erupted three times Saturday morning followed by
big bursts of hot clouds, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The eruption emitted hot lava that flowed seven kilometers down
toward the western slope of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported, but authorities have warned
the public in areas around the volcano to get ready for
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted officials of the Directorate of Volcanology
as saying they cannot predict the further development of the
eruption, because the mountain was still covered by thick smokes
at noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mount Merapi, 2,968 meters high, is situated in Central Java,
the most densely populated region of Java Island. It is the most
active volcano in the country and one of most active volcanoes in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's last eruption was in January 1997, when more than
8,000 nearby villagers had to be evacuated after the volcano
spewed hot gas, ash and lava over its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Merapi's most destructive eruption this century was in 1930,
when 1,300 people were killed.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM Hopeful of Reducing Population Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif expressed his hope Saturday that his country will achieve
its target of bringing down the population growth rate to 2.1
percent from 2.6 in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a day-long National Population Convention, held to
observe the World Population Day, he said the population growth
rate of Pakistan has already come down from 2.7 to 2.6 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an increase in population has direct relations
with illiteracy, which could be overcome by giving equal education
opportunities to both rural and urban societies.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, is well aware of Islamic values and
will not ignore these rights while promoting population planning.
</P>
<P>
Population planning is meant to provide a better standard of
life to people and ensure better utilization of their mental
faculties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon religious scholars to create awareness among the
general public about the population welfare program.
</P>
<P>
Referring to increasing population in urban areas, Sharif said
one of the main reasons for it is migration of people from rural
areas to cities.
</P>
<P>
This has over-burdened the existing civic facilities in the
cities while creating many social problems, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This trend has to be checked by providing employment
opportunities, educational and health facilities in rural areas,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said the majority of Pakistanis live in
rural areas and they need to have the basic necessities of life
which include access to clean drinking water, education, health
and recreation.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we strike a balance between the population and our
resources, the people cannot have prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the government to provide basic amenities to
every child including the right of education but we must have a
check on our population," Sharif added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for providing educational facilities in
rural areas and said they must not be conformed to the cities
only.
</P>
<P>
"With a majority of the population living in small towns and
rural areas, the women there must have a right to education for an
educated future generation.
</P>
<P>
"The child has his early education and guidance from mother and
if she is illiterate one cannot expect to have a society which
will be organized and the one which will prosper," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recreational facilities for a healthy society are also
necessary, Sharif pointed out. He called upon educational
institutions to make sports an essential part of their education.

The magistrate complained that his people have begun to dig for

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's IPI Down for January-May This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's industrial
production index (IPI) for January-May this year fell by 3 percent
to 146.3 from 150.9 registered during the same period of 1997,
according to the Statistics Department Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decline was only due to a drop in the index for the
manufacturing division to 150.9 from 158.8 a year earlier, the
latest IPI figures released by the department show.
</P>
<P>
The index for the mining division however rose by 0.5 percent
to 123.9 while that for the electricity division increased by 6.3
percent to 169.2, the figures show.
</P>
<P>
The IPI is a measure of the rate of change in the production of
industrial commodities in real terms over time.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the index for the mining division in the first
five months of this year was due to rises in the indices of tin
and crude oil by 9.8 percent to 53.9 and 1 percent to 112.2
respectively. In contrast, the index for natural gas dropped 0.8
percent to 183.2.
</P>
<P>
The increasing index for the electricity division was the
result of a 6.4-percent jump in the generation of electricity to
24,033 million kilowatt-hours from 22,596 million kilowatt-hours
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing division, six out of a total of 23 major
groups recorded higher indices during the period under review with
the manufacturing of plastic products witnessing the largest
increase of 21.2 percent to 251.7 points. It was followed by the
professional and scientific, and measuring and controlling
equipment group which rose 6.3 percent to 121.3 and the rubber
products group soaring 5 percent to 147.9.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco manufacturers group registered a 4.6-percent rise
to 119.4 and the electrical machinery, apparatus, appliances and
supplies group gained 2.5 percent to 178.4 while the paper and
paper products group rose 0.2 percent to 131.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Invests in Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
allocated 50 million Shillings (850,000 U.S. Dollars) to finance
oil exploration in the belief that there could be commercially
viable oil reserves in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue funding oil exploration with
money collected through the petroleum levy paid by oil companies,
Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae was quoted Saturday by the Daily
Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the National Oil Corporation of Kenya
(NOCK) to move quickly in transforming itself to a commercially
viable entity to face the competition.
</P>
<P>
The government would support plans by NOCK to convert into a
fully fledged oil company operating in all areas of the oil
business, Nyachae said Friday.
</P>
<P>
NOCK Chairman Bethuel Ogot said the NOCK will use the
government allocation to upgrade truck loading facilities in
Mombasa and Nairobi, the two largest commercial hubs in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of loading facilities in these areas has been one of our
major problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996/97 (July/June) financial year, the company's
turnover stood at 567 million Shillings (9.6 million Dollars), a
drop from the 1995/96 turnover of 2.2 billion Shillings (37.3
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decline in turnover was attributed to a 30 percent loss of
market share after the liberalization of the oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Expected to Lead in World's Tea Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is poised to regain its
leading position in the export of black tea from Sri Lanka
following a bumper crop in the first half of this year, commodity
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains interspersed with generous spells of sunshine led
to high growth levels with production surpassing previous records
in the east African country during the first quarter of this
year, the Kenya Time newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This year we are headed for a bumper crop. Production figures
reflect a huge rise. They are much, much higher compared to both
last year and 1996," Norman Wilson, managing director of Africa
Tea Brokers, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Africa Tea Brokers said in a statement that \Uoduction rose
57.75 million kilograms or 71.77 percent to 138.22 million
kilograms in the first five months of 1998 from the same period
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Production in the January-May period in 1996 was posted at
116.43 million kilograms. That year Kenya's tea yield touched a
record high of 257 million kilograms, making the country the
world's largest tea exporter with 244-million-kilogram tea
exporting.
</P>
<P>
Tea appears to be the only commodity that gained from the El
Nino rains which ruined Kneya's long neglected infrastructure,
mainly roads, bringing big losses to its tourism industry, and
heavily damaged the coffee crop.

<HEADLINE> China to Curb Prevalence of Selling Small State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's State Economic and Trade
Commission called for curbing the prevalence of selling small
state-owned enterprises, stressing that different forms or
measures be taken in reforming the enterprises in accordance with
their specific situation.
</P>
<P>
In a notice issued Friday, the commission refutes the idea that
sale of small state-owned enterprises is the sole solution to
their restructuring, and suggests enterprises take varied measures
that suit their asset organization mode.
</P>
<P>
These measures include reorganization, merger, lease, contract
management and shareholding, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice says that in dealing with restructuring the small
state-owned enterprises, government officials in some localities
overemphasized the role enterprise sales plays in the reform
drive.
</P>
<P>
They simplified the restructuring that is expected to be
complicated and effort-taking to "selling," the notice says,
adding that the practice has exerted negative impact on local
economic development and social stability, and the relocation of
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
People in charge of restructuring such enterprises should be
far-sighted, and must not force employees to become share holders,
the document says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the evasion and abandoning of financial
liabilities should be prevented in the restructuring drive.
</P>
<P>
The notice calls for proper asset assessment, and reinforced
inspection on employee relocation scheme.

<P>
FUZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Meizhou Island in east China's
Fujian Province has developed rapidly since 1992 when it was
approved as a national holiday resort.
</P>
<P>
Its tourism programs feature the Mazu culture. Mazu, known as
"the Goddess of Peace of the Strait," is believed to have been
born on Meizhou Island.
</P>
<P>
The island still preserves the world's first Mazu temple, which
is considered the "ancestor" of other 3,000 Mazu temples
scattering in more than 20 countries and regions, with nearly 200
million followers. There are 16 million Mazu followers in Taiwan,
accounting for 75 percent of the total population of the island
province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than one million Mazu
pilgrims coming over to Meizhou every year, one tenth of which are
from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Meizhou invested more than 500 million yuan in infrastructure
construction since 1992. Projects include Mazu temple architecture
groups, 11 kilometer cross-the-island road, and a tap water plant
with a daily supply capacity of 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Meizhou has signed more than 50
investment contracts or agreements worth 1.8 billion yuan or
220,000 U.S. dollars, more than half of which have been put into
use.

<HEADLINE> Teams Set up to Monitor Pollution in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to set up
six emergency teams to monitor various pollutants around the
clock, in a new effort to prevent environmental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Al Sarawi, chairman and director general of the
Environment Public Authority (EPA), was quoted by the English
daily Arab Times as saying that one of the teams will work on
monitoring emissions in the country's southern areas.
</P>
<P>
Another team will be formed to monitor maritime pollution,
and conduct field studies and monitor coastal water pollution and
report any oil spills to EPA, Sarawi said.
</P>
<P>
He said another team will be responsible for monitoring
contamination that might be caused by drain water or oil spills,
in addition to detecting offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Arid Area and Coasts Evolution Department of EPA will
preside over another team to conduct a comprehensive survey of the
country's coasts, including the three Kuwaiti islands, in order
to keep track of tide movements and its effects on Kuwaiti coasts
and the coastal environment in general.
</P>
<P>
Sarawi said two other teams, which are supervised respectively
by Life Resources Department and Industrial Environment
Department, will monitor the damage that sea creatures might
suffer and follow up factory emissions and their effect on the
country's environment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hashimoto's Fate Ties with Sunday's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- With the 18th election of Japan's
upper chamber coming on Sunday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
is expected to face a crucial test of whether voters still have
confidence in his leadership.
</P>
<P>
The results of the election of the House of Councillors, which
is the upper house of Japanese parliament, are not expected to
immediately change the government because the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) still dominates the more powerful lower
house, the House of Representatives, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out in the same breath that any serious
setback for the LDP in the election would dramatically affect
Hashimoto's political fate.
</P>
<P>
One focal point of the race is whether the LDP can recover a
majority in the 252-member chamber by securing at least 69 seats.
</P>
<P>
Failing that, the LDP could still score something of a victory
by grabbing 64 seats, a bare majority of the 126 seats being
contested.
</P>
<P>
In either of the above scenarios, LDP officials said, Hashimoto
could be expected to remain as LDP head and serve out his tenure
as prime minister until September 1999.
</P>
<P>
But, if the LDP fails to hold onto its 61 seats that are up for
grabs in the poll, Hashimoto would probably be forced to step
down, throwing Japan's political landscape into turmoil, analysts
believed.
</P>
<P>
Recent newspaper surveys, however, forecast that the LDP will
unlikely accomplish a comeback by regaining a majority in the
upper house lost nine years ago. The LDP might even fail to retain
its 61 seats being contested due to pollees' dissatisfaction with
the government's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months, the economic policies of the Japanese
government and the LDP have been widely and severely criticized
for contributing to Japan's economic recession, considered by the
economists the worst in decades.
</P>
<P>
Public support rates for Hashimoto's cabinet also remain at
record-low levels lately amid lacking of signs of improvement in
the Japanese economy despite a series of stimulating measures
unveiled by the government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties, in their campaignings, also criticized the
Hashimoto cabinet for mismanaging the economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the gloomy economic climate and the LDP's declining
popularity, it is still too early to assert that the LDP is
destined to suffer setbacks in the election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is still likely to make steady gains by making most of
the disarray of the opposition parties, some political pundits
believe.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout, another focal point of the election, is also
expected to have a great influence on the election results. A
record-low turnout, even lower than the 44.52 percent turnout in
the previous election in 1995, is possible when considering the
growing public apathy towards politics.
</P>
<P>
A low turnout will benefit the LDP because it has strong
support from voter organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the election is predictable if the voter turnout
stands at less than 45 percent, the LDP will expand its strength,"
an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Some 99.40 million people -- 48.24 million men and 51.16
million women -- are eligible to vote in the poll, marking a 2.1
percent rise from the 1995 election.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese upper chamber is reshuffled every three years for
half the 252 seats, with its members serving a fixed six-year term.
</P>
<P>
A total of 474 candidates from 14 parties and groups are
contesting in the upper house poll. Some 325 candidates are
expected to run in prefectural constituencies for 76 seats, and
some 160 are standing for 50 proportional representation seats.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is fielding 87 candidates, 30 for the proportional
representation slots, under which voters cast their ballots for a
party rather than for an individual, and 57 for prefectural
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Bans Avopacin in Animal Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Agriculture and
Cooperation Ministry has banned Avopacin as an ingredient in
animal feed in order to ensure that Thai chicken exports to Japan
have no Vancomycin-resistant enterococ (VRE) bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The ban took effect on July 7 and the Japanese government has
been notified, said deputy minister Somchai Sunthorvut, quoted by
Saturday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said the ministry will send a mission to Japan next
week to meet with Japanese Public Health Ministry officials. He
said he would ask Japan to inspect the export quality of chicken
products from Thailand as a further precaution.
</P>
<P>
Japan earlier announced that VRE bacteria had been found in
chicken imports from Thailand and France. VRE is dangerous
bacteria with a resistance to antibiotics. However, the bacteria
can be eliminated at high temperature.
</P>
<P>
In the livestock industry, Avopacin is a substance which
farmers mix in feed meal in order to speed up the maturity of
animals. However, local farms stopped using this ingredient five
years ago due to the high price and because it was rejected by
chicken exporters.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has imported nine tons of Avopacin annually over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure Thailand's export quality, the ministry has set up a
committee to closely monitor the cause of the problems.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand's chicken exports will not be damaged by attacks in
the Japanese media thanks to our high quality processing lines,"
Somchai said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change in the orders placed by Japanese
importers and no shipments have been returned," said Anan
Sirimongkolkasem, president of the Thai Broiler Processing
Exporters' Association.
</P>
<P>
Thai chicken exports to Japan totaled 102,756 tons during the
first five months of 1998. The association expects exports to
reach 240,007 tons by the end of this year.

WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has to send a
basketball team of college players to the coming Goodwill Games
and its best finish will be no better than third.
</P>
<P>
"We are not favored to win it, we are no better than
third," Clem Haskins, the coach of the U.S. amateur team said in
Minneapolis Friday.
</P>
<P>
Without NBA professinals, the U.S. team has no dream at all.
American collegians steadily have lost ground on the international
basketball scene since they won their last Olympic gold 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
With NBA players forced out of the world championship this year
because of their league's lockout, the United States could be
beaten badly both in the Goodwill Games and at the Worlds late
this month.
</P>
<P>
The 16-player team will be trimmed to the final 12-man roster
Sunday. It will be a team that rely on quickness to counter a lack
of size and experience against the other world strong teams in New
York from July 19-24.
</P>
<P>
The United States was grouped with Puerto Rico, the 1994
Goodwill Games champion, Brazil and China. The other group
includes world powers Lithuania, Russia and Australia, along with
Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Western Opinion on Myanmar Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government strongly
criticized western opinion on Myanmar, according to an official
Information Sheet issued here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Information Sheet quoted a news release from the Myanmar
Embassy in Ottawa, Canada, as saying there have been some media
reports of impending political unrest in Myanmar in connection
with the re-opening of all schools and universities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The news release said the reports are entirely without basis
and may even be called fictitious.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government has always had deep concern for the
personal security of all politicians including Aung San Suu Kyi,
general secretary of National League for Democracy (NLD), as there
are known elements who are trying to create political unrest by
putting her to some form of bodily harm, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out, "Any suggestion to the contrary must be
considered presumptuous and unnecessary, since 16 out of 17 armed
insurgent groups have returned to the legal fold in recent years
lowering all forms of tensions to unprecedented levels."
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to artificially create unrest and instability by
local politicians to suit their own ends are not likely to have
any popular support within the country," it declared.

Rose spit the gum as he was about to enter the plane. The gum

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government Agrees to Cover Deficit for ASIAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
agreed to cover a 2.5 billion rupiah (164,000 U.S. dollars)
deficit in the National Sports Council's budget for the country's
participation in the Asian Games in Bangkok in December, local
press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports
Agung Laksono here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After the council said it was finding it difficult to meet its
estimated budget of 5.2 billion rupiah for the national team's
preparations and costs during the competition, the minister said,
the National Development Planning Board had decided to provide the
additional funds.
</P>
<P>
Agung said there would be no more financial aid for the
council.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last. We cannot give more due to the current
economic situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had promised to allot 3 billion rupiah from the
state budget for the country's Asian Games team, but then cut it
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Agung suggested that the council undertake fund-raising
activities itself if it wanted more money.
</P>
<P>
"They can raise public funds, perhaps. I believe the people are
willing to help the national team compete in the Asian Games," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Council's chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar, despite his gratitude,
said the money was not enough. He expected the projected budget to
swell to 7 billion rupiah due to the sharp depreciation of the
rupiah against the U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He plans to hold a meeting with some ministers to find a way to
raise more money.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Minister of Defense/Armed Forces Commander
Gen. Wiranto had agreed to fly the contingent to Bangkok either by
Hercules or Boeing military aircraft.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves New Loans To Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved two
loans totaling 700 million U.S. dollars for Thailand's financial
reforms and initiatives to mitigate social impacts of the economic
crisis on the poor and unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced on Friday that it would increase to 2.2
billion dollars the total aid pledged to Thailand since its
financial crisis erupted a year ago, Saturday's Bangkok Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
The previous pledge was 1.5 billion dollars, part of a 17.2-
billion-dollar package originally brokered by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The report said the aid increase implied that Thailand's
economic recovery was more difficult than expected.
</P>
<P>
"The recession has deepened," said the bank's country director
for Thailand, J. Shivakumar. "There is a need to expand on the
fiscal side, and there is a need to prime the economy a bit. That
was not foreseen last year."
</P>
<P>
The first of the new loans, the 400 million dollars for
economic and financial adjustment, will address the cause of the
crisis and help restructure Thailand's financial and corporate
sectors while strengthening the competitive foundations of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
It will help restore macroeconomic stability and fiscal
balance, implement critical financial sector restructuring and
public enterprise reform, and sharpen competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
As a response to social impacts of the crisis, the second loan,
worth 300 million dollars, will be provided for Thailand's Social
and Investment Project to help protect the poor and unemployed
through employment generation programs and the provision of
essential social services, such as basic health and Aids care.
</P>
<P>
"These loans are an important part of our response to the
crisis," said Shivakumar. "We are committed to working with the
government of Thailand and our partners in the development
community to implement reforms and protect the poor while helping
Thailand return to the path of economic growth."

<HEADLINE> Pamana Canal Water Level Back to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal Commission
announced Friday that the canal's water level has risen to the
normal 39.5 feet, allowing ships to pass through without
limitations.
</P>
<P>
A deputy director of the commission told a press conference
that the commission has taken every possible measure to raise the
canal water level, which had fallen from the normal 39.5 feet to
35.5 feet on April 28 because of a drought caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The falling water level forced the commission to reduce the
draft of ships passing along the 81-kilometer waterway 22 times in
the 12 months after June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The deputy director said the commission invested 12 million
U.S. dollars to neutralize the impact of the drought by stopping
the use of water in the canal reservoir to generate power, and by
dredging parts of the canal, a short cut for ships passing between
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

<HEADLINE> Russian Grain Crops Hit by Widespread Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia is expected to suffer great
crop losses this year because of widespread drought, Viktor
Alexandrovich Semyonov, Russia's minister of agriculture and food,
warned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This year's grain yield is predicted to be about 64 to 67
million tons, a dramatic drop from last year's 88.5 million tons,
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Semyonov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Droughts attacked 85 farming areas in Russia, and contributed
dominantly to the anticipated crop losses this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's grain stocks, which amount to 20 million tons, will
make up for the country's domestic food deficiency caused by the
crop failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Droughts had inflicted a two-billion ruble (319,000
U.S. dollars) loss upon Russia's agriculture-industry complexes,
said Semyonov, who once acted as the first vice-president of the
peasants' and workers' union, and was also president of a large
agriculture company.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the five Central
American countries will hold the third Tuxtla Summit on July 17 in
El Salvador to discuss further cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan press quoted Mexican ambassador to Guatemala
Salvador Arriola as saying that this summit will secure the
"privileged association" promoted by Mexico in Central America.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican diplomat said the Tuxtla Cooperation Mechanism has
set the basis for a new political, economic, social, and cultural
relationship "which has already sustained and now consolidates
itself."
</P>
<P>
Arriola said the regional summit meeting "has facilitated the
cooperation and the political dialogue between Mexico and Central
America."
</P>
<P>
The Tuxtla meetings started as an effort by the Mexican
government to achieve a rapprochement with Central American
countries, after the end of armed conflicts in the region during
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador stressed that the rapprochements had generated
joint tasks of regional benefit in commerce, migration,
environment, health, education and infrastructures, as well as in
combating drug trafficking and international crime.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between Mexico and Guatemala have become
stronger in the Tuxtla agreement context, and permitted the
implementation of 90 activities each year, as well as 30
agreements in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Honduras are expected to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Calls EU's Visa Denial Political Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Belarusian Foreign Ministry
said Friday that by threatening to deny Belarusian officials of
entry visas the European Union (EU) was imposing political
pressure on Belarus.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry said all diplomatic envoys
must respect the law of the country where they are accredited,
according to a Russian press report from Minsk, capital of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a joint written representation
submitted Thursday by the charges d'affaires ad interim of five EU
countries, Britain, Germany, Italy, France and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Addressed to Belarusian Foreign Minister Ivan Antonovich, the
representation said that in response to the Drozdy incident, the
European Union would deny all Belarusian officials of entry visas
to the EU.
</P>
<P>
In late June, Belarus asked foreign diplomatic envoys living in
the Drozdy complex to leave so as to facilitate the overhaul of
the building. The diplomats refused but the Belarusian side
insisted.
</P>
<P>
The row developed as many EU countries recalled their
ambassadors in Minsk. Despite recent compromising signals from the
Belarusian side, the EU move may escalate the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Nokia Increases Exposure in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Finnish-based mobile
communications giant Nokia has increased its exposure in both
north and south China by securing new contracts and expanding a
Guangdong joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Nokia consummated a landmark contract earlier this week with
the mobile communications arm of Tianjin Telecom in Tianjin, a
port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
The contract calls for Nokia to supply fiber optical
transmission equipment for the city's global mobile telephone
network.
</P>
<P>
The agreement marked Nokia's first order for related equipment
from China's telecommunications sector, and marked the company's
entry into new business areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that Nokia provided technology will
effectively reduce the city's initial investment required to
install a mobile communications network.
</P>
<P>
The technology -- synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) -- offers
high flexibility enabling mobile communications centers to operate
during the installation stage.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Nokia expanded the production capacity
of its joint venture in Dongguan, south China's Guangdong
Province, in late June this year. The project enabled the Dongguan
Nokia Mobile Telephone Co. Ltd. to expand its production of
peripherals to include mobile telephone sets. The joint venture is
currently producing Nokia's most recent mobile telephone sets.
</P>
<P>
A senior Nokia official said the latest developments
demonstrates the company's commitment to increasing investments
and expanding technological cooperation in China.
</P>
<P>
Nokia claimed that it sold 21.3 million mobile telephone sets
around the world in 1997, which accounted for 21 percent of the
global market for related items. The company has also captured a
similar share of the China market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China had over 16 million mobile telephone
users by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Nokia has established six joint ventures and one solely-owned
production base in China.

MEXICO CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's National Demographic
Society on Friday called on social insurers of the country to make
preparations in advance to meet the challenges of an ageing

<P>
By the year 2030, the total number of the elderly people in
Mexico would reach 15.6 million, accounting for 12 percent of the
nation's population, and marking an average annual growth of four
percent, the society predicted.
</P>
<P>
Noting that three-fourths of the ageing population would appear

<HEADLINE> Chinese Court Using Polygraph As New Crime Solving Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Polygraph results have been
admitted for the first time by Chinese judges and have been called
successful.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Intermediate People's Court in southwest China's
Yunnan Province introduced the lie detector results in a homicide
case and in one business dispute recently.
</P>
<P>
Court experts concluded in the homicide case that a suspect and
his gay friend were guilty of murder, even though the suspect who
confessed to the crime denied any involvement by his friend.
</P>
<P>
The court's decision was confirmed by a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
In the business dispute over the ownership of an estate, a man
who claimed the estate was his private property failed to pass the
polygraph test.
</P>
<P>
A court spokesman explained that the equipment used by the
court was acquired from the United States and Germany last year,
to improve the ability to solve cases and see that justice is
done, and, "So far, it is successful."
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Intermediate People's Court has become known for
its open-mindedness since it took the lead in using lethal
injections to execute criminals last March.
</P>
<P>
"The court needs to reform some case-handling methods in order
to catch up with international standards," the spokesman
said.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
lobbied United States President Bill Clinton for support Friday
over Russia's bid for a multi-billion dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Russia is holding talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank (WB) on the package.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's press service said that during a trans-Atlantic
telephone call to Clinton, the U.S. president noted the Russian
government's program to stabilize the nation's economy had won
high praise from the international community, and financial
circles.
</P>
<P>
Clinton believed implementation of the program would help
Russia overcome its domestic financial crisis as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents stressed Russian's efforts should be met
with support from international financial organizations, the
Russian presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also spoke with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, French
President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
IMF Director-General Michel Camdessus in a series of calls as he
attempted to secure international backing for the package,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The European and IMF leaders expressed support for the
government's anti-crisis package, designed to end a fiscal crisis
which has sent stocks plunging, interest rates spiralling and
threatened the ruble, the Kremlin said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Russia, the IMF and the WB are negotiating and are
trying to hammer out a rescue financial deal for the troubled
Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, presidential special envoy to international
financial institutions, revealed they would make a deal during the

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Review ASEAN Tariff Reduction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
review a tariff reduction program under the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) in light of the lingering financial turmoil hitting the
region, a newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Pardo was quoted
as saying on Friday that trade ministers from the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expected to meet this month to
review the region's trade liberalization program.
</P>
<P>
"I presume the interest level on this subject will be high
because it is a common agenda among ASEAN countries," Pardo was
quoted by the Manila Bulletin as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFTA, which calls for a 0-5 percent tariff rate on all
manufactured products traded within the region by the year 2003,
is being implemented via the Common Effective Preferential Tariff
(CEPT) scheme.
</P>
<P>
Pardo, however, said the agreed timetable for the year 2003
will continue but the rate at which the tariff cuts are
implemented may have to be restudied.
</P>
<P>
As the region are stumbling economically due to the financial
crisis, ASEAN countries are expected to slow down their tariff
reduction, although they have to keep the commitment under AFTA to
meet the year 2003 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has rejected calls from the
local business community to freeze tariffs until the year 2003 to
give local industries enough time to recover from the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Local industries have been complaining about the government's
accelerated tariff reduction program, which they said is a lot
faster than any other ASEAN countries'.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Copper Exports To Asia Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Chilean copper exports to Asia
between January and April this year amounted to 688.5 million
U.S. dollars, down 40 percent compared with the same period of
last year, official figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of 1997, Chilean copper exports to
Asia accounted for 50.2 percent of its total copper export, but
the percentage dropped to 38.6 percent in the same period this
year.
</P>
<P>
Now, Asia dropped to the second place as a market for the
Chilean copper, giving up the first place to Europe, which
imported 719.6 million dollars worth of copper from Chile in the
first four months this year, marking a 2.2 percent increase from
last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to a shrinking demand caused by the
Asian financial crisis. The statistics showed that Chilean copper
exports to Japan totaled 263.1 million dollars in the first four
months of the year, representing a 53.1 percent drop from the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sales to South Korea declined by 64.4 percent to 96.8 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Chile's copper exports to China registered a 7.6 percent
rise, reaching 103.4 million dollars, according to the Central
Bank figures.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects Oil Price to Go Up in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia expects that the price
of oil will rise to 17 U.S. dollars a barrel in the fourth quarter
of this year, the Indonesian Observer reported Saturday, quoting a
senior official.
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware of the current lower price. It (the price) is
usually low in every third quarter of the year, but it will
increase in the fourth quarter," Mines and Energy Minister Kuntoro
Mangkusubroto said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that 17 U.S. dollars a barrel can still be
achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The key factor behind any future price rise will be the
maintenance of an agreement reached between the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members to cut production
output, he said.
</P>
<P>
The world's top oil producers grouped under OPEC agreed on July
3 to cut production by 3.23 million barrels per day (bpd) in a bid
to reduce a glut and boost prices.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, with its May 1998 output reaching 1.33 million bpd,
is set to cut output by 100,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
"The revenue from oil is very important for Indonesia. We want
to see the oil price higher," Kuntoro said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the price of OPEC's basket of several
crudes in the world market rose to 11.62 U.S. dollar a barrel on
Friday, up from 11.51 U.S. dollars a barrel on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> First Chilean Satellite Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The first Chilean satellite,
called Fasat-Bravo, was launched into space Friday at 02:32
Chilean time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Air Force said the satellite was launched by a
Ukrainian rocket Zenith II.
</P>
<P>
The Fasat-Bravo is expected to start emitting its signal within
the next 24 hours, marking the entrance of Chile into the space
race.
</P>
<P>
Attempts were made to put in orbit the Chilean satellite on
June 23 and 24 and on Thursday of this week, together with a
Russian satellite and other four microsatellites belonging to
Germany, Australia, Israel, and Thailand, but the launching was
delayed because of rocket failures.
</P>
<P>
Chile had tried to send a satellite into orbit on August 31,
1995 but failed because of a technical problem.
</P>
<P>
The Fasat-Bravo weighing 50 kilograms has the shape of a
60-centimeter cube with a 35-centimeter square base.
</P>
<P>
This miniprobe was built by Chilean and British technicians at
the Space Department of the University of Surrey in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Fasat-Bravo will be used to monitor the ozone layer
permanently, remote-sense natural resources and provide education
and aeronautical communications.

<HEADLINE> Warning Issued About Renewed Activity of Indonesia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A public warning about renewed
activity of Mount Merapi in Indonesia's central Java had been
issued by a local volcanological service, the local press reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Directorate of Volcanology's Yogyakarta office,
Mas Atje Purbawinata, told reporters that his office had raised
its state of alertness about the 2,968-meter volcano to the
highest level.
</P>
<P>
The volcano is about 20 kilometers from the ancient royal
capital of Yogyakarta, now a city of two million people.
</P>
<P>
Atje said several cracks created by internal pressure at the
top of the mountain had also been observed.
</P>
<P>
"Cracking is now taking place at the top, and we've been
monitoring the phenomenon closely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since early Friday morning till noon, at least 10 tremors had
been recorded.
</P>
<P>
"This show that the magma activity is rising. We estimate that
the core of the activity is located about 300 meters below the tip
of the cone," Atje was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The office had also warned public authorities in areas around
the volcano to prepare for emergency action.
</P>
<P>
Measures already taken included warning residents in nearby
areas to get ready for evacuation and building dams to channel the
lava if it begins to flow, he said.
</P>
<P>
In various villages near Yogyakarta, emergency posts have been
set up to anticipate any possible situation which may arise.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, 400 kilometers east of Jakarta, is the most
active volcano in the country and one of the world's most active
volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
The last eruption was in January 1997, when more than 8,000
nearby villagers were evacuated after the volcano spewed hot gas,
ash and lava over its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Merapi's most destructive eruption this century was in 1930,
when 1,300 people were killed.

peace and Pastrana did.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is the largest guerrilla organization in Colombia with
4400 supporters, while ELN is the second largest guerrilla group
with about 4000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
Horacio Serpa, the candidate who lost the presidential
election, offered his "full support" for the incoming president's
efforts for peace.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Galan, an ELN spokesman, now a prisoner, called the
meeting of Pastrana with the FARC heads historical.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting in Germany with the ELN, as well as
the contacts with the FARC, are complementary processes.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Ardila Lulle, who spoke on behalf of the private sector,
said that "as entrepreneurs and as Colombians we are determined to
contribute to anything that means peace."
</P>
<P>
The Colombian church -- in the voice of Bishop Noel Beltran --
said that "these predialogues will define the future of the
dialogues, without any preconditions and with plans to accelerate
the peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, the commander of the Fifth Division of the Army, Gen.
Jorge Enrique Mora Rangel, considered it necessary to wait before
rushing into any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the FARC is demonstrating anything; all
the time it has been the same. If a review is made, it will be
seen that there is a constant ambivalence in their acts," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica on Alert for Hemorrhagic Dengue Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Health Minister
Rogelio Pardo announced Friday that emergency measures will be
taken to face up a dengue outbreak in the South Pacific zone,
close to the border with Panama.
</P>
<P>
Seven cases of hemorrhagic dengue have already been detected in
the zone. The disease can kill the patient if adequate medical
attention is not available.
</P>
<P>
The hospital of the zone receives 50 patients a day suffering
from what is called classical dengue, a less serious form of the
disease which causes high fever, headaches and body cramps.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is endemical in the Central American region, but it
broke out with more virulence in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The present outbreak is one of the most serious occurred in the
past few months in the country and it could cause the closing of
the tax free zone of El Golfito, located some 180 kilometers from
San Jose, to which a great number of Costa Ricans go to buy
staples.
</P>
<P>
The disease is carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which
transmits the virus to human beings through biting.
</P>
<P>
The health minister said that the number of dengue outbreaks
increases in all the country with the arrival of the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
He insisted in the necessity of the population to take measures
to prevent the accumulation of water and reduce the presence of
the mosquito by spraying insecticide.

<HEADLINE> China's State Televison Beams Alive First Courtroom Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) - China's state-run television
station broadcast alive for the first time a courtroom hearing
across the country at this morning.
</P>
<P>
The broadcast is organized by the Supreme People's Court (SPC)
and is regarded as a major breakthrough in the reforms of China's
legal system as well as media reporting, according to an SPC
official. China Central Television (CCTV) beams the program at
Channel 1.
</P>
<P>
The trial, in Beijing's No.1 Intermediate People's Court,
involves alleged copyright violations of feature films. CCTV has
invited two legal experts on hand to explain to the audience the
proceedings of the hearing while the trial is broadcast alive.
</P>
<P>
The SPC official said that the live broadcast would in no way
interfere with proper legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, intermediate court judges can seek
the advice of a higher court or the SPC, but neither the Beijing
Higher People's Court nor the SPC have received a request for
legal assistance so far, the official said. This means that the
trial itself is conducted independently by the Beijing's No.1
Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
SPC officials also said that this live coverage event is the
latest development of China's effort to open its courtrooms to
public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The SPC says that some 20 local television channels have so far
shown trials or excerpts of trials after cooperating with the
local courts, and that some were live telecasts.

OTTAWA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar dropped 0.15
cents to 67.63 U.S. cents Friday, another record low for the
wobbly currency.
</P>
<P>
A weak unemployment report was all it took to once again drive
the Canadian loonie to a new low since it set an historic closing
low of 67.85 U.S. cents in mid-June, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On the North American markets, trades chose to interpret the
latest unemployment figures as evidence that the Canadian economy
is beginning to slow down, the reports noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported Friday that the country's
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 8.4 percent in June, but
there were about 36,000 fewer jobs across the country.
</P>
<P>
Only a decline in the number of people looking for work in June
kept the unemployment rate from climbing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Record yields in the southern
Plains lifted the U.S. Winter wheat crop up 9 percent from last
month's estimate, the Agriculture Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, farmers were expected to harvest 1.9 billion
bushels of Winter wheat. Yields were forecast at a record 46.6
bushels per acre for Winter wheat, due to excellent crops in
Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
</P>
<P>
Including Spring-planted varieties of wheat, the total U.S.
wheat crop this year is forecast at 2.52 billion bushels or
slightly less than 1997. Overall yields are estimated at 42.6
bushels an acre, also a new record.
</P>
<P>
Early projections for the corn crop placed total production at
9.6 billion bushels, which is lower than the June forecast but
still above 1997's harvest.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department expects this year's ending corn
stocks to increase by 235 million bushels due to reductions in
feed and industrial use.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary soybean projection was raised 30 million
bushels to 2.8 billion bushels, based on a record planted acreage
and good harvest prospects.
</P>
<P>
Because of drought in Texas, the cotton crop is forecast down
1.5 percent to 15 million bales. Rice is expected to top 9.4
million tons, up from about 9.1 million tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Have Faith in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday urged the people to have confidence in
the government in whatever action it takes to tide over the
economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal when addressing an all-community gathering
in Malacca, some 145 kilometers southeast of here, according to
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"The government had no other motives besides defending the
rights of the people. That's only the government's motive.
Whatever action we take, it is for the people," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could face the challenges at hand calmly and protect
its sovereignty, he said, adding "The government will try its best
but it needs the people's support. The people's unity is crucial
in our efforts to defend our country's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he was grateful to be the leader of a country
whose people were matured as they did not resort to riots or
strikes as in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the trade unions for not creating problems as
the people's purchasing power had dwindled due to soaring prices
of goods and services compared with their salaries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, however, said the people did not very much feel the
pinch of the economic slowdown but companies faced big problems
and many might go bankrupt. He said banks are under tremendous
pressure and if this continues, the people will suffer.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to be wary against allegations that the
government practiced nepotism and cronyism by awarding projects
and contracts to friends and relatives of government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "The allegations are not true at all. We must be
careful against such people as they have forked tongue."
</P>
<P>
He also said many people advised him not to talk on the
currency crisis but "if I did not explain to the people, they will
not know the actual situation."
</P>
<P>
"Many of us also want to believe there is irregularities in the
country's administration. If we believe so and spread the news,
confidence in the government will be eroded and the country will
have a weak government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a weak government would not be able to defend the
country's sovereignty from foreigners' attacks.
</P>
<P>
"What they did to us is very cruel indeed. We slogged for 20
years to develop our country but all our hard work was wiped out
in a month," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had not been compelled to seek assistance from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). "This is testimony to the
Malaysian government's strength," he added.
